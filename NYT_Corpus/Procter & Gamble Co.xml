The company introduced an online community hosted by the actress Melissa McCarthy at a news conference in New York on Monday night. The initiatives represent P.&amp; G.’s first major marketing push for Ivory in years: According to Kantar Media, a division of WPP, the company has advertised Ivory minimally since 2006, spending a high of $1.4 million that year and less than $325,000 in total between 2007 and the first half of this year. The new Ivory packaging, which features bright colors like cyan, purple and green chosen to contrast with the soap’s pure white, replaces more subdued packaging. And its social media efforts, which include a Facebook page introduced last month, are also a first. The overall campaign is intended to promote the Ivory brand’s “value and simplicity,” Procter &amp; Gamble said in a statement, while “focusing on giving busy moms and families a product that delivers what they are looking for.” Ivory is one of six soap brands sold by P.&amp; G.; the others are Olay, Gillette, Old Spice, Safeguard and Camay. In the past five years, Ivory’s annual sales have ranked third among the six brands, said Kevin Hochman, marketing director of the Ivory brand team. According to Jason M. Gere, who follows Procter &amp; Gamble for RBC Capital Markets, Ivory’s annual sales are less than $100 million, or less than 1 percent of the company’s total annual sales. Competition in the soap category has changed radically since Ivory was introduced in 1879: Mr. Hochman said the biggest trend in recent years was “genderization” of the category, soaps specifically for men or women. He said Ivory, on the other hand, appealed to men and women, with half the brand’s users male and half female.  Procter &amp; Gamble also is grappling with slower growth in sales of beauty care products. Because of the economic downturn, the company “has to hold onto its core demographic and capture new consumers with a new approach,” Mr. Gere said. He said Ivory’s main competitors in the bar soap segment — the largest part of its business — were Henkel’s Dial and Unilever’s Dove brands. According to Mintel International, a market research company in Chicago, United States sales of nondeodorant bar soaps rose only 0.8 percent in 2010 compared with 2009. According to SymphonyIRI, bar soap sales in United States supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchants excluding Wal-Mart totaled $739.4 million in the year ending Oct. 2. Dove generated 40.5 percent of these sales, an increase of 6.31 percent year over year; Dial generated 13.6 percent of sales, a fall of 3.44 percent; and Ivory generated 4.41 percent of sales, a decline of 3.13 percent. Directed at mothers ages 25 to 49, the new advertising, by Wieden &amp; Kennedy, is promoting Ivory’s bar soap, body wash and liquid hand soap. All come in Ivory’s original formula, or with aloe or lavender. The ads, which run through December, include humorous 15- and 30-second TV spots that show how complicated soap use has become. One depicts a group of unusually shaped soaps, including a soap that resembles waffles with syrup and powdered sugar, and asks, “At what point does soap stop being soap?” Television ads are running in cities including San Antonio, Detroit, Miami, and Fort Smith, Ark., which Mr. Hochman called “highly developed” markets for Ivory. Print ads are running in November and December issues of magazines like Cosmopolitan, Essence and People, while banner ads are running on Web sites like iVillage.com and AllRecipes.com. Outdoor advertising is running in Cincinnati; Nashville; Minneapolis; Charlotte, N.C.; and Bentonville, Ark. Danielle Flagg, a creative director at Wieden &amp; Kennedy, said the campaign’s creative concept came about “because it felt like just the right time to stand in contrast to the overcomplicated nonsense” in the soap category. Ivory’s new online community, called Soap Dish, is hosted by Ms. McCarthy, who recently won an Emmy award for her work on the CBS sitcom “Mike &amp; Molly,” and is the mother of two young daughters. Ms. McCarthy and community participants will discuss issues of marriage and motherhood; Ivory fans must “like” the brand’s Facebook page to participate. The Facebook page and Soap Dish were developed by Citizen Paine in Irvine, Calif.  Industry experts generally praised the campaign, though some questioned why the brand’s new packaging was not shown in any advertising. Tulin Erdem, a professor of marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business, said the campaign tried to keep up “with the times without sounding too trendy,” while “mocking lightheartedly the soap industry.” David Reibstein, a professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the unsettled economy might further Procter &amp; Gamble’s efforts, because many people cannot “afford a luxurious soap.” Renée Richardson Gosline, an assistant professor of marketing at the MIT Sloan School of Management, also predicted the simplicity of Ivory and its campaign could appeal to consumers. However, she also questioned the absence of the new Ivory packaging in advertising. “If you’re proud of the packaging, show it off,” she said. Procter &amp; Gamble declined to discuss the budget for the campaign. According to Kantar Media, the company was the largest United States advertiser in the first half of 2011, spending $1.4 billion, down 7.8 percent from the same period in 2009.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/business/colgate-profit-rises-while-procters-falls.html?ref=procterandgamble">Colgate Profit Rises While Procter’s Falls<date>Published: October 27, 2011</date><text>Colgate-Palmolive said Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 4 percent, while Procter &amp; Gamble reported a 2 percent decline.Both said their results were helped by higher prices to consumers and hurt by increased costs for raw materials. Procter &amp; Gamble, however, said its price increases could not overcome those costs, while Colgate-Palmolive said it controlled costs and had strong sales in emerging markets. P.&amp; G. raised prices mostly on premium products like Crest 3D whitening strips and Gillette ProGlide razors, which have sold well even in the weak economy, executives said. P.&amp; G.’s prices rose an average of 4 percent in the July through September period, its fiscal first quarter. That was on top of price increases of 3 percent and 1 percent the previous two quarters. The company said its price increases had pared some market share in Western Europe, where it gets 20 percent of its revenue, and in North America, where it gets about 40 percent. But it held or gained market share in other parts of the world. Revenue increased 9 percent to $21.92 billion from $20.12 billion. That beat the $21.58 billion expected by analysts polled by FactSet, a research firm. Net income fell to $3.02 billion from $3.08 billion. Earnings were $1.03 a share, in line with analysts’ estimates, and up from $1.02 a share in the same period a year ago. Gross margin fell to 49.5 percent from 51.9 percent. P.&amp; G. said it expected revenue to increase 3 to 6 percent for the current fiscal year, which runs through June. Colgate-Palmolive said that, in addition to its strength in emerging markets, there were encouraging signs in developed markets as well, where sales had lagged for more than a year. The company earned $643 million, or $1.31 a share, for the period ended Sept. 30, compared with $619 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 11 percent to $4.38 billion. Per-share earnings edged out Wall Street expectations by a penny, according to FactSet, and the company topped revenue projections as well. The biggest gains came in the Europe/South Pacific region, with an 18.5 percent revenue increase. That region makes up 22 percent of company sales. Latin America, which accounts for 28 percent of sales, posted a 16 percent rise in revenue. Revenue in North America, where 18 percent of sales are made, climbed 3 percent. Revenue for Greater Asia/Africa, which is 20 percent of company sales, rose 9.5 percent. The company expects full-year gross profit margin to fall this year. It stuck to its earnings per share forecast for the year and forecast a double-digit percentage jump in per-share earnings for next year. Colgate-Palmolive reduced its selling, general and administrative expenses to 34 percent of sales, compared with 35.3 percent a year earlier. It also cut overhead and domestic advertising spending. Worldwide ad spending rose 4 percent.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/gupta-surrenders-to-authorities-on-insider-trading/?ref=procterandgamble">Gupta Charged With Securities Fraud Related to Goldman Tips<date>October 26, 2011, 8:37 am</date><text>Douglas Healey for The New York TimesRajat Gupta at his home in Westport, Conn., on Wednesday morning. 8:46 p.m. | Updated Rajat K. Gupta, a former director at Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to insider trading charges, setting the stage for a courtroom battle that will extend the government’s broad crackdown on Wall Street to the corporate boardroom. On Wednesday, a federal grand jury in Manhattan charged Mr. Gupta, 62, with one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and five counts of securities fraud. He is accused of sharing corporate secrets about Goldman and Procter &amp; Gamble with Raj Rajaratnam, the co-founder of the Galleon Group who was sentenced to 11 years in prison earlier this month for insider trading. The details of the indictment, many of which came out during Mr. Rajaratnam’s trial and a previous action by the Securities and Exchange Commission, could prove explosive; he is the first executive from the upper echelons of corporate America to be implicated in the far-reaching scandal. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Complete Coverage: Galleon Investigation The Challenges of Prosecuting Rajat Gupta The grand jury indictment The S.E.C.'s civil complaint “Rajat Gupta was entrusted by some of the premier institutions of American business to sit inside their boardrooms, among their executives and directors, and receive their confidential information so that he could give advice and counsel for the benefit of their shareholders,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. “As alleged, he broke that trust and instead became the illegal eyes and ears in the boardroom for his friend and business associate, Raj Rajaratnam, who reaped enormous profits from Mr. Gupta’s breach of duty.” A stoic Mr. Gupta, wearing a navy blue suit and red tie, pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is set to be released on a $10 million bond, secured by his home in Westport, Conn., and will turn over his passport. “The facts in this case demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent of any of these charges and that he has always acted with honesty and integrity,” Gary P. Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, said in a statement. Judge Jed S. Rakoff, a federal judge in Manhattan, has been assigned to the case, set for trial on April 9, 2012. He ruled on a matter between Mr. Gupta and the S.E.C. this summer. The government has taken aggressive action against insider trading. In the last two years, the government has charged 56 people with swapping illegal tips, including Mr. Gupta; of those, 51 have pleaded guilty or have been convicted. With Mr. Gupta, the campaign has moved beyond financial professionals. As the head of McKinsey &amp; Company, the prominent consulting firm, Mr. Gupta advised some of the world’s most influential people, rubbing elbows with the chief executive of General Electric, Jeffrey R. Immelt, and the former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Gupta’s case has been tricky for the government. Although his name came up repeatedly at Mr. Rajaratnam’s trial, both in testimony and in secretly recorded phone conversations, the Justice Department never brought charges against him. The S.E.C. filed an administrative action against Mr. Gupta. In response, he filed a separate lawsuit, asking to move the case to federal court, where it would be heard by a jury. Judge Rakoff allowed Mr. Gupta’s suit to move forward in July, saying the S.E.C. took a “cavalier approach” in approving the administrative proceeding. The agency later dropped the matter, but reserved the right to refile. On Wednesday, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint against Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam, claiming an “extensive insider trading scheme.” It mirrored the agency’s earlier action against Mr. Gupta. “Gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading public companies, and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets to the disadvantage of investors, shareholders, and fellow directors,” Robert S. Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.’s division of enforcement, said in a statement. According to the indictment, Mr. Gupta gave Mr. Rajaratnam advance word of Warren E. Buffett’s $5 billion investment in Goldman during the financial crisis. After hanging up from a special board meeting in September 2008, Mr. Gupta called Mr. Rajaratnam within 16 seconds, prosecutors said. Moments later, Mr. Rajaratnam purchased shares in Goldman, ultimately netting about $840,000, according to the indictment. The next month, Mr. Gupta ostensibly informed Mr. Rajaratnam that Goldman would report an unexpected quarterly loss. Acting on the tip the next day, Mr. Rajaratnam, sold off shares in the company, saving millions of dollars, the indictment stated. Mr. Gupta is also accused of tipping Mr. Rajaratnam about Procter &amp; Gamble’s quarterly sales projections, which were going to be weaker than predicted. Mr. Rajaratnam promptly bet against the company’s stock, the indictment says. The government has said that Mr. Gupta was eager to deepen his personal and financial ties with the billionaire hedge fund manager, which predate the alleged tips. From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Gupta had money in at least two of Mr. Rajaratnam’s hedge funds, an investment valued at about $2.5 million by March 2005, according to the indictment. The two men also started several financial ventures together, including Voyager Capital Partners, financed with $10 million from Mr. Gupta and $40 million from Mr. Rajaratnam. The investment fund allocated some money to Galleon hedge funds, including ones managed by Mr. Rajaratnam. “There were legitimate reasons for any communications between Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam,” Mr. Naftalis, Mr. Gupta’s lawyer, said in a statement. “Mr. Gupta lost his entire investment in the fund at the time of the events in question, negating any motive to deviate from a lifetime of probity and distinguished service.” In past Galleon-related trials, the government relied heavily on the use of wiretaps and recordings to make its case. But prosecutors may not have the same breadth of evidence this time, since the Goldman discussions between Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Gupta were not taped. Instead, the government has conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and his employees. In one call played during Mr. Rajaratnam’s trial, the hedge fund manager told someone: “I heard yesterday from somebody who’s on the board of Goldman Sachs that they are going to lose $2 per share.” In a different call, Mr. Rajaratnam said, “I got a call saying something good is going to happen to Goldman.” That could present a challenge. The judge could disallow the calls as hearsay, meaning they would be deemed too unreliable to pass court muster. U.S. v. Rajat K. Gupta</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0D6123AF935A15753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">DEALBOOK; U.S. Set To Charge Major Executive In Trade Inquiry<date>Published: October 26, 2011</date><text>9:02 p.m. | Updated Federal prosecutors are expected to file criminal charges on Wednesday against Rajat K. Gupta, the most prominent business executive ensnared in an aggressive insider trading investigation, according to people briefed on the case. The case against Mr. Gupta, 62, who is expected to surrender to F.B.I. agents on Wednesday, would extend the reach of the government's inquiry into America's most prestigious corporate boardrooms. Most of the defendants charged with insider trading over the last two years have plied their trade exclusively on Wall Street. The charges would also mean a stunning fall from grace of a trusted adviser to political leaders and chief executives of the world's most celebrated companies. A former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble and the longtime head of McKinsey &amp; Company, the elite consulting firm, Mr. Gupta has been under investigation over whether he leaked corporate secrets to Raj Rajaratnam, the hedge fund manager who was sentenced this month to 11 years in prison for trading on illegal stock tips. While there has been no indication yet that Mr. Gupta profited directly from the information he passed to Mr. Rajaratnam, securities laws prohibit company insiders from divulging corporate secrets to those who then profit from them. The case against Mr. Gupta, who lives in Westport, Conn., would tie up a major loose end in the long-running investigation of Mr. Rajaratnam's hedge fund, the Galleon Group. Yet federal authorities continue their campaign to ferret out insider trading on multiple fronts. This month, for example, a Denver-based hedge fund manager and a chemist at the Food and Drug Administration pleaded guilty to such charges. A spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan declined to comment. Gary P. Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, said in a statement: ''The facts demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is an innocent man and that he acted with honesty and integrity.'' Mr. Gupta, in his role at the helm of McKinsey, was a trusted adviser to business leaders including Jeffrey R. Immelt, of General Electric, and Henry R. Kravis, of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company. A native of Kolkata, India, and a graduate of the Harvard Business School, Mr. Gupta has also been a philanthropist, serving as a senior adviser to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Mr. Gupta also served as a special adviser to the United Nations. His name emerged just a week before Mr. Rajaratnam's trial in March, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an administrative proceeding against him. The agency accused Mr. Gupta of passing confidential information about Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble to Mr. Rajaratnam, who then traded on the news. The details were explosive. Authorities said Mr. Gupta gave Mr. Rajaratnam advanced word of Warren E. Buffett's $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs during the darkest days of the financial crisis in addition to other sensitive information affecting the company's share price. At the time, federal prosecutors named Mr. Gupta a co-conspirator of Mr. Rajaratnam, but they never charged him. Still, his presence loomed large at Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman, testified about Mr. Gupta's role on the board and the secrets he was privy to, including earnings details and the bank's strategic deliberations. The legal odyssey leading to charges against Mr. Gupta could serve as a case study in law school criminal procedure class. He fought the S.E.C.'s civil action, which would have been heard before an administrative judge. Mr. Gupta argued that the proceeding denied him of his constitutional right to a jury trial and treated him differently than the other Mr. Rajaratnam-related defendants, all of whom the agency sued in federal court. Mr. Gupta prevailed, and the S.E.C. dropped its case in August, but it maintained the right to bring an action in federal court. The agency is expected to file a new, parallel civil case against Mr. Gupta as well. It is unclear what has changed since the S.E.C. dropped its case in August. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment. The case could be a challenge for the government. Many of the defendants convicted of insider trading, including Mr. Rajaratnam, have been caught on wiretaps swapping secret information.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE6DC1238F936A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">P.&amp;G. Settles Trademark Suit Against Start-Up Business<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>A Connecticut mother and businesswoman has won the right to name her company after her daughter, Willa, despite the objections of the nation's largest consumer products company. Christy Prunier spent the last three years creating a line of skin care products aimed at preteenage girls like Willa, who is 11. But after obtaining trademark approval from the government early this year, she received a cease and desist letter from Procter &amp; Gamble, which owns the hair care brand Wella. Lawyers for Procter &amp; Gamble said consumers would be confused because of the similarities, and demanded that she drop the name Willa. Ms. Prunier fought back. The two sides were scheduled to go to trial this week but instead settled the dispute, subject to a judge's approval. ''We are pleased to confirm that this matter has been amicably resolved,'' said Jennifer Chelune, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble, in an e-mail. She declined to elaborate. Lawyers for Ms. Prunier also declined to provide additional specifics about the settlement, other than confirming that their client can continue to use the name Willa for her line of lip balm, facial masks and other skin care products. Ms. Prunier, who had likened her struggle to David versus Goliath, declined to comment, citing confidentiality provisions in the settlement pact. Trademark lawyers said it was not uncommon for disputes like Ms. Prunier's to settle just before trial. ''What's important to brand owners is control, and a private resolution that allows continued use in certain respects rather than an all-or-nothing decision by a judge or jury can be a good result,'' said James D. Weinberger, an intellectual-property lawyer at Fross Zelnick Lehrman &amp; Zissu in New York. ''If you go to trial and win, great; but if you lose, there can be long-term damage that is difficult to repair.'' Mr. Prunier's battle with P.&amp; G. is just the latest case of a small-business owner claiming ''trademark bullying'' by a large corporation. This summer, the Maya Archaeology Initiative fought claims by Kellogg that a bird in the organization's logo was too similar to Toucan Sam, the bird on the Froot Loops cereal box. The sides settled the dispute, allowing the Mayan group to use its mark. The legal battles have caught the attention of Congress, which last year passed legislation that required a study of the issue. The subsequent Commerce Department report concluded that there was inconclusive evidence of widespread trademark bullying and that disputes ''may be best addressed by the existing safeguards in the litigation system.'' A former film executive, Ms. Prunier said the idea of creating a cosmetics business for preteenage girls arose while Willa was taking a bath several years ago. Willa complained that she was tired of using ''babyish'' soaps and instead wanted soap made for girls her age. Ms. Prunier spent the next three years meeting with chemists and developing a line of soaps and lotions that will be sold in purple and white bottles. She said her face wash was meant to ''smell like a girl in the summertime who takes a shower outside.'' Willa had caught the attention of Target, J. Crew and an Upper East Side boutique owned by the actressPhoebe Cates before the squabble with Procter &amp; Gamble left the business in limbo. The company's namesake was in school on Friday and unavailable for comment. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

You may have seen a fascinating New York Times article about the lawsuit Procter &amp; Gamble has filed against a start-up called Willa, which produces a line of cosmetics that is sold in Target and in small boutiques. It turns out that P.&amp;G. has a line of cosmetics called Wella, a German hair care brand that the conglomerate acquired in 2003 for $7 billion. P.&amp;G. sued Willa over the name, claiming that it was confusingly similar to Wella. The case resonated with me because TerraCycle went through a similar lawsuit a number of years ago. The settlement terms prohibit me from discussing the case, but it had a similar David vs. Goliath plot line. Intellectual property law generally requires the owner of a mark or patent to police it. For example, if we find someone using a logo similar to TerraCycle’s, we would have to do something — starting with a gentle request and moving on to legal action if necessary. Bottom line: use it or lose it. So before we come down too hard on the Goliaths who bring these cases, it is important to put these efforts in context: the big companies have little choice; it’s the way the system works. But all is not lost for the Davids. Yes, a lawsuit like this can crush a small business — Willa, apparently, has already spent $750,000 in legal fees, a very big bill for a small company. But the money doesn’t have to go to waste. I believe that the best defense when a big company attacks a smaller company is to take the fight to the press. America loves the little guy. It goes back to the colonies and the Redcoats. It’s in our D.N.A. So, Willa might do well to keep telling its story. I have seen this work for other companies (here’s an example involving Jennifer Lopez that wound up on the cover of Inc. magazine). The result can be a barrage of media that can create some major benefits: the small brand receives more attention, its consumers become more passionate, and the big brand is put on the defensive. Again, I am bound by the settlement agreement in the TerraCycle case not to disclose details of the case, but I can report that the year of the lawsuit our sales doubled from $1.5 million to $3.3 million. This media strategy changes the game from one played in the courtroom to one played in the court of public opinion. The good news is that the court of public opinion favors the little guy and will overlook many details and even legal rights that may favor the big guy. This strategy is not for everyone, however. To prevail, one needs to have a great story, one that resonates with the public. So, one thing to remember is the value in your company’s story. For many companies, the better strategy is to avoid these situations. I strongly recommend hiring a good I.P. lawyer and — just as important — buying liability insurance that will cover legal fees. As to the specifics of the Willa case, in my disinterested opinion, I do think the names are confusingly similar. But, while I support P.&amp;G. on the merits, I, like most Americans, I suspect, will be rooting irrationally for Willa. Tom Szaky is the chief executive of TerraCycle, which is based in Trenton.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFD61F3EF93AA1575AC0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">A Start-Up Takes On a Titan<date>Published: September 29, 2011</date><text>A light bulb went off for Christy Prunier while giving her 8-year-old daughter, Willa, a bath. The girl complained that she didn't like ''babyish'' soaps anymore. Ms. Prunier got to work, and after three years of research, introduced a line of skin care products aimed at preteenage girls. The name? Willa, of course. With lip balm, facial masks and lotions in whimsical purple and white bottles, Willa caught the attention of Target, J. Crew and trendy Upper East Side boutiques like Blue Tree, owned by the actress Phoebe Cates. Procter &amp; Gamble noticed Willa, too, but wasn't so enthusiastic. It sent Ms. Prunier a letter demanding that she drop the name Willa, or it would resort to ''lengthy and expensive alternative measures.'' Willa, contends Procter &amp; Gamble, sounds too much like Wella, its own brand of hair care products, and consumers would be confused. Instead of changing the name, Ms. Prunier chose to fight back. The battle between Ms. Prunier and Procter &amp; Gamble - or Willa versus Wella - goes to court next month. ''There's no chance here that anyone is going to be confused,'' said Ms. Prunier, 43, a former film executive who lives in suburban Connecticut. ''They have nothing to lose. They are intent on shutting me down.'' Ms. Prunier is not the first small-business owner to claim harassment by a large corporation over its name. After some small businesses complained about what they call ''trademark bullying,'' Congress mandated a study of the issue. In introducing the study, which was released in April, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said, ''I am concerned that large corporations are at times abusing the substantial rights Congress has granted them in their intellectual property to the detriment of small businesses.'' The senator noted a ''spurious'' trademark claim from 2009 against a Vermont business, Rock Art Brewery. Hansen Beverage, the makers of Monster Energy drinks, objected to the brewery's Vermonster beer. Hansen dropped its claim provided Vermonster was not sold as an energy drink. In another case, from last August, the Maya Archaeology Initiative fought claims by Kellogg that a bird depicted in the organization's logo is too similar to Toucan Sam, the bird on the Froot Loops cereal box. The two sides have since reached an agreement allowing the Mayan group to use its mark. Facebook, meanwhile, has sued Teachbook.com, a Web site for teachers, for using the word ''book'' in its name. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. ''The big corporations often send these cease-and-desist letters and issue threats regardless of the merits of the claims,'' said Erik M. Pelton, a trademark lawyer in Alexandria, Va. ''They then use their endless resources and legal firepower to get the result they want: the small businesses often go away because they can't afford to fight back.'' But Alan C. Drewsen, executive director of the International Trademark Association, said, ''Just because trademark owners are big doesn't mean they're bullies. Major brands must have a carefully considered enforcement strategy in order to protect their intellectual property.'' Indeed, the government's study found that evidence of widespread trademark bullying was inconclusive, suggesting that disputes ''may be best addressed by the existing safeguards in the litigation system.'' The report effectively killed any momentum for a legislative fix. Instead, regulators have urged the private sector to provide free or low-cost legal counsel to small businesses engaged in trademark disputes, a remedy that some small businesses and lawyers have criticized as being woefully inadequate. Like many large corporations, P.&amp;G. fiercely protects its intellectual property, and company lawyers routinely search for potential conflicts. Procter's lawyer contacted Ms. Prunier in January after she received government approval to use the Willa name. For Ms. Prunier, the trademark approval was the end of a nearly three-year process of working with chemists and dermatologists to develop the Willa line. Her goal, she said, was to provide a natural alternative to the ''Miley Cyrus, made in China, bubble-gum flavor products'' currently on the shelves. For instance, among her products is a face wash that ''is meant to smell like a girl in the summertime who takes a shower outside,'' she said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/a-start-up-takes-on-procter-gamble-over-a-name/?ref=procterandgamble">A Start-Up Takes On Procter &amp; Gamble Over a Name<date>September 28, 2011, 9:34 pm</date><text>Andrew Sullivan for The New York TimesChristy Prunier said she started her line of skin care products for preteenagers when her daughter, Willa, said she was tired of using soap meant for little children.

It sent Ms. Prunier a letter demanding that she drop the name Willa, or it would resort to “lengthy and expensive alternative measures.” Willa, contends Procter &amp; Gamble, sounds too much like Wella, its own brand of hair care products, and consumers would be confused. Instead of changing the name, Ms. Prunier chose to fight back. The battle between Ms. Prunier and Procter &amp; Gamble — or Willa versus Wella — goes to court next month. “There’s no chance here that anyone is going to be confused,” said Ms. Prunier, 43, a former film executive who lives in suburban Connecticut. “They have nothing to lose. They are intent on shutting me down.” Andrew Sullivan for The New York TimesProcter &amp; Gamble contends that Willa, Christy Prunier’s skin care line, is too similar to the name of its Wella hair care products. Ms. Prunier is not the first small-business owner to claim harassment by a large corporation over its name. After some small businesses complained about what they call “trademark bullying,” Congress mandated a study of the issue. In introducing the study, which was released in April, Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said, “I am concerned that large corporations are at times abusing the substantial rights Congress has granted them in their intellectual property to the detriment of small businesses.” The senator noted a “spurious” trademark claim from 2009 against a Vermont business, Rock Art Brewery. Hansen Beverage, the makers of Monster Energy drinks, objected to the brewery’s Vermonster beer. Hansen dropped its claim provided Vermonster was not sold as an energy drink. In another case, from last August, the Maya Archaeology Initiative fought claims by Kellogg that a bird depicted in the organization’s logo is too similar to Toucan Sam, the bird on the Froot Loops cereal box. The two sides have since reached an agreement allowing the Mayan group to use its mark. Facebook, meanwhile, has sued Teachbook.com, a Web site for teachers, for using the word “book” in its name. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. “The big corporations often send these cease-and-desist letters and issue threats regardless of the merits of the claims,” said Erik M. Pelton, a trademark lawyer in Alexandria, Va. “They then use their endless resources and legal firepower to get the result they want: the small businesses often go away because they can’t afford to fight back.” But Alan C. Drewsen, executive director of the International Trademark Association, said, “Just because trademark owners are big doesn’t mean they’re bullies. Major brands must have a carefully considered enforcement strategy in order to protect their intellectual property.” Indeed, the government’s study found that evidence of widespread trademark bullying was inconclusive, suggesting that disputes “may be best addressed by the existing safeguards in the litigation system.” The report effectively killed any momentum for a legislative fix. Instead, regulators have urged the private sector to provide free or low-cost legal counsel to small businesses engaged in trademark disputes, a remedy that some small businesses and lawyers have criticized as being woefully inadequate. Like many large corporations, P.&amp;G. fiercely protects its intellectual property, and company lawyers routinely search for potential conflicts. Procter’s lawyer contacted Ms. Prunier in January after she received government approval to use the Willa name. For Ms. Prunier, the trademark approval was the end of a nearly three-year process of working with chemists and dermatologists to develop the Willa line. Her goal, she said, was to provide a natural alternative to the “Miley Cyrus, made in China, bubble-gum flavor products” currently on the shelves. For instance, among her products is a face wash that “is meant to smell like a girl in the summertime who takes a shower outside,” she said. The natural personal care category is big business, estimated at $5 billion a year in sales in the United States alone, according to Organic Monitor. A few one-time start-ups have made a killing, too; Tom’s of Maine was purchased by Colgate-Palmolive for $100 million in 2006, and Burt’s Bees was bought by Clorox for $925 million a year later. Ms. Prunier said she developed Willa with help from her baby sitter, Francesca Harrell, a recent graduate of the Parsons School of Design, and Willa herself. Focus groups consisted of Willa’s classmates from the Spence School, a private school on the Upper East Side, who sampled products and jotted their reactions on a clipboard. (The family moved to Connecticut this summer.) Ms. Prunier was picking Willa up at Spence on Jan. 31 when she received a call from her trademark lawyer informing her of the Procter cease-and-desist letter. P.&amp;G. gave her less than two weeks to confirm that she was “taking the necessary steps to comply with our client’s demands.” Instead, she sought advice from Willa’s best friend’s father, a lawyer, who urged her to stand up to Procter &amp; Gamble. Eventually, Ms. Prunier sued, asking a court to rule that Willa does not infringe upon the trademark for Wella, a German hair care brand that P.&amp;G. acquired in 2003 for $7 billion. Procter has since demanded the hard drive from Ms. Prunier’s computer to search for incriminating documents. And it issued subpoenas to Ms. Prunier’s potential customers, including Ms. Cates, according to Ms. Prunier’s lawyer. “If you were the owner of this boutique, why would you want to get involved in this fight?” said William A. Brewer III, Ms. Prunier’s lawyer. “It basically stops the forward thrust, or opportunity, for our client.” Jennifer J. Chelune, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble, said, “We believe that a range of hair and related products called ‘Willa’ would be too close to our Wella brand name. This risks consumer confusion and is important to know that it could set a precedent that other companies could exploit to try and infringe our Wella trademark.” She said that the company’s trademarks were “how we build consumer trust in our brands over many years” and needed to be protected. “Especially in today’s Internet world, the size of the company makes little difference.” The case goes to trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Oct. 12. It is likely to hinge on whether a jury finds a “likelihood of confusion” among customers of Willa and Wella, a rather squishy legal standard that focuses on factors including the similarity of the marks and products, and whether they are sold in the same channels. Ms. Prunier argues that Wella sells only hair care products, while Willa’s line is broader. In addition, she said Wella is primarily sold in hair salons, while Willa would be offered in retail stores and boutiques. Given the strain of the lawsuit and the estimated $750,000 in legal fees, Ms. Prunier said she had thought about changing the name. But she said the story of Willa was crucial to the brand and any other name lacked “authenticity.” Willa’s middle name, Price, doesn’t work either. “The first thing I think of when I think about ‘Price’ is cost,” Ms. Prunier said. For Willa, now a smiley 11-year-old with braces, the family start-up has provided all sorts of lessons about the business world, not all of them pleasant. As she watched her mother break down in tears during an interview at her kitchen table, Willa struggled to maintain her composure. “I think it’s going to work out,” Willa said. “It’s just a lot of stress for my mom.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/business/cold-water-detergents-get-a-chilly-reception.html?ref=procterandgamble">Cold-Water Detergents Get a Cold Shoulder<date>Published: September 16, 2011</date><text>Newly formulated laundry detergents can wash most clothes perfectly well in cold water, manufacturers say, but customers are stubbornly refusing to turn down the temperature. Although some of these detergents have been available for several years, customers cling to mom’s age-old advice that hot water washes best — squandering energy and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.Even in Germany, where consumers tend to be more environmentally attuned than in the United States, manufacturers have discovered that cold-water washing is such a hard sell that they have relegated claims about it — and the attendant green benefits — to the fine print, choosing to emphasize other attributes. “For selling, it is much more effective to focus on stain removal and whiteness, performance and price,” said Dr. Thomas Mueller-Kirschbaum, a senior vice president for research and development at Henkel, the German company that markets cold-water formulas under the Persil and Purex brands. “In market research, when you ask consumers, they currently don’t see the immediate benefit of saving energy.” Of course, some consumers have long preferred to wash their clothes in cold water to prevent them from shrinking or the colors from fading, and many others wash darks or delicate clothes on the cold cycle. But the idea of reformulating detergent so that all types of clothes can be washed in cold water is relatively new, at least in North America and Europe. (In Japan, consumers routinely do their laundry in cold water.) About three-quarters of the energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions from washing a load of laundry come from heating the water — a practice that, scientists say, is often wasteful and unnecessary. Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant that makes brands like Crest and Gillette in addition to Tide, takes credit for the innovation in North America, which emerged from an evaluation of the company’s energy footprint in 2003. After realizing how much energy was used to heat water for laundry, Procter set a goal to convert 70 percent of all washing-machine loads to cold water by 2020; by Procter’s estimate currently 38 percent of laundry loads globally were done in cold water. But in trying to create Tide Coldwater, Procter’s scientists were confronted with a problem: hot water does help get clothes cleaner. In fact, thermal energy is one of three secrets to cleaning clothes, along with mechanical energy and chemicals. “When you reduce one, you have to do better in the others,” said James Danzinger, a senior scientist who works on detergents for Procter &amp; Gamble. So the company set its scientists loose to find new chemicals to compensate, and what they came up with was a detergent, Tide Coldwater, with different enzymes and surfactants that work better in cold water. Tide Coldwater was introduced in 2005. Several competitors followed with their own cold-water formulas, including Purex from Henkel, Wisk from Sun Products and Biokleen from a small company by the same name. Do cold-water detergents work? Consumer Reports ranked Tide Coldwater among its top detergents last year, though some of its competitors did not rate as high. The chemical composition of the new cold-water detergents, which cost about the same as regular detergents, is “totally different” from what was found in detergents a decade ago, said Dr. Mueller-Kirschbaum of Henkel. Some even contain chemicals that coat fabric fibers so that they are less likely to absorb dirt in the interval before the next washing. Tide Coldwater, by far the best-selling cold-water detergent, now accounts for $150 million in sales in the United States and $60 million in Canada, the company says. By comparison, regular Tide has well more than $1 billion a year in sales in the United States alone. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/business/emerging-markets-lift-results-at-procter-gamble.html?ref=procterandgamble">Emerging Markets Lift Results at Procter &amp; Gamble<date>Published: August 5, 2011</date><text>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company said Friday that its quarterly profit rose 15 percent as sales gained in emerging markets, and forecast annual revenue that topped some analysts’ estimates.

After she sprays air freshener, however, odors disappear, as evidenced by her ecstatic inhalations and, occasionally, by her being instantly transported to a flower garden or orange grove. Febreze, the Procter &amp; Gamble brand, is turning its nose up at that approach. For a series of television commercials and online videos, the brand recruited subjects off the street, who agreed to be blindfolded for what they were told was a scent experiment. Then, in video captured by hidden cameras, the participants were guided into odoriferous settings, like a dilapidated motel room strewn with dirty clothes, a secondhand store filled with threadbare furniture and soiled stuffed animals, and a cramped Chinese restaurant kitchen with whole uncooked fish on counters. In the commercials, each setting is shown being treated with a Febreze product, like fabric spray or room spray, before the blindfolded subjects are led in. In one spot, two women approached on the street in the SoHo section of Manhattan are led blindfolded into an abandoned section of a building, where they are seated on an old, torn couch that has clumps of dog hair. As two dogs dart around the room, they are asked by an off-screen interviewer to take deep breaths and report what they smell. One of the women says, “Light floral, lilac,” and “Like when you have fresh laundry.” The other adds, “Maybe even a little bit of citrus,” “a little bit beachy” and “wispy white curtains.” They are told to remove their blindfolds, and the squalor of the room registers on their shocked faces, with both saying, “Oh, my god,” before two members of the film crew approach them wielding Febreze. “Join us on Facebook for more experiments as Febreze sets out to make everyone breathe happy — no matter what,” says a voiceover, as the slogan for the campaign, “Breathe Happy,” appears on the screen. The spots, by Grey New York, part of the Grey Group unit of WPP, are scheduled to be posted on YouTube and Facebook on Friday and to be shown on television beginning July 7. “What we have done is put our products to the ultimate torture test,” said Jeff Pierce, a spokesman for Febreze. “If Febreze is so strong that it works in this dirty hotel room or on this gross couch, then it’s definitely going to work on my seemingly clean couch, blanket or any fabric in the home.”  Tor Myhren, president and chief creative officer at Grey New York, said the impetus for the campaign came from a consumer focus group. “Someone said, ‘You can close your eyes, but you can’t turn off your nose,’ and that’s a brilliant insight,” Mr. Myhren said. “We said that’s a big, big, big idea that we need to bring to life.” Members of Procter &amp; Gamble’s research and development team were on the sets for the commercials, which were shot in New York and Los Angeles. “The R.&amp; D. team would be there with their clipboards and they’d walk in and would say that they thought the malodor was there,” said Elena Grasmann, a vice president at Grey who attended the shoots. (Ms. Grasmann’s own assessment: “It smelled.”) After Febreze representatives sprayed the sets with the product, they, along with the director and representatives from Grey, huddled in a nearby trailer and watched the proceedings unfold on monitors. “We all sat there watching and we were anxious and then we were amazed,” said Ms. Grasmann. For the scientists, it was particularly “rewarding for them given that they worked on these products,” she said. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/business/media/16adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Laundry Soaps Try a Hint of Horror and Some Tough-Guy Talk<date>Published: June 15, 2011</date><text>A LOW-INTEREST category in consumer marketing is getting interesting.The category is laundry products, household staples like detergents, bleaches and fabric softeners. People do not think about them much, unlike higher-interest categories like cars or any gadget from Apple beginning with “i.” No laundry product marketer has introduced an iDetergent — not yet, anyway. Meantime, the largest companies in the category are seeking more attention among shoppers with campaigns that are offbeat and even odd. Reckitt Benckiser, for its Woolite brand of liquid detergent, is introducing ads with a spooky tone reminiscent of a Rob Zombie horror movie. That is no coincidence: the commercial that is the centerpiece of the campaign, making its debut on Thursday on the brand’s Facebook page, was directed by Mr. Zombie. “Some detergents torture your clothes,” asserts the campaign, which depicts apparel being threatened by ominous devices out of a horrible Halloween. “Save them,” the ads declare, with Woolite, as evidenced by the campaign’s theme, “Long live your wardrobe.” And Procter &amp; Gamble is featuring the actor and martial artist Chuck Norris in a campaign for its Era liquid detergent. Era is “Chuck Norris approved,” according to the cheeky campaign, which includes commercials on television and YouTube, online advertising and social media like Facebook and Twitter. The Era campaign borrows from jokes that began appearing online in 2005, known as “Chuck Norris facts,” in the form of boldly exaggerated statements about Mr. Norris’s prowess as a fighter, a man’s man and a human being. The premise of the humorous Era campaign is that Era is the Chuck Norris of detergents, battling — and beating — stains the same way he vanquishes bad guys. The theme of the campaign, “A lot of fight for a little dough,” expresses that thought as well as that Era is a value brand — priced lower than Procter’s flagship detergent, Tide, but higher than store brands. “We’ve repositioned Woolite as more of a daily-use detergent for all the fabrics that require special care, and we’ve been trying to communicate this to consumers over time,” said Jiri Kulik, general manager for United States household marketing at the Reckitt Benckiser North American headquarters in Parsippany, N.J. “But we’ve always had trouble breaking through with the message,” he added, “because it’s very difficult to change a habit.” After “some of the consumers in our focus groups described what their clothes go through with laundry detergent like a ‘torture,’ we got this crazy idea of the washing machine like a torture chamber for your clothes,” Mr. Kulik said, “and then we describe Woolite as the savior.”  Even so, after the Woolite agency — Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas — presented a campaign based on that concept, “when we saw the first storyboard we almost flipped from our chairs,” he added, laughing. “Eventually, with testing, we got more and more comfortable with it.” Still, there are two versions of the commercial: a darker one for Facebook and movie theaters, and a milder one for television. “I’m not really sure which version is which,” Mr. Zombie said. “It’s not like it’s scary.” Mr. Zombie said he and his cinematographer, Brandon Trost, made the spot “more like a Tim Burton” film than something truly horrifying. For example, the main character, who is shown tormenting the clothes not washed in Woolite, “is like Uncle Fester,” Mr. Zombie said, referring to the character from “The Addams Family,” and not “like some child killer out in the woods.” Perhaps the only thing stranger than talking about death in reference to detergent ads is talking about Mr. Norris. He does not appear in person in the Era campaign; rather, his likeness is seen on a tongue-in-cheek seal in the ads and on bottles. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/media/03adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">From Proctor &amp; Gamble, Direct Disaster Relief<date>Published: June 2, 2011</date><text>MANY companies have donated money and goods in the wake of the tornado that devastated Joplin, Mo., and left at least 138 people dead. But in addition to donating to disaster relief groups, Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods giant, is taking the unusual approach of providing disaster relief directly.Days after the tornado, two of the company’s brands, Tide and Duracell, arrived with their own specially equipped trailers and crews, which set up in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Joplin. One trailer housed the Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry, first dispatched to post-Katrina New Orleans in 2005, which provided free wash-and-fold service. The other was the Duracell Power Relief Trailer, which provided free batteries and flashlights as well as charging stations for phones and laptops. In an era when 87 percent of Americans believe that companies should place at least as much value on societal interests as on business interests, according to a study by Edelman, the public relations firm, the line between marketing and philanthropy has grown increasingly fuzzy. The widely lauded Pepsi Refresh Project, for example, which awarded more than $20 million to about 1,000 projects in 2010, was introduced after the beverage maker announced that it would forgo buying commercial time during the Super Bowl for the first time in 23 years and allocate funds to causes instead.  Marketers run both the Tide and Duracell programs, but while the trailers are festooned with logos, there is no overt selling. “I guess you could call it a marketing expense because it’s run by our marketing team,” said Mandy Treeby, the external relations manager for Tide who leads the Loads of Hope program. “But Tide has cleaned clothes for Americans every day for the last 65 years, and this is so core to our purpose as a brand.” On May 26, the mobile laundry, which generally handles roughly 300 loads a day, extended its hours and accepted 764 loads, its busiest day ever. Dispatches from Joplin on the Tide Facebook page, with almost 1.4 million followers, have drawn hundreds of glowing comments from users. “This is exactly why I don’t mind paying a little more for a product like Tide,” Samantha Cantrill wrote in a typical comment on May 27. “I love that you guys turn around and give back to people.” Kurt Iverson, a spokesman for Duracell, said helping consumers in the aftermath of a storm is a natural fit for the brand. “Spring and summer season is a preparedness time when we try to remind consumers they need to have batteries ready because storms can take your power away from you,” Mr. Iverson said. The Duracell trailer made its first disaster outing in May after the tornadoes that struck Tuscaloosa, Ala. In the 13 days that the trailer was in Tuscaloosa, it was visited by about 3,000 families and distributed about 3,200 flashlights and batteries. About half of the visitors charged laptops or used onboard computers, often to get online to update friends and family. “It’s just a great opportunity to really have some personal relationships with consumers that have probably bought Duracell for years but probably didn’t expect them to show up on their doorstep when they needed them most,” Mr. Iverson said. Tide spent $177.2 million on advertising in 2010 and Duracell spent $60.4 million, according the Kantar Media unit of WPP. The Gigunda Group, a firm based in Manchester, N.H., that specializes in experiential marketing, a term for in-person activities and events, coordinates the logistics for both the Tide and Duracell efforts. Ross Mosher, the director of production for Gigunda , has traversed the country with the Tide unit for more than four years and said that because both water and sewer lines are often damaged, about 60 percent of the time the team has to bring in fresh water and take out dirty water. Sometimes, Tide forgoes its truck and leases local laundries, providing free wash-and-fold services there. “It may be that all they have is the clothes that they pulled out of the debris of their house, and when it’s a flood, sometimes the clothes are soaking wet and dirty,” Mr. Mosher said. Laundry at Loads of Hope, which is staffed by about 10 Gigunda and Procter &amp; Gamble employees as well as workers hired locally, is washed, folded, wrapped in paper, placed in bags and tied with a ribbon. “People come and lean over the table and give us a hug,” Mr. Mosher said. “One of the things that every brand strives for is to have an emotional connection to their brand, and Loads of Hope provides that every time.”  Since 2006, Gigunda also has coordinated the mobile public restrooms that Charmin, another P.&amp; G. brand, has provided in Times Square during the holiday season, and Mr. Mosher said restrooms might soon be dispatched to disaster areas, too. With pets distressed by disasters, too, Gigunda also is discussing with Procter the possibility of outfitting a pet-assistance mobile unit, which could be linked to the company’s Iams and Eukanuba brands, according to Mr. Mosher. “You have to be incredibly careful around natural disasters because you don’t want to be seen as an ambulance chaser, and you cannot merchandise on the back of a disaster,” said Carol Cone, managing director for brand and corporate citizenship at Edelman. But Tide has steered clear of pitfalls, Ms. Cone said. “What they came up with is to give superhuman powers to their brand to help out during disasters,” Ms. Cone said. “In a disaster people have lost everything, but what Tide realized is that just bringing in a laundromat gives people a modicum of normalcy, a moment of humanity.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/29consumer.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate Earnings Rise<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>The Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate-Palmolive companies posted increases in profit and sales for their most recent quarters on Thursday, but warned that rising costs would affect their results and lead to higher prices for consumers.Procter &amp; Gamble lowered the high end of its profit forecast for the year after posting a profit that fell a penny short of analysts’ average estimate. Colgate said that rising costs hurt its profit margins in its last quarter but that the income still met forecasts. Procter &amp; Gamble, the world’s largest maker of household goods, now expects its costs to rise about three times as much at it had at the start of the year, with increases in diesel, resin and other materials, the chief financial officer, Jon R. Moeller, said. Procter has implemented or announced increases across brands representing about 50 percent of United States sales but is not raising prices as much as it did in 2008, the chief executive, Robert A. McDonald, said. Procter &amp; Gamble earned $2.87 billion, or 96 cents a share, up from $2.59 billion, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended March 31 and was the third quarter of the company’s fiscal year, rose to $20.23 billion from $19.18 billion. Stock in Procter, which is based in Cincinnati, rose 48 cents, to $64.50 a share. Colgate, which was reporting results for its first quarter, said it earned $576 million, or $1.16 a share, up from $3.57 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.99 billion from $3.83 billion. Excluding one-time items from the year-earlier period, its net income was down 8 percent. The chief executive, Ian M. Cook, said Colgate raised prices in many categories and in all its markets, and will keep doing so, but he declined to provide details. Stock in Colgate, which is based in New York, rose $1.91, to $82.97 a share.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/rebound-for-product-makers-with-green-focus/?ref=procterandgamble">For a Few, Focus on Green Products Pays Off<date>April 21, 2011, 8:59 pm</date><text>These days, it seems, the provenance of green products matters. Manufacturers who have long aligned themselves with environmental causes, like Seventh Generation and Method, have rebounded better from the recession than the “green” lines of larger, more traditional manufacturers. Analysts say the reason is that the niche manufacturers tend to attract serious green customers who want products that are good for the environment even if they cost more. And if these customers find that a botanical ingredient isn’t quite as effective as bleach, they believe it is better for their house and lungs. As we report in an article in The Times, sales of green products over all dropped during the recession. But the committed customers have been quicker to come back to environmentally friendly products, compared to the much larger audience of mainstream customers, who may have been willing to buy green products when times were flush but scaled back when price started to matter. “If you were a hardcore ‘X’ user and the green brand came out and it was on sale, you gave it a shot, but you really weren’t committed to the movement,” said Eric Ryan, co-founder of Method. “Versus the pure plays like ourselves — we brought in the early adopters that were committed to either making a shift for the environment or for the health of the home environment, and we’ve built it over time.” Mr. Ryan said sales of Method products were up 20 percent in 2010, excluding comparisons to products like air fresheners that Method discontinued. Method sales were relatively flat in 2009. Similarly, sales of Seventh Generation rebounded to “solid double-digit growth” in 2010, after a relatively meager 2 percent gain in 2009, said John Replogle, chief executive. He attributed the rather sluggish sales in 2009 — which compared to a 50 percent increase in 2008 — with an influx of new competition and the economy’s near collapse. “We definitely watched the consumer trade to value for a period of time,” he said, adding that the cycle lasted about 15 months. Mr. Replogle said some major manufacturers might have struggled to gain traction in the green space because “the consumer didn’t see a compelling reason or point of difference.” “As a result, they didn’t get repeat purchase,” he said. Of course, not all of the major manufacturers who produced a green line are waving a white flag. Heidi Dorosin, vice president for marketing in the cleaning division of Clorox, noted that the company’s Green Works line remained the market leader and that Clorox was committed to the brand’s growth. She said Green Works adjusted its pricing so that it was never more than 20 percent higher than traditional cleaners. In addition, she said the company realized that the pricing had been inconsistent and confused consumers. Sometimes it the premium was more than 20 percent, sometimes it was less. (Method says its products are usually 25 percent higher than standard cleaners, because ingredients and containers are more expensive — recycled plastic costs more than new plastic. Also, smaller companies tend to have higher transportation and production costs than bigger ones, who can negotiate because of their size.) Ms. Dorosin noted that overall spending on cleaning products was down, and she theorized it was because of the recession and a decline in home ownership. She said the overall category was down roughly 3 percent, as were green cleaners. While competitors like Clorox, Church &amp; Dwight and S.C. Johnson were hurrying to introduce green products around 2008, Procter &amp; Gamble, the household products giant, decided it would not. Len Sauers, vice president for global sustainability, said the company considered such a move five or six years ago. But in conducting market research about green products, what the company found was that “not many people bought them,” he said. He said the company didn’t want to introduce more products into a category that was a relatively small portion of the overall market. He estimated that 15 to 20 percent of shoppers were willing to pay more, or lose some efficacy, for products with environmental attributes. But Mr. Sauers said 70 percent or more of consumers in the United States were not willing to make those trade-offs for green products, though they would buy the products if they cost the same. Procter &amp; Gamble took another tack, at least with laundry detergent, and emphasized money-saving. Instead of labeling a product as green, it introduced Tide Coldwater, which, as the name suggests, works with cold water instead of hot. In doing so, consumers can save as much as 80 percent of energy costs on every load, the company marketing says. In the last year, retail sales of Tide Coldwater have increased 24 percent, he said, and Procter &amp; Gamble recently added another variation, Tide Free for Coldwater, which doesn’t have any perfumes or dyes.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/business/global/14cartel.html?ref=procterandgamble">Unilever and P.&amp;G. Fined for Fixing Price of Detergent<date>Published: April 13, 2011</date><text>BRUSSELS — European antitrust authorities levied stiff fines on Wednesday on the household products companies Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever for price-fixing that arose during efforts to make greener packaging for laundry detergents.P.&amp; G., the maker of detergent brands like Tide and Ariel, was ordered to pay 211.2 million euros, or $306 million. Unilever, whose brands include Omo and Surf, was fined 104 million euros. A German company, Henkel, escaped a fine in exchange for blowing the whistle on the cartel. The European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said that the companies had developed the cartel to make sure none gained a competitive advantage over the others while seeking to meet environmental goals. “They agreed to protect their respective market shares, they agreed also not to decrease prices when decreasing the size of the packages, and afterwards they even agreed on a price increase,” Mr. Almunia said. The companies formed the cartel after working on methods to reduce the weight of detergent powders and to reduce waste from boxes and bags through the Association for Soaps, Detergents and Maintenance Products, a trade association that includes other major home products companies. The cartel operated from January 2002 until March 2005, and it affected the price of laundry detergents in supermarkets in Belgium France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain, the European Commission said. Mr. Almunia said there was no need to punish the trade association, which he praised for promoting environmental initiatives. Henkel said it detected the cartel in 2008 during an internal audit. The company “had to acknowledge concrete evidence of misconduct by employees” in several West European countries, Dirk-Stephan Koedijk, the chief compliance officer at Henkel, said in a statement. Henkel also said that it had taken measures to “avoid future misconduct.” Marina Barker, a spokeswoman for P.&amp; G., said that the activity took place from six to nine years ago, and had been solely focused on some countries in Europe. She said that P.&amp; G. had “previously taken an appropriate financial reserve,” and that the company had already strengthened its global compliance program. Unilever said that the size of the fine was in the range it had prepared for. Mr. Almunia said the companies admitted involvement in the cartel in exchange for a 10 percent reduction in their fines as part of a settlement procedure. Mr. Almunia said that where possible he favored settlements, as in two recent cases involving computer chips and animal feed, to speed up cartel investigations, but that that did not mean Europe was going soft on cartels. “The commission will pursue its relentless fight against cartels, which are the worst violation of competition rules by extracting higher prices from consumers than they would pay when companies compete fairly and on the merits,” Mr. Almunia said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/business/06pringles.html?ref=procterandgamble">Pringles Is Sold by Procter &amp; Gamble<date>Published: April 5, 2011</date><text>In announcing the sale of Pringles on Tuesday, Procter &amp; Gamble concluded what had been a tumultuous, sometimes zany, 50-year experiment in engineered food.The $2.35 billion deal with Diamond Foods is also a milestone for Procter as it sheds its last food brand after having already sold Jif peanut butter, Folger’s coffee and Crisco shortening. The company’s expertise in edible oils was used widely by the potato chip industry in the 1950s and 1960s, and shaped the invention of Pringles, the thinly sliced saddle-shaped crisp. Company officials still aren’t sure how the chips got their name, but one theory holds that two Procter advertising employees lived on Pringle Drive in Cincinnati and the name paired well with potato. The creator of the famous Pringles can was so proud of his invention that he asked that his ashes be buried in one. Yet Pringles, which is basically dehydrated potato flakes that are rolled and then fried, was not universally loved. It was such a dud in its early years that some called for Procter to dump the brand. The brand did not take off until the company tweaked the flavor in 1980 and introduced the “Fever for the Flavor of Pringles” advertising campaign. By the late 1990s, Pringles had become a $1 billion a year brand. On the television series “Ally McBeal,” Ally got into a grocery store skirmish with a woman over a can of Pringles. “When I was there 30 years ago, it was dead,” said Charles Jarvie, vice president of Procter’s food division in the late 1970s. “It’s a great example where they just didn’t give up.” Nonetheless, the sale of Pringles was not unexpected, as Procter has refocused its attention on the core businesses of beauty, grooming and household care. “Pringles is an iconic, billion-dollar snack brand with significant global manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure,” said Michael J. Mendes, chief executive of Diamond Foods, in a statement. The $2.35 billion transaction includes $1.5 billion of Diamond stock, which goes to P.&amp; G. shareholders who elect to participate in the deal, and the assumption of $850 million of Pringles debt by the merged company. The sale will barely make a dent in Procter, with $80 billion in annual sales. “It really didn’t fit what they are looking to do,” said Jason Gere, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who tracks the company. “For a long time, this was one of those products that felt more appropriate in someone else’s portfolio.” Pringles has kept up with some of its rivals in the flavor department, offering salt-and-vinegar, cheddar and pizza versions. While Pringles’ sales had been growing of late, Mr. Gere said that they had not been nearly as robust as many of P.&amp; G.’s other megabrands. Mr. Jarvie said the company had hoped to replicate the great science breakthroughs it had with laundry detergents, toothpaste and disposable diapers. But, he said, “food is as much an art as it is a science. Procter never got that.” In the 1950s, roughly 25 percent of the company’s sales were in food, particularly in shortening and other cooking oils. “We provided most of the oils to the potato chip industry,’ said Greg McCoy, a corporate archivist. “We were already frying up potato chips to test the oils.” But it lacked a distribution network to ship perishable bags of chips to grocery stores, so it directed its researchers to come up with a longer-lasting chip that could be distributed with P.&amp; G.’s existing distribution network. “They knew from the get-go that they wanted it to be uniform in size, texture and taste,” Mr. McCoy said. Procter wanted to create a perfect chip to address consumer complaints about broken and stale chips and air in the bags. The task was assigned to a chemist named Fredric Baur, who from 1956 to 1958 created Pringles’ saddle shape out of fried dough and also its can. But Mr. Baur could not figure out how to make the chips taste good, and he eventually was pulled off the Pringles job to work on another brand. In the mid-1960s, another Procter researcher, Alexander Liepa, dusted off Mr. Baur’s work and set a out to improve on the Pringles taste, which he succeeded in doing. Another theory for the Pringles’ name comes from Mr. Liepa’s patent, which credits research done in the 1940s by Mark Pringle, Mr. McCoy said. The chips were test marketed in Evansville, Ind., in 1968 and were an “overnight sensation,” Mr. McCoy said. But when the chips went national in 1971, the taste issue resurfaced. Officially, Pringles are called crisps rather than chips, the result of a long-ago fracas between competitors and regulators over what could be called a potato chip. In the 1993 book “Soap Opera: the Inside Story of Procter &amp; Gamble,” the author Alecia Swasy writes that Pringles were considered one of the great flops in company history, “the P.&amp; G. Edsel.” Mr. McCoy maintains, however, that Pringles gained traction after a makeover in 1980s, which included a thicker chip and a new focus on the taste, rather than the can. Mr. Baur never lost his affection for the Pringles’ can, which he invented. When he died in 2008, his children honored his request to bury his ashes in a Pringles can. In an interview with Time, Mr. Baur’s son, Larry, said he and his siblings stopped at a Walgreen’s to pick up a can of Pringles on the way to the funeral home. “My siblings and I briefly debated what flavor to use,” Mr. Baur said, in the Time interview. “But I said, ‘Look we need to use the original.’ ”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E7DA1139F93BA35750C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">DEALBOOK; Curious Accusations In S.E.C. Case<date>Published: March 8, 2011</date><text>The fact pattern looks bad, very bad. Seconds after Rajat K. Gupta, then a director of Goldman Sachs, finished up a board call during which he learned that Warren E. Buffett had agreed to invest $5 billion in the firm, he picked up the phone and called his friend Raj Rajaratnam, regulators contend. Minutes later, Mr. Rajaratnam placed bets on shares of Goldman Sachs that netted his firm, the Galleon Group, $900,000. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Mr. Gupta of insider trading last week, says this happened not once, but repeatedly. He did the same thing at Procter &amp; Gamble, where he was also a director, the S.E.C. claims. Exactly what was said on these phone calls remains unknown. But if the S.E.C. proves its case, then Mr. Gupta, a respected management guru who once ran McKinsey &amp; Company and advised the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was routinely ''disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets.'' Yet there is something curious about the accusations against Mr. Gupta, which came just days before Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal trial, which is set to begin on Tuesday. Given the seriousness of the claims - insider trading by an executive who had reached the upper echelons of corporate America - why not bring criminal charges against Mr. Gupta? Well, that's where the facts of the case get a little mushy, and they are starting to raise some questions among lawyers about the S.E.C.'s motivations. ''This is very unusual. It's a red flag,'' Kip Weissman, a partner at Luse Gorman Pomerenk &amp; Schick in Washington and a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer, said of the case. Not only has the Justice Department not brought a criminal case, at least not yet, but the S.E.C. decided to bring its case in front of an administrative law judge instead of in a Federal District Court, where a defendant has full discovery rights. The S.E.C. is using a new provision in the Dodd-Frank Act to bring the case this way. ''It's a little easier from an evidentiary perspective,'' Mr. Weissman said, for the S.E.C. to bring the case in front of an administrative judge. ''The evidentiary standard is lower,'' he explained. ''It's certainly noteworthy that the S.E.C. brought the case in this forum.'' Indeed, statistically, it is notable: of the 26 Galleon-related cases the S.E.C. has brought, all have been brought in federal court. None have been brought in front of an administrative judge. As Mr. Weissman asked, somewhat rhetorically, ''Why?'' The S.E.C.'s laundry list of allegations against Mr. Gupta raises some important questions: Since the government had tapped Mr. Rajaratnam's phones, were any of the conversations with Mr. Gupta that were cited by the S.E.C. recorded? It appears not. In one instance, the S.E.C. said ''telephone records and calendar entries'' indicated only that ''Gupta and Rajaratnam very likely had a telephone conversation.'' Since when has ''very likely'' been considered enough to make a civil allegation? Stranger still, nowhere in the S.E.C.'s filing does it contend that Mr. Gupta received any form of compensation for passing along insider trading tips to Mr. Rajaratnam. If that's right, why would Mr. Gupta pass the information? (The S.E.C. does not have to show that Mr. Gupta benefited financially to prove its case.) None of this is to suggest that the circumstantial evidence isn't powerful. But it does raise red flags among legal experts trying to handicap exactly what the government has up its sleeve. The running narrative among defense lawyers is this: The S.E.C. brought its case in front of an administrative judge to discredit Mr. Gupta to help the criminal case against Mr. Rajaratnam. But you have to imagine that if the evidence was truly overwhelming against him, Mr. Gupta might have sought to become a government witness to save himself. (People close to the case suggest that such a settlement offer had been on the table.) Having said all that, there is something mystifying in the statement that Gary Naftalis, Mr. Gupta's lawyer, made the day he was sued. ''Mr. Gupta has done nothing wrong,'' Mr. Naftalis said. ''There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits as part of any quid pro quo.'' Read those words again. He didn't say Mr. Gupta didn't pass on material nonpublic information or that he didn't breach his fiduciary duty. All he said was that his client wasn't getting paid to do so. Maybe Mr. Naftalis was going only for a short sound bite, but it is odd. In October, Alan Lafley, the former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, described Mr. Gupta thusly. ''I think of him like Thomas Aquinas,'' the philosopher and priest. The S.E.C. allegations may make him seem less like a saint, but not much like a sinner - at least not yet. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, was accused of insider trading by the S.E.C. last week.

The former director, Rajat K. Gupta, is accused of passing along information on the two companies’ earnings as well as word of Warren E. Buffett’s $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs in 2008. As a longtime senior executive at McKinsey &amp; Company, Mr. Gupta, 62, is the most prominent business executive ensnared by the government in a wide-ranging investigation into insider trading on Wall Street. He ran McKinsey from 1994 to 2003 and counts as friends and associates some of the most powerful people in business. In comparison, many of the defendants charged earlier with insider trading were junior traders and lawyers or midlevel executives. Over the last 18 months, federal prosecutors in Manhattan have charged 46 people with insider trading; of those, 29 have pleaded guilty. But the S.E.C.’s civil case against Mr. Gupta reaches into the most elite boardrooms of corporate America. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links S.E.C. order against Rajat Gupta S.E.C. statement “Mr. Gupta was honored with the highest trust of leading public companies, and he betrayed that trust by disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets,” said Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s director of enforcement, in a statement. “Directors who violate the sanctity of boardroom confidences for private gain will be held to account for their illegal actions.” The proceeding against Mr. Gupta perhaps most acutely stings Goldman, which has had at least three run-ins with the S.E.C. over the last year. Last summer, it struck a $550 million settlement with the agency over its sale of a complex mortgage investment, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. And earlier this year it canceled an opportunity for its clients to invest in Facebook because of worries that the publicity around the deal could violate S.E.C. rules. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The S.E.C. case ties Mr. Gupta to Mr. Rajaratnam, the Sri Lankan-born billionaire hedge fund manager at the center of the government’s insider trading inquiry. Mr. Rajaratnam, who is fighting the criminal charges against him, is to go on trial on Tuesday. The S.E.C. filing contends that Mr. Gupta provided details about Goldman’s financial health and plans after the collapse of Lehman Brothers rocked the financial markets. On Sept. 23, 2008, the Goldman board met via telephone to consider and approve Mr. Buffett’s $5 billion purchase of preferred shares in Goldman. “Immediately after disconnecting from the board call, Gupta called Rajaratnam from the same line,” the S.E.C. filing says. A minute later, Galleon funds bought more than more than 175,000 shares of Goldman just minutes before the market closed, the agency says. After the close, Goldman announced the investment, and its shares rallied on the vote of confidence by Mr. Buffett. The Galleon funds netted a profit of more than $900,000, the S.E.C. says. In another instance, the S.E.C. said that Mr. Gupta passed along an illegal Goldman tip to Mr. Rajaratnam after a call that previewed Goldman’s positive quarterly earnings results one week before they were publicly announced. Soon after, Mr. Gupta is said to have initiated a flurry of telephone calls with Mr. Rajaratnam, who then directed his fund to load up on Goldman stock and call options. When the stock rose the next day, Mr. Rajaratnam exited his positions and earned more than $13.6 million in profits, the S.E.C. said. Mr. Gupta is also accused of disclosing information to Mr. Rajaratnam about P.&amp; G.’s 2008 fourth-quarter earnings on the eve of their release. In the long investigation of Mr. Rajaratnam, thousands of conversations were recorded, including some with Mr. Gupta. But the S.E.C filing refers to none of those conversations. In recounting phone calls between the two men, the filing does not provide details of their content. Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, said the S.E.C. accusations were “totally baseless.” “Mr. Gupta has done nothing wrong,” he said. “There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits as part of any quid pro quo.” The case against Mr. Gupta tarnishes an otherwise sterling business career. Born in Kolkata, India, Mr. Gupta earned an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School in 1973 and joined McKinsey upon graduation. He was elected head of the consulting firm in 1994, the first non-Westerner to hold that post. Mr. Gupta, 62, met Mr. Rajaratnam, who was born in Sri Lanka, in the middle of the last decade through their work for the Indian School of Business. Mr. Gupta co-founded the school and is its chairman, and Mr. Rajaratnam was a major donor to the school. Mr. Gupta was a regular presence at Galleon’s offices at Madison Avenue and 57th Street and showed up there periodically for lunch. Mr. Rajaratnam’s secretary would order in Indian or Chinese food and the two men would sit in Mr. Rajaratnam’s office and chat, according to a former employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. In 2006, Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Gupta worked together to start New Silk Route, a private equity firm focused on investments in India. Mr. Rajaratnam never had an active role in the New Silk Route. A spokeswoman for New Silk Route declined to comment. Mr. Rajaratnam told his staff that Galleon had formally engaged McKinsey to help them better understand companies and run special projects where the fund could “do a deeper dive” into companies, the former employee said. Nothing came of the engagement, said this person. Mr. Gupta is the second McKinsey executive to be ensnared by the government’s insider-trading inquiry. Anil Kumar, a senior McKinsey executive and onetime protégé of Mr. Gupta, pleaded guilty in January to leaking confidential information about a merger to Mr. Rajaratnam and is cooperating in the criminal case against Mr. Rajaratnam. “We were saddened to learn about the civil charges against our former colleague,” said a McKinsey spokesman about Mr. Gupta, who left McKinsey in 2007. Mr. Gupta holds philanthropic posts, including a senior advisory post at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and a board seat at the Rockefeller Foundation. He lives in Westport, Conn. Mr. Gupta voluntarily resigned on Tuesday from the P.&amp;G. board, which he joined in 2007. A company spokesman said he resigned to prevent any distraction to P.&amp;G. and its board. At Goldman, Mr. Gupta said he would not stand for re-election in March 2010 and stepped down from the board in May. Mr. Gupta earned more than $2.5 million as a director at Goldman and P.&amp;G. Mr. Gupta is also a member of the board of AMR, the parent company of American Airlines. An American Airlines spokesman declined to comment. The case against Mr. Gupta has an unusual procedural twist. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the S.E.C. can seek a full range of penalties against people not employed by a financial services firm through a relatively streamlined proceeding before an S.E.C. administrative law judge. Historically, if the agency sought penalties against a public company director like Mr. Gupta, it had to sue in federal court, where the defendant has full discovery rights of the S.E.C.’s case, including all of its witnesses. Mr. Naftalis, the lawyer for Mr. Gupta, said in a statement that his client’s “40-year record of ethical conduct, integrity and commitment to guarding his clients’ confidences is beyond reproach.” He also said that Mr. Gupta lost his $10 million investment in a fund managed by Mr. Rajaratnam that collapsed during the financial crisis, “negating any motive to deviate from a lifetime of honesty and integrity.” Ben Protess contributed reporting. S.E.C. Case Against Rajat Gupta This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 3, 2011 An article on Wednesday about insider trading accusations against Rajat K. Gupta, a prominent business executive and former director of Goldman Sachs, misstated the year in which he graduated from Harvard Business School. It was 1973, not 1974. And a correction in this space on Thursday misstated part of the name of the federal agency that made the allegations against Mr. Gupta. It is the Securities and Exchange Commission, not Security and Exchange Commission.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/business/13advice.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter &amp; Gamble Advice Site Is Aimed at Men<date>Published: January 12, 2011</date><text>Hey, fellas, want to spice things up with your lady? Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products giant, has some ideas.A Web site created by the company for husbands and fathers offers articles with titles like “Conquering Sex Problems.” Among other things, the article advises men to take their time in bed. “If you want a hot woman who acts like a porn star in bed, you need to be prepared to spend some time getting her to that place,” suggests the site, ManoftheHouse.com. While the Internet is crowded with all kinds of sex advice, P.&amp; G. — the maker of Pampers and Ivory soap and the nation’s largest advertiser — says it has found an untapped marketing opportunity for its products in the family man. Much of the popular sex advice for men, in publications like Maxim and GQ, is directed toward singles on the prowl, the company says. Even its top rival, Unilever, has gone decidedly raunchier in a campaign for Axe, a grooming brand aimed at young men, that includes a double entendre about cleaning sporting equipment and a man’s private parts. The P.&amp; G. site gets out of the bedroom, offering tips on grilling burgers, cleaning toilets and disciplining children. It promises, “We’ll make men out of you yet,” while also promoting Gillette razors, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and other company products. “What we are trying to do is speak to the whole man,” said Jeannie Tharrington, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble Productions. “Certainly, relationships and sex are part of an adult man’s life.” Josh Bernoff, senior vice president at Forrester Research who has written about P.&amp; G.’s marketing efforts, said ManoftheHouse.com was not so different from “As the World Turns,” the TV soap opera that was another P.&amp; G. innovation. “This is the 21st-century version of the soap opera,” he said. “It’s information. It’s topical.” More and more big companies have discovered the how-to genre as a marketing tool. General Mills offers dieting advice and coupons on Tablespoon.com, and Wal-Mart has a Web site in which mothers blog about everything from being frugal to reviewing products. Jeremiah Owyang, a partner at the Altimeter Group, a digital strategy consulting firm, said company-generated lifestyle sites could be effective as long as they did not push the brands too hard. Reviewing the homepage of ManoftheHouse.com, he said, “All of these discussions on this page are already happening on Facebook,” he said. “The reason these things do work is that consumers are already having these discussions, having a healthy breakfast, talking about their wives in relationships.” Ms. Tharrington said company research found that men were going to women’s Web sites to find information on recipes, cleaning the house or getting a stain out of a shirt. As for sex talk coming from a company that has honed a wholesome image — remember Mr. Whipple? — she said, “For us, it’s part of it, but it’s not the whole thing. What we try to do is be tasteful.” Procter &amp; Gamble has a long history of unusual marketing. The Cincinnati-based company created one of the first radio soap operas as a way to market its products, and years later it created its own soap operas, including “As the World Turns,” for television. In the last decade, Procter &amp; Gamble was one of the pioneers in word-of-mouth marketing campaigns in which mothers and teenagers were plied with samples and coupons to draw more customers. In 2000, the company introduced Beinggirl.com, which provides information and expert advice on issues that teenage girls might be too embarrassed to ask a parent or a doctor about, like menstruation, eating disorders, acne and dating. The site also advertises P.&amp; G. tampons and offers free samples. In the years since Beinggirl.com was created, Procter &amp; Gamble has started several other lifestyle Web sites, including one that is directed at women, Homemadesimple.com. David Germano, the general manager of ManoftheHouse.com, said consumer data showed that 10 percent of the visitors to the women’s site were men. ManoftheHouse.com has brought on several writers who had established father-focused blogs. Karl Withakay, a Utah-based singer and songwriter who writes some of the sex articles, including “Conquering Sex Problems,” was already writing about relationships for other media outlets. “The pieces he wrote were based upon his own experience,” said Craig J. Heimbuch, ManoftheHouse.com’s editor in chief, in an e-mail. “I appreciate his perspective a great deal. It lends itself well to the tone of the site, which is men helping men.” So are men drawn to a PG-rated Web site when so much R- and X-rated competition is out there? Procter &amp; Gamble says that so far it is pleased with the number of visitors. The site was started in June, and by December it had topped a half a million monthly unique visitors. By comparison, AskMen.com, a site with similar, if more titillating content, had 5.5 million unique visitors in December, according to comScore, the market research firm. Jonah Disend, chief executive of the brand strategy firm Redscout, questioned whether ManoftheHouse.com would generate a big following. He said men tended to be more interested in specialized publications about a specific hobby or sport. “Just because no one’s doing it doesn’t mean there’s a real market for it,” he said. Racy also works. Indeed, that is just what Procter &amp; Gamble’s archrival, Unilever, discovered in its efforts to market Axe. The campaign it started last year, which included the double entendre, has become a sensation; last month, Zeta Interactive proclaimed the ads as having received the most social media buzz in 2010. “We’ve taken a calculated risk,” said Heather Mitchell, a Unilever spokeswoman, “knowing what resonates with our guys.”</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/sports/golf/24sportsbriefs-WOODSOUTASGI_BRF.html?ref=procterandgamble">Woods Out as Gillette Endorser<date>Published: December 24, 2010</date><text>Procter &amp; Gamble said it would not renew its endorsement deal with Tiger Woods after the end of the year.

Having persuaded Americans to buy synthetic laundry detergent, fluorinated toothpaste and disposable diapers, P.&amp; G. believes it has finally cracked the code on the dry cleaning business, too. Where other dry cleaning entrepreneurs have tried to come up with clever business models for dry cleaning, P.&amp; G.’s primary innovation is in the brand name itself: Tide Dry Cleaners, named after its best-selling laundry detergent. With more than 800,000 Facebook fans and legions of loyal customers, Tide will draw people into the franchise stores, and superior service — which includes drive-through service, 24-hour pickup and cleaning methods it markets as environmentally safer — will keep them coming back, company officials predict. “The power of our brands represents disruptive innovation in these industries,” said Nathan Estruth, vice president for FutureWorks, P.&amp; G.’s entrepreneurial arm. “Imagine getting to start my new business with the power of Tide.” And the lure of its fragrance. P.&amp; G. plans to infuse the stores and its dry cleaning fluids with the scent of the brand that’s been cozily familiar to generations of households. Among the Tide believers is Rick DeAngelis, a 40-year-old who is planning to open a franchise in suburban Cincinnati next year. “It’s been a trusted name in laundry for 60 years,” he said. “It’s almost synonymous with laundry.” Already, some local dry cleaners are complaining about the new gorilla on the block, backed by a corporation with roughly $80 billion in annual net sales. Robert Tran, who owns Monroe Dry Cleaning here in Mason, said his business was off more than 50 percent since a new Tide store opened down the street at the end of October. Customers are being drawn to the Tide store by discounts and giveaways, like P.&amp; G. products and gift cards, he said. “There is no way I can afford that,” he said. “All my customers just left without giving me a chance to say, ‘Hey, check the quality.’ ” But for Tide to become synonymous with dry cleaning too, P.&amp; G. will have to overcome problems that have undone other upstarts. The dry cleaning industry has been roiled by unemployment and economic woes, and hurt by a continuing trend toward more casual work clothes. Competition is fierce, and customers can be prickly: woe to the dry cleaner that ruins a favorite dress, even if it was cheaply made and bought decades ago. Sanjiv Mehra, who oversaw a short-lived effort by Unilever to break into the dry cleaning business about a decade ago, said the key to success was figuring out a way to do it cheaper or significantly better than the mom-and-pop stores that dominate the industry. At the end of the day, Unilever decided that it couldn’t do either. “It comes back to, are you fundamentally changing the economics of the business?” he said, adding that P.&amp; G.’s marketing muscle could be the difference. “That’s where they will make a lot of money if they do this right.” Payam Zamani, co-founder of Autoweb.com, a site for car buyers, who later founded PurpleTie dry cleaners, said he tried to do for dry cleaning what Blockbuster did for video stores, offering efficient and better quality than neighborhood dry cleaners. He said it was hard for his stores to compete with owner-operated stores with little overhead and low-wage employees. “People were more interested in cheaper service, not better service,” Mr. Zamani said. P.&amp; G. has dabbled in dry cleaning before. In the late 1990s it introduced Dryel, an at-home dry cleaning product that rattled local dry cleaners, who feared they would lose business. But Dryel was considered a disappointment, and P.&amp; G. sold it in 2008. In 2000, it opened several stores in suburban Atlanta, called Juvian, that offered at-home pickup and delivery of laundry and dry cleaning. The stores were eventually closed. The idea for Tide Dry Cleaners came from P.&amp; G.’s FutureWorks, a unit that comes up with ways to expand famous brands like Pampers, Oil of Olay and Crest. Many of those brands are experiencing robust growth in developing markets, but finding new ways to increase revenue in saturated markets like the United States is more challenging. Four years ago, FutureWorks began considering franchise opportunities, looking for industries where ownership was fragmented and consumers weren’t satisfied. It came up with a three-inch binder of ideas. The first one to get a green light? Car washes festooned with Mr. Clean, P.&amp; G.’s popular cleaning product. There are now 16 Mr. Clean Car Washes, including one here in Mason that includes Wi-Fi, televisions and spray guns that children can aim at cars passing through the wash. Of course, Mr. Clean products are for sale too.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/02/fashion/02SKINDEEP.html?ref=procterandgamble">Finding Elusive Bars of Camay Soap<date>Published: November 30, 2010</date><text>MY mother discovered Camay soap 64 years ago, when she immigrated to New York from London at the end of World War II after marrying my father, an American soldier. She has seen much change in her 86 years, but her devotion to Camay has remained constant.When she recently realized that her local ShopRite, in Plainview, N.Y., no longer stocks Camay, and that she has only eight bars left in her linen closet, she called me in, well, a bit of a lather. “What am I going to do?” she asked me. “What am I going to do?” I went online to do some research and found that my mother wasn’t the only woman desperately seeking Camay. On Amazon.com this week, Camay was selling by the case, like a particularly sought-after wine: 48 bars for more than $50. “I have been looking all over for Camay soap,” one customer wrote. “I was afraid I would never wash again.” “Memory bars is what I call them,” wrote another. Procter &amp; Gamble introduced Camay in the United States in 1926 as “the soap of beautiful women.” The original wrapper featured a cameo of an elegant lady, her silhouette in profile. Advertising campaigns focused on young brides marveling at their soft complexions. Camay evoked feminine luxury, even sensuality, at a time when other soaps like Ivory were utilitarian. Camay was still popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Tish Stoker Signet, 58, a psychotherapist in Davidson, N.C., remembers that, as a child, she and her mother would paint the soaps’ cameo imprints gold, then give them as sachets to older women at Christmas. But by the turn of the 21st century, Camay, pink and lightly perfumed, had lost its mass appeal in the United States. Procter &amp; Gamble now sells Camay to online distributors and abroad, mostly in Eastern Europe, though it may also still be available in some mainstream stores in the United States, said Kate DiCarlo, a spokeswoman. These days, the company is more focused on its Olay bars, which compete directly with the Dove Beauty Bar, made by Unilever. These products contain synthetic detergents that are less irritating than soap, said Dr. Amy Derick, a dermatologist in Barrington, Ill. But Camay, which is a traditional soap like Ivory, may feel less irritating because it contains glycerin, Dr. Derick added. Still, for a certain vintage of American woman, Camay soap remains a cultural touchstone. “I love the perfume smell,” said Billie Brown of Cove, Tex., who declined to give her age. “It’s lightly fragrant. It’s totally feminine.” Ms. Brown remembered her mother setting out the Camay on the bathtub of her childhood home near Lake Charles, La.. Because the soap disappeared from her Kroger supermarket, she now buys it online. At CleaningProductsWorld.com, based in Norwich, Conn., Camay accounts for more than half of bar-soap sales, said Jessica Fischburg, the company’s e-commerce manager. She said no other beauty product sold on the site inspired such loyalty. “If you’ve used just one soap for 50 years, you identify that one soap with cleanliness,” said Ms. Fischburg, 24. Linda Eshleman, 62, of Jersey Shore, Pa., buys Camay online and goes through about a bar a week. “No matter where I go, it always goes with me,” Ms. Eshleman said. Nancy Durbin, 69, who lives in Houston, recently bought a case of Camay as a Christmas present for her older sister in Cincinnati. “When you get to be my age, and her age, products start disappearing,” Ms. Durbin said. Chris T. Allen, a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati, predicted that Camay could have a second act if it follows the lead of another Procter &amp; Gamble brand, Old Spice. That went from being an old man’s after-shave to a hip young man’s deodorant and body wash, thanks largely to this year’s advertising and viral-video campaign, “Smell Like a Man, Man,” featuring Isaiah Mustafa. Prell shampoo, a former Procter &amp; Gamble brand now owned by Ultimark Products, is also trying to remake its image. Ultimark recently signed Alexa Ray Joel, the daughter of Christie Brinkley, the model, and Billy Joel, the singer, to be the new face of Prell. (Ms. Brinkley was a “Prell Girl” in the 1980s.) “There’s a strong theme of nostalgia,” Mr. Allen said, talking about consumers: “If these are brands they used when they were younger, you never lose interest.” My mother, a brand loyalist, has used the same kind of Rimmel mascara for over seven decades, and visited the same hairstylist for more than 40 years. She says she chose Camay 64 years ago not for its status as a beauty totem, but because it was the only soap that didn’t irritate her skin. Only a few weeks ago, a man half her age admired her youthful looks and kissed her on the cheek. Although she doesn’t own a computer and is wary of new technology (she calls the Internet the “Yenta-net”), she will go there if she has to. “O.K.,” she said. “Buy me a case of Camay online.” When she heard how many bars she’d receive, she thought back to 1946, when she’d buy Camay at a drugstore on Amsterdam Avenue, one precious bar at a time.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/business/media/18adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Art of Shaving Promoted as a Brotherhood Brand - Advertising<date>Published: November 17, 2010</date><text>“REPEAT after us,” begins a new print ad by the Art of Shaving, an upscale brand of products that includes shaving cream for $22 and shaving brushes for as much as $600. “I will not let my son shave with a plastic razor.” The ad, like several in the new campaign, concludes with the tagline, “Welcome to the brotherhood of shaving.”Although the brand is 14 years old and is sold in 43 Art of Shaving stores in the United States as well as in department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Neiman Marcus, this national advertising campaign is its first. The ads, by BBDO New York, part of the Omnicom Group, first appeared in Grand Central Terminal this month and will run in the December issues of men’s magazines like Esquire, GQ and Details.  The consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble bought the Art of Shaving in a 2009 acquisition that, along with its purchase of Gillette in 2005, reflects that the company, which in the past marketed products almost exclusively to women, is now pitching to men, too. “When we acquired Gillette, that was entirely the company’s desire, to play in the ‘he’ space as well as the ‘she’ space,” said Damon Jones, a Procter &amp; Gamble spokesman. “If we are going to win with men, we have to be serious about them.” Mr. Jones declined to reveal how much was being spent on the campaign for the Art of Shaving. Gillette, which also makes deodorant and other products, spent $185.7 million on advertising in 2009, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. The market for men’s shaving and skin care products has doubled over 12 years, to $4.8 billion in 2009 from $2.4 billion in 1997, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. What’s known in the industry as the prestige channel, which includes brands like the Art of Shaving that are sold by upscale retailers, is also growing, in spite of the economic downturn. From Jan. 1 to Oct. 10, sales of men’s prestige skin care products totaled almost $53 million, a 5 percent increase from the same period in 2009, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Myriam Zaoui and Eric Malka, who are married, were in their 20s and first dating in New York in 1995 when Ms. Zaoui, working as an aesthetician doing facials at a day spa, grew concerned about the shaving irritation Mr. Malka was experiencing. It was bad enough that he took to shaving at night in the hope that the redness would disappear by morning. Ms. Zaoui, who grew up in Paris, recalled that her father had the same problem and had applied Johnson’s Baby Oil before applying shaving cream, to ease irritation. Rather than suggest that, she formulated a preshave oil that contained botanical extracts and essential oils. The concoction let Mr. Malka enjoy an irritation-free shave. In 1996, suspecting that men would pay a premium for a better shave, the couple opened their first Art of Shaving store, on the Upper East Side. Today, about half of the company’s stores offer shaving services, and Mr. Malka said that both barbers and sales clerks reinforced the approach that every shave required four steps: prepare (with a preshave oil), lather (with cream and a brush), shave and moisturize (with after-shave balm). “The more that we presented the four elements as one system, the more that consumers came on board with the system and the faster the company grew,” Mr. Malka said. Kits containing toiletries for all four steps, some with razors and shaving brushes as well, account for 30 percent of revenue. In his book, “Accidental Branding,” David Vinjamuri includes a chapter about the Art of Shaving. The book explains how the brand capitalized on the metrosexual trend popularized about a decade ago, when more men began to acknowledge exfoliating, while steering clear of the metrosexual reaction that ridiculed primping as unmanly. “The genius insight behind the Art of Shaving as a brand,” Mr. Vinjamuri wrote, in describing both the design of the first store and the brand generally, “was to infuse the grooming practices of the metrosexual movement with a deeply masculine flavor taken from traditional English barbering shops.” While women may compliment one another on lipstick or recommend a nail polish, “the topic of shaving isn’t something that guys are sitting around a bar talking to each other about,” said Mr. Jones, of Procter &amp; Gamble. While the tone of the new Art of Shaving ads, with copy like “Repeat after us: I will resist the urge to bring my shaving brush out at parties,” is tongue-in-cheek, the overall brotherhood theme tries to “create a comfortable space for men to talk to each other and to trusted experts” about shaving, said Mr. Jones.  Mr. Vinjamuri said in an interview that the Art of Shaving was an “insider brand,” meaning that it was favored by consumers who prided themselves on being in the know, and who looked askance at products they deemed too mainstream. “I think it’s quite a good creative hook to think of it as a ‘brotherhood of shaving,’ ” he said, “because the only way to be introduced into a brotherhood is by a brother.” He also said Procter &amp; Gamble, which typically advertises on television, was wise to limit the campaign primarily to men’s magazines, because a television campaign could dilute the insider mystique of the brand. “I certainly wouldn’t want to see this on TV, but I like it in print,” Mr. Vinjamuri said. “It feels to me like the kind of thing you want to see when you’re sort of in the company of men, and you feel like that when you’re reading Details or GQ.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/28procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter &amp; Gamble Profit Falls but Forecast Rises<date>Published: October 27, 2010</date><text>Procter &amp; Gamble is slowly luring back consumers to its big brands, while attracting new buyers around the globe by getting more products into emerging markets like India and China.The company, whose brands include Pantene shampoo and Pampers diapers, said Wednesday that revenue grew nearly 2 percent on high volumes in its latest quarter, and it forecast growing sales for the rest of the year. More spending on advertising and innovation in high and low price ranges are helping P.&amp; G. fight frugal shoppers’ inclinations to buy cheaper store brands and to reach more of the world’s newer consumers. P.&amp; G. reported that net income was $3.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, down from $3.3 billion, or $1.06 a year ago. Sales rose nearly 2 percent to $20.1 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected, on average, $1 a share on revenue of $20.2 billion for the July to September quarter. “We aren’t going to make any excuses for the macroenvironment like the one we’re in,” Robert A. McDonald, chairman and chief executive, told reporters on a conference call. “We see it as an opportunity to continue to invest and grow market share profitably.” Mr. McDonald said sales of the new Gillette Fusion ProGlide, introduced in June, were strong despite its 15 percent higher price. They said it is handily outselling the previous Fusion and the rival Schick. Olay skin cream and other beauty products aimed at women buyers also sold more, although higher-end salon and prestige brands lagged. P.&amp; G. said the year-to-year net income difference was mainly a result of the absence of its pharmaceutical business, sold last October for $3.1 billion to Warner Chilcott as part of the company’s strategy to focus on products with the best growth and profit prospects. Organic sales, a crucial measure that excludes the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and currency changes, rose 4 percent in the quarter. The company projects them to rise 3 to 5 percent in the current quarter and 4 to 6 percent for the full year. P.&amp; G. shares rose 22 cents to close at $63.08. For the year, the company expects earnings of $3.91 to $4.01 a share, and says the current quarter should produce earnings of $1.05 to $1.11. Analysts expect full-year earnings of $3.97 a share, and $1.11 for the quarter.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/11/business/media/11adnewsletter1.html?ref=procterandgamble">‘Ghost’ Brands Come Alive With New Ads<date>Published: October 11, 2010</date><text>It is just a coincidence that as Halloween nears, two “ghost” brands are getting their first new campaigns in years.The brands are the Pert Plus line of hair care products and the Sure line of antiperspirants and deodorants, both sold by the Idelle Labs division of Helen of Troy Ltd. The campaign is composed of television commercials and print advertisements, all created by a New York agency known as the Madison Avenue Consortium. Idelle is spending an estimated $10 million to $15 million on each of the two campaigns. According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, there has been no ad spending in major media for either brand so far this year — none, in fact, since 2007. That paucity of ad support is typical of ghost brands, called that because they have become ghosts of their former, successful selves as they were overshadowed by newer products or overlooked when their owners changed focus or changed hands. They are still sold, but have usually been banished to the bottom shelves of stores, near the floors. Among the wraiths of the supermarket and drug store aisles, in addition to Pert Plus and Sure, are once-familiar household names like Aim, Aqua Velva, Armour, Barbasol, Biz, Breck, Brylcreem, Camay, Close-Up, Comet, Duncan Hines, Fab, Lava, Log Cabin, My-T-Fine, Oxydol, Parkay, Pepsodent, Prell, Schlitz, Spic and Span, Tab and Vitalis. In many instances, the parents of ghost brands sell them to concentrate attention and resources on larger brands with stronger vital signs. Companies have been formed that specialize in trying to revive those corporate cast-offs, among them the aptly named Phoenix Brands, Prestige Brands and Idelle, which owns, in addition to Pert Plus and Sure, ghostly products like Ammens, Brut, Final Net, Sea Breeze and Vitalis. The economic woes of the last three years have encouraged some marketers to take another look at faded brands to see if they can be revived or renewed. The idea is that it can be less expensive to stimulate consumer memories of once-famous products, which had been backed with considerable ad budgets, than to spend enormous sums to introduce all-new products. In fact, that was a reason Helen of Troy acquired Pert Plus and Sure in the spring and added them to the Idelle Labs offerings. The products were bought from Innovative Brands, which acquired them from Procter &amp; Gamble in 2006. Helen of Troy has another Procter connection: Last year, the company made a deal with Procter to buy the Infusium 23 line of hair care products, which is also now part of the Idelle lineup. The goal is to determine if “there is something still within the brand proposition that can resonate with today’s consumers,” says Rick Cutler, director for marketing at Idelle in Danbury, Conn. The way to do that is to “dig into the inherent drama still within these brands and reconnect with lapsed users,” he adds, as well as shoppers who were young when the products were in their heydays. The checklist is to “re-establish the brand name,” Mr. Cutler says, “link the brand to its benefits and establish personalities for two brands that, frankly, were devoid of personalities for years.” To be sure, “there are no guarantees,” he acknowledges, but if the right criteria can be met ghost brands can be returned to “real positive growth.” The drama that Idelle considers to be inherent in both Pert Plus and Sure is their identities as effective, no-nonsense products for busy people that do what they promise with a minimum of bother. For Pert Plus, it stems from its nature as a two-in-one hair care product — that is, the shampoo and conditioner are combined in the same bottle. “I am not going to convince someone who is, for lack of a better descriptor, ‘hair-involved’ that a two-in-one is going to work for them,” Mr. Cutler says, but such a product is appealing to a consumer whose attitude is: “Let me get into the shower and get out of the shower quickly, and still have great hair.” So the campaign is aimed at the women who buy hair care products for their families, telling them that a down-to-earth, get-it-done product like Pert Plus is appealing to their husbands and useful for their children. An announcer in a commercial featuring a mother, a father and three children (two boys and a girl) declares Pert Plus is “for hair that’s all plus and no fuss.” The “two-in-one shampoo and conditioner cares as it cleans,” the announcer says as the father and children are seen having fun together, “to turn any hair into great hair.” “Pert Plus makes everyone’s hair a plus,” she continues, “and we’re all about accentuating the positives.” (Somewhere, Johnny Mercer is smiling.) The spot concludes with this advice: “Bring out the plus in your hair with Pert Plus.” Those points are echoed in the text of a print ad, which also offers additional selling points like the product’s ability to work “quickly and easily” and how it “rinses away fast.” These words appear at the bottom of the print ad: “Find out what all the Plus is about. Go to pertplus.com.” Likewise, Mr. Cutler says, Sure is bought by consumers who “just want deodorant to do its job.” “They don’t want to see it, feel it, smell it,” he adds. “They just want trusted protection.” That provides the approach for the campaign for Sure, which carries the theme “Be 100 percent Sure.” “Accept nothing less than 100 percent protection,” an announcer says, declaring that Sure gives “unstoppable wetness protection and unbeatable odor protection.” “When you need to go the extra mile, Sure offers unconditional protection you can rely on,” he says. “So all day you’re superprotected for anything that comes your way.” That is underscored with the presence of a superhero behind a package of Sure that dominates the commercial. The superhero, wearing a cape, takes flight as the announcer wraps up his spiel.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/science/earth/19clean.html?ref=procterandgamble">Cleaner for the Environment, Not for the Dishes<date>Published: September 18, 2010</date><text>Some longtime users were furious.“My dishes were dirtier than before they were washed,” one wrote last week in the review section of the Web site for the Cascade line of dishwasher detergents. “It was horrible, and I won’t buy it again.” “This is the worst product ever made for use as a dishwashing detergent!” another consumer wrote. Like every other major detergent for automatic dishwashers, Procter &amp; Gamble’s Cascade line recently underwent a makeover. Responding to laws that went into effect in 17 states in July, the nation’s detergent makers reformulated their products to reduce what had been the crucial ingredient, phosphates, to just a trace. While phosphates help prevent dishes from spotting in the wash cycle, they have long ended up in lakes and reservoirs, stimulating algae growth that deprives other plants and fish of oxygen. Yet now, with the content reduced, many consumers are finding the new formulas as appealing as low-flow showers, underscoring the tradeoffs that people often face today in a more environmentally conscious marketplace. From hybrid cars to solar panels, environmentally friendly alternatives can cost more. They can be less convenient, like toting cloth sacks or canteens rather than plastic bags or bottled water. And they can prove less effective, like some of the new cleaning products. “Most Americans want to do things that are good for the environment, but not everyone wants to pay the price,” said Elke U. Weber, director of the Center for Research on Environmental Decisions at Columbia University. In the world of cleaning agents, where chemicals and fragrances can pose respiratory and allergy problems as well as pollute waterways, the environmental benefits of the switch are clear. Yet the new products can run up against longtime habits and even cultural concepts of cleanliness. Phosphorus in the form of phosphates suspends particles so they do not stick to dishes and softens water to allow suds to form. Now that the content in dishwasher detergent has plummeted to 0.5 percent from as high as 8.7 percent, many consumers are just noticing the change in the wash cycle as they run out of the old product. “Low-phosphate dish detergents are a waste of my money,” said Thena Reynolds, a 55-year-old homemaker from Van Zandt County, Tex., who said she ran her dishwasher twice a day for a family of five. Now she has to do a quick wash of the dishes before she puts them in the dishwasher to make sure they come out clean, she said. “If I’m using more water and detergent, is that saving anything?” Ms. Reynolds said. “There has to be a happy medium somewhere.” Similarly, a nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., that helps women form environmentally minded cooperatives and trains house cleaners, says their employers have often resisted switching to the new cleaning products. “There’s the myth that to be clean it has to shine or smell or make a lot of bubbles,” said Ivette Melendez, one of the trainers for the group, Women’s Action to Gain Economic Security. She says products like vinegar, baking soda or the newer cleansers work just as well as traditional items if applied in the proper mix and quantities. But Jessica Fischburg, a commerce manager in Norwich, Conn., for CleaningProductsWorld.com, which sells janitorial supplies in bulk, said she was not surprised that many of her clients rejected products marketed as environmentally friendly. “The reality of any green product is that they generally don’t work as well,” she said. “Our customers really don’t like them.” But some users attest to quantifiable benefits. Reports of burns, rashes, dizziness and scratchy throats among housekeeping employees have plummeted at North Central Bronx Hospital and Jacobi Medical Center since the staff switched to new cleaning products in 2004, said Peter Lucey, an associate executive director for support services at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. The number of lost days linked to injuries from the products declined from 54 in 2004 to zero last year, he said. “It’s the switch and the training,” Mr. Lucey said. In the case of the new dishwasher detergents, the main benefit is viewed as the protection of bodies of freshwater. Once they go down the drain and into the environment through discharge at sewage treatment plants, phosphates end up in lakes, streams and drinking-water reservoirs. Phosphorus pollution comes from multiple sources, including fertilizer and manure that enter the water through runoff. Dishwasher detergents contribute just a fraction, but environmental campaigners say any reduction can result in a tangible improvements. (Laundry detergents and hand soaps are already free of phosphates.) The first significant regulatory rumblings came in Washington State in 2006. As more and more states followed suit, manufacturers faced the prospect of uneven laws that could disrupt retail distribution nationwide, said Dennis Griesing, vice president for government affairs at the American Cleaning Institute, which represents the cleaning product industry. The nationwide product rollover began late last year. Industry officials generally insist that most customers have not noticed a change. But in its September issue, Consumer Reports reported that of 24 low- or phosphate-free dishwasher detergents it tested, including those from environmentally friendly product lines that have been on the market for years, none matched the performance of products with phosphates. The magazine did note that the formulas were improving, and it rated seven detergents “very good,” including two of six Cascade products it tested. Susan Baba, a spokeswoman for Cascade, said that while most Cascade customers had not noticed any change, Procter &amp; Gamble was modifying the formulas of some products in response to complaints. “As we learn more, we’re finding out that there’s a lot more variation than we saw in the labs,” she said. Ms. Baba added that the conversion to low-phosphate content had been complex, with three or four ingredients needed to match what the phosphates accomplished alone. Elise Jones, a 32-year-old mother of two in Chatham, N.J., and a blog editor for Babybites, a group for new and expectant mothers, said she noticed “a white dusty film” on her dishes and children’s cups starting about a month ago. “I thought it was the dishwasher,” she said, before she heard of the change in formulas. All the same, she agrees with the restrictions on phosphates because “we all worry about our water supply.” Washing the dishes entirely by hand is not necessarily better for the environment, experts say, because people tend to let the tap run even when they are not rinsing. So Mrs. Jones now rinses them all by hand after the wash cycle, trying to economize on water so that her rinsing can match the dishwasher’s efficiency. “You try to do things as consciously as you can,” she said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/business/media/03adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Febreze Air Freshener Takes Aim at Football Moms<date>Published: September 2, 2010</date><text>SOME brands that are official sponsors of the National Football League could be construed to reinforce stereotypes about male fans, whether it’s that they swill beer (Coors), laze on the couch eating pizza and snacks (Papa John’s, Frito-Lay), or overindulge (Prilosec heartburn medication).But Febreze has become the “Official Air Freshener of the N.F.L.,” raising questions that may reflect well on men. Is it the prevailing view on Madison Avenue, for example, that men today are contributing more to housework and should be sold household products? Is the consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Febreze, shifting away from its strategy of marketing home care products almost exclusively to women? Were the willow blossom and pomegranate mango Febreze scents formulated specifically to appeal to male N.F.L. fans? The answers: No, no and no. It turns out that the Febreze N.F.L. marketing is directed at women, and if there is one gender stereotype being debunked, it’s that women are not football fans. A new television commercial for Febreze by Grey New York, part of the Grey Group unit of WPP, features a woman in a football jersey spraying her living room with Febreze. “Earlier today your living room was game day central — a place for friends, family and your husband’s trademark victory dance,” says a voiceover, as attendees are seen celebrating. “Now the crowd is gone and all that remains is the stink. But you’re ready, because Febreze Air Effects cleans away tough game-day odors in the air — sweat socks, chicken wings, garlic dip — and leaves a light, fresh scent.” For the 2009 season, female television viewers constituted 33 percent of the average N.F.L. game audience, according to Nielsen. Super Bowl XLIV in February attracted 41.9 million female viewers, more than the entire adult audience for the Academy Awards the following month. And 35 percent of the adults who attended N.F.L. games in the last 12 months were women, according to Scarborough Research, a market research firm. The Febreze sponsorship began last year, as part of a deal between the N.F.L. and several Procter &amp; Gamble brands, including Head &amp; Shoulders, Gillette, Old Spice and Vicks. Scott Beal, brand manager for Febreze, said the line of air and fabric fresheners was directed at women, especially mothers, and that the brand “reaches our core consumer in a contextually relevant way” through the N.F.L. “Our female target audience is watching the N.F.L. and gathering her family and friends for that football-watching experience,” Mr. Beal said. “Often when that happens, there’s food and there’s a crowded room and odors can be there, and that’s not the experience you want to have.” Febreze spent $81.5 million on advertising in 2009, according Kantar Media, a subsidiary of WPP. Introduced in 1999 as a fabric spray for items that could not be laundered, Febreze expanded into air fresheners in 2004. It had an 86 percent share of the fabric freshener market in the United States in 2009, and its share of the air freshener market grew to 12.1 percent in 2009 from 1.6 percent in 2004, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm. Mr. Beal said men were a “subtarget” for marketing of Febreze Sport, which was introduced last year and claims to “neutralize sweat odors” from shoes and sports equipment. The spray, ads for which began appearing last year in Men’s Health magazine, is being stocked in the lockers of N.F.L. players, and last season it was often glimpsed in locker room interviews on ESPN, Mr. Beal added. Women tend to use air fresheners more for ambiance, and men more for odor elimination, according to a report by Mintel, a market research company. “Men are more likely than women to use unscented air fresheners, indicating that they prefer to get rid of unpleasant smells rather than adding a new smell to the home,” Mintel wrote. Peter O’Reilly, vice president for brand strategy and marketing for the N.F.L., said “Our fan base has been pretty darn significant on the female side for a while, and it’s continuing to grow.” Mr. O’Reilly said the league has worked to “debunk the stereotype” that women are not fans and to pique their interest by, for instance, selecting the singer Taylor Swift to perform during a pregame show for the season opener on Sept. 9. The league has worked with apparel makers to promote better-fitting N.F.L. team shirts for women. An ad campaign for a product line called Touch by Alyssa Milano features slogans like “Finally. Love Your Team Without Looking Like You’re On It.” Reebok, in collaboration with the league, last year introduced a line of N.F.L. team maternity shirts — and matching infant onesies — printed with sayings like “Mom’s Tiny Kicker.” A customized Febreze bus will visit football stadiums throughout the season in what the brand is calling the Febreze Game Day Freshness tour. Olivia Manning is a spokeswoman for the tour, including the first stop in her hometown of New Orleans on Sept. 9. Two of her sons are N.F.L. quarterbacks, Peyton for the Indianapolis Colts and Eli for the New York Giants, and her husband, Archie, is a former N.F.L. quarterback as well. Ms. Manning said in an interview by phone that when it came to football, the smell of success was often anything but sweet. “I wish I had Febreze when my boys were coming home with their smelly gear,” she said. On the bus tour and in videos on the Febreze Web site and Facebook page, Ms. Manning will share game-day hosting tips and recipes rather than dwelling solely on olfactory matters. “I’m not an actor,” she said. “I’m really just an N.F.L. mom and wife talking about game day.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/business/04procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter &amp; Gamble Posts Lower Profit as Marketing Costs Offset Sales Growth<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>The household products maker Procter &amp; Gamble posted lower-than-expected profit on Tuesday as higher spending on marketing more than offset sales growth.Procter said investment in products released this year, including Pampers Dry Max diapers, the Fusion ProGlide razor and Crest 3D White tooth-whitening strips, outpaced a 5 percent growth in net sales. “Next year is another big year of innovation for us, and we’ll be investing behind that,” the chief financial officer, Jon R. Moeller, said in a conference call with reporters. Profit for the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter fell to $2.19 billion, or 71 cents a share, from $2.47 billion, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended June 30, rose 5 percent to $18.93 billion. Net income fell short of the 73 cents a share expected by analysts, and Procter &amp; Gamble shares fell $2.12, or 3.4 percent, to $59.94. The company forecast first-quarter earnings of 97 cents to $1.01 a share and said sales were expected to grow by 3 to 5 percent. Unfavorable currency exchange rates are expected to reduce net sales growth by about 3 percent. Analysts had expected first-quarter earnings of $1.04 a share.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/magazine/01fob-consumed-t.html?ref=procterandgamble">Making a Statement with Designer Diapers<date>Published: July 30, 2010</date><text>When I heard that Huggies had begun to sell a “limited-edition jeans diaper,” and that its bigger rival Pampers was offering a new diaper line carrying the imprimatur of the fashion designer Cynthia Rowley, it struck me as a throwback. Could there be a more absurd example of the sort of mindless conspicuous consumption that marked the years before “credit default swap” entered the national vocabulary? I seem to remember a lot of declarations that the urge to buy anything signaling nonthrifty behavior had been left behind as decisively as a house with an upside-down mortgage. Even TV commercials said so!But upon further reflection, it’s a little too simple to conclude that designer diapers signal the return of the splurgy ’00s. An ad for the Huggies jeans diapers — obviously they’re not really denim, just a denim-suggesting pattern — pokes goofy fun at fashion tropes: women peep over their trendy shades to glimpse at a stylish player who turns out to be diapered child, pimp-rolling in slow motion to his convertible. A Euro-voice coos over an electro soundtrack, “My diaper is full — full of chic.” It’s parody, except the product is real, and really does cost more than standard diapers — 40 percent more, according to a Los Angeles Times “parentology” blogger who reported that the product was selling out in some stores and than an “online frenzy” was under way. Rowley’s Pampers line, devised in conjunction with her ongoing relationship with Target, offers a more straight-faced rationale for setting aside tightwad habits to pay more for the very finest in things that will be soiled with excrement and thrown away. According to an official Pampers announcement: “The diaper collection, which will be available in pastel designs including madras, stripes and printed ruffles suited specifically to babies and toddlers” — not to teenagers or the middle-aged, you understand — “delivers the perfect blend of utility and aesthetics.” The same document quotes Rowley: “As a mom, I wanted other moms and dads to have more options in every part of their lives — even diapers. It’s the first piece of clothing your baby will ever wear, and it should be special.” Maybe you think that one thing America consumer culture had successfully delivered to its moms and dads was a sufficient number of options, or maybe you don’t think of diapers as clothing. If that’s your reaction, you’re missing the point, just as I was. Designer diapers do not portend widespread return of pre-recession overspending habits. Most of us are going to need something more convincing than economists’ declarations to persuade us that the recession has ended in the face of all the bleak news about jobs, income and debt. But even in penny-pinching times, parents still want to demonstrate how well (or at least tastefully) they are bringing up baby. Designer diapers are a useful tool for sending that message. And perhaps more to the point, they are also an extension of the well-established tendency among contemporary parents to treat their children as identity props. And it’s plausible that this version of that behavior says something about this specific cultural moment. For years, we’ve seen youngsters in luxury-brand outfits (if not in real life, then at least in magazine ads, where they often look distinctly insolent). Similarly, the onesie has long since been converted into a wearable billboard for parental taste, a means of swaddling infants in visual endorsements of the Ramones, the Yankees, Sarah Palin and any number of other things that a budding human does not yet understand. And it has been a couple of years at least since I marveled to a friend about tiny Timberland boots on the feet of beings as yet unable to walk, and she patiently explained to me that the concept of a fashion-aware baby was both funny and pleasing. If that is so, then clearly there’s no reason not to extend the general idea to diapers. Especially, perhaps, now. Surely there are those among us with the means to reclaim flashier pre-recession behaviors — back before the president called upon us to “set aside childish things” — yet remain squeamish about doing so. Why not satisfy the urge by putting your baby in a top-notch diaper? I have to admit, though, that this development makes me sad. One of the few genuinely charming things about infants, in my view, is their indifference to, and indeed ignorance of, the identity projection and status signaling that will soon enough complicate their lives. Do we really want the burden of society’s designer desires being newly borne by the newly born? I don’t think so. Moreover, the disposable diaper seems like a particularly unfortunate vehicle for identity signaling, given its status as a longstanding bugaboo of many environmental crusaders disturbed by our throwaway culture. It’s a regular tactic of the eco-concerned to prod us to imagine a future in which our children ask us, “As the evidence mounted that the way we live might not be sustainable, what did you do?” In this case the answer would be, “We bought you some trendy diapers, and baby, you looked fantastic.”</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/business/26recall.html?ref=procterandgamble">Iams Prescription Cat Food Recalled Over Salmonella<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>The maker of Iams-brand products said it was recalling two lots of prescription cat food because of possible salmonella contamination.No illnesses have been reported, the company said in a statement.

In a press release, Procter &amp; Gamble warned that “people handling dry pet food can become infected with salmonella,” especially if they do not wash their hands afterward. If consumed, salmonella can cause fatal infections in children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.

For this week, Procter &amp; Gamble and Wal-Mart are filling a couple of hours of NBC’s schedule with “The Jensen Project,” the second in a series of “family-friendly” television movies the two consumer giants are producing.The Hallmark feeling is accentuated by the presence in the lead of Kellie Martin, who made 11 “Mystery Woman” pictures for that channel in recent years. In other ways, though, “The Jensen Project” is more like a Syfy or Disney Channel production: the premise of a secretive colony of geniuses to which a married couple (Ms. Martin and Brady Smith) once belonged and have now been called back, and the prominence of a pair of disobedient teenagers (Justin Kelly and the sultry Alyssa Diaz) who help save the day. The by-the-numbers story involves the theft, both actual and intellectual, of molecule-size computers called nanobots, a device familiar to viewers of “Chuck,” “Ben 10” and (if your memory stretches that far) the 2003 series “Jake 2.0.” Ms. Martin, given the unenviable task of playing a character who is equal parts bitter scientist and worried mom, delivers a humor-free performance, and the film as a whole lacks the snap that Nickelodeon or Disney would have given it. “The Jensen Project” may be friendly to family values, but it gives the cold shoulder to fun. Once scientific justice has been served — a process that involves some gimcracky special effects and the comforting presences of LeVar Burton (“Roots,” “Star Trek: The Next Generation”) and Patricia Richardson (“Home Improvement”) — Mom, Dad and teenage son are asked to stay on at the project, leaving the door open for sequels, if not a series. Procter &amp; Gamble may find that a harder sell than laundry soap. As you would expect in this kind of product, there’s some product placement, one instance of which will be more interesting to many viewers than the movie itself. In the opening minutes Mr. Kelly is seen standing before a television waving his right hand back and forth. He’s playing table tennis on a Microsoft Kinect game system (available by preorder through Wal-Mart) when he should be doing his homework. Now that’s family friendly.

It’s Not Unmanly.<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>WHEN Old Spice, the 72-year-old Procter &amp; Gamble brand, was planning a new advertising campaign for shower gel earlier this year, it faced a challenge: its research suggested women purchase as much as 70 percent of the shower gel for men in their households, but using body wash struck some men as unmanly. How could they market body wash to female purchasers and yet still cast the product as decidedly masculine to lure men away from bar soap?The answer, a campaign called “Smell like a man, man,” arrived in February with a television commercial starring the actor Isaiah Mustafa. “Hello, ladies,” says the strapping Mr. Mustafa, standing in a towel in a bathroom, as the spot begins. “Look at your man. Now back at me. Now back at your man. Now back to me. Sadly, he isn’t me, but if he stopped using ladies’ scented body wash and switched to Old Spice, he could smell like he’s me.” In the 30-second spot, by Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which relies on an ingeniously constructed set, the actor strolls from the bathroom to the deck of a boat and ultimately — before the camera pulls back for a final shot — Mr. Mustafa sits on a horse, proclaiming, “I’m on a horse.” The spot became an Internet sensation, drawing more than 13 million views on YouTube. (A video about how it was made, in a single shot using minimal digital effects, has itself had more than a million views.) Now Mr. Mustafa, who the brand refers to as Old Spice Man, is back with a new commercial. He again begins, “Hello, ladies” and in one continuous shot manages to go from a dock, to rolling on a log, to walking on water, to strolling through a kitchen with a frosted cake, saying, “Do you want to be with a man who smells like he can bake you a gourmet cake in the dream kitchen he built for you with his own hands?” The spot attracted more than 6.2 million views since the brand uploaded it to YouTube on June 29. To promote the campaign, on Tuesday and Wednesday the brand fielded questions to Old Spice Man through Twitter messages or on Facebook. Mr. Mustafa, meanwhile, stood wrapped in a towel in a bathroom set that had been constructed in a production studio near the agency in Portland, where four writers quickly scripted responses. Over two days, the brand uploaded about 185 videos, most about a minute long, to YouTube, including the actor responding to the actresses Alyssa Milano and Demi Moore and to George Stephanopoulos, the anchor of “Good Morning America,” where Mr. Mustafa subsequently was a guest on Thursday. Perhaps the most surprising request came from Johannes S. Beals, who sent this Twitter message: “Can U Ask my girlfriend to marry me? Her name is Angela A. Hutt-Chamberlin.” In a video, Mr. Mustafa then held up a ring and asked her to make Mr. Beals “the happiest man in the world and marry him.” Less then four hours after sending the initial message over Twitter, Mr. Beals reported in another Twitter message, “SHE SAID YES!!!!” In less than three days, the 65 response videos drew more than 5.2 million views on YouTube, where the Old Spice channel was the most viewed on Tuesday, while the brand’s Twitter followers grew to 48,000, from 3,000.  The body wash campaign “touches on a very subtle but powerful sentiment that is bubbling under the surface of American culture now, and that is that it’s O.K. to be a man,” said Rob Frankel, author of “The Revenge of Brand X.” Mr. Frankel compared the spots to those from a competing men’s brand, Axe, which is known for over-the-top commercials in which men who use the products become suddenly irresistible to scantily clad women. “Axe turns women into scent-sniffing bimbos and nymphomaniacs and is more about, ‘Use our product and it will enhance your sex appeal,’ ” said Mr. Frankel. “But Old Spice goes to your own character, and they’re really reaffirming masculinity.” In a posting on the Web site Jezebel shortly after the first ad was introduced in February, Irin Carmon wrote about its appeal. “Among the reasons the ‘I’m on a horse’ ad quickly became a viral sensation — a clever script, some surreal transitions, Mustafa’s magnetism — had to be the fact that women could enjoy it without feeling like we were participating in our own diminishment,” Ms. Carmon wrote. Old Spice spent $7.5 million advertising body wash in 2009, well under the $30 million spent by Axe body wash, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. But in the first quarter of 2010 Old Spice advertised far more aggressively, spending $11.4 million to Axe’s $3.6 million. Body wash sales, including women’s and unisex varieties, grew to $755 million in 2009, from $500 million in 2004, an increase of 51 percent, according to a 2009 report by Mintel, the market research firm. “Guys have been a little slower to adopt body wash because early on they didn’t feel like it got them as clean as bar soap,” said James Moorhead, vice president of marketing at Old Spice, which introduced body wash in 2003.  Some men told marketers they were reluctant to use the nylon webbing sponges called “poufs,” which raise a lather but were off-putting because of their dainty name and appearance. In 2009 Old Spice introduced a pouf in a rubber grip and called it a Deck Scrubber. “An experienced seaman knows the gentler sex is unlikely to board a vessel whose deck, galley and undercarriage has not been scrubbed as clean as the shiny inside part of an oyster shell,” states the package. (Axe introduced its own manly pouf, called the Detailer, in 2008.) “It took a little time for guys to get over the pouf,” Mr. Moorhead said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/business/media/02adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Pringles Introduces a Multigrain Variety<date>Published: July 1, 2010</date><text>IS there any such thing as a healthy-sounding snack that also tastes good? Procter &amp; Gamble is betting that the answer is yes by introducing a multigrain version of its popular snack-in-a-canister, Pringles.The new variety of Pringles has the crunchiness and saddle shape of the original, which was invented 41 years ago, but the latest stacked chip is made of several grains as well as potatoes. Procter &amp; Gamble’s campaign includes a charity donation for hungry children in the United States, participation by a celebrity chef and recipes to pair with multigrain Pringles. That is in addition to a television commercial and print advertisement, both presented in autumn harvest hues, and a commercial available online. The company is putting its marketing might — though it declined to say how much it was spending on its new Pringles campaign — in a snack category whose multigrain segment sometimes has had trouble finding solid footing in the marketplace. One reason is that consumers often say they want healthy snacks but reject products because they are not as tasty as their fatty, salty counterparts. To overcome concerns about taste, Pringles did extensive sampling, including focus groups and in-home tastings, of its product among consumers in the United States and Europe, said Douwe Bergsma, the North America marketing director for Pringles.  “Our emphasis is completely on taste,” Mr. Bergsma said. “We’ve introduced three flavors: Truly Original, Creamy Ranch and Cheesy Cheddar, to appeal to the consumer segment in the snack market that desires to experiment with new and different tastes and flavors.” In devising the marketing campaign for multigrain Pringles, Brett Banker, account director at Grey Worldwide, part of WPP, said that “there is a general perception that multigrain is bland and does not taste good. “So we tried to leave behind the idea of boring and serious, and go with delicious and playful,” he said of the television commercial, which has young people gathering in a farmer’s field to create a crop circle, a design seen from the air. To familiarize people with its multigrain version, Pringles has been distributing samples, giving out more than two million — individual chips, not entire cans — said Kay Puryear, a brand spokeswoman. Samples and coupons for a tube of multigrain Pringles were distributed in grocery stores nationwide, at concerts and festivals in several cities, and at Grand Central Terminal in New York. Mr. Bergsma said that the multigrain Pringles campaign was devised to appeal to people 35 and older, a group that tends to be more aware of calories and sodium content and that also looks to keep the pounds off with whole grains. (Even so, multigrain Pringles, which are made from rice, corn, wheat and black beans in addition to dehydrated potatoes, have about the same amount of sodium and calories as regular Pringles.) Pringles, Mr. Bergsma said, also is aiming at 18- to 28-year-olds. That age group, according to Mintel, a market research company based in Chicago, shows marked interest in trying healthier snacks. Three-fourths of people in that age group, Mintel’s 2009 research found, wanted healthier snack fare. Pringles is the sole remaining major food brand owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, which has sold food lines like Folgers coffee, and it has consistently added to its flavors. Loaded Baked Potato and Bacon Ranch are included in the lineup. The company also offers a fat-free version, introduced in 1998, and reduced fat version, introduced in 1981. (In fact, Pringles, including the new product, are officially named crisps rather than chips in response to the 1975 Food and Drug Administration edict that their composition required any labeling to spell out that it is “a potato chip made from dried potatoes.”) Those, along with multigrain, join a field dominated thus far by SunChips, a multigrain chip from Frito-Lay, which has benefited from rekindled interest in healthier snacks. From 2005 to 2009, sales of healthier snacks rose 8 percent, according to a report last year on the snack industry by Information Resources, the research group now called the SymphonyIRI Group.  As part of its marketing campaign, which began in April, Pringles sponsored a “U taste, we donate” campaign in which consumers could enter the universal product code from a multigrain can on pringlesmultigrain.com. Pringles pledged to donate $1 to Share Our Strength, a group that works to end hunger among American children, for each entry. The goal was $100,000, but Pringles has not yet released the results of the fund-raising effort. Pringles also hired a Food Network chef, Tyler Florence, to create recipes, like baked potato soup with broccoli, to give consumers ideas about what food goes well with multigrain Pringles. The recipes are featured on the multigrain Pringles Web site. In its 30-second television commercial for multigrain Pringles, a group of young people bring ropes and boards to bend wheat stalks to form the face of Mr. Pringle, the brand mascot, who wears a bow tie and has a mustache. Then, members of the group share some Pringles, passing around cans of the varieties. The commercial is also available on the multigrain Web site. Pringles does not disclose its media buys, Ms. Puryear said. That includes placement of its print ads, which show an aerial view of the crop portrait of Mr. Pringle. Grey is collaborating with a group of WPP-owned agencies in the campaign for multigrain Pringles, which will begin a new, but as yet unannounced, phase for the coming school year. Pringles also created a humorous 15-second Internet commercial, which features a news anchor sitting at a desk — with the crop circle appearing on a screen behind her — who is munching on a multigrain crisp when she notices the camera is on. “This just in. Mysterious crop circles —— ,” she begins, but is quickly overwhelmed by the desire for another chip.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/business/media/28adnewsletter1.html?ref=procterandgamble">Bounty Now Promises a Competent Clean<date>Published: June 28, 2010</date><text>A year after changing campaigns for Bounty paper towels, Procter &amp; Gamble is refocusing the brand’s advertising again.Bounty had for decades been called “the quicker picker upper” or, in a more recent variant, “the quilted quicker picker upper.” In February 2009, Procter switched approaches, introducing a theme, “Bring it,” to reflect that absorbency — picking up spills as soon as they happen — was perhaps no longer the be-all and end-all it once may have been. Although “Bring it” remains part of pitches for Bounty, it has been supplanted in importance by paeans to the benefits of a “Bounty clean.” Now Bounty ads end with proclamations that it is “the clean picker upper.” (Yes, a campaign for paper towels devoted to how they clean. What next, a campaign for bread devoted to how eating it keeps away hunger pangs?) The concept the campaign seeks to get across is that a single sheet of Bounty is strong and absorbent enough to get surfaces clean. The subtext is, of course, the economy, and how frugal shoppers are watching how many paper towels they use each time there is a mess to be mopped up in the kitchen. Procter, the nation’s largest advertiser, has been zigging and zagging during the last couple of years as consumers changed their buying habits to cope with the financial crisis and the recession. The company has increased some ad budgets, slashed prices of some products and rolled out campaigns that promote some brands as values compared with cheaper competitors. Recent commercials for Bounty have touted it as superior to an unnamed “bargain brand,” and that approach has been worked into the new campaign. “With one sheet of new Bounty,” an announcer says in one commercial, “you’ll have confidence in your clean.” There is also a demonstration that pits Bounty against an unidentified “bargain towel,” which of course concludes with Bounty’s triumph. “Super durable, super absorbent, super clean,” the announcer declares. “New Bounty, the clean picker upper.” The commercials are running on television and on the brand’s Web site. To underscore the shift in slogans, the Web address has been changed to bountytowels.com from quickerpickerupper.com; if you type the latter U.R.L. into your browser, you will be directed to the former. Bounty packaging also has been changed. The words “One sheet keeps cleaning” now appear under the brand name on the front of the wrapper. On the back, a block of type says “thick and absorbent Bounty helps you clean up quickly and easily, so you can get more out of each day.” The campaign also has a presence in social media in the form of a Facebook page (facebook.com/bounty). And there is a cause marketing element, too, called Make a Clean Difference, which encourages volunteers to help clean up 30 public schools in 10 cities like Cincinnati, the home of Procter; Los Angeles; Miami; and New York. For the cause marketing program, Procter is teaming up with the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation — the name comes from a founder, Joseph (Rev. Run) Simmons of Run D.M.C. — and an organization known as the Hands On Network, part of the Points of Light Institute. The campaign, which began in April, is from the Bounty creative agency, Publicis USA in New York, part of the Publicis Worldwide division of the Publicis Groupe. A public relations effort is being handled by MS&amp;L North America in New York, part of the MS&amp;L Group unit of the Publicis Groupe. Although the budget for the campaign is not being disclosed, Procter spent $46.9 million to advertise Bounty last year, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $55.8 million in 2008 and $53.3 million in 2007. The campaign begins amid a burst of marketing activity for household cleaning products as consumers stay home more as a result of economy-related cuts in traveling and eating out. “We recognize the economic downturn only reinforces the need to stay laser-focused on delivering superior performance and value to consumers,” says David Lee, Bounty brand manager at Procter in Cincinnati. “First and foremost, they want a competent clean that they can trust on surfaces their families encounter every day,” he adds, so the campaign is concentrating on that “functional benefit” rather than how fast Bounty picks up spills. The revamping of the campaign stems from “the ongoing learning” at Procter as a result of research, Mr. Lee says, as “we focus on understanding consumer needs.” The “clean” approach is “speaking in the words of the consumer,” he adds. “We’re talking to her as she talks about the product.” The use of the feminine pronoun reflects that the Bounty ads show only women, usually mothers, cleaning. Asked whether some promotions this month centered on Father’s Day for another Procter brand, Pampers diapers, might inspire Bounty to someday include a man or two in the campaign, Mr. Lee replies: “We really feel great about our campaign, and we’ll see where we go next. It’s still early, and we’ll learn as we go.” (Sounds like a “no.”) In the first Bounty commercial in the campaign, a woman enters the kitchen of her friend, who places a wedding gown on the counter. The woman grimaces, but after she runs her hand over the counter she is relieved to see how clean it is. In a second commercial, a mother and her son are together in the kitchen and he uses cake frosting to draw a portrait of his grandmother on the counter. No worries, with Bounty Extra Soft — a variety of Bounty — on hand, as an announcer says: “Art projects in the kitchen? Bring it.” In the second spot, the performance of Bounty Extra Soft is compared with a wet dishcloth rather than Brand X. Again, no surprises, Bounty prevails. Bounty is not alone in changing campaigns. There are also new ads for other brands of paper towels like Brawny, sold by the Georgia-Pacific unit of Koch Industries, and two brands sold by Kimberly-Clark, Scott and Viva. Although “I can’t comment on competition,” Mr. Lee says, “our business is doing really, really well” and “we continue to lead category growth.” As for whether another change in how Bounty speaks to consumers is one too many, Mr. Lee is optimistic. “I think we feel really good on the communication to the consumer and the understanding of the consumer needs,” he says. “It’s consistent in an evolution of how we talk to her and rooted in the competent clean she can trust.” Representatives from the Publicis USA New York office were unavailable to discuss the campaign, according to a spokeswoman at MS&amp;L. Hmmmm. Perhaps they, er, um, clean forgot about the interview. ------- If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/business/media/23adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Pampers Makes a Push to Get Dad to Do Diaper Buying Duty<date>Published: June 22, 2010</date><text>FATHERS are changing more diapers than ever, but you would never guess that while walking down the diaper aisle, where packages feature mothers but never fathers.Now Pampers, the Procter &amp; Gamble brand, while not planning to advertise on ESPN anytime soon, is taking baby steps toward fathers. On June 17, Pampers was host to a “Daddy Play Date” in Manhattan with celebrity fathers like the singer Joel Madden and the actor Gilles Marini and about 100 guests, who played carnival games with their toddlers. According to an invitation, the event was to pay “homage to dads on diaper duty.” Three days later, on Father’s Day, Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback and a Pampers spokesman, threw out the first pitch at the Yankees-Mets game while wearing a Pampers T-shirt. Mr. Brees was joined by his 17-month-old son Baylen, whom he had held aloft amid falling confetti in the celebratory minutes after the Saints’ Super Bowl victory in February. For Pampers, which released a Web-only video earlier this year of Mr. Brees promoting Dry Max, a technology that allows diapers to be thinner, the effort to market to fathers is a new one. “The role of dads is expanding and we salute that and we want to make dads a bigger part of the brand,” said Bryan McCleary, a Pampers spokesman. “Dads are playing an increasingly large role in parenting and diapering.” In a recent survey of parents by Pampers, 69 percent of men responded that they changed diapers as often their wives, while 11 percent said they did so even more often. Although men’s perceptions differ from women’s (only 31 percent of mothers said fathers split diaper duties equally, and just 4 percent said fathers did more), the findings are consistent with other reports about men’s growing involvement in the home. A Families and Work Institute report found that the average amount of time fathers spent with children younger than 13 during a workday in 2008 was three hours, up from two hours in 1977, while the amount of time mothers spent remained unchanged at 3.8 hours. • A new feature on Pampers’ Facebook page encourages fathers to share parenting stories, with entrants eligible for daily drawings of $250 diaper giveaways through June. But as Pampers pays more attention to fathers, it is in stark contrast to what the brand has done in the past — and much of what it is doing now. A “Dry Max Fact Sheet” handed out to the media at the recent Manhattan event, for instance, was heavily skewed toward mothers. “For Mom:” one passage comparing the product with its rival, Huggies, begins. “They are 20 percent thinner than Huggies Little Snugglers/Movers so mom can carry or store more of them within less space. She can also be confident that she is getting a hard-working diaper for the same great price.” Greg Allen, whose blog, Daddy Types, includes a list of men’s restrooms in Manhattan that are equipped with diaper-changing tables, said that brands often made overtures on Father’s Day. “In June, everybody talks to dads, and baby marketing is filled with how dads are unsung heroes, but the rest of year it’s just moms,” Mr. Allen said. “All of the packaging and ad copy is all babies and moms — and their regular day-in, day-out marketing and communications is all targeted at moms.” Most Pampers packaging features mothers and babies, though the brand occasionally features just a baby. Huggies is the opposite, usually featuring just babies, but occasionally featuring mothers, too. Neither brand’s packages feature fathers. Some dad blogs have praised Huggies, a Kimberly-Clark brand, for including fathers in commercials. One spot from 2008, for instance, showed a father trying to change his son, from whom a geyserlike stream emanates. Another, from 2009, shows a father chasing his toddler at a playground. A Pampers ad from 2007 shows a less engaged father, who snores while his wife puts food on the table. Pampers spent a total of $41.4 million on advertising in 2009, while Huggies spent $38.8 million, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP. Representatives from both Huggies and Pampers said that the vast majority of diaper shoppers were women, but declined to estimate what percentage were men. At Diapers.com, among the nearly 500,000 active customers, about 20 percent are men, according to Christina Carbonell, vice president of marketing for the online company. Ms. Carbonell said that percentage was likely higher than in traditional stores because men were more apt to shop online. The site, which was started by two fathers, strives to be inclusive. “We recognize moms but in general we serve busy parents and that’s the way we speak to them,” Ms. Carbonell said. She said that concerning content on the site, “we choose to use ‘parents’ and not ‘moms.’ ” In 2007, Brian Reid, then a stay-at-home dad, registered with Pampers to receive offers by e-mail. Every year since, the company has sent him a Mother’s Day greeting, beginning “Dear Brian,” and sharing sentiments like, “Thanks, Mom, for all that you do.” • Mr. Reid, who has a blog, Rebel Dad, has excoriated the brand in annual posts for four years. “Let’s get one thing straight: not every person on your diaper-coupon mailing list is a mother,” Mr. Reid wrote in May. “Dads buy lots of diapers. And though we don’t make our purchases based on which company panders the most to fathers, a lot of the dads I know appreciate it when huge consumer-product giants at least suggest that maybe mom doesn’t do all of the heavy lifting.” On June 18, Mr. Reid received a form e-mail message from Pampers that encouraged him to enter an anecdote about being a father for its Facebook contest, the first time the brand got his gender right. “I’m happy about this because we’ve gone through this long phase in which fathers were actively ignored,” Mr. Reid said in a telephone interview. “The fact that Pampers has now vaulted over that, and thinks it’s worth the time and effort to get Drew Brees to talk to dads, makes it seem that they realize that this is a market segment that can’t be ignored.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/science/earth/16dawn.html?ref=procterandgamble">Spill Provides Marketing Opportunity for Dawn Detergent<date>Published: June 15, 2010</date><text>In mid-April, the makers of Dawn liquid dish detergent started running TV commercials that played up its reputation as the soap of choice among nonprofit groups that clean birds and marine mammals harmed by oil spills.The advertisement, with blackened baby otters and ducklings emerging cleansed by a Dawn bubble bath, had run intermittently since last summer. More of the ads were being played as Earth Day neared, on April 22. Two days before Earth Day, the Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf of Mexico. The timing was an odd twist for the marketers of Dawn, who are watching their commercials recreated in TV news reports about hapless birds covered in oil, creating an accidental — and uneasy — bit of product placement. The number of damaged birds, dead or alive, collected and cataloged by the federal authorities has soared in recent weeks to nearly 1,400 as of Tuesday. The live ones are brought to be cleaned, and cameras now routinely catch images of Dawn bottles in the background as brown pelicans and laughing gulls are being washed. “It is a tough thing,” said Susan O. Baba, a spokeswoman for Dawn, made by the consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble, which has sent 7,000 bottles of the detergent to the gulf at no charge and plans as of now to send 5,000 more. And yet it is a marketing opportunity. “An oil spill is exactly the situation where Dawn is able to help and exactly what we want communicated about the product: tough on grease, yet gentle,” Ms. Baba said. But, she says, the company has not put out any press releases, or made any commercials specific to the gulf disaster. She says the brand has not even decided if it will extend its current campaign past the end of June, when it was scheduled to end. Still, some suspect the company’s motives. The comedian Stephen Colbert ran a segment on his Comedy Central show hypothesizing that Dawn was the real villain behind the oil spill. “They made that commercial last summer and now there is an oil spill, how convenient,” he told viewers, eyebrow arched, earlier this month. But Dawn does have its fans in the scientific community, including the International Bird Rescue Research Center. The center was founded after two oil tankers collided in San Francisco Bay in 1971 and 7,000 birds were covered in oil. Volunteers tried cleaning them with a combination of mineral oil and corn meal. All but 300 birds died. Over the years, founders of the organization looked for a better solution. They tested nail-polish removers, paint solvents and other compounds before settling on Dawn in 1978 as the best product for the job. While other dish detergents were good, Dawn had the right ratio of “surfactants” — cleaners that cut oil — to be effective yet not irritate the birds and other animals like otters and seals. Organizers also liked that it was readily available at any store and that it did not hurt animals’ ability to whisk away water. Procter &amp; Gamble refused requests by the research center to donate its product until 1989. In recent years, Dawn has started raising money for the center and also the Marine Mammal Center. In its current campaign, the company is raising money from sales of the product, and is on track for $500,000 by the end of the month, Ms. Baba said. But even as the money pours in for the bird cleaners, new doubts are being raised about whether cleaning them really makes sense over the long run. As of last week, nearly 30 birds a day were arriving at the research center’s rehabilitation facility in Fort Jackson, La. The oil covering them is so thick that it first is rubbed with a chemical pretreatment. They are then cleaned up to three at a time in a row of sinks in an open warehouse, where Dawn is put right on the birds and rubbed into their feathers. (Currently the oil is so heavy that research center staff members say they are using one bottle of Dawn for each bucket of water and three buckets to wash one pelican.) The birds emerge from the baths still subdued, but looking a lot more like themselves. After they are blow-dried they sit in outdoor cages, waiting to fully recover and be sent to gulf beaches not yet covered in oil. Yet even Jay Holcomb, the executive director of the bird rescue research center, acknowledged that it was unclear what happens after that. “It is like a Band-Aid to a gunshot wound to the heart,” said Mr. Holcomb, who says it is impossible to estimate how many of the birds will survive when returned to the wild.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/30/business/30product.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter, Colgate and Unilever Profit as Brands Sell Again<date>Published: April 29, 2010</date><text>Brand-name consumer products companies, by cutting prices, introducing products and pumping up promotions, are starting to win back shoppers who traded down to store brands.Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever all showed strong sales growth in Thursday’s quarterly report, although P.&amp; G.’s results were hurt by charges, including some from the American health care overhaul. Colgate was hit by Venezuela’s currency devaluation. While consumers are still minding their budgets, the rising sales are an encouraging, if tentative, sign of economic rebound after more than a year of steep shopper cuts. “These are companies that sell everyday household products,” said Jack Russo of Edward Jones, who covers Procter and Colgate. “Procter has been introducing products that have more of a value equation. I wouldn’t say that consumers are jumping back in on the premium products.” The three companies’ sales surged over all, particularly in emerging markets and after price cuts meant to lure consumers back from cheaper private label and store brands. Colgate shares rose 19 cents in afternoon trading but finished the day down 20 cents to $84, while Procter was off 97 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $62.20. Procter &amp; Gamble is trying to combine brand strength with lower-price alternatives. The company, which makes Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, said revenue rose 7 percent, to $19.2 billion, while profit dipped 1 percent to $2.59 billion, or 83 cents a share, with a charge of 5 cents a share for costs from health care changes in its third fiscal quarter. Colgate-Palmolive, maker of Colgate toothpaste, Palmolive dishwashing liquid and Ajax cleanser, said revenue rose more than 9 percent, to $3.83 billion. But first-quarter earnings fell 30 percent, to $357 million, or 69 cents a share, after the company took a charge for the currency changes in Venezuela, an important South American market. Unilever, the maker of Lipton tea, Dove soap and Ben &amp; Jerry’s ice cream, reported a 33 percent jump in first-quarter profit and a revenue increase of 6.7 percent. Unilever and Procter had to cut some prices because people were more apt to trade down to off-brand household products than health or beauty goods, said David Kolpak, managing director at Victory Capital Management in Cleveland.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/20/business/media/20adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">In the Mood to Clean? They Know<date>Published: April 19, 2010</date><text>THE Madison Avenue marketing calendar is chockablock with holidays both official (Presidents’ Day, the Fourth of July, Christmas) and less so (St. Patrick’s Day, Cinco de Mayo, Halloween). Then there are commercialized occasions like back to school, during which consumers are encouraged to shop for more than a day’s worth of merchandise.Spring-cleaning season is such a time, too, as evidenced by a spate of campaigns now under way for products that are meant to help consumers tidy up after a long winter. Makers of household cleaners like Clorox, the Dial division of Henkel, S. C. Johnson, Procter &amp; Gamble and Reckitt Benckiser are filling magazines, television programs and Web sites with pitches for sprays, bleaches, detergents, soaps and disinfectants. Spring is also when appliance makers and cleaning services try to take advantage of the impulse for home improvement. For instance, Hoover vacuums and floor care products are being promoted in a multimedia campaign that begins this week, the first for the brand from a new lineup of agencies. And Stanley Steemer International has introduced a campaign for its services to clean carpets, furniture, floors, air ducts and other woebegone household items.  Although spring arrives each year whether times are flush or tough, both campaigns reflect the realities of the current economy. For example, a year ago Hoover was advertising its higher-end Platinum Collection. The new campaign, by contrast, is for various models including the Platinum products, which are not identified as such in the ads. “Sales on some older models” that are less expensive “are showing double-digit growth,” said Brian Kirkendall, vice president for marketing and design at TTI Floor Care North America in Glenwillow, Ohio, the unit of Techtronic Industries that sells Hoover products in stores like Sears, Target and Wal-Mart and on Web sites like Amazon.com. The goal is “getting back to being good at the basics,” Mr. Kirkendall said. “A brand like Hoover has to get in touch with who it is.” That is reflected in the approach the new campaign takes, which he described as “old school” with a contemporary twist. The commercials are basic, hard-working spots that include selling points like “Designed for the way you live”; product demonstrations; humorous depictions of messy behavior; an updated version of “Nobody Does It Like You,” a Hoover jingle from 1993; beauty shots of products; and a large logo at the end. The campaign last year, by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., “was beautiful, beautiful work, but a little ethereal,” said Rudy Banny, co-founder and creative director at the new Hoover creative agency, Tattoo Projects in Charlotte, N.C. “It was not the nuts and bolts of what Hoover is,” he added. “In three or four spots, I don’t think there was hardware.” Although “we’re not asking people to reach too deep into their wallets” for Hoover products, Mr. Banny said, which can cost from $129 to $179, the careful attitude among shoppers means the campaign must work hard at promoting benefits and demonstrating the cleaning power of Hoover “where the rubber meets the road.” The other new Hoover agencies are Empower MediaMarketing in Cincinnati, for media buying, and Current PR in Chicago, for public relations. They and Tattoo Projects are working on, in addition to the commercials, campaign elements like digital ads to appear on Web sites including CafeMom.com and HGTV.com, a presence on social media like Facebook and Twitter and a cause-marketing initiative to raise money for the Cleaning for a Reason Foundation, which helps women with cancer by dispatching cleaning crews to their homes. Hoover spent $18.2 million last year to advertise in major media, according to the Nielsen Company; the Kantar Media unit of WPP reported the total as $20.7 million. For 2010, Hoover will spend about 50 percent more than in 2009, Mr. Kirkendall said. Stanley Steemer spends about $50 million to $60 million each year on advertising. Its new campaign, which takes a humorous tack, introduces a pair of recurring characters, employees who drive to service calls in the company’s familiar yellow van. One of the employees — technicians, in Stanley Steemer parlance — is chatty and a bit of a know-it-all; his partner is silent, taking it all in.  Like the Hoover commercials, the Stanley Steemer spots, on TV and YouTube, rework a vintage jingle. The new version of the “1-800-STEEMER” song also promotes the company’s Web site (1-800-Steemer.com). The Stanley Steemer campaign was created by Young &amp; Laramore in Indianapolis, which also served as the company’s creative agency from 2003 to 2005. “We had a very good experience with Young &amp; Laramore” the first time around, said Justin Bates, president at Stanley Steemer International in Dublin, Ohio, “and with everything that had gone on with the economy we realized it was very important to have the right creative going into 2010.” Typically, an economic downturn can benefit the carpet-cleaning business, Mr. Bates said, as people who are loath to buy new carpeting decide to clean their existing carpets. But early last year, “a lot of people stopped spending money altogether,” he added, which hurt results. “It wasn’t our best year,” Mr. Bates said of 2009, but there was hope for an upturn because carpets were “still getting dirty.”</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/business/media/19adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Schick Razor Focuses on Comfort, Not Blade Count<date>Published: April 19, 2010</date><text>WHEN Gillette introduced the first three-bladed razor in the United States, the Mach 3, in 1998, it struck some as absurd, and “Saturday Night Live” at the time pitched a 14-blade razor in a parody commercial. But blade escalation continued: Rival Schick introduced the four-bladed Quattro in 2003, and Gillette struck back with the five-bladed Fusion in 2005.Schick is introducing a new razor, the Hydro, however, and this time it is not raising the blade ante. The new razor is available in both five- and three-blade versions, and advertising focuses less on blades than how a moisturizing gadget reduces irritation. New television commercials — by the New York office of JWT, part of WPP — show men getting an unexpected splash from a boxing glove or a soccer ball exploding like a water balloon, drenching the player. The spots are scheduled to appear Monday, with print ads in May issues of magazines. “As you continue to add more blades, there are diminishing returns because more and more blades make a bigger cartridge and that makes it hard to shave in all the nooks and crannies on your face,” said Brad Harrison, a Schick brand manager. “So instead of more blades, we’re providing a more lubricious, smoother, more comfortable shave.” • The razor replaces the moisturizing strip on the razor’s head with a “gel reservoir” that exudes aloe and vitamin E, which the brand claims softens whiskers better than strips. “It’s by far the biggest launch we’ve ever done, our largest capital commitment for R.&amp; D. and marketing, and by far the best technology we’ve ever come up with,” said Mr. Harrison, who declined to provide specific figures. Schick, which was bought by Energizer in 2003, is dwarfed in the razor category by Gillette, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand. Gillette has 66 percent and Schick has 25 percent of the nondisposable razor segment, which totaled $214 million in the 52 weeks ended March 21, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, a data firm whose totals do not include Wal-Mart. In the $781 million replacement cartridge segment, Gillette commands an 83 percent share, compared with 14 percent for Schick. Gillette, which also makes deodorant, body wash and other items, collectively spent $185.7 million on advertising in 2009, compared with $58.4 million by Schick, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP that tracks ad spending. David Vinjamuri, the author of “Accidental Branding” and an adjunct professor of marketing at New York University, lauded Schick for breaking the add-a-blade cycle. “In brand marketing, when you do something and it works, you keep doing it until it stops working, and that’s what it felt like was happening when companies went from one to three to five blades,” Mr. Vinjamuri said. “They added so many blades that they have unwanted effects, like more irritation. It was absurd, frankly, and it got to be a marketing gimmick.” While razor makers tend to stress technological advances and performance, which can make razors seem more like racecars, the new Schick campaign focuses more on how it treats skin. (Schick, which had never sold shaving cream in the United States, also just introduced Hydro varieties.) Schick says its internal research found that only 30 percent of men shaved five or more times a week, and Mr. Harrison said Schick was positioning Hydro as the antidote to “shave avoidance.” The company is publicizing a poll it commissioned which found, conveniently enough, that men who shave five or more times a week have sex twice as frequently as the stubbly, and that 82 percent of women prefer cleanly shaven men. Gillette, meanwhile, will introduce a razor in June that, rather than add another blade, similarly promises to make shaving with five blades less irritating. The Fusion ProGlide, as its name makes clear, will not be an entirely new razor, but rather an extension of Fusion, a brand that Procter &amp; Gamble reports grew faster than any other in its history, earning $1 billion within two years of its introduction. “If you’re going to address comfort, the place to start is not by adding blades but rather to work on the engineering of the blades themselves,” said Stew Taub, associate director of male premium systems at Gillette. The ProGlide makes seven comfort-related improvements to the Fusion, including using thinner blades with improved friction-reducing coating to, as Mr. Taub puts it, cause less “tug and pull.” The razor’s lubricating strip is 25 percent larger than the existing model, while “a snowplow comfort guard” at the bottom of the cartridge clears away excess shaving cream to help blades work more comfortably. The company also will introduce a preshave facial scrub that causes a warming sensation, as well as a postshave cooling lotion under the ProGlide label. • Fusion alone commands 31 percent of both the razor and replacement cartridge segments, considerably more than all Schick models combined. “Consumers vote with their purchases and have overwhelmingly said Fusion is best, and we’ve chosen to take it up a notch,” said Damon Jones, a Gillette spokesman. Mr. Jones said the innovations in the ProGlide had been in development for years. But to Mr. Vinjamuri, the author, it seems that Gillette is rushing a comfort-driven product to market to steal Schick’s thunder. “It looks like a fairly quick and defensive move on Gillette’s part,” Mr. Vinjamuri said. “For me the big news is that Schick, after being almost an afterthought in the category for many years, has staked out some smart territory, and is acting like a real brand marketing company.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/business/smallbusiness/15sbiz.html?ref=procterandgamble">A Local Dry Cleaner Tries to Compete Against P.&amp;G.<date>Published: April 14, 2010</date><text>FOUNDED in 2004, Hangers Cleaners of Kansas City, Mo., was started as an environmentally safe dry cleaner. It uses colorless, odorless liquid carbon dioxide instead of the aggressive chemicals applied at traditional dry cleaners. It has 35 employees and 2009 revenue of $1.6 million.THE CHALLENGE To survive the arrival of a huge new competitor, Procter &amp; Gamble, which began testing a Tide dry-cleaning service in Kansas City in 2008. THE BACKGROUND When Joe Runyan started Hangers, he was hoping to bring a fresh approach to what he considered a stagnant industry. A first-time entrepreneur who had left a marketing career at Sprint, he had been dissatisfied with the local dry cleaners, finding dirty facilities and rude workers to be the norm. Then, while researching the business, he discovered that the chemicals used by most cleaners were prohibiting new entrants. Building owners refused to lease space to cleaners using perchloroethylene, or “perc,” which is now heavily regulated. “By no means was I a tree hugger,” Mr. Runyan said. “But from a business perspective, it was clear this industry had to change.” He found that liquid carbon dioxide was acceptable to landlords and as effective as perc in cleaning. Mr. Runyan decided to employ the new process. While his business plan had called for 12 to 14 storefronts and drive-through counters throughout the city, pick-up-and-delivery vans emerged as Hangers’ most effective sales channel. At a storefront, customers might forget to retrieve garments, and Mr. Runyan might never get paid. His six vans, however, picked up and delivered clothes in waterproof bags from patrons’ porches or garages twice a week. Upon delivery, Mr. Runyan immediately charged his customers’ credit cards. He didn’t charge extra for the service, but he said, “It’s so much less expensive to roll a van.” Better yet, he found that if customers never put clothes in their own cars, they were less tempted by competitor sales. “Our bricks-and-mortar storefronts provide credibility,” he said, “but we encourage our employees to convert customers to the vans. Our stickiness is so much higher. It’s one more errand people don’t have to run.” And then, in 2008, Procter &amp; Gamble opened an eco-friendly dry cleaner about 1.5 miles from Hangers’ headquarters. Using Kansas City as a test market for a new line of franchised Tide Dry Cleaners, P.&amp;G. offered drive-through service, 24-hour lockers, an on-site tailor and traditional “wet” cleaning, as well. “I think there’s enough business in town for both, especially if they focus on storefronts, but they’re spending tons of money marketing and undercutting price,” Mr. Runyan said. “How do we overcome the gorilla down the road?” THE OPTIONS One way to differentiate Hangers from a global brand, Mr. Runyan hoped, would be to increase the quirky messaging he believed his patrons enjoyed. Hangers gave away T-shirts that say “Sniff me” and sent promotional e-mail messages with riffs on the latest “American Idol” episode. It returned garments on hangers with slogans like “In the closet and proud” and “You’re the 23rd person I’ve seen naked. Please recycle hangers.” These efforts had brought positive feedback in person and through Mr. Runyan’s social networking on Facebook and Twitter. Another option was to cast the company as an integral member of the community. For example, Mr. Runyan could try to partner with local businesses and charities, picking up from and delivering to their offices. A single point of contact might introduce Hangers’ services to thousands of employees, bypassing the cost of traditional media. Third, Mr. Runyan could re-evaluate his storefront strategy, promoting the best ones but placing an even bigger bet on the vans. Finally, he contemplated offering “wash ’n fold” laundry, too. “How can we leverage the trust we’ve built, the payment mechanism, and the vans to capture a larger share of wallet?” he asked. “What else can we sell?” THE DECISION Mr. Runyan decided to pursue a combination of these options: Hangers continued to cultivate its offbeat image. “We have a personality in a business devoid of it,” Mr. Runyan said. “We can’t out-price or out-spend our big competitor, but we can be genuine, funny and edgy.” He worked to create a tight-knit culture of service and accountability. If a garment was damaged, a store representative would call the customer immediately and offer to replace it. He held a St. Patrick’s Day tailgate party for 60 people in a Hangers parking lot and financed a float in the local parade. “Maybe it’s goofy and old-fashioned,” he said, “but it seems to be resonating with the folks in K.C. Who would expect people to party with their dry cleaner?” He initiated partnerships with corporations, nonprofit organizations and community groups, and he can quantify the patrons gained from each. He also contacted schools and donates 10 percent of the proceeds from parents’ dry cleaning back to each school. In 2009, Hangers closed an underperforming storefront. And he concentrated Hangers’ van service on affluent, densely populated neighborhoods, hiring an additional sales representative to explain and expand the service in these areas. “We were already focused on the vans,” he said, “but P.&amp;G.’s arrival made us work even harder.” (So far, Procter &amp; Gamble has not offered van service.) Additionally, Hangers began offering laundry service at $1.55 a pound (Tide cleans primarily pressed shirts and charges per article of clothing). THE RESULTS While other local dry cleaners have told him that their year-over-year revenue is flat or down as much as 25 percent, Mr. Runyan said his revenue grew 2 to 3 percent in 2009 and his profits quadrupled, largely as a result of closing the unprofitable location. The laundry service proved a hard sell to suburbanites with their own washers and dryers, but young professionals and dual-income families responded; it now accounts for 2 percent of Hangers’ revenue. Procter &amp; Gamble now has three locations in Kansas City, and according to Lisa Popyk, a communications representative, they have been “a big win.” The company is advertising franchise opportunities in Cincinnati, Columbus and Dayton, Ohio, and in Lexington, Ky. Mr. Runyan noted, however, that several of his customers had tried Tide’s service and returned to Hangers; he can tell, he said, because of the bar codes “the gorilla” leaves on each garment.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/carlyle-hires-former-wyeth-chief/?ref=procterandgamble">Carlyle Hires Former Wyeth Chief<date>April 9, 2010, 7:42 am</date><text>Another private equity firm has snapped up a high-profile former chief executive.

With tactics like placing their food bowls next to vacuums that are not in use, Mr. Millan helped reverse the behavior. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Monica Almeida/The New York Times Cesar Millan of “Dog Whisperer” with Daddy, his 15-year-old pit bull. Enlarge This Image An advertisement in a recent Good Housekeeping magazine featured Bissell's Pet Hair Eraser vacuum. Enlarge This Image A new Swiffer ad campaign shows the SweeperVac cleaning up stray pet food. Now Swiffer, the 11-year-old Procter &amp; Gamble brand, is hiring Mr. Millan to help with a different sort of behavior modification: getting consumers to forgo traditional floor cleaning devices and buy Swiffer products. “Mops and brooms are really what we’re going after,” said Marchoe Northern, a Swiffer brand manager, adding that women were the target consumers. “It’s really about habit adaption at first  getting the Swiffer in her house  and then habit formation.” “I was using the Swiffer long before they approached me, so for me it was a no-brainer,” Mr. Millan said in an interview by phone. “I came into my marriage with a pack of dogs, and my wife said she didn’t want the smell in the house, so I’m the one who cleans the house.” Swiffer estimates that about half of the consumers it wants to reach have pets. That is consistent with findings from Packaged Facts, a market research company, indicating 49.7 percent of American households included a dog or cat in 2009, up from 45.4 percent in 2003. Mr. Millan will be featured in online marketing, including providing dog tips on the Swiffer Web site and its Facebook page, but there are no immediate plans for him to appear in print or television advertising. For the next several months, he will primarily promote the SweeperVac, which sells for $39.99 and combines Swiffer disposable electrostatic cloths with a rechargeable upright vacuum. “The vacuum allows you to pick up big stuff like kibble, and the Swiffer cloth on the bottom picks up hair,” Ms. Northern said. In a television commercial produced by the Kaplan Thaler Group, part of the Publicis Groupe, that had its premiere this month, a woman discards her broom outside. “Switch to the new and improved Swiffer SweeperVac, and you’ll dump your old broom,” a voiceover says. “But don’t worry, he’ll find someone else.” At that, the broom and a pink flamingo in the yard begin to sway to “Who’s That Lady” by the Isley Brothers. Inside the kitchen, meanwhile, the SweeperVac inhales kibble near a dog bowl, making it the third of five current Swiffer spots that highlight pets. The two others feature the original Swiffer removing hair near a dog bed and the Swiffer Duster tackling cat hair. Sales of Swiffer products, which also include a wet-mop system, totaled $325.4 million in the 52 weeks ended Jan. 24, according to Information Resources, whose figures exclude Wal-Mart. Swiffer spent $95 million on advertising for the first nine months of 2009, an increase of 21 percent over the $78.3 million spent in the same period in 2008, according to TNS Media Intelligence.  While cleaning brands have customized products for pets for decades, with Arm &amp; Hammer introducing a carpet deodorizer with a “pet fresh” scent in 1981, marketing efforts are booming as more people consider cats and dogs part of the family and a beagle is less likely to be found in a doghouse than on the sofa. Cameron Woo, publisher of The Bark magazine, said advertisements from cleaning brands had grown in the “double digits” in each of the last three years, growth he attributed both to increasing “germ phobia” and demand for less toxic cleaners. (One advertiser, PawSafe, markets a toilet cleaner free of harsh chemicals, so a dog can drink out of the commode more safely.) Several vacuum brands offer models for pet owners, but none as extensively as Bissell, the 134-year-old cleaning products company whose offerings are sold at Petco and PetSmart. Bissell’s five models of pet vacuums include the Pet Hair Eraser and the SpotBot Pet Deep Cleaner, a compact steam cleaner to be placed over an animal mishap to clean it unattended. Bissell’s ShedAway, a metal-toothed tool at the end of a vacuum attachment, draws pet hair into the vacuum so it does not fall onto rugs and furniture. Another product, the Drool Cleaner, is for sliding doors and windows where pets keep watch exuberantly: a spray container has a small attached brush and squeegee to, according to the Bissell Web sit, cut “through drool, smudges and paw prints.” Bissell, which also advertises on Petfinder.com and has a pet section on its Web site, runs an annual Most Valuable Pet contest, where pets’ photos are entered for a chance to be featured on Pet Hair Eraser vacuum packaging and win $10,000 for an animal charity of the pet owner’s choice. In 2008 and 2009, the contest drew more than 100,000 entries. “We try to think of ourselves as pet owners and pet lovers, and then we become better pet marketers,” said James A. Krzeminski, executive vice president and chief customer officer of Bissell Homecare.  As part of Swiffer’s partnership with Mr. Millan, the brand will be featured on his Facebook page, which has more than 195,000 fans. Mr. Millan said that in yet-to-be filmed videos on Swiffer’s Web site, he will demonstrate how to use Swiffer products to clean floors without agitating pets. “To me it’s how can I help people make this cleaning tool pet-friendly,” Mr. Millan said. “A lot of people who put the dog somewhere else before they clean up don’t realize how to have a more harmonious relationship with the tools. “Dogs have very sensitive ears, and I don’t want my pack to get nervous about this new tool that I’m using.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 16, 2010, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/03/business/media/03adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">A Clean Break With Staid Detergent Ads<date>Published: February 2, 2010</date><text>ONE of the biggest  and dullest  categories in consumer marketing is showing signs of life. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A Method laundry detergent campaign includes ads that take aim at what is obviously a jug of Tide. The category is laundry detergents, prosaic products whose advertising budgets have financed decades of soap operas and women’s magazines, not to mention enough coupon inserts to fill a googol of Sunday newspapers. (Yes, before there was “Google” there was “googol.”) The detergent business is emblematic of what is known as a low-interest category, a marketing term that means most consumers would rather watch paint dry than a commercial for such everyday products. One reason the category has become so staid was the victory that the leader, Procter &amp; Gamble, won in the United States over its two longtime nemeses, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever. So commanding a lead did Procter build in the detergent market with brands like Tide and Cheer that the two other rivals left the field and sold rights to their brands  among them, Ajax, All, Dynamo, Fab, Surf and Wisk  to other companies. But in the last couple of years, shoppers have shown renewed interest in detergents. The recent economic woes have spurred sales of lower-price products from marketers like Arm &amp; Hammer and the Dial division of Henkel. Also, detergents meant to be environmentally friendly have been gaining favor, among them brands like Green Works, from Clorox; Seventh Generation; and Vaska. Enter Method, the cleaning-products company with a green, and quirky, persona that is summarized in its corporate mantra, “People against dirty.” Method is introducing a detergent in a campaign with a budget estimated at $10 million. The campaign, now under way, takes the cheeky tone typical of Method’s marketing by mocking mainstream products as feeding a household’s heinous “jug” habit  jugs being the large, handled bottles that rival brands use rather than the small pump bottles of Method. “Say no to jugs,” the headlines of print and online ads declare. Other ads proclaim that Method stands “for a jug-free America.” And the following is a sequence of online banner ads: “Are you a jug addict? Frequently overdosing? Heavy and bloated? We can help. Get off the jugs and get clean.” The campaign, by Droga5 in New York, can also be seen on a microsite, or special Web site, methodlaundry.com. The ads also paint a giant target on Tide, which is America’s best-selling detergent, by showing the Method product in front of a large orange jug with a blue cap. Although the jug is unlabeled, it is clearly clad in Tide’s trade dress. “We use the jug as the monster our challenger brand wants to slay,” said Eric Ryan, a founder of Method, based in San Francisco, who is the company’s chief brand architect. “We need to go through the door of the category,” he added, referring to Tide, to demonstrate that “our laundry detergent is superior to the one they’re using today.” “Laundry habits are ingrained early in life and people think of themselves as closed off to change,” Mr. Ryan said. “They head down the laundry aisle on autopilot.” “Our challenge is getting consumers to rethink how they do laundry,” he added, on a “small budget” compared with those of Tide and other traditional detergent brands. The pun-filled ads comparing laundry habits to drug habits are intended to be “provocative enough” to be noticed, Mr. Ryan said, but not to generate complaints. Method knows too well about maintaining that balance. In November, the company and Droga5 introduced a parody video clip that was styled like a commercial for a make-believe conventional cleaning product named Shiny Suds. The online video featured talking Suds bubbles that were malevolent, representing what Method considers to be the harsh or hazardous chemicals in competitive products. To underline their nasty nature, the Suds were shown leering at a woman while she showered. Among the many comments about the video on Web sites were hundreds that complained the clip degraded women and condoned sexual harassment. Chastened, Method withdrew the video. “We were taken aback a little bit by a vocal minority,” said David Droga, creative chairman at Droga5. “It was something we didn’t anticipate.” “But this is a people-focused company,” he said of Method, “so we had to respond to those concerns.” As for the brazenness of likening detergent jugs to drugs, Mr. Droga described it as “the starting point to create a conversation.” Asked what he would do if Nancy Reagan were to complain about Method making light of her “Just say no” campaign, Mr. Droga replied: “If Nancy Reagan complains, it’s all good. Nancy Reagan has dirty laundry, just like anyone else.” Mr. Ryan said: “We never want to offend anybody. When you’re trying to provoke change, it’s a challenging line to walk.” The print ads for the detergent are to appear in March through September issues of magazines like Family Circle, People and Real Simple. The digital ads are to run from Feb. 16 through the end of May. Method is also supplying about 200 of what the company calls its “top-tier advocates,” or dedicated customers, with detergent samples for themselves and friends. Method must try to elicit interest in its detergent without getting Procter &amp; Gamble so annoyed that it would, say, introduce a version of Tide in a small pump bottle. Procter, too, wants to capitalize on the new interest in the detergent category. It has introduced a campaign for Tide, carrying the theme “Style is an option. Clean is not,” and a campaign for Cheer featuring humorous video clips online (cheer.com/brighten-bay).

Related Times Topics: Procter &amp; Gamble Company | Colgate-Palmolive Company Add to Portfolio Colgate-Palmolive Company Go to your Portfolio » Profit at Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers, fell less than analysts had anticipated. A higher profit at Colgate, the toothpaste and household cleaner maker, was stronger than analysts had expected. “This idea that this economy is causing everyone to trade down is a little bit overly general and too broadly applied,” Procter &amp; Gamble’s chief executive, Robert A. McDonald, said during a conference call. Still, the companies stood by their 2010 profit forecasts as they digested new concerns like the effect from the devaluation of the bolivar in Venezuela. “It’s encouraging, there’s no question,” a JPMorgan analyst, John Faucher said of the results from the two companies. As raw material prices rebound, however, “they’re not going to put up this kind of upside without some acceleration in top-line growth going forward,” he said. Procter &amp; Gamble said sales should rise more than it previously expected this year. Both companies have felt pressure since late 2007 as consumers bought less expensive products to save money. But Colgate’s portfolio has been more resistant to such trends because most of its products, like toothpaste and soap, are less discretionary. Procter &amp; Gamble said it earned $4.66 billion, or $1.49 a share, down from $5 billion, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn $1.42 a share. Sales in the period, which ended Dec. 31 and was the second quarter of Procter &amp; Gamble’s fiscal year, rose 6.4 percent, to $21.03 billion, from $19.76 billion, falling short of analysts’ forecast of $21.07 billion. Organic sales, which exclude the effect of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 5 percent, as did the volume of goods sold. Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, rose 87 cents, to $61.68. Colgate said it earned $631 million, or $1.21 a share, up 27 percent from $497 million, or 94 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period, Colgate’s fourth quarter, rose 11.4 percent, to $4.08 billion from $3.66 billion, while the volume of goods sold increased 3 percent. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $1.18 a share on $4.08 billion in sales. Shares of Colgate, which is based in New York, fell 47 cents, to $79.92.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A new Procter &amp; Gamble ad for Tide detergent suggests that cleanliness is part of presenting a personal style. An image campaign for Tide, now under way, eschews the brand’s long-time pitches celebrating its ability to get clothes clean. The most recent such ads, which began appearing in 2007, carried the theme “Tide knows fabrics best.” In the new campaign, clean clothes are presented as a means to an end  expressing personal style  rather than the end itself. That is a far cry from vintage campaigns for Tide with slogans like “Dirt can’t hide from intensified Tide,” “If it’s got to be clean, it’s got to be Tide” and “Tide’s in, dirt’s out.” By comparison, the theme of the new campaign is “Style is an option. Clean is not.” The focus is on how Tide enables its loyal users to dress for success, to impress or just for fun. For instance, one ad shows a woman accessorizing a T-shirt in a dozen ways, from casual to chic. The headline declares: “100 ways to wear a T-shirt. 1 detergent to help keep it white.” Another ad, depicting a well-dressed young woman, carries this encouraging headline: “You make it work. We’ll keep it clean.” In a third ad, a girl wears a top decorated with hearts, a skirt festooned with polka dots and striped socks. “Mismatched? Maybe,” the headline says. “Stained? Nope.” In short, the ads suggest that at a time when buying new clothing is almost as out of style as a leisure suit, a detergent that cares for the clothing already in closets and dressers may be worth the extra cost. Since the economy soured, Tide has maintained its lead as the country’s most popular liquid and powder detergent, with a market share exceeding 40 percent. But less expensive brands  among them All, Arm &amp; Hammer and Purex  have been making inroads. Procter is worried enough to have started running ads for Tide asserting that it is a better value than other detergents because, the ads say, Tide contains “more cleaning ingredients” and “less water.” And Procter is testing, in three Southern states, a version of Tide called Tide Basic, that costs about 20 percent less than the mainstay versions. The new campaign is meant to stimulate demand for full-priced Tide rather than the budget variety. “These are tough times,” said Suzanne Watson, North American Tide associate marketing director at Procter in Cincinnati. “Making your current clothes look newer longer, cleaner longer, fresher longer, is important.” The goal is “having a sense of pride and dignity when you walk out the door that what you wear is clean,” Ms. Watson said, so the campaign seeks to persuade consumers they “don’t have to go out and buy a new white T-shirt when there’s one detergent that’s going to keep it really clean day after day.” At Procter, Ms. Watson acknowledged, “we here analyze, and overanalyze, the importance of whiteness, brightness, stain removal” when it comes to consumers choosing among detergents, but they “don’t think about it in those terms.” So “rather than saying, ‘This is dirty; now it’s clean,’ ” Ms. Watson said, the new campaign “is expressing it in a different way: ‘You rock what you love to wear. We’ll be behind the scenes keeping it clean.’ ” Eight agencies are working on the campaign, among them Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, for the advertising. Research among consumers to determine the direction of the campaign was initiated “at the beginning of when the economy started going bad,” said Wanda Pogue, senior vice president and global planning director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and those interviewed spoke of how they had “stopped eating out and buying new clothes.” From that came a decision to center the ads on “maintaining your clothes and keeping them at their best despite your wearing them time and time again,” Ms. Pogue said, which could contribute to “having your family not feel the impact of the downturn.” Andrea Diquez, senior vice president and global director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, said: “In the past, we’ve been about superior cleaning. Now, it’s about how to make that relevant. It’s not ‘I take out the stain.’ Why does that matter? Because at the end of the day, it affects how you look.” Elements of the campaign extend well beyond traditional media like television and print ads, reflecting Procter’s increasing comfort with the new media. There will be clips on YouTube, material on Facebook, signs known as wildpostings in urban locations, events held at style centers like South Beach and content on the tide.com Web site. Procter spent $90.2 million to advertise Tide detergent in major media during the first nine months of 2009, according to data from the TNS Media Intelligence division of WPP, almost as much as the $90.3 million spent during all of 2008. By comparison, spending for the first nine months of 2008 totaled $51.5 million, TNS reported. The other agencies on the campaign are the Burrell Communications Group, for ads aimed at black consumers; Conill Advertising, part of Publicis, for ads aimed at Hispanics; DeVries Public Relations; Digitas, also part of Publicis, for digital ads; the Integer Group, a unit of the Omnicom Group, for ads in stores; Landor Associates, part of WPP, for design, including a jazzed-up version of the venerable Tide bull’s-eye logo; and SMG United, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of Publicis, for media.

She was also a doctor. And a hopeless alcoholic. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Courtesy of the Welch Family Ann Williams as Eunice Wyatt on “Search for Tomorrow.” Related Times Topics: Soap Operas Enlarge This Image Courtesy of the Welch family Ann Williams at 29. She was a soap opera actress. In the early ’60s, my mother was cast as Erica Brandt on “Young Dr. Malone,” one of the first televised soap operas to be produced by Procter &amp; Gamble. Last week, “As the World Turns,” the last Procter &amp; Gamble-owned soap, was canceled after a 54-year run. It is the end of an era. My mother  Ann Williams to her fans, Mrs. Welch to my teachers and friends  did not live to see this. She died of cancer 24 years ago today, leaving my three siblings and me orphans (our father had been killed in a car crash in 1982). I was 16, Amanda 20, Dan 14 and Diana 8. Amanda moved to Brooklyn to live on her own, and the rest of us were split up to live with different families in our hometown, Bedford, N.Y. Still, that story line paled in comparison to my mother’s daytime roles, and deaths. She rose to fame as the original Dr. Maggie Fielding on “The Doctors” in 1964, leaving the show to give birth to Amanda in 1965. When she conceived me in 1968, her pregnancy was written into her role as Eunice Wyatt on “Search for Tomorrow,” another Procter &amp; Gamble production. She played Eunice for 10 years until Morgan Fairchild, in one of her first TV roles, as Jennifer Pace, shot Eunice in the back during a schizophrenic fit. Jennifer held the gun, hearing voices; Eunice whimpered, trying to reason with her psychotic murderess. Though I was only 7 when Eunice was killed, I remember receiving a big box from Procter &amp; Gamble every Christmas, filled with soaps and hair products. Mom’s next role lasted from 1978 to 1980, on yet another Procter &amp; Gamble-sponsored soap, “The Edge of Night.” Margo Huntington was the most successful businesswoman in all of Monticello. She owned the local TV station, wore fur coats and painted her long fingernails a bloody red. Margo was my favorite, nothing like Mom, who made me cringe with embarrassment whenever she wore her earth-toned velour tracksuits and clogs to the grocery store. Margo’s shady business deals led her into financing pornography; her unrequited love for a married man led her into a marriage-cum-business arrangement with Eliot Dorn, a former cult leader, in the hopes it would make her true love jealous. That backfired  Margo instead was bludgeoned with a fire poker by one of Eliot’s love interests, who also happened to be her maid. Cut to a commercial. In our real life, Mom was married to Robert Daniel Peter Welch, an investment banker who died in a mysterious car crash two years after Margo’s fictional demise. At the time of his death, our father was $1.2 million in debt, unbeknownst to my out-of-work 46-year-old mother. Collection notices replaced condolence cards and then, exactly one month after his death, Mom was given a diagnosis of terminal cancer. That summer she got a radical hysterectomy and put our three-story, five-bedroom house on the market. We moved into the caretaker’s two-room cottage, which Mom had wisely kept, along with the remaining seven acres of land. When she started radiation therapy, we were scared. When she was cast as June Slater on the ABC drama “Loving,” we celebrated. June had a drinking problem, which was hilarious because Mom was a lightweight: one glass of Dubonnet Blonde made her nose fall asleep. On “Loving,” June liked Scotch (which was actually apple juice) and was married to Garth Slater, a college dean who kept her drunk so he could sneak into their teenage daughter’s bedroom at night. I was 14 that summer and spent one week at a volleyball camp. Practice started one morning with a journal writing exercise. I wrote about my mom’s new job and storyline. That afternoon, I was called into the camp director’s office, where four very concerned-looking adults were waiting for me. At first, I thought it had something to do with my reluctance to try an overhead serve. Then, my coach said, “Liz, tell us about your father.” I was confused. “What about him?” I asked. A stern-looking woman spoke next: “It’s O.K., you’re safe here. We read your journal.” I suddenly understood and burst out laughing: “Oh, no! That’s my mom’s husband on TV! My real father is dead! He died in a car accident last year!” The adults let out a collective sigh of relief. Everyone smiled. “All right-y then,” the camp director said. And I was sent back to practice. That was the magic of soap operas in their heyday. They exorcised people’s feelings about whatever ills plagued them in their own lives. Today, though, people don’t need soaps for that. And we certainly don’t need actors to play these sometimes scary and often sensationalized roles. Real people get to play those, in news stories that are horrendous, stupendous and almost impossible to believe. Talk shows, reality shows, cable news do for us what radio serials and soap operas once did: They make us feel better about our own dramas. When my mother was very ill and undergoing chemotherapy, she played her final role, a blind woman on “Guiding Light.” She wore a wig and sat in a wheelchair  a Method actor to the end, she argued that it worked for her character. The truth was, she was bald from chemo and too weak to walk. But she needed the union hours to be eligible for her health insurance. Several months later, she died at home. “Guiding Light” continued for two decades more, broadcasting its last episode on Sept. 18  a 72-year run. The death of “As the World Turns” is the final nail in the coffin of soap operas as my mother knew them. I just wish she were around to mourn them with me.

McDonald, Procter &amp; Gamble's chief executive, said his goal was to add nearly 548,000 customers a day — every day — for the next five years. Add to Portfolio Unilever N.V Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Al Behrman/Associated Press A. G. Lafley, the former chief of P.&amp; G., spent the last decade revitalizing the 172-year-old company and doubling its sales. Every day. For the next five years. That is the goal Robert A. McDonald, Procter &amp; Gamble’s new chief executive, has been promoting in recent weeks and that will be an important benchmark for his tenure. If he is successful, it will be an important new chapter for the company, after Mr. McDonald’s predecessor, A. G. Lafley, spent the last decade revitalizing the 172-year-old company and doubling its sales. Now the consumer products giant has to keep expanding its reach beyond its core markets of the United States, Western Europe and Japan, and start winning over new customers in places like Nigeria, India and Somalia. P.&amp; G., best known as the maker of Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, is taking on steep challenges. One is that its rivals Unilever and Colgate have long had a presence in many of these far-flung countries, so much so that they are called walled cities within the industry because of the difficulties new competitors face in penetrating these new markets. “It will be a knife fight, it will be brutal,” said William Schmitz, an industry analyst with Deutsche Bank North America. “It will be fought in shampoo, detergent, deodorant, and Unilever and Colgate won’t roll over.” The other big challenge is how a company that built itself on selling premium products at premium prices can shift to selling an array of low-priced products for consumers who often live on only a few hundred dollars a month or less. In some cases, potential customers do not use many of P.&amp; G.’s products and may even have to be taught how to do so. At his first presentation as a chief executive to P.&amp; G. shareholders last October, Mr. McDonald talked at length about the expansion plan and described the growth prospects in less developed countries as “absolutely amazing amazing.” Today, sales from developing markets represent 32 percent of P.&amp; G.’s $78 billion in annual revenue, up from 23 percent four years ago. Sales from developing countries are doubling every four years. Unilever and Colgate, though, already get about 45 percent of their sales from emerging markets. Today, P.&amp; G. has annual sales of $25 billion from developing countries, compared with $8 billion eight years ago. Procter already operates in 80 countries, selling its wares everywhere  large superstores in cities and tiny storefronts in remote villages. “For several years, they have been very quietly laying the groundwork,” said Lauren Lieberman, an industry analyst with Barclays Capital, said of P.&amp; G.’s push into developing countries. “Now they are ready to fully explore the strategy.” The pitch from P.&amp; G. executives to Wall Street is relatively simple: Americans spend about $110 a year per capita on Procter’s products. The worldwide per-capita figure is $12. In Mexico, the number is $20; it’s less than $3 in China and less than $1 in India. The goal, these executives say, is to get the per-capita numbers in China and India to look like Mexico’s. If that were to happen, Mr. McDonald told shareholders, sales at P.&amp; G. would increase by $40 billion  a statement repeated, almost as a mantra, by various other Procter executives at any number of industry conferences. Of course, customers in developing countries have little money to spend. And getting Procter’s goods to small towns and villages is a difficult logistical challenge. “Distribution in emerging markets is extraordinarily expensive, and it is fraught with missteps,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “You are taking things down to the village level.” Products, too, have to be adjusted. Procter &amp; Gamble has had to break down products like shampoos and soaps into smaller and less expensive sizes. In these countries, for instance, P.&amp; G. makes sure that a small package of shampoo, enough for one or two uses, does not cost more than the price of an egg. “There may be one billion new customers,” said Mr. Schmitz of Deutsche Bank. “But it is a question of the price per customer and what they can buy. How can you maintain profit margins when you are trying to sell small shampoos or little bars of soap in deepest India or sub-Saharan Africa?” Procter has come up with marketing efforts that are decidedly different than those in the United States and other more developed countries. Many infants, for instance, simply go without diapers, which means that P.&amp; G. goes to hospitals and mobile clinics to demonstrate the use of diapers. Because the cost of diapers are often an issue and because children and parents often share the same family bed, P.&amp; G. is promoting diaper use only at nighttime. “It’s an educational effort showing the importance of a good night’s sleep to the family,” said Werner Geissler, Procter &amp; Gamble’s vice chairman for global operations. “What we want them to do is use one diaper per night. And, if they can afford it, we are promoting use of diapers for outings, like when a family visits friends.” Earlier this month, to promote greater use of its feminine hygiene products, P.&amp; G. started a scholarship and a hygiene education program for young girls, featuring its Always sanitary pads. The company was promoting the pads as a way to reduce stress during their periods and to provide greater comfort, enabling the girls to study better. This comes on top of a similar P.&amp; G. program  called “Live your Life”  which featured young Nigerian girls writing essays about their first menstrual period, with a scholarship granted to the winning entry. Procter &amp; Gamble executives say they think their company and Unilever can find plenty of business without engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Even more, P.&amp; G. is confident it can trump the products offered by local and regional companies. “When two or three companies come in offering these products, it builds awareness of them,” Mr. Geissler said.” Across emerging markets, we can take market share without having to do battle with Unilever.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 12, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/business/09procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">Chief Executive of P.&amp; G. Will Add the Role of Chairman<date>Published: December 8, 2009</date><text>Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer products company, continued its management transition on Tuesday, announcing that A. G. Lafley will step down as chairman on Jan. 1, giving way to the chief executive, Robert A. McDonald. Mr. Lafley, 62, gave up the chief executive title in June to Mr. McDonald, the former operating chief. Mr. Lafley, who took over the Cincinnati company amid profit warnings and diving stock prices in June 2000, helped right Procter &amp; Gamble by emphasizing innovation and a “consumer is boss” focus, which included spending more time in personal observation and interviews with consumers. The company also built its major brands like Pampers and Tide. It now has 23 brands with sales of at least $1 billion, up from 10 in 2000. It has sold off slower-growth brands, including Comet cleanser, Sure deodorant and Folgers coffee. Mr. McDonald took over as chief executive as the company’s sales were struggling in the recession. But the company turned in better-than-expected first-quarter results in October and forecast a better outlook for the year. Mr. McDonald has pledged to aggressively win back market share from lower-price competitors and store brands; Procter &amp; Gamble has cut prices across its broad portfolio, stepped up advertising focused on offering value, and added both cheaper versions of its products and new premium-price items. Mr. Lafley said Tuesday that the strategies were working, and it was time to complete the management transition.

Join the discussion. More Arts News CBS announced on Tuesday that it was canceling “As the World Turns,” the 54-year-old soap that is the last daytime serial owned by Procter &amp; Gamble. The show chronicled generations of characters in fictional Oakdale, Ill., as they survived love and loss, but they couldn’t survive the harsh realities of modern television, where scripted dramas have become too expensive to justify dwindling ratings. The demise of “ATWT,” as it is known to soap fans, means that the two most venerable examples of the genre have been given cancellation notices in the same year. “Guiding Light,” a CBS daytime staple, had been on the air through radio and television for 72 years. CBS informed Procter &amp; Gamble of the cancellation “a couple of days ago,” according to Jeannie Tharrington, a spokeswoman for Procter &amp; Gamble. “It’s a part of our business that we will miss, and it’ll be hard for us to say goodbye to the show,” Ms. Tharrington said. Proctor &amp; Gamble said it would try to find a new home for the series. Given the current economic climate, though, that is considered unlikely. Soaps typically cost around $50 million a year to produce. CBS replaced “Guiding Light” this fall with “Let’s Make a Deal,” which costs about half that amount, and the network has seen increases in total audience and among the younger viewers that most advertisers seek. “Is it the end of an era?” Leslie Moonves, the chairman of CBS, asked. “Sort of. Only the special soaps are going to survive. It’s certainly the end of the client-owned soap.” He added, “All good things come to an end, whether it’s after 72 years or 54 years or 10 years. It’s a different time and a different business.” “As the World Turns” had the longest-running continuing character in television history  the family matriarch Nancy Hughes, played by Helen Wagner, now 91. Despite the conservative reputation of many Procter &amp; Gamble soaps, the show featured a male couple, Noah and Luke, and the first gay kiss on daytime television. However, its audience, which exceeded six million viewers a week in the 1990s, has drawn less than 2.5 million so far this season, the Nielsen Company said. And the younger adult women viewers, which are favored by most advertisers, had shrunk even more. The decline has been a continuing trend for the daytime genre. One CBS soap, “The Young and the Restless,” has posted slight gains of 3 percent total viewers and 6 percent among women 18 to 49. NBC’s last remaining soap, “Days of Our Lives,” has staged a small comeback this season. It is up 15 percent among total viewers and 10 percent among women 18 to 49. But for the most part soaps these days are watched by older women. Every network soap now has a median viewer age over 50 and only “General Hospital” on ABC is under 53. “As the World Turns” has a median age of 57.8. That is older than most of the network averages in prime time, during which NBC’s programs have a median age of 48, ABC’s programs 51.4 and CBS’s programs 54.1. The subtraction of the two shows means that network television, which once offered soap operas back to back throughout the daytime hours, will be down to only six serial dramas on three networks starting next fall. For Procter &amp; Gamble the loss is symbolic more than financial. The company, which has owned more than 20 soap operas in the past 80 years, now spends more than $7 billion in global advertising each year, making soap operas only a tiny portion of its business. Procter &amp; Gamble said on Tuesday that it wanted to remain in the television production business and that its annual “People’s Choice Awards” will continue each year. “The world has turned,” said Tim Brooks, a television historian and co-author of “The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows.” Ratings for soap operas have declined for decades because of “social changes,” he said. “Women are working today,” he said, and fewer people are able to spend time every day watching soap operas. The shows emerged on the radio in the 1930s during the Depression, he said, “and they seem to be ending in an era of economic downturn, too.” More Articles in Arts » A version of this article appeared in print on December 9, 2009, on page C1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/30/business/30procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">Colgate and P.&amp;G.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Colgate-Palmolive Company Go to your Portfolio » Procter &amp; Gamble, meanwhile, reported a slight drop in profit, but the results were better than analysts had expected. It also forecast a better outlook after a year in which households cut spending and traded down to cheaper brands. Procter &amp; Gamble, whose brands include Tide and Pampers, reported Thursday that its profit was down 1 percent at $3.35 billion, or 1.06 a share, compared with $3.31 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. Sales fell 6 percent to $19.8 billion, from $20.98 billion. Analysts expected the company to report a profit of 99 cents on sales of $19.83 billion. Separately, Colgate-Palmolive said that it earned $590 million, or $1.12 a share, in the quarter that ended in September. A year ago, Colgate earned $500 million, or 94 cents a share. Revenue rose to $4 billion from $3.99 billion, helped by a 5 percent rise in prices worldwide. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $1.11 a share and revenue of $3.94 billion. The amount of products sold rose 1.5 percent as consumers appeared willing to spend more for their products. Colgate’s brands are staples, like its namesake toothpaste and soap. Procter &amp; Gamble makes consumer staples, but it also sells discretionary items, such as fragrances, which shoppers are less likely to buy right now. Procter &amp; Gamble cut prices across 10 percent of its broad portfolio and stepped up advertising focused on offering value. Procter &amp; Gamble shares rose $2.31, or 4 percent, to $59.54. Colgate-Palmolive’s stock was up $1.26, or 1.6 percent, to $78.94.

But the ads remained steadfastly oblique about what consumers do after they tear along the perforated line. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image In a Charmin video, an actor wipes some toothpaste off his hand with toilet paper, then uses Freshmates to finish the job. Add to Portfolio Kimberly-Clark Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image An ad with Cottonelles mascot puppy equates using its products with visiting a health spa. With the prevalence these days of commercials for erectile dysfunction drugs and risqué network programming, however, tissue brands also are growing more frank. In a 2008 Cottonelle spot by JWT, New York, actors sat on scorching car hoods or fell on their posteriors while rollerblading, and a voiceover intoned, “The world is a tough place on bottoms.” The campaign introduced a slogan still used today: “Be kind to your behind.” Now a new JWT campaign for Cottonelle, a Kimberly-Clark brand, makes an even more direct appeal. A commercial shows the brand’s puppy mascot scampering through a health spa, as the voiceover recommends that “the gentle care you give to your face, hands and legs, also goes to your tush.” The spot, and a new Web site, CottonelleInstitute.com, highlight not just the brand’s Aloe &amp; E toilet paper but also its new flushable moist wipes, SoothingClean. With both products, the brand is breaking with tradition, trumpeting not softness but rather that it is “dermatologically tested” for sensitive skin. “Dry toilet paper is generally thought of as being a functional product, and a lot of brands in the category talk about strength and softness,” said Courtney DeSalvatore, a brand manager for Cottonelle wipes. “But we are reframing the Cottonelle brand as a personal care brand, which is a much more emotional space.” Ms. DeSalvatore says this is the first time the brand is pitching both rolls and wipes in one advertisement, in the hope of increasing the use of wipes, which are purchased by only 25 percent of households, many of which use them only on what she called “select usage occasions.” “Moist flushable wipes should be used on an everyday basis for personal care down there,” she said. Getting adults to use more wipes in the bathroom, in other words, requires marketers to engage in a sort of toilet training with grown-ups, and Cottonelle and other brands apparently think cultural taboos have relaxed enough to do exactly that.  Cottonelle leads the moist toilet paper category, with about $85 million in sales in the 52 weeks ending Sept. 6, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm. Its data does not include Wal-Mart sales. Private-label brands account for $51 million in sales, followed by another Kimberly-Clark brand, Scott, ($18 million) and Charmin ($10 million). Kimberly-Clark’s internal estimates, which have the benefit of including its sales at Wal-Mart, predict the total flushable wipes category  dominated by moist toilet tissue, but including feminine hygiene and medicated wipes  will exceed $500 million for the first time in 2009. That is more than two and a half times the 2001 totals, which were slightly less than $200 million; the company projects steady growth over the next three years, reaching $650 million in 2012. While the growth of wipes is well known in the industry  at an annual conference called World of Wipes, or WOW, sponsored by the Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, attendees discuss trends and innovations  the toilet paper brands have not advertised aggressively. “Surprisingly, with only modest marketing support, the adult moist toilet tissue wipe segment grew,” stated a 2008 report on flushable wipes by Pira International of Britain, which provides research and consulting to the packaging, paper and publishing industries. “This segment is one of the largest subsegments in the personal care wipes market, a high-value and growing segment.” Marketers say the growth of wipes does not cannibalize sales of toilet paper, because consumers tend to use them not as a replacement but an added step. “Only about 1 percent of flushable moist wipes consumers use just wipes,” said Ms. DeSalvatore, of Kimberly-Clark. “Most use both toilet paper and flushable moist wipes in conjunction with each other.”  Rival Charmin, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand, also is pitching its wipes, called Freshmates, as complementary to rolls. A current campaign by Publicis, New York, is decidedly more descriptive than Mr. Whipple, showing animated bears with tissue clinging to their hindquarters to highlight its Ultra Strong variety, which resists breaking into fragments. The spots end with an additional pitch for Freshmates “for a cleaner clean.” The company also recently uploaded to the Charmin Web site and to YouTube what it calls a “product demo,” in which an actor in a bathroom says, “You may think that dry bathroom tissue alone can get your family clean when you go to the bathroom, but sometimes it’s not enough. That’s when you use Charmin Freshmates.” His next words, “I’ll demonstrate” are, mercifully, followed with “this small amount of toothpaste.” He squeezes about an inch onto the back of his hand, wipes most away with dry tissue, and says, “Let’s add Charmin Freshmates moist wipes to the routine,” before wiping it clean. “It’s a pretty straightforward way of speaking to consumers and letting them know how best to use the products together to get cleaner,” said Jack Rubin, a Charmin brand manager. “To my knowledge it is the most clearly that we have laid it out so far.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 20, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/29/business/29sorkin.html?ref=procterandgamble">Big Merger Deals Signal Restored Confidence<date>Correction: September 30, 2009Published: September 28, 2009</date><text>The corner office is getting a bit more bullish about the economy. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Norm Betts/Bloomberg News John Chambers, chief of Cisco Systems, says the company will be making acquisitions. Add to Portfolio Abbott Laboratories Xerox Corp Cisco Systems Inc Affiliated Computer Services Incorporated Warner Chilcott Ltd Go to your Portfolio » While investors have been bidding up shares in the stock market for months, many chief executives and boards had privately remained skittish about their own businesses  until recently. In a signal that confidence  and perhaps a bit of executive swagger  may be returning to the business world, two large mergers were announced on Monday, adding to a flurry of deals in the last month. First, Abbott Laboratories, the drug maker, agreed to acquire a unit of Solvay of Belgium for $6.6 billion, and then Xerox agreed to buy Affiliated Computer Services, an outsourcer, for $6.4 billion. Neither merger compares in size to the double-digit billion-dollar deals that took place just two years ago at the height of the buyout boom. But taken in the context of what has been a merger drought  in the wake of the financial crisis, deal-making is still off by more than 50 percent from last year  the transactions suggest that the most senior ranks of corporate America may now have a more optimistic outlook on the economy than some people thought. “Will you see us move with a lot of acquisitions over this next year? You betcha,” John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, said in a recent meeting. “Especially if it plays out economically the way that I think.” For nearly two years, mergers plunged along with the markets as executives grappled with trying to understand how best to survive. At this time in 2007, $1.28 trillion in takeovers in the United States had been announced; so far this year, only $491.8 billion have been announced, according to Thomson Reuters. And with stock prices fluctuating sharply after falling for many months until the spring, buyers were anxious about overpaying and sellers were nervous about shortchanging themselves. But as the markets have rebounded and leveled off, companies are more confident about their prospects, so they are dipping their toes into the deal waters. The takeovers, in turn, helped lift the stock market on Monday, which had stalled recently. “The psychology has changed. This is sign that things have stabilized,” said Boon Sim, Credit Suisse’s head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, who suggested that deals were a lagging indicator to the stock market. “I don’t think the floodgates are opening up,” he continued, “but C.E.O.’s are now beginning to say, ‘If I don’t buy it now, it’s only going to get more expensive in the next 12 or 18 months.’ ” What Wall Street hasn’t seen, of course, is the return of the biggest buyers in recent years  the private equity firms that propelled much of the merger mania during the debt-fueled bubble. And that may be good news. The big deals announced recently are strategic deals, in which one company buys another to make it an integral part of its business, and they do not require the buyer to take on mounds of new borrowing to pay for the acquisition. In contrast, many of the takeovers for the last five years were based on little more than financial engineering, with lax lenders providing low-interest debt to help private equity firms buy companies that they often planned to resell quickly in hopes of pocketing a fast profit. That has left many companies struggling to make interest payments, making it harder for them to invest in new products or more efficient manufacturing methods. A number of those takeovers are already underwater and some have turned sour. Just one example: Simmons, the mattress maker, was bought by the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, or THL, in 2003, largely with borrowed money. Last week, THL said that Simmons  whose immense debt burden from the takeover was hampering its prospects  would be put into bankruptcy proceedings and sold. But the sale price for Simmons is so low that bond investors will lose around $500 million. At Xerox, Ursula M. Burns, the company’s chief executive, said that she pursued the deal for Affiliated Computer Services only because she finally felt more comfortable with the performance of her own business. “We’re confident that our base business will rebound when the economy does  and in Q2 saw the right trends in this direction,” she said. “So, all factors played to our favor. At the end of the day, in tough times, strong companies look to invest in their future.” While the recent mergers may represent a positive sign for the economy, Alexander Roos, a partner at the Boston Consulting Group, is less inclined to believe that we are about to see a burst of activity. In a study to be published on Tuesday, he said, his analysis of a sample of companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index shows that about 20 percent are “predators,” ready to take on the risks of a deal, while another 20 percent are “prey.” “We expect a window of opportunity offering attractive takeover prospects to open soon,” Mr. Roos said. “We have already seen some of our smarter clients making preparations in recent months.” The greatest concentration of deal-making appears to be in the health care and technology sectors. Warner Chilcott made a $3.1 billion deal for Procter &amp; Gamble’s drug business last month, for example, and Dell bought Perot Systems, a technology services company, for $3.9 billion. But deals are also being made in other sectors, like food; Kraft’s $16.7 billion unsolicited bid for Cadbury, which was rejected but remains a possibility, is the largest outstanding offer to date. “If you’re healthy, it’s a great time to acquire inexpensively,” adds Ted Rouse, a head of Bain &amp; Company’s global mergers and acquisitions practice. “But it’s an awful time for two weak companies to merge.” While the return of corporate mergers may be a good sign for the economy, a bigger question may be whether it is such a good thing for companies. Most deals sound great at the time, but in the end, not all of them work out as well as planned. Mr. Rouse said, “Before the recession, Bain’s research on M.&amp;A. showed that approximately 55 percent of acquisitions failed to deliver expected shareholder returns after one year  worse than flipping a coin. The odds only get worse as the size of the acquisition increases and the target is further from the acquirer’s core business.” Let’s hope the odds are better this time around.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 30, 2009 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about a recent uptick in mergers and acquisitions, described incorrectly a benefit of strategic deals, in which one company buys another with the aim of making it an integral part of its business. Typically, such deals do not require the buyer to take on extensive debt to pay for the purchase  not the opposite.

But the No. 2 ranked player apologized, and two of her biggest sponsors, Nike and Kraft Foods, told Advertising Age afterward that they supported her. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image In a print ad for Tampax Pearl tampons, Serena Williams slams shots at the character of Mother Nature, who is trying to bring the tennis star a gift wrapped in red. Enlarge This Image Disney Digital Books An image from Disneys digital book Web site, which will offer electronic replicas of hundreds of books for $79.95 a year. A new sponsor, Tampax, the Procter &amp; Gamble tampon brand, has signed a deal with Ms. Williams, who is featured in print ads and Web-only videos. The ads, by Leo Burnett USA of Chicago, were produced before the kerfuffle; print ads had already gone to press in magazines including Teen Vogue, and the brand remains steadfast. “We didn’t ever consider dropping Serena,” said Courtney Schuster, a Tampax brand manager. “She accepted responsibility and apologized for what happened, and we think that demonstrates the strength of her character.” While the endorsement strikes some as amusing  “Following Her PMS-Like Tirade, Serena Inks Tampax Endorsement,” joked a recent post on Highbrid Nation, an entertainment blog  for Procter &amp; Gamble it is a milestone. “This is pretty encouraging for the feminine care category,” Ms. Schuster said. “A lot of celebrities are not open to working with our brand, and we’re thrilled that Serena is.” While menstrual products have in the past hired retired Olympics gymnasts  in the 1980s Stayfree sanitary napkins advertising featured Cathy Rigby while Tampax featured Mary Lou Retton  an athlete of Ms. Williams’s currency and renown has never been a spokeswoman. Ms. Williams, who is on a book tour promoting her memoir, “On the Line,” declined to comment. Joe Favorito, a consultant who teaches sports marketing at Columbia, praised the deal. “There’s no reason athletes shouldn’t be associated with brands like this,” Mr. Favorito said. “I have a 13-year-old daughter, and you don’t want any stigma involved with a healthy lifestyle. It’s not something that needs to be hushed up.”  Ms. Williams is being used in a Tampax Pearl campaign that made its debut in July 2008, in which Mother Nature, played with gleeful mischief by the actress Catherine Lloyd Burns, approaches women in potentially precarious situations, like lying on a beach in a skimpy white bikini, and gives them a present wrapped in red, representing the onset of their periods. Mother Nature is repeatedly foiled when women brandish the product, and the spots close with the tagline: “Outsmart Mother Nature  with Tampax.” In the new online video, at Tampax.com and BeingGirl.com, Ms. Williams and Mother Nature trade barbs at dueling press conferences. Asked about their rivalry, Mother Nature responds, “Bad blood? Well, there is plenty of blood, but none of it’s bad.” (The generally unblushing New York Post called the video “uncomfortably graphic.”) The video closes with Mother Nature holding the red gift and cowering at the net while Ms. Williams, on the opposing side in a white outfit, thwacks balls at her. “Since we launched the campaign, we’ve been eager to see Mother Nature ambush a celebrity,” said Becky Swanson, a creative director from Leo Burnett. “To find out that Serena was interested was wonderful news because it’s not usually a category that people are clamoring to be associated with.” In more euphemistic eras, women in advertisements for tampons and pads rode white horses or relaxed on white couches to hint at the products’ efficacy, and Ms. Swanson said that women play tennis in short skirts, often white. “It’s hard to get more exposed than that unless you’re playing beach volleyball,” Ms. Swanson said. “Audiences are watching you in your cute short white outfit  yikes! It’s a real torture test for this product to keep yourself protected when you’re superactive.”  Another Tampax overture to professional tennis did not end well. In 1995 the brand, then owned by Tambrands (Procter &amp; Gamble acquired it in 1997), offered the Women’s Tennis Association tour more than $10 million to be its sponsor, but was rebuffed. “Initially my reaction was that it would be good to have the money,” Martina Navratilova, then the president of the association, told The Washington Post at the time. “But almost immediately I realized that the sport had the potential to be a laughingstock and just couldn’t afford to do it.” Phil de Picciotto, president of the athletes and personalities division at the Octagon agency (then known as Advantage International), presented Tambrands’ offer to the Women’s Tennis Association at the time. “Tennis is the most global and the largest sports platform for women  and would have been a powerful marketing platform for a global brand such at Tampax that wants to market to women,” Mr. de Picciotto said in a recent telephone interview. The W.T.A. formed in 1973 with financing from Virginia Slims, the cigarette aimed at women, which remained its sponsor for two decades. “So you had this irony,” Mr. de Picciotto said, “where the sport had a historic tie to tobacco, and that was fine, but a new tie to a feminine hygiene product was not fine.” Although Tampax’s current campaign focuses on a single player and runs only in the United States and Canada, Mr. de Picciotto still finds the development encouraging. “Looking back, and with Serena’s acceptance of the deal, I can borrow Virginia Slims’ slogan, and say, ‘You’ve come a long way, baby,’ ” Mr. de Picciotto said. “And good for them. I think it’s about time.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 29, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/25/business/media/25adco.html?ref=procterandgamble">Tough on Crude Oil, Soft on Ducklings<date>Published: September 24, 2009</date><text>ALTHOUGH cause-related marketing usually entails a company selecting a nonprofit in need of money and exposure, when it comes to Dawn dishwashing liquid, it was not the brand that chose the charity but the other way around. Skip to next paragraph Ads about cleaning up birds after oil spills bring scrutiny of Procter &amp; Gambles ambivalence toward animals. In 1978, Alice Berkner, founder of the International Bird Rescue Research Center, which helps birds harmed by oil spills, secured a small grant from Chevron to test all major dish soaps for cleaning birds. “The one that worked better than anything else was Dawn,” Jay Holcomb, executive director of the group, said in a telephone interview from California, where the center operates outside San Francisco and Los Angeles. “It cut the oil faster than anything else.” The organization informed Dawn’s parent company, Procter &amp; Gamble, which initially ignored requests to donate cases of the product, then finally agreed to do so in 1988, according to Mr. Holcomb. (P.&amp; G. said in a statement that because Dawn had made its debut only in 1973, “In these early stages it was important for Dawn to solidify its fundamentals before pursuing opportunities the brand felt passionate about.”) In 1989, during the Exxon Valdez spill, volunteers used Dawn on crude-covered birds, and the brand figured prominently in media accounts of the disaster, as it has in animal-rescue coverage since. In recent years, Dawn also has donated as much as $100,000 annually. Now Dawn is championing animal-rescue efforts in a television spot  by Kaplan Thaler Group, New York, part of the Publicis Groupe  that shows a baby duck, penguin and seal being washed in sudsy tubs. There is no voiceover, just the song “Wash Away” by Joe Purdy, and text stating that Dawn helped save thousands of animals caught in oil spills. Lastly, it reveals that the company will donate $1 to wildlife groups each time a consumer buys a bottle of Dawn and visits a Web site. Dawn has highlighted wildlife in advertising campaigns intermittently since 2002 but never tried so actively to engage consumers. For Dawn to make a donation, consumers must go to dawnsaveswildlife.com  which features the bird rescue group and another beneficiary, the Marine Mammal Center  and enter a sequence of numbers printed on the back of bottles. So far, more than $89,000 has been raised. A Facebook page, Everyday Wildlife Champions, features volunteering opportunities and has more than 14,000 fans. Dawn also chose a spokeswoman, the actress Minnie Driver, who has appeared  with penguins  on “The View” and the “Today” show. Dawn is the leading American dish soap brand, with 36 percent of the category, according to Information Resources, a market research firm whose data does not include Wal-Mart Stores. Revenue for dishwashing liquid in the 52 weeks that ended Sept. 6 totaled $623 million, a 5 percent increase over the previous year, owing perhaps to the recession driving more people to eat at home. The contest between Dawn and Palmolive, the Colgate-Palmolive brand whose original formula ranks second, historically has been one of power versus mildness, with Palmolive saying how gentle it is on hands  in the iconic 1970s television spots a manicurist, Madge, had clients soak their hands in it  and Dawn asserting that it powers through grease. Both brands secondarily claim to beat their rival at its own game, with Palmolive promoting its efficacy and Dawn its mildness. For Dawn, sullied birds help with that secondary claim. “Some of our competitors have owned mildness, but Dawn has proved also to be gentle on hands, and this commercial demonstrates that in a different way,” said Susan Baba, a P.&amp; G. spokeswoman. “This is really a great way of highlighting our messaging of being tough on grease but gentle on hands.” Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of Kaplan Thaler Group, said the Web site and Facebook group were inspired not by an advertising campaign but by a political one. “Instead of a getting a few people to contribute a lot of money, the Obama campaign got a lot of people to give a little, and kept telling them they were stewards for their country,” she said. “People don’t want to be lectured to; they want to really participate.” Not all participation in the Dawn campaign has been positive, however: several comments on Facebook  and on YouTube, where the commercial is posted  have noted that Procter &amp; Gamble conducts tests on animals. “Go ahead and support animal testing!” wrote Janina Miranda Laffitte on Facebook. “Dawn donates $1.00 yes but they test their products on many animals to this day!” Kathy Guillermo, vice president for laboratory investigations at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said, “The bottom line is that Procter &amp; Gamble is really good in some ways and bad in others.” The company severed ties with an animal testing laboratory after a PETA investigation revealed that dogs had been mistreated, and it says that it has invested more than $250 million developing alternative testing methods, but it has not declared it will cease animal testing. (Among the top 25 dish soaps, only Seventh Generation and Method do not test on animals, according to a “cruelty-free company” compilation on PETA’s Web site.) Asked if Dawn itself is tested on animals, Ms. Baba of P.&amp; G. responded in an e-mail message, “We do not test finished products, which includes Dawn, on animals,” adding that “at some time over the 30-year history of Dawn, an ingredient may have been tested on an animal because the law required it or there was no alternative test at that time.” Ms. Guillermo of PETA said of the current Dawn campaign: “Anything a company does to help animals we applaud even if we have issues with their policies in their entirety. It sounds like they may have figured out the marketing advantage of helping  but in any case they’re helping.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 25, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/business/energy-environment/17green.html?ref=procterandgamble">Fight Grows Over Labels on Household Cleaners<date>Published: September 16, 2009</date><text>Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Mr. Clean, is under pressure to come clean itself.

Go to Blog » Manufacturers of detergents, household cleansers and furniture polish, like Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and others, are facing questions from consumers about the chemicals in their products. While many of the chemicals are present only in small amounts, some have been associated with asthma, birth defects and fertility problems in higher doses. And even if the amounts are low, consumer groups say, what is the effect of using these products over a lifetime? The questions have left the industry in an awkward position. It wants to be seen as environmentally sensitive and consumer-friendly. But at the same time, companies do not want to give competitors and makers of cheap knock-offs all the details of what goes into Pine-Sol, for instance, or Windex. So they have been working with consumer groups to devise a plan that could satisfy both sides. Come January, the industry has said it will voluntarily start to disclose much of what is in its cleaning products, which now represent a $14 billion-a-year business. Consumers will be able to call an 800 number, look at a Web site or, in some cases, simply check the product label to find the ingredients. The industry’s plan has been praised by consumer groups as a step in the right direction. “The voluntary plan is not perfect, but it is worlds ahead of where the industry was before,” said Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Women’s Voices for the Earth, a nonprofit group that published a study in 2007, “Household Hazards,” that catalogued potential health risks. “We had been talking about this issue for years, and now it is being fast-tracked.” But whether it goes far enough for some critics is another question. Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and other major companies have been sued in New York State by consumer groups seeking fuller disclosure. A measure has been introduced in Congress to require ingredient disclosure on all product labels. And in California, which has led the nation in passing “green chemistry” laws, an influential Democrat, State Senator Joe Simitian, said he would press for mandatory disclosure if the voluntary effort came up short. The government now requires only that ingredients posing an immediate danger be reported on product labels. Representative Steve Israel, Democrat of New York, argues that consumers have a right to know what is in the products in the kitchen and bathroom cabinets. He introduced the mandatory labeling bill. “The cleaning industry uses five billion pounds of chemicals in the United States, and we have little to no idea of what chemicals are inside these products,” he said. “It’s nonsensical that we have labels on food, but not on the cleansers on kitchen counters.” Mr. Israel’s measure has been criticized by the Consumer Specialty Products Association, a lobbying group for the industry that has been working with consumer advocacy groups to devise a plan that both can live with. So far, the association has been able to get entities as diverse as the Sierra Club and Procter &amp; Gamble to support the voluntary effort. “We’ve been working on this issue for years,” said Phil Klein, senior vice president for the industry association. “We’re trying to find a balance to protect confidentiality and product formulations with the need to be more transparent as to what’s in these products.” There are still points of contention. The voluntary industry plan covers four product categories  air fresheners, automotive care, household cleaners and floor polishes. It would require that all ingredients be listed in descending order of concentration, but amounts of less than 1 percent would not have to be ranked. Preservatives, fragrances and dyes  crucial ingredients that differentiate products but can contain potentially hazardous chemicals  are exempt from disclosure plan. Big fights are breaking out over small amounts of chemicals, since that is what the industry says is the “secret sauce” that makes products special  putting the lemony smell into Lemon Pledge, for instance. “Chemicals that make up 30 percent of a product are not the secret,” said Tom Neltner, co-chairman of the Sierra Club’s Toxic Committee. “But chemicals that represent only one-half or a quarter percent  anything below 1 percent is where the information becomes really confidential and proprietary.” That, he continued, is “the nub of negotiations right now. We care because if 99.5 percent of a product is water, and the last part is a fragrance that really hurts someone with asthma, we want to know.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 17, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/business/11procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">Procter &amp; Gamble Predicts Sales Will Recover in Fall<date>Published: September 10, 2009</date><text>Procter &amp; Gamble officials say they expect sales to begin rebounding this fall as the company cuts prices and adds new versions of its consumer products that emphasize value. The company, considered a household spending bellwether, has been hurt in the recession as consumers have cut spending and turned to store brands and other cheaper products, so the positive news was welcomed by the markets. On Thursday, Procter &amp; Gamble shares jumped $2.28, or 4.2 percent, to $56.04. Executives told investors they expected the sale of Procter &amp; Gamble’s prescription drug businesses to increase earnings by 32 to 34 cents a share this fiscal year. They also said they projected organic sales growth of 1 to 4 percent for the quarter ending in December. Organic sales, which are sales not related to acquisitions, have fallen the past two quarters. The company expects them to be flat or drop as much as 3 percent in the current quarter. Procter &amp; Gamble plans to cut prices on about 10 percent of its broad global portfolio and step up “value” pitches to consumers. Officials say they are cutting prices on Cheer brand laundry detergent; they have said they are also testing a low-cost version of their top-selling Tide. Jon Moeller, the chief financial officer, said the company was not counting on better market conditions, but expected investments in innovation, marketing and pricing to help sales. “We firmly believe we’ve made the right choices in the past year to deal with the global economic crisis, but we also know that we can and must deliver better overall results,” Mr. Moeller said. He said Procter &amp; Gamble expected solid earnings growth for its second quarter ending in December, but did not provide any figures. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected average growth of 97 cents a share. The company stuck to a first-quarter estimate of 95 cents to $1.

The sponsorship, expected to be announced Tuesday, comes at a key time for the United States Olympic Committee, which has struggled to attract and retain corporate partners in the recession. Company executives said the deal would involve 17 brands. Procter &amp; Gamble will capitalize on the Olympics’ appeal to women by running television advertisements for its beauty brands  including Olay, Pantene and Secret  during the Games. Olympic logos will appear on packaging and in-store displays to promote other products, like Charmin, Febreze and Scope. Consumer research has shown that the Olympics appeal particularly to women, teenagers and adults ages 18 to 34, said Kirk Perry, vice president for North America at Procter &amp; Gamble. “That encompasses our consumer base,” he said Monday in a telephone interview. “It connects at every income level. It is such an iconic and important event.” Officials at Procter &amp; Gamble and the U.S.O.C. declined to specify how much the agreement was worth, but Lisa Baird, the chief marketing officer at the U.S.O.C., said, “It’s a very significant sponsorship for us.” Baird said Procter &amp; Gamble had signed on as a partner, the highest level of engagement on the U.S.O.C.’s roster of sponsors. Partners typically pay $15 million to $25 million for the right to use the Team USA and Olympic logos within the United States for four years, said Jim Andrews, a senior vice president at IEG, a sponsorship consulting company in Chicago. “It’s certainly a huge win for the U.S.O.C. in a year that they needed one,” Andrews said. The U.S.O.C. is one of the few national Olympic committees that do not receive direct government money. Corporate sponsors accounted for 46 percent of the committee’s revenue between 2005 and 2008, according to Lindsay DeWall Hogan, a U.S.O.C. spokeswoman. Since the close of the Beijing Olympics last summer, at least six companies  including longtime supporters like Bank of America and Kodak  have declined to renew their sponsorships, and Baird said the U.S.O.C. was still in negotiations with AT&amp;T over whether it would renew its contract. Baird said her office was talking to a handful of other potential sponsors. A consumer survey in February, she said, showed that Americans saw “supporting Olympic athletes as an uplifting and uniting cause for our country, even in this climate.” But the Olympic brand has struggled recently as companies have moved away from campaigns that build generic brand awareness and toward promotions leading directly to sales. Some sponsors have questioned the value of investing in the Olympics, which occur once every two years. To address those concerns, the U.S.O.C. announced plans this summer to start a television network that would showcase Olympic sports year-round. The network has since been postponed after the International Olympic Committee and NBC, the Olympic broadcaster, raised questions about the deal. Several sports marketing experts said the Olympics continued to be a worthwhile investment. “Sports is a catharsis for people, even during very difficult economic times,” said Peter Graham, an Olympics expert and a professor emeritus at the University of South Carolina. “I think some companies are seeing this as an opportunity to buy in now, when their costs are a little bit lower.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on September 1, 2009, on page B16 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/business/media/17adnewsletter1.html?ref=procterandgamble">How Do I Pop Thee? Let Me Count the Ways<date>Published: August 17, 2009</date><text>If there are 50 ways to leave your lover, as Paul Simon once suggested, a brand of snack chips wants to double the ante. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A campaign to promote new Pringles Super Stack includes print advertisements. Multimedia Video Pringles Spot The Procter &amp; Gamble Company is sponsoring a sweepstakes that asks consumers to demonstrate the 100 ways they eat, munch, nosh and snack on its Pringles line of potato crisps. Fans of the brand can submit video clips, photographs or text messages in Twitter-sized, 140-count bites to a section of the Pringles Web site (pringles.com/100ways). The sweepstakes began on Aug. 5 and continues through Sept. 11. Prizes include a trip to New York City and $100 gift cards. The sweepstakes is part of a campaign promoting a restaging of Pringles, centered on the introduction of a larger container called the Super Stack can. The can contains, on average, 100 crisps, and weighs 6.4 ounces; previously, the regular variety of Pringles came in a 6-ounce can and there was no head count for the number of chips inside. The campaign, which carries the theme “Everything pops with Pringles,” includes television commercials, print advertisements, ads in stores, public relations and an extensive interactive component that involves, in addition to the brand’s Web site, presences on Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and YouTube. The campaign is being handled by a team of agencies owned by WPP. They include Grey New York, part of the Grey Group, for the creative duties; G2, also part of Grey, for elements in stores; Hill &amp; Knowlton, for public relations; MediaCom, part of GroupM, for the media duties; and Bridge Worldwide, for the interactive duties. The campaign is emblematic of efforts being made by giant marketers to spark renewed interest in familiar brands as consumers display continued reluctance during the recession to buy much beyond household necessities. Indeed, when Procter reported earnings earlier this month, executives said that sales of its discretionary products were particularly sluggish. Those lines include fragrances, hair care, batteries and snacks  i.e., Pringles. Pringles is the last major food brand owned by Procter, which in recent years has sold off food lines like Crisco shortening and cooking oil, Folgers coffee and Jif peanut butter. Analysts have speculated that the company may be interested in divesting Pringles, too, as it focuses on areas like beauty, household cleaning products and men’s care. Whether or not Pringles will be a Procter brand for another 40 years, the company is clearly devoting time and money to it, bringing out new varieties in addition to the Super Stack can. “There are new flavors, new sub-lines, new tastes,” says Bryan Hamilton, North America brand manager for Pringles at Procter in Cincinnati. Among them, he lists a line of “Extreme” flavors like “blazin’ buffalo wing” and “smokin’ hot ranch” and “Restaurant Cravers” flavors like onion blossom and cheeseburger. The idea behind the campaign is to let consumers “know we’re delivering more product than before,” Mr. Hamilton says, and having 100 or so crisps in each can reflects that “100 is a noticeable number.” “When we did research, consumers were pleasantly surprised over the number of crisps that were in the can,” he adds. The sweepstakes, soliciting material from consumers, reflects that “fun and playfulness have always been a part of our heritage,” Mr. Hamilton says, “and we wanted to make sure we give them an outlet.” There have been similar sweepstakes and contests before for Pringles, among them one that asked consumers for new commercial jingles. On the section of the Pringles Web site devoted to the sweepstakes, entries have already been posted. Some people are playing with their food, as in a video clip in which a woman flips chips into her mouth from a table. There are photographs of Pringles paired with a dish of macaroni and cheese and, oddly, of a woman eating Pringles while working out on an exercise bicycle at a health club. A TV commercial promises that “everything pops with the new Pringles Super Stack can” as a couple dances to the rock tune “Hooked on a Feeling.” The spot shows crisps emerging from a Pringles can like butterflies. And in a print ad, a kitchen counter looks as if a hole had to be cut into it to make room for a Pringles Super Stack can: “100 Pringles now in every Super Stack can,” the headline reads. “(Minor renovations not included.)” “We maybe slightly underestimated” the power of the message of 100 chips in the can, says Brett Banker, vice president and group management supervisor at Grey New York. “It was a magic number,” he adds, “compelling and engaging.” It is “a good time to bring this message to the forefront,” Mr. Banker says, referring to the economic climate. “A lot of brands are charging more, but you’re getting less,” he adds. “This is a tight message: ‘more to enjoy with the 100 crisps in a can.’ ” Consumers will find when they shop that as they get more Pringles, they are paying more, too. The average retail price rose from around $1.25 for the old can to $1.50 to $1.65 for a Super Stack can. “We haven’t taken pricing in 10 years in the category,” Mr. Hamilton says, using a marketing term that refers to a price increase. Mr. Banker says he believes the higher price should not pose a problem because “we have a great product at a great value.” “Pringles has always been seen as a good value,” he adds. “Though the price increase took place, you’re getting more per can.” The cost issue is addressed to some degree in the TV commercial, which compares 100 potato chips and 100 Pringles crisps. “Both cost the same, but only the Pringles Super Stack can makes everything pop,” the spot declares. “Same cost, but a lot more fun.” Makers of potato chips like the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo had been shrinking the sizes of their bags without lowering prices, thus increasing the cost of each chip. Frito-Lay has recently been promoting bags with “20 percent more” chips for brands like Lay’s, but it is difficult to determine whether or not the bags are now back to their previous sizes. Procter has been raising prices during the recession on many products, to counter rising energy and commodity costs. But in some categories , like detergents, that move has cost the company sales as consumers switch to cheaper brands. Procter is counterattacking with campaigns that proclaim its products, like Bounty and Charmin, may cost more than “bargain” brands but cost less on a per-use basis because they are of higher quality or efficacy. Another tack Procter is taking is to introduce lower-priced versions of its premium products like a variety of Tide named Tide Basic, which is being tested in about 100 supermarkets in the South and Southwest. What would a variety of Pringles called Pringles Basic be like? Perhaps, to quote a song by Chuck Berry, it would be too pooped to pop. ------- If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

Waving and smiling, he is clearly unaware that, dangling from his underarm to nearly his knee, is the word “idiot,” spelled out in white, foamy letters, which match bits of deodorant visible in his armpit. A bikini-clad woman looks up from a magazine at him, and the copy reads, “Residue Is Evil. Stop It.” Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A print ad from the Ever Clear campaign emphasizing to men the problem of deodorant residue. Related Accounts, People &amp; Miscellany (August 17, 2009) The new formulation by Old Spice, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand, uses less powder and wax than other P.&amp; G. deodorants, but it does not trumpet the claim typical for “invisible solids” and “clear gels” of keeping clothing free of deodorant streaks. Ever Clear is “not bringing it to life on the clothing like other brands have in the past,” said James Moorehead, an Old Spice brand manager. “For us, it’s really about what’s going on in the underarm.” Jason Bagley, a creative director at Wieden &amp; Kennedy, the Portland, Ore., agency handling the campaign, said the approach ensured the brand would not “sound like the 101 other antiperspirants that say they are invisible.” But men probably have not been lying awake at night worrying about whether their underarms were pristine, he conceded. “Our challenge was how do we bring that problem of having antiperspirant clumps in your pits more to life and have it be more unacceptable?” Mr. Bagley said. “And that’s what led us to the residue is evil campaign.” Other print ads, and a Web site, residueisevil.com, also highlight what Mr. Moorehead called “the social consequences of these big, ugly clumps.” In one ad, a young man talks to a woman on a basketball court as the word “nasty” comes out of one armpit, and “chump” out of the other; in another set in a sauna, the words “stupid” and “weirdo” dangle.  With a target market of males 12 to 34, Old Spice has  like the competing deodorant and body spray brand Axe  relied heavily on over-the-top humor and promises of having an aphrodisiacal effect on women. (P.&amp; G. said the product’s name being similar to Everclear, a brand of grain alcohol that might appeal to hard-partying young men because of its high alcohol content  up to 190 proof and illegal in some states  was strictly coincidental.) “There are certainly many instances of using humor to appeal to men in the personal care” arena, said Taya Tomasello, a men’s grooming market analyst at Mintel, a market research firm. “They’re really trying to appeal to younger men with this ad, and they’re doing a good job,” Ms. Tomasello said of the Ever Clear campaign. “It’s pushing the continuum a little bit further.” Old Spice also is specifically catering to African-Americans, who are featured in some ads, because, as stated in its marketing material, “underarm residue is especially a concern for darker skin tones where it tends to be more visible.” Ever Clear recently publicized a survey it conducted through the Web site AOL Black Voices, for example, with such findings as 31 percent of female respondents ranking men’s underarm residue as “very disgusting.”  The American deodorant market totaled $1.2 billion in revenue in the year ended July 12, up less than a percent over the prior year, according to Information Resources, whose data did not include Wal-Mart. Deodorant use is highest among younger consumers  about 10 applications a week for those 24 and under  and frequency drops with age, though never on average below once daily, according to Mintel. At one time consisting mostly of gender-neutral products, it is increasingly a his-and-hers category, with different formulations, scents and packaging  men’s sticks are considerably wider. “What we’re seeing is the genderization of the category,” said Kevin George, a general manager at Unilever, whose brands include Degree and Axe. “Ten years ago, the category was about 30 percent unisex, but now that’s just 5 or 6 percent.” Mr. George said that Unilever had weighed developing a men’s product that focuses explicitly on being invisible but has not done so because company research indicates it is less of a concern for men than for women in sleeveless dresses. He added that “you have to lower the active-ingredient levels in the product to avoid the white marks, and you have to apply a lot less to achieve it  a lot less than we know that guys use.” (Old Spice Ever Clear contains a 16 percent concentration of its active ingredient, while Old Spice Red Zone has a 19 percent concentration; directions recommend applying a “thin layer,” adding, “if you see white marks, you have applied too much.”) Speed Stick, on the other hand, is on the bandwagon. In March, the Colgate-Palmolive brand introduced Speed Stick Pro, a line consisting of three products “that provide customized ‘pit’ protection,” with Pro Skin for men with irritation-prone skin, Pro Extra Dry for profuse sweaters and Pro Clean for “guys needing a clean glide through hair” with a “clumping control formula,” according to a news release. Colgate-Palmolive declined interview requests. A current ad for Speed Stick Pro Clean illustrates the benefit much less graphically than Ever Clear, which is unusual in its approach of actually showing men’s underarms. The model for Speed Stick Pro Clean wears a shirt and is shown from the shoulders up. (He does have a beard, presumably to suggest hirsuteness.) Old Spice’s approach, meanwhile, was not without technical challenges. Instead of creating the effect in Photoshop, the agency sculptured words like “idiot” out of Styrofoam and attached it to models’ armpit hair (along with extra fake hair). The words were, additionally, held aloft with small cables, which were edited out of the photos. “Those things are light, but they are too heavy to hang from a dude’s armpit hairs,” said Mr. Bagley, of Wieden &amp; Kennedy.

Add to Portfolio ConAgra Foods Incorporated Sanofi-Aventis S.A RadioShack Corp Go to your Portfolio » The companies that have moved their ads elsewhere in recent days included ConAgra, Geico, Procter &amp; Gamble and the insurance company Progressive. In a statement that echoed the comments of other companies, ConAgra said on Thursday that “we are firmly committed to diversity, and we would like to prevent the potential perception that advertising during this program was an endorsement of the viewpoints shared.” The campaign against Mr. Beck is rooted in an advocacy group’s objection to the commentator’s remarks on July 28. Given the number of advertisers that have pledged to remove their spots, it appears to have been unusually successful.  Its success also indicates that as commentary on cable news reaches a rhetorical boiling point, advertisers may become more skittish about being near it. “We have TV today that’s very polarizing and controversial,” said Donny Deutsch, the advertising executive and occasional host on CNBC and MSNBC, a rival to Fox News. Last month, Mr. Deutsch listed some of the “Glenn Beck” advertisers and told MSNBC viewers that people who objected to Mr. Beck’s remark should write to the chief executives of the companies. In an interview, he said corporate decisions about where to allot ad dollars were the “ultimate check and balance.” The sponsors’ shifts came after a campaign by ColorOfChange.org, a black political coalition, to contact sponsors of Mr. Beck’s program. The remark by Mr. Beck, a conservative radio host and comedian who joined Fox News in January, came not on his 5 p.m. talk show but on “Fox and Friends,” a raucous morning program. That day, Fox News appeared to distance itself quickly from Mr. Beck’s remark that Mr. Obama was a racist, telling the TVNewser blog that Mr. Beck had “expressed a personal opinion, which represented his own views, not those of the Fox News Channel.” Two days later, ColorOfChange asked its 600,000 members to sign a petition addressed to Mr. Beck’s advertisers. It says more than 100,000 have signed. Fox said the campaign had no financial effect. “The advertisers referenced have all moved their spots from Beck to other day parts on the network, so there has been no revenue lost,” said a spokeswoman for the channel, a unit of the News Corporation. Still, ColorOfChange trumpeted the advertisers’ announcements as meaningful wins in news releases this month, and announced on Thursday that ConAgra, the pharmaceutical companies Roche and Sanofi-Aventis, and the electronics retailer RadioShack had pledged to remove ads from “Glenn Beck.” An official at RadioShack told the advocacy group that it had not bought time directly on Fox News, but that a third-party manufacturer had cited the retailer in its commercials. RadioShack said it had asked the manufacturer, magicJack, to “immediately cease and desist running all commercials with our name tagged in the spot“ on the Beck program. Other companies also said their spots had been scheduled during “Glenn Beck” by mistake. Ads for Procter &amp; Gamble and S.C. Johnson appeared on a weekend repeat of Mr. Beck’s program by mistake, Fox acknowledged. Progressive said that its advertising order had specified “no Glenn Beck,” but Fox said it had bought a block of time with the channel that included Mr. Beck. Past efforts to put pressure on cable news advertisers have met more resistance. In the spring, when the liberal group ThinkProgress protested Bill O’Reilly of Fox News by contacting corporate sponsors, most wrote back by blandly thanking them for taking the time to write. One Ford Motor employee even suggested they abandon the petition tactic, writing, “the silly form letters are just annoying and easy to delete.”  In the current media climate, one dominated by talk about health care and other politically tinged topics, hosts and commentators on TV and radio seemingly try to one-up one another with shocking comments every day. Recently, Lou Dobbs of CNN came under fire for raising questions about Mr. Obama’s citizenship. CNN said it had not seen any advertisers “looking to reallocate their money” from Mr. Dobbs’s program. What Mr. Beck said about Mr. Obama in July was “race-baiting packaged as news,“ said James Rucker, the executive director of ColorOfChange. (Mr. Beck declined to comment.) In what was ColorOfChange’s first direct appeal to advertisers, it told members it was fighting back by “hitting Beck where it hurts,” financially. The Beck program draws an average 2.2 million viewers a day, making it Fox News’s third-highest rated. Mr. Rucker acknowledged that advertiser campaigns are tough, saying that “things have to be at a certain level in terms of being pretty extreme” for the sponsors to take action. Mr. Deutsch, the chairman of the ad agency Deutsch Inc., said that “at a company like Procter &amp; Gamble or G.M., the C.E.O.’s don’t know where all those ad dollars are going.” When they find out that their messages are being associated with controversial comments, they often “decide they can go somewhere else,” he said. Calling Fox News a “good network,” Mr. Deutsch said advertisers could easily move their spots to other programs. That is what several sponsors said they have done. Mr. Rucker said some of the advertisers “didn’t even know that they were actually enabling Beck” when they were contacted. Mirroring the verbal combat among cable news channels, the advertiser pressure has become a divisive issue of its own. On conservative blogs this week, writers have questioned ColorOfChange’s motives and asked supporters of Mr. Beck’s to write to his advertisers as well.

But to harness the viral marketing of social media, Procter &amp; Gamble sponsored an event last week before the BlogHer 2009 conference in Chicago to present its updated Swiffer Wet Jet cleaning mop, which will be shipped to stores around Aug. 1. The company was the title sponsor of the Swiffer SocialLuxe Lounge, billed as a pampering party. More than 500 BlogHer participants stopped by on Thursday afternoon, which offered makeovers, a blogging awards presentation and stations to recharge phones and hand-held devices. One of the main stations at the event had a campy theme that allowed bloggers to test the new Swiffer and dress up as their favorite housewife character, like Lucille Ball or Marge Simpson. “These bloggers are influential,” said Beth Feldman, founder of RoleMommy.com, who was one of the six bloggers who organized the event. Even if bloggers did not write about the product, many sent messages through Twitter, posted updates on Facebook or reached out to their readers in other ways. More than 1,000 photos were uploaded from the event, thanks to another sponsor, Eye-Fi, Ms. Feldman said. “It’s not just about blogs anymore. It’s about the numerous ways you can get the word out to people that can make an impact,” she said. Companies are increasingly sponsoring blogging events, underwriting the travel costs for bloggers to attend tech conventions and even paying bloggers hundreds of dollars for postings or viral marketing campaigns. But Procter &amp; Gamble strictly underwrote part of the cost of the event itself rather than paying for any positive press, the company said. Bloggers who attended could request samples of the products for their trials or giveaways and provide their honest opinions, said Mark Mercurio, assistant brand manager for Swiffer. “Word of mouth is a very powerful tool,” said Mr. Mercurio, who added that the company monitored other feedback, like Amazon.com customer reviews and opinions from focus groups. “Consumers are increasingly investigating products online.” Andy Sernovitz, a blogger who monitors ethics, praised the guidelines set up by the BlogHer organizers. That does not mean, however, that paid content was a rarity at the Chicago conference. The BlogHer convention site offered plenty of giveaways and gift certificates worth hundreds of dollars that were underwritten by corporations.

For one thing, the conglomerate Kokusai Kogyo Holdings has sued the private equity firm’s chief operating officer, Mark Neporent, over governance issues  a suit Cerberus says has no merit. The firm’s funds also own 45 percent of Aozora Bank, which posted big losses for the year ending in March. Its investment looks to be still in the black over all, but Aozora’s shares have tumbled more than 75 percent since Cerberus took it public in late 2006. Now the buyout firm is eyeing Procter &amp; Gamble’s $3 billion prescription drug business, a transaction it would probably do with a partner. The investment would work a bit like a bond, throwing off fairly predictable amounts of cash for a finite period and then declining after its drug patents expire in a few years’ time. Doing a safe deal like this would put some of Cerberus’s unused capital to work, bring in a bit of cash flow  and, perhaps, soothe a few investors’ nerves. Still, it would really amount to damage control. Such an investment might stabilize the portfolio, but probably would not deliver outsize returns. Problems elsewhere could still easily re-emerge. Cerberus may be trying to move on, but its past missteps will not be so easily forgotten. Asia Is Recovering Will it be “V” for victory in Asia’s economies? The Asian Development Bank expects the region to recover quickly in 2010 from its sharp downturn, which is regarded as a V-shaped recovery. Trade has bounced back and domestic growth remains strong. The region’s manufacturing-oriented economies with modest budget deficits may now fare better than the centers of the financial crisis. In many cases, the region’s downturns were harsher in the first quarter of 2009 than those experienced in Western economies. For instance, the gross domestic product in Taiwan shrank by 10.2 percent, while Singapore’s dropped by 9.6 percent in the quarter. In comparison, the economy of the United States declined 2.5 percent, while Britain’s fell 4.9 percent. The differences seem surprising at first glance. The Asian Development Bank estimates that of the $1.5 trillion of global financial sector write-downs since September 2008, only $35 billion were in Asia. But the region had a different kind of collapse: exports tumbled around 30 percent. Trade has now recovered significantly, and Asian stock markets have risen by about 70 percent. Most regional economies are expected to post positive growth in the second quarter and to continue doing so thereafter. While the downturn has pushed the countries’ budget deficits higher, only Malaysia’s is expected to be above 5 percent of G.D.P. in 2009. Some worries over China’s financial sector aside, little appears to prevent the region from resuming growth based on domestic strength and an improving, if not stellar, export picture. That contrasts with the United States and Britain, where record budget deficits and sharply negative real interest rates are set to stunt future growth. The economic drag from correcting expansive and potentially inflationary monetary policies and servicing large government debt burdens may cause growth to remain subdued for years. So the Asian Development Banks prognosis sounds reasonable. With less financial sector drag, the region could well lead the way out with a relatively rapid V-shaped recovery.

In what other papers did this ad run? How often do those congratulatory full-color, full-page ads after a major athletic feat occur? What type of arrangement is made before publication of such an ad in the event the feat is not accomplished? Is there an alternative ad to be run or simply a smaller fee for running no ad but holding the position? I am curious because the Federer win of the Wimbledon men’s final occurred at around 2 p.m. Eastern time, which would have made it close to deadlines in the United States and possibly for deadlines in Europe. A: (Stuart Elliott) The ad from Gillette, part of Procter &amp; Gamble, that congratulated Mr. Federer on his record 15th Grand Slam singles title in tennis is one of many such ads that have appeared in recent years. They are typically bought by companies that have long-term or expensive endorsement deals with the winning athletes or teams. (That is not always the case. Sometimes, the ads try to ride on someone else’s coattails, celebrating a local team for winning, say, a Super Bowl or World Series without any formal ties between the marketer and the team.) In this instance, Mr. Federer is one of the superstar jocks who are major endorsers for Gillette, known as the Gillette Champions. Others include the soccer player Thierry Henry, Derek Jeter and Tiger Woods. That made it worthwhile for Gillette to face the expense and logistical challenges of running an ad based on breaking news. “It takes a big one” to justify such an ad, says Mike Norton, a spokesman for Gillette in Boston, “a monumental event for one of our athletes.” The ad was “a pre-arranged media buy,” he adds, purchased “several days in advance” of the match, which took place on July 5. The ad ran in four newspapers: The Boston Globe, The Cincinnati Enquirer (Cincinnati is home to Procter), The New York Times and USA Today. If Mr. Federer had not won, or had the match not been played for some reason, “we had a brand-specific ad” that would have run in place of the congratulatory ad, Mr. Norton says. As for the deadline, it has become much easier to deal with ads related to breaking news, he adds, because “the publishing business has become electronic” and ads can be sent quickly to newspapers (and magazines) to make last-minute closing deadlines. The newspaper ads saluting Mr. Federer were created by BBDO Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. “Congratulations, Roger,” they read, “on winning Wimbledon, setting a new record of 15 Grand Slam titles and redefining greatness.” There is also an invitation to “join the celebration” on gillette.com, where computer users can watch a tribute video clip and leave congratulatory messages. The milestone nature of the match won by Mr. Federer was underscored by the fact that the player who lost to him, Andy Roddick, was also the subject of a salute ad. One of Mr. Roddick’s sponsors, Lacoste, ran a newspaper ad that read: “Congratulations Crocodile Andy. Lacoste thanks Andy Roddick for his performance at Wimbledon.” It is rare that finishing second merits such a commercial tribute. There were also commercials on TV paying tribute to Mr. Federer, some of them running right after the match. They included Nike, NetJets and Rolex. Q: (Reader) I have been reading In Advertising for quite some time now and it never fails to brighten my day. I particularly love your Q &amp; A’s. I thought the July 6 installment was particularly ironic. I usually stop reading after the Q &amp; A as I really don’t know anyone in the field so the Webdenda section does not grab me. However, after reading the lead article about the True Value campaign and its coined word, “hardwarian,” it struck me that you have been using a self-made word of your own: Webdenda. It fits its subject perfectly, although “hardwarian” is still pretty good. Thanks for all the smiles. A: (Stuart Elliott) And thanks, dear reader, for your kind words.

Opts for an Insider as Its C.E.O.<date>Published: June 10, 2009</date><text>CINCINNATI (AP)  The consumer products company Procter &amp; Gamble said Wednesday that it had selected Robert A. McDonald as its chief executive, citing his broad experience and his 29 years with the company. Skip to next paragraph Tom Uhlman/Associated Press Robert A. McDonald will lead Procter &amp; Gamble on July 1. Mr. McDonald, who will take over July 1, has helped build the company’s developing markets business and restructure company operations. P.&amp; G. made the announcement on the long-expected succession a day after its board met in Cincinnati. A. G. Lafley, who became chief executive nine years ago this week, will remain chairman. He will be 62 Saturday. Mr. McDonald will be 56 later this month, before he moves up from chief operating officer to become company president and the 12th chief executive in the company’s 172-year history. He is a native of Gary, Ind., and a West Point graduate with considerable experience in the Asian region, where he sees strong growth opportunities. P.&amp; G. shares fell 33 cents, to close at $52.08. Mr. McDonald has said that P.&amp; G.’s fastest growth is coming from emerging markets, and that the company will aggressively step up its presence in the developing world, building new plants in countries as far-flung as Pakistan and Nigeria. He has said that P.&amp; G., whose sales and earnings growth have fallen during the recession, can more than double its annual sales, to $175 billion a year, over the next 15 years by increasing its reach into countries like India, China and Brazil. “There’s no question that the basic demographics are going to take the center of gravity of our business to Asia, to Africa  where the people are, where the babies are being born,” Mr. McDonald said in an interview last year. He became chief operating officer in 2007.

Skip to next paragraph The Olay Professional Pro-X campaign will focus on price and relative value. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The syndrome is named after the discounter that for years ran a campaign featuring fed-up car owners declaring, “I’m not going to pay a lot for this muffler!” What was an annoying slogan has morphed into a mantra as shoppers insist now they are not going to pay a lot for (insert product here, from soup to soap to shoes). The reluctance of consumers to spend  coupled with a sudden sharp rise in the savings rate  has left even the savviest marketers scrambling to reconsider their strategies. For instance, the Procter &amp; Gamble Company, the nation’s largest advertiser, announced last month that it would adopt a “surgical” approach to reducing prices in categories in which Procter brands are being perceived as costing too much compared with competitive products.  At the same time, Procter will also try to keep shoppers paying full price for the bulk of its brands by presenting them as more innovative or offering better value. Commercials for Tide detergent discuss how it is not as diluted as lower-priced alternatives and spots for Bounty call it more absorbent than a “bargain brand” of paper towels. “Value means different things to different people,” said Herb Walter, consumer packaged-goods and retail advisory partner at the Washington office of PricewaterhouseCoopers. “You almost have to think about it in the plural instead of the singular.” One type of consumer behavior that is becoming more prevalent, Mr. Walter said, is “paying closer attention to the spread of price points in a category  premium, midprice, lower  and more selectively choosing a price point.” “If it’s Johnny’s birthday and you’ve got the relatives coming, you may splurge a bit” on food and beverage brands, he added, “but if you’re buying midweek for the family, you may buy a more value-oriented product.” PricewaterhouseCoopers, along with the Grocery Manufacturers Association, plan to issue a report on Wednesday on the financial performance of marketers of consumer packaged goods. The report concludes that the industry is weathering the recession better than others because of a focus on delivering value along with innovation. Value “is not just about price,” said Clayton Wai-Poi, senior brand manager for Kraft Singles cheese slices at Kraft Foods in Northfield, Ill. As a result, “the role Kraft Singles can play in meeting mom’s needs in the current climate” extends beyond ads that describe how a meal of a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of Campbell’s tomato soup can “warm hearts without stretching budgets,” Mr. Wai-Poi said. There are also promotions sponsored by Kraft Singles with partners like the Walt Disney Company and Minor League Baseball, he added, that are centered on affordable family entertainment. And at Procter &amp; Gamble, a line featuring new products that cost $42 to $62 each  a far cry from the price of a bar of Ivory soap  is getting a value designation because, ads assert, it performs like product lines costing much more. The line is called Olay Professional Pro-X, part of the Olay skin-care brand. A print campaign from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, that is scheduled to begin in July for the Intensive Wrinkle Protocol  a regimen kit of three products  will carry this headline: “As effective at wrinkle reduction as what the doctor prescribed. At half the price.” The Pro-X items cost two or three times as much as the products in another Olay line, Total Effects, which cost about $20 to $25 apiece. “It is getting into higher price points,” said Tim Bunch, Olay Pro-X brand manager at Procter in Cincinnati. So “if you’re going to lay down that type of money,” he added, “it ought to be for a brand you believe in.” “With Olay, we’ve built that trust with women through the decades,” Mr. Bunch said. “A big element of value is standing behind your product, especially in beauty where so much is smoke and mirrors.” Since the line was introduced in January, “consumers have really responded,” he added, to the point where Procter executives now “project Olay Professional will be the largest skin-care launch in North America in year-one dollar sales.” Helping achieve those results, Mr. Bunch said, is an image for the Olay brand as one that “speaks straightforward and direct to consumers.” “We tell them what we believe the truth is,” he added, which includes an acknowledgment that not all women will achieve the same results after using Olay products.  “If you don’t see it for yourself, I would rather you find a product better suited to your needs,” Mr. Bunch said, and return the Olay items for a refund. Hmmmm. That calls to mind the scene from the classic movie “Miracle on 34th Street” when the Santa Claus at Macy’s (Edmund Gwenn) informs a skeptical shopper (Thelma Ritter) that the fire engine she wants to buy her son, which Macy’s does not have, can be found at another store. “The only important thing is to make the children happy,” Mr. Gwenn says. “Who sells the toy doesn’t make any difference. Don’t you feel that way?” Ms. Ritter replies: “Who, me? Oh, yeah, sure. Only I didn’t know Macy’s did.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on June 3, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/opinion/01mon4.html?ref=procterandgamble">The Lord Justice Hath Ruled: Pringles Are Potato Chips<date>Published: May 31, 2009</date><text>Britain’s Supreme Court of Judicature has answered a question that has long puzzled late-night dorm-room snackers: What, exactly, is a Pringle? With citations ranging from Baroness Hale of Richmond to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Lord Justice Robin Jacob concluded that, legally, it is a potato chip. The decision is bad news for Procter &amp; Gamble U.K., which now owes $160 million in taxes. It is good news for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs  and for fans of no-nonsense legal opinions. It is also a reminder, as conservatives begin attacking Judge Sonia Sotomayor for not being a “strict constructionist,” of the pointlessness of labels like that. In Britain, most foods are exempt from the value-added tax, but potato chips  known as crisps  and “similar products made from the potato, or from potato flour,” are taxable. Procter &amp; Gamble, in what could be considered a plea for strict construction, argued that Pringles  which are about 40 percent potato flour, but also contain corn, rice and wheat  should not be considered potato chips or “similar products.” Rather, they are “savory snacks.” The VAT and Duties Tribunal disagreed, ruling that Pringles  which have been marketed in the United States as “potato chips”  are taxable. “There are other ingredients,” the tribunal said, but a Pringle is “made from potato flour in the sense that one cannot say that it is not made from potato flour, and the proportion of potato flour is significant being over 40 percent.” An appeals court reversed, in a convoluted opinion that considered four interpretations of the law before ultimately rejecting three of them. In the end, it decided that Pringles are exempt from the tax, mainly because they have less potato content than a potato chip. The Supreme Court of Judicature reversed again, in an eloquent decision. Lord Justice Jacob, in an apparent swipe at the midlevel court, insisted the question was “not one calling for or justifying overelaborate, almost mind-numbing legal analysis.” The VAT and Duties Tribunal took an eminently practical approach, he said. It considered Pringles’ appearance, taste, ingredients, process of manufacture, marketing and packaging, and concluded that “while in many respects” they “are different from potato crisps and so they are near the borderline, they are sufficiently similar to satisfy that test.” The tribunal was not obliged, he said, “to go on and spell out item by item how each was weighed as if it were using a real scientist’s balance.” It came down to “a matter of overall impression.” The Supreme Court of Judicature had little patience with Procter &amp; Gamble’s lawyerly attempts to break out of the potato chip category. The company argued that to be “made of potato” Pringles would have to be all potato, or nearly so. If so, Lord Justice Jacob noted, “a marmalade made using both oranges and grapefruit would be made of neither  a nonsense conclusion.” He was even more dismissive of Procter &amp; Gamble’s argument that to be taxable a product must contain enough potato to have the quality of “potatoness.” This “Aristotelian question” of whether a product has the “essence of potato,” he insisted, simply cannot be answered. In the Pringles litigation, three levels of British courts engaged in a classic debate over line-drawing, a staple of first-year law school classes. At some point, a potato-chip-like item is so different from a potato chip that it can no longer be called one  but when? Lord Justice Jacob invoked the wisdom of Justice Holmes: “A tyro thinks to puzzle you by asking you where you are going to draw the line and an advocate of more experience will show the arbitrariness of the line proposed by putting cases very near it on one side or the other.” In other words, sometimes you just have to call them as you see them. Conservatives like to insist that their judges are strict constructionists, giving the Constitution and statutes their precise meaning and no more, while judges like Ms. Sotomayor are activists. But there is no magic right way to interpret terms like “free speech” or “due process”  or potato chip. Nor is either ideological camp wholly strict or wholly activist. Liberal judges tend to be expansive about things like equal protection, while conservatives read more into ones like “the right to bear arms.” In the end, as Lord Justice Jacob noted, a judge can only look at the relevant factors and draw an overall impression. His common-sense approach was a rebuke not only to Procter &amp; Gamble, but to everyone out there who insists that the only way to read laws correctly is to read them strictly.

Global Prestige Products group, part of its beauty and grooming division. The new space had to communicate the luxury that the company sells in high-end fashion fragrances like Lanvin, Gucci and Jean Patou, and reflect the radiance promised by hair and skin care products like Frédéric Fekkai and SK-II. Skip to next paragraph Ruby Washington/The New York Times Christopher Blackadder. Enlarge This Image Ruby Washington/The New York Times Portraits of models who have appeared in the companys advertising line the walls of the space, which was designed by Christopher Blackadder, principal with the New York office of IA Interior Architects. “It needed to delight all the senses,” said Carol Denison, creative director of beauty environments and culture at P.&amp; G., which is based in Cincinnati. The finished space delivers with an airy, sunlit labyrinth of glass partitions, mother-of-pearl finishes and romantic air-brushed photographs juxtaposed with views of the city skyline from its perch on the 20th and 21st floors at 909 Third Avenue, at East 54th Street. Designed by Christopher Blackadder, principal with the New York office of IA Interior Architects, in conjunction with Landor Associates, a marketing and branding company based in New York, the offices occupy 30,000 square feet spread over the two floors  the entire 21st and half of the 20th. The division was concentrated on the 20th floor before the renovation; it took additional space on the 21st that was formerly occupied by offices of Citibank. P.&amp; G. employees began moving into the renovated space in stages a year ago. Work was completed in January. A departure from P.&amp; G.’s corporate style of design, the new approach starts with the elevator lobby. Sustainable oak lines the walls, and the elevator doors are painted a shimmering abalone gray, framed in cream-colored lacquer. The white terrazzo floor is inset with a darker rectangle, distinguishing it from the main reception area visible through glass doors, where the terrazzo floor is all white. The doors open onto a long, wide corridor created by the glass walls of four large conference rooms. The architects placed the walls to give the reception area a “V” shape that widens from 12 feet at the entrance to about 20 feet at the back, where there are skyline views, facing south over East 54th Street, behind the reception desk. Overhead, a chandelier fashioned from Murano glass balls shimmers like bubbles in the light. The whole area is punctuated by a line of low benches covered in a vinyl satin the color of new spring leaves. “We wanted a bit of a ‘wow’ factor when people arrived,” Mr. Blackadder said. IA Interior Architects has 14 offices worldwide, 12 of which are in the United States, and collaborates with more than 50 partners around the globe. Each of P.&amp; G.’s four main conference rooms seats 18 people and is enclosed in frosted glass for privacy. White dominates the color scheme to better highlight products on display in horizontal lighted shadowboxes on a wall in each conference room. Above the boxes are a changing assortment of soft-focus photographs of models in diaphanous dress. Each room is equipped for teleconferencing and has a projection screen that comes down from the ceiling. The footprint of the 21st-floor space is a perfect rectangle that stretches all the way from Second to Third Avenue, with the elevator core at the center of one side. The 20th-floor space is also a rectangle, though half the size. In addition to the four principal conference rooms on the main floor, each level has a series of smaller ones, called huddle rooms, and other open spaces for more spontaneous meetings. Enclosed offices around the core have plain glass to maximize the flow of light. There is only one private office on the two floors  for Frédéric Fekkai, the hair stylist whose name appears on a range of products. All other staff members occupy work stations in the vicinity of the windows. In the former space, only 50 percent of staff members had work stations, but Mr. Blackadder wanted everyone to profit from the natural light. To that end, he also designed low-rise partitions for the work stations. Office layouts on both floors adhere to a certain rigid geometry, but fluid curves and gauzy images have been incorporated into the design to soften it. There are large portraits of models clad in soft billows of fabric (including the actress Cate Blanchett posing for the SK-II skin care line), and wavy walls serve as a foil to the straight walls elsewhere. A curved partition defines the kitchen-cafe area on the 21st floor, two of the four large conference rooms have curved walls, and another curved wall with partitions on the 20th floor creates private bays where visiting employees can set up shop and work. Christopher Martorana, an IA associate who collaborated on the project with Mr. Blackadder, and Susan Leone, also an associate, said the curves help to bring the look more in line with the concept of the P.&amp; G. beauty and grooming lines. “The curves soften it like the feeling of the long, wavy dresses in the photos and help it fall in line with the idea of the beauty products,” Mr. Martorana said. The 20th-floor cafeteria helps to soften the atmosphere, too, with white midcentury-style dining tables against a backdrop of bold green and purple patterns on an upholstered banquette. The adjacent lounge is downright whimsical, with a curved wall covered in a big bold field of plastic strips that appear to be woven together like the vinyl bands of a 1950s lounge chair. P.&amp; G. Beauty and Grooming has more than 170 brands of products geared to men and women. The products it markets under the banner of P.&amp; G. Global Prestige also include the Clairol and Wella hair color lines. Fragrances under the Prestige banner include Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Escada, Burberry, Hugo Boss and Valentino. The parent company, Procter &amp; Gamble, had net sales of $83.5 billion last year. According to Ms. Denison, the new headquarters for the Prestige family reflects the products themselves. “The light and the glow of the space make it really look like a prestige office that reflects the brands that live within,” she said. “If you are a beauty company, you have to live the dream.” More Articles in Real Estate » A version of this article appeared in print on May 3, 2009, on page BU15 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/business/media/27adnewsletter2.html?ref=procterandgamble">Q &amp; A with Stuart Elliott<date>Published: April 27, 2009</date><text>Q: (Reader) Procter &amp; Gamble has resurrected a Folgers coffee spot, first produced by N. W. Ayer in 1998. Do you think there’s any inside story as to why P.&amp; G. chose to do this? It’s also on YouTube at youtube.com/watch?v=ZjfFTxkiBSw&amp;NR=1. Besides the actual commercial, there are lots of interesting comments from viewers with fond memories of the spot. A: (Stuart Elliott) The commercial in question, called “A Dancer’s Morning,” is part of the long-running campaign for Folgers coffee that carries the theme “The best part of wakin’ up is Folgers in your cup.” The spot features a young woman waking up to her day of rehearsals for a dance troupe that resembles the “Riverdance” performers. The commercial has been brought back not by Procter &amp; Gamble, which owned Folgers when the spot was created, but by the J. M. Smucker Company, which recently acquired Folgers from Procter. “The iconic ‘Wakin’ up’ theme was launched in 1984, making 2009 its 25th anniversary,” Maribeth Badertscher, director for corporate communications at Smucker, writes in an e-mail message, “so as one point of celebration, we are airing one of the campaign’s most recognizable, beloved spots.” “We welcomed Folgers into the Smucker’s family last fall,” she adds, “and are thrilled people are taking notice and commenting on this longstanding Folgers campaign.” The current agency for Folgers is Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe. Ayer disappeared in 2002, after 133 years in business, when it was absorbed by the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York; both at the time were owned by an agency company called the Bcom3 Group. Ayer had lost the Folgers coffee account three years earlier, in 1999, when it was known as N. W. Ayer &amp; Partners; the assignment was shifted to D’Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles. When D’Arcy was closed in 2002, the Folgers account was awarded to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. The vintage Folgers spot is one of several older commercials that are back on TV. Others include a spot for MasterCard featuring beloved brand characters like Mr. Peanut and Charlie the Tuna bonding over dinner. In some instances, the comebacks are for nostalgic or commemorative purposes; in others, the spots are being brought back to save money by not producing new ones. Q: (Reader) Am I hearing things? The current Carnival Cruise Lines commercials have a musical ending, using “Anchors Aweigh.” Right before that music kicks in, there’s a segue that sounds so much like a bit of the “30 Rock” theme music. Coincidence? A: (Stuart Elliott) According to the Carnival agency, dear reader, you are indeed hearing things. “The music in the Carnival spot is ‘Anchors Aweigh,’ ” Lisa Unsworth, chief marketing officer at Arnold Worldwide in Boston, a unit of Havas, writes in an e-mail message. “We had a company called Music for Pictures produce the public domain version” of the song for the commercial, she says, and “there is no other music in the spot.” More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DEEDB163BF930A15757C0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">Drug Deals Tie Prices To How Well Patients Do<date>Published: April 23, 2009</date><text>Think of it as product guarantees by the drug industry. Pressed by insurance companies, some drug makers are beginning to adjust what they charge for their drugs, based on how well the medicines improve patients' health. In a deal expected to be announced Thursday, Merck has agreed to peg what the insurer Cigna pays for the diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet to how well Type 2 diabetes patients are able to control their blood sugar. And last week, the two companies that jointly sell the osteoporosis drug Actonel agreed to reimburse the insurer Health Alliance for the costs of treating fractures suffered by patients taking that medicine. ''We're standing behind our product,'' said Dan Hecht, general manager of the North American pharmaceutical business of Procter &amp; Gamble, which sells Actonel with Sanofi-Aventis. ''We're willing to put our money where our mouth is.'' Some experts hail such arrangements as a welcome step toward health care that rewards good outcomes for patients. ''We're going to see a growth in outcomes guarantees for pharmaceuticals, and it's very healthy,'' said Robert Seidman, a consultant who was formerly the chief pharmacy officer for WellPoint, an insurance company. Traditionally, discounts and rebates that drug companies offer insurers have been based on how much drug is used, not how well patients do. But the emerging, outcomes-based contracts would -- in theory -- better align the incentives of insurers, drug companies and the employers that provide health coverage toward improving people's health. Such pay-for-performance contracts started to take hold a few years ago in countries with national health systems, in which the government could effectively block a drug from being used if it was too costly. Johnson &amp; Johnson set what is considered the prototype deal in 2007 with Britain's national health system, which had tentatively decided not to pay for the cancer drug Velcade. To avert that decision, the company offered essentially a money-back guarantee. If Velcade did not shrink a patient's tumors after a trial treatment, the company would reimburse the health system for the cost of that patient's drug. In the United States, where insurance companies do not have national monopolies -- and where Medicare, by law, is precluded from negotiating drug prices -- insurers have less leverage with drug makers. Even so, they can give favorable treatment to certain drugs, by reducing the required co-payments, for example. Under the Actonel deal, if a patient insured by Health Alliance suffers a nonspinal fracture despite faithfully taking Actonel, the drug makers will help pay for the medical care -- spending $30,000 for a hip fracture, for instance, and $6,000 for a wrist fracture. This clearly lowers the cost of the drug to Health Alliance, a small insurer in Illinois and Iowa. But Procter &amp; Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis might benefit as well. The deal could reduce the pressure on the insurance company to move patients off Actonel, which costs about $100 a month, to less-expensive generic versions of Fosamax. And the insurer has kept Actonel in a tier of its drug list that requires a smaller co-payment than for a competing brand-name drug, Boniva. The deal between Cigna and Merck is more complex. Rather than getting paid more for good results, Merck will actually give Cigna bigger discounts on Januvia and Janumet. Some discounts will be granted if more people diligently take the drugs as prescribed. This helps both Cigna, because people who take their pills are likely to have fewer complications from the disease, and Merck, because it sells more pills. The assumption is that Cigna will push for patient-compliance programs that urge people to take their medicine at the right times and in the proper doses. Moreover, in an unusual move, Merck will offer even greater discounts to Cigna on Januvia and Janumet if patients' blood sugar is better controlled -- regardless of whether the improvement comes through Merck's drugs or other medications. In effect, though, Merck is betting not only that its drugs prove superior but that Cigna's incentives to reap the benefits of the deeper Januvia and Janumet discounts will prompt the insurer to try to keep patients on those drugs. As part of the agreement, too, Merck will get better placement for Januvia and Janumet on Cigna's formulary, meaning a lower co-payment for patients than for some other branded drugs. The deal was made with the pharmacy benefit management division of Cigna, which manages prescriptions for 7.1 million people. Merck declined a request for an interview. In a statement the company said it was ''committed to finding new approaches to demonstrate the value of our products to patients, physicians and payers.'' Januvia, approved in 2006, costs about $150 a month. Janumet, approved a year later, is a combination of Januvia and metformin, a widely used generic drug. Eric Elliott, the president of Cigna Pharmacy Management, said his company was negotiating similar contracts with other drug makers. ''We wanted a contract that drives performance,'' he said. ''Getting this one out will provide more momentum.'' PHOTO: Januvia, by Merck, is part of a cost-control deal with Cigna.(PHOTOGRAPH BY MERCK, VIA BLOOMBERG NEWS)(pg.

But the ads have grown less oblique in recent years, and a new campaign for Tampax uses elements that were once unheard-of in ads for tampons and sanitary napkins: candor and even humor. In a series of television spots by Leo Burnett Worldwide for Tampax Pearl, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand, an actress depicting Mother Nature approaches women and gives them a present wrapped in red, representing the onset of their menstrual cycle. In one ad, she presents the red box to a woman sunning on a beach in a white bikini. “Mother Nature here, bringing Kate her monthly gift: Her period,” says the actress, who is in her 40s and is smartly dressed in a Jacqueline Onassis-style green suit, her pinched smile suggesting a sinister edge. Looking at the skimpy bikini, she says, “Good luck wearing that with backup,” an expression for using a sanitary napkin as reinforcement for a tampon. But Kate reaches into her beach bag, pulls out a box of Tampax Pearl tampons, and winks triumphantly at the camera. The voice-over tag line: “Outsmart Mother Nature  with Tampax.” Tampax has been running several ads in the campaign since July, and this month it will introduce another, in which Mother Nature interrupts a woman’s steamy dream with the red gift, as well as an online-only video where the actress thrusts the package at unsuspecting women on the street, an unscripted video using nonactors who subsequently signed releases. Becky Swanson, a creative director from the Chicago-based Leo Burnett USA on the Tampax account, said that the campaign was intent on avoiding oft-parodied clichés. “There are no walks on the beach, no riding a white horse or sitting on a white couch, and no conversations between a mother and a daughter about ‘that not-so-clean feeling,’ ” Ms. Swanson said. The Mother Nature character was developed to be a “worthy opponent who is all-powerful and very much in control, more of a mother-in-law figure,” Ms. Swanson said. While the target audience is vast, she said, “the idea of having this worthy opponent really resonates with younger girls, because when someone tries to tell them how to lead their life or what they can or cannot do, they want to outsmart that person.” Using the word “period” in commercials is something Tampax has been doing only in recent years, but Ms. Swanson says that newer spots drop the word as women become more familiar with the campaign, making it unnecessary to spell out what the red gift represents. Procter &amp; Gamble’s most prominent use was in the “Have a happy period” campaign for the company’s Always sanitary napkins, ads that began in 2005 and continue today.  Patricia Perez-Ayala, vice president of Procter &amp; Gamble’s feminine care division, says that while most women alternate between tampons and sanitary napkins depending on the stage of their menstrual cycles, the company’s research indicates that they generally have a preference, or “mind-set.” “A pad mind-set is much more embracing the period and is much more accepting because it’s part of being a woman,” Ms. Perez-Ayala said. Women who have favored tampons have a different attitude. “A tampon mind-set is like, ‘Period  what period? I don’t even want to talk about it,’ ” Ms. Perez-Ayala said. The Always and Tampax campaigns speak to those contrasting views  the idea of Mother Nature’s being an opponent would most likely be anathema to a devoted pad user, as would the notion of a “happy period” for those who favor tampons. According to a report from Mintel, a market research firm, the United States tampon market was worth $610 million in 2008, a drop of nearly 1 percent from the previous year. The report also said growth in the market had been sluggish since 2005 because baby boomers were reaching menopause and were no longer using menstrual and birth control products. Tampax brands lead the tampon category, with 49 percent of the market, followed by Playtex brands (25 percent), Kotex (10 percent) and O.B. (6 percent), according to Mintel. Kotex, made by Kimberly-Clark, declined a request for an interview about its marketing efforts, as did representatives from O.B. (made by Johnson &amp; Johnson) and Playtex (a division of Energizer Holdings Inc.). 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 20, 2009, on page B7 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/business/10procter.html?ref=procterandgamble">A Top Executive Steps Down at Procter &amp; Gamble<date>Published: March 9, 2009</date><text>CINCINNATI (AP)  Procter &amp; Gamble announced that Susan E. Arnold, who had been widely considered a candidate for chief executive, resigned Monday as president for global business units. Ms. Arnold was the highest-ranking woman at Procter &amp; Gamble and had achieved several firsts for a woman at the company. She and the chief operating officer, Robert A. McDonald, were promoted in 2007 in what some analysts perceived as setting up a succession for the chairman and chief executive, A. G. Lafley. The resignation leaves Mr. McDonald as the front-runner to lead the company, which makes consumer products, including Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette razors. Procter &amp; Gamble said Ms. Arnold would retire Sept. 1 after 29 years with the company, which is based in Cincinnati. The announcement said she had long intended to step down when she turned 55. Her birthday was Sunday. Ms. Arnold will report on special assignment to Mr. Lafley until she retires. Her job will not immediately be filled, and the company said three vice chairmen who had reported to her will now report to Mr. Lafley, ”reducing a layer of management as part of the company’s ongoing simplification effort.” Ms. Arnold, who was the first woman to be president of Procter &amp; Gamble and the first vice chairwoman, is frequently ranked among the most powerful women in American business. She was named vice chairwoman for beauty in 2004, then vice chairwoman for beauty and health in 2006. She is on the boards of several companies, including the McDonald’s Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, and will continue in those roles, Procter &amp; Gamble said.

BALMAIN A spangled jacket over split-front harem pants. ROCHAS A trouser suit and a knitted jacket and dress.

In another echo of genuine hard times, the models at Balenciaga had their eyebrows blotted out so they appeared to be wearing little makeup. Ahead of reports that France will suffer its worst postwar recession this year, two far-sighted designers conjured the 1940s. Presenting his first collection today for Rochas  a mixture of masculine tailoring and discreet feminine details  Marco Zanini said, “In my fantasy trip about what is French, I didn’t want to look at any one decade, but Paris during the occupation is very meaningful.” A former designer at Versace, who most recently worked at Halston, Mr. Zanini did an excellent job imparting French savoir faire. With no long dresses and only a slip as a foundation, his Rochas is a departure from the drama of Olivier Theyskens, its former designer, and, despite the flashback, is more contemporary. At Balenciaga, Nicolas Ghesquiere had Yves Saint Laurent in his sights, but the lodestar for Saint Laurent was the ’40s. The era informed one of his most daring collections as it agitated clients. Held in a salon at the Crillon overlooking the Place de la Concorde, instead of in his cramped Left Bank showroom, Mr. Ghesquiere’s show included dresses and trousers in lavishly draped satin. Lately, his clothes have looked hard, molded and probably mystifying to people who don’t follow these shows closely. If this collection seems more romantic, more feminine and more accessible, it may be because Mr. Ghesquiere, like other designers, has to think harder about selling clothes. Accordingly, he had spotty print dresses inspired by the Balenciaga archive, including one in sparkling green-and-black leopard spots. Jackets were sharp-shouldered, fitted though roomy, and the best of the lot was shown over a black lace bandeau top with gray-striped pants. The swags of satin drapery on skirts and trousers may have unfortunate associations to the ’80s, and certain prime-time queens. But in the blend of colors like Persian blue and green, in the alert cut of the shoulders, in the bangles stacked on wrists, in the erotic strips of black lace, these clothes also evoke Saint Laurent. And as a modern interpretation of his style, it was a good one. There were a number of Saint Laurent muses in the room, including Catherine Deneuve and Loulou de la Falaise, who worked with the designer for three decades. “I think Yves would have liked this interpretation very much,” Ms. de la Falaise said. She did. After the show, several French editors stood waiting for the backstage area to clear and the kissing to stop. There was Loïc Prigent and Agnès Boulard, who collaborate on documentaries and a French television program; Carine Roitfeld, the editor in chief of French Vogue; and Emmanuelle Alt, the magazine’s fashion director. Ms. Roitfeld had on a Balenciaga coat over a black lace top, Ms. Alt skinny jeans and a silver braided Balmain jacket, Ms. Boulard a little peak-shoulder jacket. Their hair was long, and they wore little if any makeup. With a wave of his hand, Mr. Prigent said: “Look at her, look at her. This woman still exists. It’s so French, this look. It’s not Saint Laurent, it’s the woman. She’s a Paris lady. She smokes in the building even if it’s forbidden.” The women kind of shrugged. “We’re all blond inside,” Ms. Roitfeld said. Rochas more or less disappeared after its owner, Procter &amp; Gamble, pulled the plug on its small fashion operation about three years ago and let Mr. Theyskens go. Procter &amp; Gamble still owns the brand, but it’s now produced in Italy by Gibo, with Mr. Zanini as creative director. If he could find the design codes at two labels as different as Versace and Halston, there’s no reason to think he can’t succeed with a French house. “Creativity doesn’t have a passport,” he said. “You apply your creativity to whatever you do.” Although the slip dress is the basis for the collection, Mr. Zanini’s skills shone in the tailoring  in the soft, natural drape of black bouclé jacket with hand-stitching on the lapel, in a handsome gray blazer, in small details like a wide piece of cream silk ribbon sewn into the interior of the jackets. But then he likes small surprises, like the Rochas name tucked inside the pocket of a cardigan or a cuff. Skirt linings have a tiny hem of white crochet, a lingerie detail you can show or not. And many of his dresses are as simple as a T-shirt but have seductive elements like a black illusion panel under each arm or a geometric play of black and navy beads on net. Gareth Pugh, the London designer, showed a video of his clothes. While the film perfectly expressed his dark vision, it also didn’t reveal much more than that. Rick Owens had a solid, tough show: heavily layered with cutaway jackets in black, white and plaster gray. Papery gold wrappers closed asymmetrically over some looks, and details included intricate quilting and taut boots that puffed at the back like bellows. Balmain drew a crowd on Thursday at the Ritz. The French dearly love Christophe Decarnin’s cool jackets and sexy pants (now harem-style with slits up the front), but to an American, at least, listening to the disco remix  well, it’s as if a woman has stepped into a pail of glitter on her way to see “Dancing With the Stars.” Oops!

The company lowered its earning projections for the full year, and said it expected total sales to fall in the current quarter and possibly for the year. Procter &amp; Gamble said it earned $5 billion, or $1.58 a share, for the quarter, which ended Dec. 31 and was the second quarter of Procter &amp; Gamble’s fiscal year. That compared with $3.27 billion, or 98 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The most recent quarter included a one-time gain of 63 cents as a result of the sale of its Folgers unit to the J. M. Smucker Company. Sales in the period fell 3.2 percent, to $20.37 billion, from $21.04 billion. The company, whose brands cover a wide range of household, beauty and personal care products like Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette shavers, said sales declined as a result of lower volume and a stronger dollar. It also confirmed that organic sales  those not related to acquisitions  had slowed below its targets. Alan G. Lafley, the chief executive, said Procter &amp; Gamble was trying to increase its market share through promotions like offering more coupons and by emphasizing value to lure budget-minded consumers. Shares of Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, fell $3.72, or 6.4 percent, to $54.50.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tide Total Care and Downy Total Care from Procter &amp; Gamble on display next to clothing at Ann Taylor Loft stores. Add to Portfolio Ann Taylor Stores Corporation Go to your Portfolio » For consumers, that means finding creative ways to stretch a paycheck, like shopping at less expensive stores or machine-washing clothes that would normally be dry cleaned. For retailers, it means helping customers cut back  even if it means going outside their comfort zone. A new partnership between the retailer Ann Taylor Loft and Procter &amp; Gamble is turning stores into launching pads for two new products, Tide Total Care and Downy Total Care. Both products claim to cut down on dry cleaning bills by helping clothes look new for a longer time. The store chain is handing out free samples and coupons to customers who buy machine washable clothes, while posters and decals throughout the stores alert customers to the products’ benefits. The retailer has also produced an eight-page magazine, available free in its stores, that provides tips on how to keep clothes looking fresh (hint: they require Tide or Downy Total Care). The arrangement may be the first of its kind between a consumer packaged goods company and a fashion retailer, most of whom avoid associating themselves with laundry detergent. But dwindling store traffic and budget-conscious shoppers have retailers like Ann Taylor experimenting. “The partnership between Loft and P.&amp; G. is not typical, and we admit that at first we had concerns,” said Robert Luzzi, chief marketing officer of Ann Taylor Stores. “But we decided that the partnership at this time was incredibly relevant for our clients in this pretty tough economy.” The promotion started in September and will run through November. Ann Taylor operates about 360 of its stores and more than 500 of its lower-price Loft outlets in the United States, but announced plans this year to close about 117. (The company’s stock has dropped by about 10 points in the last year.) Overall sales in the women’s apparel category have dropped by about 3 percent, according to the research firm NPD. “The economy is fairly tough right now, and we want to deliver value for our clients,” Mr. Luzzi said.  For Procter &amp; Gamble, which is based in Cincinnati, the introduction of the Total Care line represents years of research into preserving the shape and color of clothes after repeated washes. The ads assert that they keep clothes looking new for up to 30 washes. At a time when people are looking to save money, Procter &amp; Gamble sees an opportunity to attract customers who will gladly machine-wash clothes they formerly dry cleaned if there is no loss in quality. “Women and families can’t afford to buy clothes as frequently, and are searching for ways to keep clothes looking newer longer,” said Kash Shaikh, a manager of communications for the North American fabric care unit of Procter &amp; Gamble. “Women spend $1,500 a year on dry cleaning, and 65 percent of those clothes are actually machine washable.” The company is spending $60 million to market the new products, the largest marketing investment ever in its fabric care category, Mr. Shaikh said. Tide accounts for $3.2 billion in annual sales, and Downy about $1 billion, he said. Pairing a retail brand with a product like detergent is “definitely a new and cool idea at this level,” said Mike Gatti, executive director of the National Retail Federation, a trade group. “Target did it years ago by making ads that featured lots of different brands, but this is different because it’s a high-end clothing store.” It is a message that could resonate now, which would be good news for struggling retailers like Ann Taylor, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD. Retailers are looking “for any reason they can give customers to come in,” he said. “This message is different. It says, ‘We understand you want clothes that are going to last.’ ” In addition to the partnership with Ann Taylor, the introduction includes three TV commercials  one for Downy and two for Tide  and special events and Web promotions. P.&amp; G. is also running print ads, some of which include the Ann Taylor brand, for the first time in fashion magazines like Elle and InStyle. The TV spots are running on networks like NBC, ABC and CBS. The ads for Tide were created by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe; ads for Downy were created by Grey, part of the WPP Group. Procter &amp; Gamble has also enlisted the help of fashion arbiters like Tim Gunn from the Bravo series “Project Runway” and the celebrity stylist Jorge Ramon, who make several appearances throughout the campaign. The idea is to assure women that they do not need to spend a lot of money on dry cleaning to keep their clothes looking stylish.  Indeed, Procter &amp; Gamble said it approached Ann Taylor because the stores appealed to the target audience for the new detergents: budget-conscious women who are interested in fashion. “This idea of fashion combining with value, that’s why Loft was a perfect fit for us,” Mr. Shaikh said. In addition to the giveaways and signs, Ann Taylor Loft will hold events around the country in coming months where women will have a chance to get personal styling tips from Mr. Ramon.

He was 92. The cause was pneumonia, said his son, Jon Peters. The elder Peters played many supporting roles in his career, usually as a heavy or villain. But he is best remembered as Mr. Clean, a muscular man with a no-nonsense attitude toward dirt and grime. From the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, he helped advertise the household cleaner. Mr. Peters's prime acting career ran from mid-1930s to the late 1960s. He worked with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry on their television shows and appeared in ''Perry Mason,'' ''Gunsmoke,'' ''The Twilight Zone'' and ''Lassie.'' He also wrote an autobiography, ''Another Side of Hollywood,'' in which he describes growing up the son of an actress and silent film actor in Beverly Hills, Calif. His father, Robert House Peters Sr., has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Robert House Peters Jr. was born Jan. 12, 1916, in New Rochelle, N.Y. He studied drama in high school and became inspired to pursue acting as a profession. Besides his son Jon, his survivors include his wife, Lucy Pickett; a daughter; another son; and four grandchildren. PHOTO: House Peters Jr., who played cowboys for decades.

With her sharpish features and flair for courting controversy, Ms. DeGeneres, 50, would seem an unlikely candidate to represent a major cosmetics brand. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Ellen Degeneres Dove did not mind freckles. Celebrities in campaigns like Andie MacDowell. Reba McEntire in an ad. But her attributes  even the negative ones  are among the reasons that CoverGirl, the beauty industry giant, announced last week that it had hired her to be the face of its next advertising campaign. “Ellen is an authentic beauty,” said Esi Eggleston Bracey, a vice president of Procter &amp; Gamble, the parent company of CoverGirl. Ms. DeGeneres appeals to consumers who are “looking not so much for a role model as a woman they can relate to both physically and emotionally,” Ms. Eggleston Bracey said. “In Ellen, she sees a slightly better version of herself, someone appealing from the inside out.” Ms. DeGeneres, who will start to appear in the company’s ads in January, is not the first unconventional model for CoverGirl, which veered away from its longtime mascot, Christie Brinkley, more than a decade ago. But she does represent the type of celebrity whom cosmetics companies are approaching as they widen their talent pool, seeking out endorsers whose chief drawing card is a knack for charming Everywoman. The selection of Ms. DeGeneres is simply the industry’s latest bid to reach out to women who consider themselves disenfranchised because they do not look like Kate Moss. “We don’t need to see another ingenue rocking to the top  we’ve had a few,” said Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor in chief of More, a magazine for women over 40. “We’re getting worn out by the Lindsays and the Britneys, and I think we need a break.” Industry figures seem to bear out that assertion. Sales of mass market cosmetics plunged 6 percent in the first quarter of 2008 compared with the same quarter in 2007, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. While the sector shows signs of recovery, “over all, the first half of 2008 is one of the slowest periods we have seen, ” said Karen Grant, a beauty analyst for NPD. In such a climate, major brands find themselves retooling their ads to reach shoppers who would prefer to see a glamorously packaged version of themselves. “Women don’t necessarily want to look slimmer, younger or more stylishly turned out,” Ms. Seymour said. “They just want to be the best that they can be for the stage of life that they are in.” They are less likely to identify with Lindsay Lohan than, perhaps, with Andie MacDowell, 50, whose crows’ feet are discernible in a L’Oreal print campaign for RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle Concentrate; or Diane Keaton, who at the age of 62 has been talking up L’Oreal’s hair color and Age-Perfect Pro Calcium moisturizer. Older women are not the only targets of such campaigns.

Such celebrities are “approachable,” said Jody Crane, president of New Solutions Marketing, a consultant to large corporations, and “with approachability comes relevance. Shoppers look at them and tell themselves, ‘Oh, I can see myself using this product.’ ” CoverGirl is the top mass-market makeup brand in America in sales and consumer awareness, according to Ms. Grant of NPD.

With her sharpish features and flair for courting controversy, Ms. DeGeneres, 50, would seem an unlikely candidate to represent a major cosmetics brand.

But her attributes  even the negative ones  are among the reasons that CoverGirl, the beauty industry giant, announced last week that it had hired her to be the face of its next advertising campaign. “Ellen is an authentic beauty,” said Esi Eggleston Bracey, a vice president of Procter &amp; Gamble, the parent company of CoverGirl. Ms. DeGeneres appeals to consumers who are “looking not so much for a role model as a woman they can relate to both physically and emotionally,” Ms. Eggleston Bracey said. “In Ellen, she sees a slightly better version of herself, someone appealing from the inside out.” Ms. DeGeneres, who will start to appear in the company’s ads in January, is not the first unconventional model for CoverGirl, which veered away from its longtime mascot, Christie Brinkley, more than a decade ago. But she does represent the type of celebrity whom cosmetics companies are approaching as they widen their talent pool, seeking out endorsers whose chief drawing card is a knack for charming Everywoman. The selection of Ms. DeGeneres is simply the industry’s latest bid to reach out to women who consider themselves disenfranchised because they do not look like Kate Moss. “We don’t need to see another ingenue rocking to the top  we’ve had a few,” said Lesley Jane Seymour, the editor in chief of More, a magazine for women over 40. “We’re getting worn out by the Lindsays and the Britneys, and I think we need a break.” Industry figures seem to bear out that assertion.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A scene from the new Folgers TV commercial that features the sounds heard in a kitchen, such as the opening of drawers, the tinkling of a spoon in a coffee cup and the squeaking of slippers. Add to Portfolio Starbucks Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Folgers new print ad featuring preroasted coffee beans. The competition  shops like Starbucks, Cosi or Caribou  can now be found on every corner, all brewing coffee made from pricey Arabica beans. Mainstays like Folgers  which relies on less expensive Robusta beans  have competed by focusing on cost-conscious home brewers, often by introducing flavored coffees or specialty brews. Now Folgers, which is still the top-selling packaged coffee in the United States, is trying to lure customers with an approach to roasting that it calls “the biggest innovation since the launch of decaf.” The company will unveil the roasting method with an ad campaign that it says is the most expensive in the history of the brand.  “Over the last 8 to 10 years, we have been working on ways to drive technology to improve the cup-to-cup consistency and flavor quality of our coffee,” said Jamie Egasti, president of coffee for Procter &amp; Gamble. This year, Procter &amp; Gamble sold the Folgers brand to the J. M. Smucker Company for $2.95 billion in stock. The deal is expected to close before the end of the year. P.&amp; G. has overhauled its main roasting plant in east New Orleans  which employs more than 400 people  to include a step it calls “predry” or “preroast.” Each bean is fully dried before roasting, ensuring a more evenly cooked bean, which makes it less bitter. “This is the largest technical investment in our roasting facility we have done,” Mr. Egasti said. Jim Trout, innovation leader for research and development, at P.&amp; G., said: “It’s like thawing a turkey before you cook it. If you don’t, the outside will be burnt and the inside will still be raw. This way it cooks evenly all the way through.” While the company is realistic about its chances of swaying those in the habit of drinking Starbucks coffee, Folgers believes there is room to win customers among those who brew at home. “Given the economy, there is an opportunity to underscore what Folgers offers with people who may have been going out more frequently than they do today,” said Marnie Kain-Cacossa, executive vice president, global equity director at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi New York, Folger’s ad agency of more than 50 years. The ad campaign includes a TV commercial, print ads, in-store signage, coupons and Web banner ads. The packaging of Folgers’ coffee has also been overhauled to include information about the roasting process. The 30-second TV spot features a man in pajamas preparing coffee as the sounds of a typical morning  kitchen drawers opening, slippers squeaking, a spoon clinking inside a mug  are heard at high volume. The sound effects are intended to deliver a “heightened sense of reality that mirrors the enhanced coffee,” Ms. Kain-Cacossa said. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi created the campaign, as well as the “Best part of waking up” jingle, which first aired in 1984. The jingle appears in the new TV spot, though without lyrics. Ms. Kain-Cacossa said research showed that the jingle was recognizable to consumers without the slogan. The spot will first appear Sept. 29, and run largely on women-oriented networks like Lifetime, HGTV, Food Network and the Soap Network. Neither P.&amp; G. nor Saatchi would disclose a specific budget for the campaign, but it is expected to be in the low six figures. Ms. Kain-Cacossa called it “the largest marketing investment in the history of Folgers.”  Print and Web ads will focus on images of the red Folgers canister transformed into a roaster, with copy reading, “Every mountain-grown bean of Folgers is roasted with care, using just the right amount of heat. So every morning, you can wake up to rich, pure taste.” This is not the first time that Folgers has tried to keep pace with the changing tastes of coffee drinkers. The company introduced flavored coffees in 2002, and in 2006 released gourmet roasts with names like caramel drizzle and espresso roast. It has even introduced a variety called Simply Smooth, intended to lessen the chance for an upset stomach. A coffee industry analyst and consultant, Judy Ganes, said that despite the change in consumer coffee habits in the last decade, Folger’s and Maxwell House were still by far the dominant coffee brands on the market and could capture an even greater share as consumers on a budget return to home brewing. “People may be willing to forgo the high end but don’t want to have a bad cup of coffee either,” she said. “When people are trying to watch their wallets, they may be willing to give this a try.” That shift has yet to show itself in the marketplace. According to the National Coffee Association, 17 percent of adults in the United States drank a gourmet coffee beverage every day in 2007, a record high. Over all, coffee consumption dipped to 80 percent of the population in 2007, down from 82 percent the year before. The sale of Folgers was part of an effort by P.&amp; G. to refocus on core businesses, namely global health and beauty brands, and those that show growth of at least 4 percent annually. Folgers grew by about that much in 2007, but is sold only in North America. “The margins that you can earn in the health and beauty space are significantly above those in food and beverage,” Mr. Egasti said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 22, 2008 The Advertising column on Friday, about a marketing campaign by Folgers coffee, misstated the type of coffee beans used by a rival, Maxwell House. It primarily uses Arabica beans, not the less expensive Robusta.

But now that oil costs are plunging, other prices are not following them lower -- not yet, anyway. Even though oil prices have fallen closer to $100 a barrel, from $147 about two months ago, many companies that cited higher energy costs for increasing prices are resisting a rollback, saying they still need to recover money lost in the run-up. Crude oil prices slid Tuesday by $5.75, to $109.71 a barrel, down 25 percent from the high on July 11, as Hurricane Gustav passed near New Orleans without damaging oil production facilities. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped more than 220 points before falling as energy company shares lost ground. As oil tumbles, prices at the gas pump come down. But the costs of many other products have not. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, has raised by 7 percent to 10 percent the prices it charges retailers for items made with ingredients derived from oil. The company is planning to maintain the increase ''to recover costs already incurred,'' Paul Fox, a spokesman, said. Such decisions will come as little relief for thousands of retailers and wholesalers that have been forced to squeeze margins instead of passing their elevated costs to consumers, who have cut back on consumption of finished goods as their bills for groceries and gas jumped. P.&amp; G., Dow Chemical, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, as well as other big users of oil-based raw materials, are waiting to see if oil prices will stay down or continue to fall before they commit to price cuts. ''Everybody still feels there is too much uncertainty to be clear about what action they should take,'' said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who specializes in companies that use oil-based raw materials in making a variety of consumer products. ''They won't immediately drop their prices.'' Until recently, robust growth in Europe and a seemingly endless thirst for petroleum in China and developing nations lifted global demand for oil, and the price with it. But now some economies, especially in Europe, are weakening almost more rapidly than America's, lifting the dollar. That should help relieve price pressures over all by making imports -- as well as oil prices -- cheaper. This uncertainty helps to explain why Dow Chemical, for example, which had raised prices this year by nearly 50 percent for the oil-based raw materials that go into the manufacture of products like diapers and polystyrene, does not want to give up those increases until the company recovers its old profit margins. ''Our prices continue to lag our cost increases,'' the spokesman, David Winder, said. And Goodyear Tire and Rubber, which has raised tire prices by 15 percent this year, said it was still making synthetic rubber tires from oil-based feed stocks bought at relatively high prices more than three months ago. Keith Price, a Goodyear spokesman, said Goodyear could not consider canceling the price increase until it knew whether oil prices were going to stay down. The decline in oil prices has also dragged the cost of other commodities sharply lower since early summer. Corn, in particular, has slumped: it settled on Tuesday at $5.69 a bushel, down 29 percent since June 27. Soybean prices are down 21 percent in the same period. Despite the steep declines in the cost of raw ingredients, prices for packaged foods sold at supermarkets are likely to remain higher than they were last year, said Ephraim Leibtag, an economist who studies food markets for the Agriculture Department. With oil prices in sharp decline, the nation's millions of car owners are a little better off. The average price of a gallon of gas settled at $3.68 on Tuesday, down from a record $4.11 in mid-July. ''That's a 43-cent decline,'' said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, chief economist for the Ford Motor Company. ''It's almost like a tax cut for consumers.'' Just the opposite holds for commuters who travel on the nation's airlines. The major carriers have pushed through 15 price increases since the beginning of the year, with 11 of them depicted as fuel surcharges. None of the domestic airlines has stated how or when the surcharges might be removed, making them the equivalent of price increases, said Rick Seaney, who runs FareCompare.com, a Web site offering information on plane fares. Like Procter &amp; Gamble, Dow Chemical and Goodyear, the airlines suggest that what they do with fares depends on what happens to the price of oil over the long run. ''We would love to see it come down and stay down,'' said Betsy E. Talton, a Delta spokeswoman. Interest rates were slightly lower with the rate on the 10-year Treasury note at 3.73 percent, down from 3.81 percent late Friday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, rose 21/32, to 102 6/32.

Whole Foods is slowing its expansion plans as growth falters. The company, which makes products like Tide detergent, Olay skin care and Pampers diapers, said results were also helped by growth in developing markets like China and Russia, the weaker dollar and cost-cutting efforts. P.&amp; G. said it earned $3.02 billion, or 92 cents a share, up from $2.27 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding tax benefits, earnings were 80 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected 78 cents a share. The company, which is based in Cincinnati, said revenue jumped to $21.27 billion for the quarter, up from $19.27 billion in the period the previous year, topping analyst expectations for $21.05 billion. For its full fiscal year, sales rose 9 percent, to $83.5 billion. The company has already raised prices this year on products like Iams dog food, Cascade dishwasher detergent and Oral-B power toothbrushes, and has increases planned in September for Gillette shaving cream, Dawn dishwashing liquid and other items. P.&amp; G. said it expected energy and commodities costs to jump $3 billion more in the coming year. Its shares gained $2.15, or 3.3 percent, to $67.97, in afternoon trading Tuesday. The company expects 2009 adjusted profit of $3.80 to $3.87 a share, lifting the upper end of its range by 2 cents from earlier guidance. That does not include an expected gain of 50 cents a share after the sale of its Folgers coffee business to J. M. Smucker, less an expected 12 cents a share for revamping costs.

Store-brand goods attract shoppers with a low price, made possible precisely because they don’t need to waste money projecting a brand image via advertising to win the struggle for consumer attention and shelf space. (After all, the owners of store-brand goods also own the shelves.) That premise has held true even as, in recent years, many store brands moved to have more independent, name-brand-ish identities, and private-label sales in general rose steadily. But two of Safeway’s newer private-label lines, O Organics and Eating Right, are moving in a different direction. Both were built much more like name brands than like store brands  in fact, both were supported by national television and print advertising. And more recently, Safeway has initiated the Better Living Brands Alliance, with the highly unusual goal of selling these two store-brand lines in places other than the chain that created them  school cafeterias, foreign markets and, ultimately, other U.S. grocers. In the judgment of the trade publication Refrigerated and Frozen Foods Retailer, which recently named Safeway as its retailer of the year, the experiment is “breaking the mold on what we all thought we knew about private label.” The strategy, which is the culmination of several years of effort on Safeway’s part, seems to defeat the whole purpose of the store brand. O Organics, which now includes about 350 products, like milk and frozen edamame, was rolled out in 2006, in response to increased consumer interest in more-healthful and less-processed food. Of course many players, large and small, have seen this trend as an opportunity. It has fueled the growth of the Whole Foods Market chain, and many mainstream grocery stores have added a section filled with organic, natural or otherwise virtuous-sounding products from a variety of niche brands. But rather than becoming the alternative to established brands, Safeway wanted O Organics to be the established brand. The company brought in executives from consumer-product giants like Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestlé, gave the line a look that stands on its own (although the color choices may look familiar to anyone who knows the Whole Foods house brand) and hired the ad agency DDB in Chicago to create print and television advertising to help build the image of a full line of healthful, organic products in a wide range of categories. The company says the line is on track to hit sales of $400 million in 2008. In 2007, Safeway followed a similar strategy with Eating Right, which is positioned as balancing taste and nutrition, with a package design that highlights the most impressive aspect (“low fat,” for example) of the 250 products in the line, including frozen dinners and cereal. The company’s research suggests that shoppers think of the lines as independent brands that sell in Safeway by some exclusive arrangement  and that was the goal. “One of the critical aspects is that these were brands that really stood on their own,” says James D. White, the Safeway senior vice president leading the Better Living Brands Alliance. This is described as a consortium of food and beverage makers and distributors (basically Safeway’s private-label partners) that markets the O Organics and Eating Right brands to non-Safeway locations. Instead of competing simply on price, White describes the brands as having solutions-oriented images, meaning that they appeal to consumers who feel they ought to be eating better, but perhaps find the thicket of smaller, virtue-food brands confusing  or simply inaccessible. Safeway, after all, operates at a mass scale, with more than 1,700 stores. (By comparison, Whole Foods has about 270.) Image-building notwithstanding, owning the shelves allows the company to keep prices lower than a smaller brand might, while simultaneously making O Organics and Eating Right feel like an easily recognized “solution” to the problem of at least trying to improve one’s diet, a big part of the point of any “name” brand. Still, will rival chains go along with the idea that the lines have a Safeway-free identity with shoppers? White says that such challenges aside, “we couldn’t reach enough households” through Safeway stores alone. Maybe so. But unlike most name brands trying to expand distribution, these have a pretty good safety net. “We have at least one big partner,” White says.

So Dr. Curtis, an anthropologist then living in the African nation of Burkina Faso, contacted some of the largest multinational corporations and asked them, in effect, to teach her how to manipulate consumer habits worldwide. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Colgate-Palmolive Company Pfizer Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Val Curtis Val Curtiss hand-washing campaign began in 2003 in Ghana. Dr. Curtis, now the director of the Hygiene Center at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, had spent years trying to persuade people in the developing world to wash their hands habitually with soap. Diseases and disorders caused by dirty hands  like diarrhea  kill a child somewhere in the world about every 15 seconds, and about half those deaths could be prevented with the regular use of soap, studies indicate. But getting people into a soap habit, it turns out, is surprisingly hard. To overcome this hurdle, Dr. Curtis called on three top consumer goods companies to find out how to sell hand-washing the same way they sell Speed Stick deodorant and Pringles potato chips. She knew that over the past decade, many companies had perfected the art of creating automatic behaviors  habits  among consumers. These habits have helped companies earn billions of dollars when customers eat snacks, apply lotions and wipe counters almost without thinking, often in response to a carefully designed set of daily cues. “There are fundamental public health problems, like hand washing with soap, that remain killers only because we can’t figure out how to change people’s habits,” Dr. Curtis said. “We wanted to learn from private industry how to create new behaviors that happen automatically.” The companies that Dr. Curtis turned to  Procter &amp; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever  had invested hundreds of millions of dollars finding the subtle cues in consumers’ lives that corporations could use to introduce new routines. If you look hard enough, you’ll find that many of the products we use every day  chewing gums, skin moisturizers, disinfecting wipes, air fresheners, water purifiers, health snacks, antiperspirants, colognes, teeth whiteners, fabric softeners, vitamins  are results of manufactured habits. A century ago, few people regularly brushed their teeth multiple times a day. Today, because of canny advertising and public health campaigns, many Americans habitually give their pearly whites a cavity-preventing scrub twice a day, often with Colgate, Crest or one of the other brands advertising that no morning is complete without a minty-fresh mouth. A few decades ago, many people didn’t drink water outside of a meal. Then beverage companies started bottling the production of far-off springs, and now office workers unthinkingly sip bottled water all day long. Chewing gum, once bought primarily by adolescent boys, is now featured in commercials as a breath freshener and teeth cleanser for use after a meal. Skin moisturizers  which are effective even if applied at high noon  are advertised as part of morning beauty rituals, slipped in between hair brushing and putting on makeup. “OUR products succeed when they become part of daily or weekly patterns,” said Carol Berning, a consumer psychologist who recently retired from Procter &amp; Gamble, the company that sold $76 billion of Tide, Crest and other products last year. “Creating positive habits is a huge part of improving our consumers’ lives, and it’s essential to making new products commercially viable.” Through experiments and observation, social scientists like Dr. Berning have learned that there is power in tying certain behaviors to habitual cues through relentless advertising. As this new science of habit has emerged, controversies have erupted when the tactics have been used to sell questionable beauty creams or unhealthy foods. But for activists like Dr. Curtis, this emerging research offers a type of salvation. For years, many public health campaigns that aimed at changing habits have been failures. Earlier this decade, two researchers affiliated with Vanderbilt University examined more than 100 studies on the effectiveness of antidrug campaigns and found that, in some cases, viewers’ levels of drug abuse actually increased when commercials were shown, perhaps in part because the ads reminded them about that bag of weed in the sock drawer. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/business/media/07music.html?ref=procterandgamble">It’s American Brandstand: Marketers Underwrite Performers<date>Published: July 7, 2008</date><text>The hip-hop and R&amp;B producer Jermaine Dupri has discovered best-selling acts like Kris Kross and Da Brat, has produced hits for Mariah Carey and Jay-Z, and now runs the urban music division of the Island Def Jam Music Group.

Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, is joining Island Def Jam in a joint venture called Tag Records, a label that will sign and release albums by new hip-hop acts. It is named after a brand of body spray that P.&amp; G. acquired when it bought Gillette. And Mr. Dupri, a music-industry veteran and the longtime partner of the singer Janet Jackson, sounds quite pleased with his new gig. “I’ve never seen someone wanting to devote this much money to breaking new artists,” said Mr. Dupri, who will serve as president of Tag Records while keeping his position at Island Def Jam. “Nobody in the music business has the marketing budget that I have.” At a time when online file-sharing is rampant, record stores are closing and consumers are buying singles instead of albums, getting into the music business might seem like running into a burning building. But as record labels struggle to adjust to a harsh new digital reality, other companies are stepping up their involvement in music, going far beyond standard endorsement contracts and the use of songs in commercials. These companies  like Procter &amp; Gamble, Red Bull and Nike  are stepping outside of their core businesses to promote, finance and even distribute music themselves. A few months ago, Bacardi announced that it would help the English electronic music duo Groove Armada pay for and promote its next release. Caress, the body-care line owned by Unilever, commissioned the Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger to record a version of Duran Duran’s “Rio” that it gave away on its Web site to promote its “Brazilian body wash” product. The energy drink company Red Bull is starting a label that is expected to release music before the end of the year. And at least some of this music is credible: a hip-hop song that Nike released by Kanye West, Nas, Rakim and KRS-One was nominated for a Grammy Award for best rap performance by a duo or group. Unlike Starbucks, which got into the music business to sell CDs at its stores, these companies want to use music to promote products they already sell. “It’s not about money,” said Sarah Tinsley, a global marketing manager at Bacardi. “It’s a branding exercise.” Unlike the exclusive album deals that Wal-Mart is striking with groups like the Eagles, these companies are attracting artists at the height of their relevance. Two weeks ago, Converse released a single by a combination of artists that The Times of London called “a three-headed Frankenstein’s monster of coolness”: the Strokes singer Julian Casablancas, the producer Pharrell Williams and the R&amp;B performer Santogold. Offered as a free download on Converse’s Web site, the song received mostly favorable reviews from both blogs and newspapers. “Our instructions to them were to have fun, as though they were doing any song,” said Jon Cohen, co-founder of Cornerstone, a music marketing company that has set up music deals for Converse, Nike, Caress and Smirnoff. “It doesn’t matter where the music comes from as long as it’s great.” A decade ago, signing a record contract with a body spray company would have been unthinkable for most artists. But at a time when labels’ promotion budgets are declining, consumer brands can offer valuable exposure in print and television ads. Jeff Straughn, Island Def Jam’s vice president for strategic marketing, said that Tag might spend seven times as much promoting a release as a traditional label. “When I started in this business 10 years ago, it was hard to get an artist to stand in front of a sign with a logo on it,” said David Caruso, the co-founder of Acme, the agency that negotiated the deal between Island Def Jam and Tag. “Now brands are engaging their audiences with content.” But the brands walk a fine line by making sure that consumers are aware that they financed a song without having it simply seem like a commercial. “We wanted it to be like they were making their own record,” said Rob Stone, a Cornerstone co-founder, referring to the song that Kanye West, Nas and KRS-One made for Nike with a celebrated producer, Rick Rubin. “None of them had to mention the Air Force 1,” a Nike shoe. Instead, Cornerstone asked the artists to write a track about the theme of timelessness and promoted it like any other song, making a video, promoting it to radio and selling it on iTunes. (Nike’s profits went to the Force4Change Fund, a charity for youth leadership programs.) As it turned out, the song, “Better Than I’ve Ever Been,” does mention the sneakers as well as “Nike’s straight classic.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DF173CF936A35754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=procterandgamble">WORLD BRIEFING | EUROPE; Britain: Pringles, Never a Chip, found To Be No Potato Snack, Either<date>Published: July 5, 2008</date><text>Britain's High Court ruled that Pringles are not a potato snack, and thus are not subject to the value-added tax.

G. Lafley had his work cut out for him when he became Procter &amp; Gamble’s chief executive eight years ago. Profits were lackluster and the stock was way down. New product introductions had slowed to a trickle, and no more than 15 percent of those wound up making money. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Al Behrman/Associated Press A. G. Lafley Mr. Lafley quickly cut jobs, sold declining brands like Crisco shortening, and began reciting what became a familiar mantra: Innovate, innovate, innovate. These days, he said, more than half of Procter’s new products are commercially successful. Mr. Lafley still thinks innovation is the key to success. And he has codified that thinking in a book, “The Game-Changer,” (Crown Business, 2008), which he wrote with Ram Charan, a management consultant. In a recent conversation, Mr. Lafley elaborated on his views about innovation  and on why a chief executive would become an author. Q. You’re already famous, I doubt you need the royalty money and I imagine that running P.&amp; G. is a full-time job. Why would you write a book? A. It was the last thing I wanted to do. But Ram said that, as long as he had access to other P.&amp; G. people, he would only need 15 or 20 hours of my time, spread over a year and a half. So I talked it over with Norm Augustine, our presiding director. And we decided that the book could advance P.&amp; G.’s reputation as well as its strategy business model. So I said yes, and I’m donating any proceeds to charity. Q. Reputation makes sense, but a strategy business model? A. P.&amp; G. was always really good at branding and commercializing products, but we weren’t better than anyone else at that fragile front end, where the idea is created. So in 2000, we decided to stop being Fortress P.&amp; G., and move to an open innovation system that could attract innovations of all stripes from the outside. We set a goal, that half of the innovations we take to market should have external front-end partners. And the book can help us attract those partners. Q. But the book just came out. How have you attracted partners in the last few years? A. We participate in Web networks, including one that taps our own retirees for ideas. We wanted to print Trivial Pursuit questions on Pringles, and one of these Internet networks helped us find a small bakery in Italy that knew a safe, edible way to print on baked goods. We’ll accept innovation help from any source, even competitors. We have a joint venture with Clorox on a press-and-seal wrap. We developed it, but it sells under the Clorox Glad brand. So we compete like crazy with Clorox on cleaning products, but partner with them on wraps. Q. Innovation has become one of those words, like sustainability, that is so overused these days as to be almost meaningless. Why not just say invention? A. Invention is just a new product or service. Innovation ties that idea to a better customer experience, and results in increased sales and profits. It lets you make unlikely connections that enable you to solve wickedly hard problems. It is a team sport that uses the expertise of people from a lot of different fields. It also means identifying your consumers and involving them early on. These days, Internet technology makes it so much easier to do that. And it is vitally important. Consumers turned away from the first few rounds of cellphones because no one had made them intuitive to use. But Apple turned a 10-year-old technology into the iPod, because it understood what young music lovers wanted. Q. You’re putting a lot of emphasis on outside voices. What about internal innovation? A. The first thing we did was open the internal innovation architecture. We worked on getting engineers and biochemists to work with marketing, and we got people from our different businesses to work with each other. Each of our businesses used to do its own research. But our core technologies span businesses. We can manipulate surfaces, for example, be they kitchen counters or blouses or hair. Gil Cloyd, our chief technology officer, and I have set up what we call communities of practice. These are networks of nanotechnologists, of biochemists, of people who specialize in packaging, and who work for all the businesses. And we have regular innovation reviews, where we move ideas and best practices around our 22 businesses. Q. And yet only half of your product innovations succeed. Why isn’t the rate higher? A. I don’t really want it to be. Human nature is such that, if we push our people to drive the batting average up, they’ll try to hit more safely, take a shorter swing, go for the singles instead of home runs. But we try to set milestones that innovations must meet at every step along the development process. As soon as they miss one, we allocate the resources to another product moving through the funnel. That’s another difference from the old days, when P.&amp; G. let bad ideas go too far. Q. In your book you say you are moving Procter away from food and beverages because they have limited innovation potential. But I see new flavors and ingredients all the time. Explain. A. In beauty and household products, we have access to ingredients and formulas that our competitors really can’t get. But when it comes to food, the private label guys can get anything we can get. Q. So getting back to your role as a co-author, did you really hold your input to 20 hours? A. Are you kidding? Writing this book was my early morning and late night activity for six months.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Fragrance Market, 2007 Related Light Touch in Inventing Chinese Scents (May 10, 2008) Add to Portfolio Estee Lauder Companies Go to your Portfolio » With perfume sales in much of the rest of the world slowing or declining, the industry, primarily based in Paris and New York, hopes for significant growth in China. The market there remains small, though sales are rising exponentially. Nobody knows the exact growth rate, but Patrick de Lambilly, the vice president for Asia for Coty, says, “You can see 20, 30, and 40 percent a year.” Alexandre de Chaudenay, Asia-Pacific managing director of the perfume licensee Beauté Prestige International, said, “I’d say 20 to 40 percent seems correct, but the figures are extremely difficult, and people tell you anything.” Still, even if the Chinese market is potentially hugely lucrative, doing business there is far from easy. The regulatory system is uncertain. The complexity of its bureaucracy is daunting. The department stores are of varying quality, and because Chinese tastes are changing rapidly, a store that attracts crowds one day can be deserted the next. To add to the uncertainty, many in the business say the concept of perfume is so new that a lot of Chinese consumers are, in fact, not buying a perfume but rather the brand to which a bottle of perfume happens to be attached. “China is about brand, brand, brand,” Mr. de Chaudenay said. And the importance of brand raises the question of the market’s future stability. Although many in the industry talk about the strength of the luxury brands in China, “Are those brands’ perfumes selling well?” Mr. de Chaudenay asked. “I think so. Are the consumers coming back? We don’t know.” For that reason, Mr. de Lambilly says his perfume company and others are tempering their enthusiasm for the Chinese market with realism. “We’re learning as we go,” he said. “Particularly in fragrances. All of us here are doing the same thing: getting data from the marketing sources, comparing it to other sources, trying to figure it out.” Hans Wohmann, head of Procter &amp; Gamble’s Asian operations for scent, said sales in China of what are known as “prestige fragrances”  perfumes made by designers and luxury houses like Chanel, Estée Lauder and Dior  were around $120 million versus the $9 billion European market or the $4 billion American market. Even the Japanese market, the largest in Asia, was $500 million in 2006. As Mr. Wohmann put it, “So 20 percent of the world’s population has only 1 percent of the global fine fragrance market.” Perfume is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. Mr. de Lambilly said the Chinese started using scented shower products only in the early 20th century. But they were light and simple, he said. “They were for freshening the body and also to avoid mosquitoes.” Western-type perfumes have been produced in China only since the mid-1980s, said Bill Jin, manager at the PearlChem Corporation in Parsippany, N.J., an importer and distributor of perfume raw materials. Ralf Ritter, a consultant to the scent maker Takasago, said he would be “surprised if even 50 percent of the perfume bought in China was actually used.” And that, he said, is largely because in China fragrances serve multiple purposes. “They’re fragrances, but they also repel mosquitoes, they have moisturizing properties, and they are used in the summer to freshen up,” he said. “Chinese consumers care that the product does more than just fragrance the body.” Mr. Jin says there are a just a few local perfume brands. Pearlscent, the sister company of Mr. Jin’s company, based in Guangzhou, is one. “The fragrance concentrates are mainly created by our customers in the U.S. or France and imported from the U.S.A. or Europe.” They are then mixed with alcohol, bottled and sold in China. Mr. Jin adds that there is virtually universal agreement that Chinese brands will not pose serious competition to Western brands until well in the future. “High-end brands like Dior and Chanel will be for the prestige consumer, which is completely different from the local brand market,” he said. “One bottle of Chanel perfume will cost almost a half month pay for a fresh-out-of-college student.” 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 18, 2008 An article on May 10 about the growing market for perfume in China misstated the title of Luciano Bertinelli, who distributes fragrances in China with the help of a local partner, and also misspelled part of the name of his company.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, said that higher retail prices, cost controls and strong growth in emerging markets helped lift its third-quarter profit 8 percent. The company also raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 3 percent. A. G. Lafley, the chief executive, said the company remains optimistic about sustaining its growth because of daily uses for its many household brands such as Charmin toilet paper, Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent. “Virtually everything we sell is not discretionary; it’s a staple,” Mr. Lafley said on a conference call. Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said it expects costs to keep climbing, has increased spending on marketing, and will raise more prices this summer. Its rival, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, whose products include its namesake toothpaste and dish soap, said first-quarter earnings fell 4 percent as the company took restructuring charges and a higher provision for income taxes. Colgate, based in New York, said rising materials costs were offset by higher prices, but that margins would be pressured as the cost of raw materials keeps rising. Analysts questioned Colgate-Palmolive executives on whether they had been slow to lift prices and to anticipate the impact of rising costs for agricultural commodities. The company will raise Colgate toothpaste prices by 9 percent this summer. “If gross margin pressures persist, one leg of the Colgate growth stool falls off, which could start to impact growth as advertising spending is reduced,” a Deutsche Bank analyst, Bill Schmitz Jr., said in a note to clients. Colgate-Palmolive reported solid growth in Latin American markets and said its toothpaste business was strong in China, India and Russia. Among food companies, the Kellogg Company’s first-quarter profit fell 2 percent, despite recent price increases by the company, which makes cereal, Pop-Tarts toaster pastries and Eggo frozen waffles. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., raised wholesale prices an average of 3.2 percent across much of its product portfolio, said a spokeswoman, Kris Charles. Prices went up for snacks at the end of December and for cereal and frozen products in late January. At Kraft Foods, the nation’s largest food and beverage maker, first-quarter earnings fell 13 percent, also amid higher costs for ingredients. Kraft, which makes Oscar Mayer hot dogs, Maxwell House coffee and Oreo cookies, benefited from nearly across-the-board price increases. Kraft’s profit decline also came because earnings in the same period last year were raised by a one-time benefit related to the company’s spinoff from the Altria Group. Kraft is based in Northfield, Ill. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/business/28ftc.html?ref=procterandgamble">Top F.T.C. Official Expected to Resign<date>Published: February 28, 2008</date><text>The chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission is expected to resign her post next month to take a senior position at Procter &amp; Gamble, according to people briefed on her plans. Deborah Platt Majoras, the chairwoman, is the latest in a series of Bush administration officials to leave in the last year of the president’s second term. Before joining the commission, Ms. Majoras was a senior official in the antitrust division of the Justice Department, where she played an important role in the antitrust case against Microsoft. William E. Kovacic, a member of the commission since January 2006, is the leading candidate to succeed Ms. Majoras, according to the people, who were briefed on her resignation plan but were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Mr. Kovacic was previously a law professor at Georgetown University and the general counsel for the commission. Under Ms. Majoras, the F.T.C. has focused most intently on privacy and data security, especially as they relate to the Internet. The commission, like the Justice Department, has pursued relatively few antitrust cases, drawing some criticism from Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates. Ms. Majoras’s departure was first reported on the Web site of The Wall Street Journal.

Skip to next paragraph Gillette is marketing the first five-blade razor for women. Gillette, which first introduced a twin-blade razor in 1971, unveiled the three-blade Mach 3 in 1998; Schick struck back with the four-blade Quattro in 2003; then Gillette responded with the five-blade Fusion in 2005. Now comes the Gillette Venus Embrace, the first five-blade razor for women, and Procter &amp; Gamble, which acquired Gillette for $57 billion in 2005, is starting the biggest campaign on the women’s side of its business since the original three-blade Venus was introduced in 2001. Procter would not disclose the amount it is spending on the campaign. Developed by BBDO Worldwide in New York, which is part of the Omnicom Group, the campaign plays on Venus’s being the Roman goddess of love, but recasts women as deities in decidedly contemporary settings. In one advertisement, a leggy woman running with a jogging stroller is the “Goddess of Trailblazing;” in another, a woman sending a text message is the “Goddess of Communication.” Ads will appear in publications like Marie Claire, Allure, InStyle and Us Weekly and television spots will run on both network and cable, including during the Academy Awards on ABC this Sunday.  “Now we’ve given women the permission to reveal her own goddess,” said Gro Frivoll, who has worked on the Venus account at BBDO for eight years. “Every woman can be the goddess of something, because this allows you to be your most feminine self.” The Venus Embrace has some slick design innovations. In addition to the five blades, it has a soft rubber handle and  instead of the moisturizing strip above blades on many razors  has upgraded to an oval-shaped Ribbon of Moisture that completely encircles the blades. In all, there are 35 patents pending or granted that cover the product’s technologies, designs and manufacturing processes. When Gillette pitches razors to men, it tends to emphasize technological innovations. But on the women’s side, “we focus more on the emotional end benefits,” Ms. Frivoll said. “Men want to know, What am I paying more for? If a man were paying $25 for lipstick, it would have to have more than the Chanel name on it.” Gillette says it has 55 percent of the women’s razor market, and cites for support a combination of Nielsen and internal data. (Internal data include sales at Wal-Mart Stores and club stores, which do not report to Nielsen and other data firms.) Schick, a division of Energizer Holdings, makes the four-bladed Quattro for Women and declined to comment on its next move. Gillette marketed the first women’s razor, Milady Décolletée, in 1915, and in 1975 introduced the first women’s disposable, the Gillette Daisy, which it still sells. But while early women’s razors differed little from men’s (except for their pink handles and delicate names), today’s look significantly different because they are designed to perform a much different task, according to Kevin Powell, director of the Gillette Technology Center in Britain. “With female shaving you are dealing with areas of the body that are more topographically varied, and also they tend to vary a lot in terms of the physiology of the skin and hair,” Mr. Powell said in a telephone interview. Whereas a men’s razor has a fairly limited mission  shaving beards with short strokes, usually in the direction that hair grows  women shaving their legs deal with finer, more dispersed hair, against the grain, and must maneuver around knees, ankles and tendons. And then, Mr. Powell said, “there’s the challenge of the underarm, which has a very different topography, looser skin, hairs that are much denser, like those on a man’s face, and growing in all sorts of directions.” While women might want the power of five blades for denuding that area, they prefer oval-shaped heads because they “don’t want a guy’s razor digging in them in their underarms or their bikini areas,” he said.  Before joining Gillette 14 years ago, Mr. Powell designed jet engines for Rolls-Royce and missile guidance systems for a British Ministry of Defense contractor. “Somehow targeting hairs and targeting things in battlefield scenarios are pretty similar challenges,” he said. The razor industry is big business, with sales of more than $1.9 billion in the 52 weeks ending Jan. 27 in the United States alone, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm whose data excludes Wal-Mart. Rick Aristotle Munarriz, a senior analyst with the Motley Fool, the financial investment Web site, said that for razor companies the revenue model “is pretty much the same mantra as the printer industry,” which makes little or no money on printer sales but a much larger profit on replacement ink cartridges. The new Venus Embrace, which comes with two snap-on cartridges and a holder with suction cups for hanging it in the shower, has a suggested retail price of $9.99 to 11.99; a package of four refill cartridges costs more, with a suggested retail price of $13.49 to 14.99. A Procter &amp; Gamble spokeswoman said that the company does not discuss specific margins but that it did make a profit on both the razors and the replacement blades. Last year, Gillette’s men’s and women’s replacement cartridges revenue totaled $671 million, more than five times its razor sales ($124 million) and more than three times its sales of disposable razors ($209 million), according to Information Resources. Shaving companies strive to outdo not just their competitors but themselves, aiming to coax people to replace their old “shaving system,” in industry parlance, for the newest one, which invariably promises even closer, more comfortable shaves. But with five blades on both men’s and women’s razors, what’s next? Six? Eight? A dozen? “Is there an end in sight?” said Ms. Frivoll, the BBDO executive. “I don’t know the answer to that.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/books/19cathy.html?ref=procterandgamble">In Books for Young, Two Views on Product Placement<date>Published: February 19, 2008</date><text>Specifying a character’s brand of lipstick, shoes or handbag is a commonly accepted way to add an aura of reality or consumer aspiration to books aimed at young readers: just think of “The Gossip Girl,” with that series’s abundant references to Prada and Burberry. But what if writers and publishers enlisted companies to sponsor those branded mentions, as is the widespread practice in Hollywood? Skip to next paragraph The new paperback edition of the popular Cathys Book. More Photos » Multimedia Slide Show Comparing 'Cathys Book' Related Product Placement Deals Make Leap From Film to Books (June 12, 2006) Authors of two book series have come to separate conclusions: in one case, the writers tried it and then changed their minds; in the other, for a new series to be published next year, the author, who owns a marketing company, said she planned to give corporate sponsorship a chance. With “Cathy’s Book: If Found Call (650) 266-8233,” a genre-bending mystery for young adults by Sean Stewart and Jordan Weisman that was published in 2006, the authors learned that product placement could be a touchy subject. After their publisher, Running Press, an imprint of Perseus Books Group, revealed that the authors had agreed to have characters wear specific makeup lines made by Cover Girl in exchange for promotional ads for the book on beinggirl.com, a Web site aimed at adolescent girls and run by Procter &amp; Gamble, Cover Girl’s parent, the book came in for criticism. Ralph Nader’s advocacy group, Commercial Alert, urged book review editors to boycott it, and the novelist Jane Smiley wrote a disapproving op-ed article for The Los Angeles Times; The New York Times wrote a critical editorial as well. Now the novel  which features a series of clues that are given out in voice mail messages, Web sites, letters and other documents included with or referred to in the book  is set to come out in paperback on Monday, and all the references to Cover Girl’s products have been removed. A drawing in the hardcover edition, for instance, shows Cathy wearing “Cover Girl lipgloss ‘Demure,’ ” and “Waterproof Mascara ’Very Black’ ,” but it appears in the paperback version without any makeup noted. And at the end of the hardcover edition, Cathy talks about wearing “a killer coat of Lipslicks in ‘Daring’ “; in the paperback she just says, “a killer coat of lipstick.” “We did a whole bunch of pretty innovative things with that book,” Mr. Stewart said in a telephone interview. But, he said, the main topic of conversation, “instead of being about the other 18,” was about the product placement. In “Mackenzie Blue,” on the other hand, a new series aimed at 8- to 12-year-old girls from HarperCollins Children’s Books, product placement is very much a part of the plan. Tina Wells, chief executive of Buzz Marketing Group, which advises consumer product companies on how to sell to teenagers and preteenagers, will herself be the author of titles in the series filled with references to brands. She plans to offer the companies that make them the chance to sponsor the books. Ms. Wells said she would not change a brand that she felt was at the core of a particular character’s identity merely to cement a marketing partnership. “Mackenzie loves Converse,” she said, referring to the series’s heroine and the popular sneaker brand she favors. “Does Converse want to work with us? I have no clue. But that doesn’t negate the fact that Mackenzie loves Converse.” However, when asked what she would do if another sneaker company like Nike (one of her clients) wanted to sponsor the books, she said, “Maybe another character could become a Nike girl.” Ms. Wells, 27, who founded Buzz Marketing when she was just 16, is also seeking a tie-in with a music label to produce a soundtrack for the books. She said she was also interested in enticing companies to sponsor the books in exchange for references to their philanthropic initiatives related to themes like global warming that she plans to address in the story lines; one idea would be to include resource pages at the back of the books. So, for example, one of the characters in the series, Ally, is the daughter of journalists who end up in the Sudan in one of the books. Ms. Wells suggested she could work with Procter &amp; Gamble, which sponsors projects to donate feminine hygiene products to girls in Africa. Susan Katz, publisher of HarperCollins Children’s Books, said she was not concerned about a possible backlash against corporate sponsorship in books aimed at such a young audience. “If you look at Web sites, general media or television, corporate sponsorship or some sort of advertising is totally embedded in the world that tweens live in,” Ms. Katz said. “It gives us another opportunity for authenticity.” As for “Cathy’s Book,” David Steinberger, president of Perseus, said the criticism of the Cover Girl relationship did not affect sales. According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of sales, the book has sold 43,000 copies in hardcover. “ ‘Cathy’s Book’ surpassed our expectations and hit best-seller lists in every country,” Mr. Steinberger said, “because teens responded to the writing, the graphics and the interactivity.” Mr. Weisman, an author of “Cathy’s Book,” said in an e-mail message on Friday that he had only just informed an executive with Procter &amp; Gamble that the Cover Girl references had been removed from the paperback. “There was no expectation that the cross promotion would extend past the hardcover launch/ edition,” Mr. Weisman wrote. He added that he and the executive were discussing future marketing relationships. A spokeswoman for beinggirl.com confirmed that discussions were continuing. Mr. Stewart and Mr. Weisman have written a follow-up, called “Cathy’s Key,” which comes out in May.

Skip to next paragraph Related Some Suspect Chemical Mix in Pet Food (April 12, 2007) Filler in Animal Feed Is Open Secret in China (April 30, 2007) China Food Mislabeled, U.S. Says (May 3, 2007) China Shuts 3 Companies Over Safety of Products (July 21, 2007) Tainted wheat gluten, used as an ingredient in moist pet food, killed at least 16 dogs and cats, sickened thousands of others and led to one of the biggest pet food recalls in American history, involving companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Menu Foods. It was also a prelude to scores of other recalls of Chinese-made products last year, including tires, fish, children’s jewelry and toys. The federal indictment, citing e-mail traffic between the Chinese manufacturer and the American importer, says that the importer of the tainted ingredient knew that it was being mislabeled to avoid inspection. The case resulted from a long investigation by the Food and Drug Administration and was filed by the United States attorney’s office in Kansas City, Mo., which was the port of entry for the tainted wheat gluten. It called for fines and jail time for executives at the Chinese companies  Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Company and Suzhou Textiles, Silk, Light Industrial Products, Arts and Crafts  and for the owners of the importing company, ChemNutra, which is based in Las Vegas. “There’s a strong perception that the rule of the law has not yet taken hold in China, and that’s fundamentally what’s at issue in all of these supply-chain cases,” said Richard Cellini, vice president of Integrity Interactive, a consulting firm in Waltham, Mass. It is unclear if United States authorities can extradite the Chinese executives or enforce fines against the companies. “Somebody should be held responsible,” said William Howell, whose Japanese Chin suffered kidney problems and died last spring after eating some of the tainted foods. “I don’t know if it’s Menu Foods or their distributor in China who put the ingredients in, but somebody should be held responsible.” Mr. Howell, a retiree who lives in Maitland, Fla., had his dog euthanized last April after watching it writhe in pain for days, he said in an interview last summer. Like many dog owners, he said he had fed his pet the more expensive moist food instead of dry food because he thought it was better for her. After news of the tainted wheat gluten emerged last spring, all of the companies charged in the indictment said they did not know how melamine  which can be toxic when ingested  had made its way into the gluten. But the owner of Xuzhou Anying, Mao Lijun  who is referred to in the indictment as Mao Linzhun  subsequently conceded to Chinese authorities that his company had added the melamine to make the wheat gluten appear higher in protein, court papers said. Xuzhou was required by ChemNutra to produce wheat gluten with at least 75 percent protein content. Melamine is used in many industrial products like glues, inks and fertilizers, but it has no approved uses in food in the United States. The F.D.A. found the melamine in the wheat gluten in late March and determined that it had been used in the wheat gluten that Xuzhou Anying shipped from November 2006 to February 2007. Xuzhou Anying shipped at least 13 loads of the tainted wheat gluten, more than 800 metric tons, through Suzhou Textiles, which created false labels for the shipments, the indictment said. China’s product safety agency requires that shipments of wheat gluten be inspected before export. To avoid inspection, Suzhou Textiles labeled the shipments with a code other than the one that would have indicated it was wheat gluten, according to the indictment. ChemNutra and its owners, a married couple, Sally Qing Miller and Stephen S. Miller, knew that the shipment was mislabeled in a way that would allow it to leave China without testing, the United States attorney’s office says, and the Millers did not disclose the mislabeling to pet food makers. The government cited e-mail messages sent or received by the Millers in 2006 in which the proper codes for wheat gluten and other proteins were discussed. In addition to accusing the Millers of helping the Chinese companies distribute tainted food, the indictment said the couple defrauded customers, the pet food makers. As early as January last year, one pet food maker complained to ChemNutra that the wheat gluten was too moist, according to the indictment. The Millers also misled pet food makers by saying that they had worked directly with Xuzhou Anying without mentioning Suzhou Textiles, the intermediary, the indictment said. ChemNutra said in a statement that the government had not accused the Millers of knowing that there was melamine in the wheat gluten, pointing out that the government focused on the incorrect labeling. “Although Mr. and Mrs. Miller strongly deny any intent to defraud or knowledge of wrongdoing, the government does not allege that Mr. and Mrs. Miller knew of the presence of melamine or any other substance that would cause death or injury to animals,” the statement said. The Chinese executives in the indictment could not be reached for comment. William Gu, a manager at Suzhou Textiles, said the owner of the company, Chen Zhen Hao, who is charged in the case, was on vacation. But he said the situation had been resolved. The company no longer ships food to the United States. David Barboza contributed reporting from Shanghai.

This is a little surprising, given that Super Bowl ads are practically synonymous with mass brands and the Procter &amp; Gamble detergent is about as mass as it gets. Indeed, the orange-and-yellow circles of its logo have that rare instant-read power that suggests not just Tide but branding in general. In a 2005 Advertising Age assessment of “brand endurance” of several well-known consumer names, Tide stood out for having increased its share of the detergent market over its long life: from 31 percent in 1952 to 40 percent more than half a century later. Last year P.&amp;G.’s top marketing executive told Fortune that Tide is “one of our fastest-growing” brands. Today’s Super Bowl ad is not for the detergent itself but for a spinoff stain-removing product called Tide to Go. And while once there was a thing called Tide, a visit to Tide.com finds 39 different kinds of Tide: Coldwater Tide, Tide With a Touch of Downy, Tide With Bleach, Tide With Bleach Alternative, Tide With Febreze, floral scents, “mountain” scents and original scent. Recent eco-conscious variations include concentrated Tide and Tide for use with “high efficiency” appliances. All that’s missing are sugar free-and menthol. While this responds to consumer demand for variety, it brings certain challenges to the iconic power that is one of Tide’s marketplace strengths: namely, balancing that recognizable design with the idea of a range of choices. To assess the Tide logo in the contemporary marketplace, I consulted J. Duncan Berry of Applied Iconology, a consulting firm. Berry has a Ph.D. in art history from Brown and for a time taught there and at the Rhode Island School of Design, but these days his specialty is semiotic analysis of package design for consumer-product companies. What this means is that he applies the close-reading analytical skills you might associate with deconstructing a novel or a work of art to the breaking down of logos and packaging to their “constituent parts” and “indexical signs.” He seems to enjoy it. Berry noted the effectiveness of the original Tide package, which communicated “cyclone in a box,” he says. “There’s this great dynamic tension there. The word ‘Tide’ is bursting out of the circle, and the circle is standing out of the box. It’s almost a baroque composition; it’s like what Steven Spielberg would do if he were designing a brand.” The idea was that Tide is “a force of nature  it’s a phase shift.” After all, an effective synthetic detergent was a real innovation in 1947, a result of years of expensive research and development. The bull’s-eye look was actually borrowed from earlier P.&amp;G. products, Dash and Oxydol. But in his memorable culture and design book, “The Total Package,” Thomas Hine noted that “some sophisticated color research”  involving a psychologist who specialized in such things  went into selecting a bright scheme that would suggest “sufficient power,” tempered with the “likable” blue that had a more “sensitive” connotation. Reaching the market just as automatic washing machines were catching on, Tide was a sensation; anecdotal accounts from the time suggest people lined up to get hold of the stuff  as if it were an iPhone. Berry’s reading suggests that it has become a lot harder to strike a visual balance in the many-Tides world. Consider Tide With Febreze, with a label that Berry compares to “an illusionistic landscape,” cluttered with many signifiers: “You have this grass that signals freshness, and Febreze sort of in the middle ground of the landscape, and Tide is like the sunset.” The problem, he contends, is that it doesn’t cohere into a message with instant emotional impact. The product 2X Ultra Tide HE presents “more of an abstract composition,” Berry continues, with the high-efficiency washing-machine icon, standing on a sort of green ribbon, casting a shadow on a Tide logo. The most noticeable thing about this more eco-aware version of Tide is that the bottle isn’t orange but a pearly hue that suggests purity. “Are people going to believe,” Berry wonders, “that Tide is going to be the power cleanser  and the soft, natural cleanser at the same time?” Still, the sales figures suggest that even if the many Tides speak many graphic languages, sometimes garbled, something is managing to connect with disparate consumer desires. It may be the one thing that Berry found to be the strongest element of every niche Tide design: that screaming orange logo. Maybe it’s a legacy of another era, one that seems much less sophisticated than our own  but 60 years later, it’s the one visual element in all the Tide variations that still really works.

Colgate shares rose $3.19, to $76.69. Procter &amp; Gamble shares were up less  33 cents, to $65.42  after the company said earnings for the current quarter would be below analysts’ estimates. Procter &amp; Gamble also announced plans to make its Folgers coffee business a separate company with stock offered to shareholders. An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Amy L. Chasen, said in a research note that Colgate’s results looked much better and could increase the focus on Procter &amp; Gamble’s weaker third-quarter outlook. Like many consumer products companies, Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate are being hit by soaring prices for energy and raw materials. Both have cut overhead costs and increased prices to help offset the rising commodity costs. Both companies sell toothpaste, soap and pet food, but Procter &amp; Gamble’s products also include things like coffee, paper towels and razors, making it more exposed to rising costs than Colgate, analysts said. “P.&amp; G. manufactures a much broader assortment of products, and their exposure is going to be greater,” an analyst at Morningstar, Lauren DeSanto, said. Procter &amp; Gamble posted a 14 percent increase in net income to $3.27 billion for its second quarter, which ended Dec. 31. Earnings were 98 cents a share, compared with the average analysts’ estimate of 97 cents compiled by Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9 percent to $21.6 billion, helped by the weaker dollar, which increased the dollar value of overseas sales. The company had strong sales growth in China, Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa, a spokesman said. Those increases came as American growth slowed, the company said during a conference call with analysts, though the company said it had not been losing customers to lower-priced private-label brands. Colgate, meanwhile, said fourth-quarter profit rose to $414.9 million, a 3.4 percent increase, with sales up 13.5 percent to $3.64 billion. Excluding revamping charges, earnings were 91 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 89 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company is in the latter stages of a four-year overhaul aimed at oral care, personal care and pet food and is using the savings to help increase spending on marketing. Colgate also set a new plan to repurchase 30 million shares over the next two years.

The companies in the program, called the Supply Chain Leadership Collaboration, include giants in their sectors like Cadbury Schweppes, Dell, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Procter &amp; Gamble and Tesco. The venture is being coordinated by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a British nonprofit organization that helps companies and investors to cooperate in the battle against climate change. “Multinationals are seeking to understand where the emissions are lying in their supply chain and what risks and opportunities from climate change will be presented,” Paul Simpson, chief operating officer for CDP, said. In the pilot phase, until the end of March 2008, each company participating in the program has selected 50 suppliers to work with, the group said. The Carbon Disclosure Project will publish a report after the first phase, recommending a standardized approach to emissions cuts. A second phase, starting in May, will include up to 2,000 suppliers associated with each participating company.

Soon, Tide, the biggest detergent brand in America  sold by the biggest advertiser in America  will appear for the first time on the biggest day for advertising in America. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Lining Up for the Super Bowl Ad Procter &amp; Gamble, the maker of Tide, has bought time during the Fox Broadcasting coverage of Super Bowl XLII on Feb. 3 for a commercial for the Tide to Go instant stain remover. The 30-second spot, by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, is scheduled to appear in the game’s second quarter. Procter joins two dozen or so marketers, both well known and would-be, that are paying Fox a record or near-record amount to run commercials in the game. The average cost of each 30 seconds of commercial time is estimated at $2.7 million, compared with $2.6 million for spots in Super Bowl XLI in February 2007. Among the other advertisers are Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, FedEx, General Motors, PepsiCo, Toyota Motor and several movie studios. Fox Broadcasting, part of the News Corporation, has sold all but one of the 63 30-second commercials that it plans to run in the game, a spokesman for Fox Sports, Lou D’Ermilio, said Thursday. Demand for commercial time in Super Bowl XLII was strong even before the writers’ strike upended the prime-time schedules of the major networks and cast into doubt the fate of popular fare like “C.S.I.,” “Grey’s Anatomy” and the broadcast of the Academy Awards ceremony. As early as the end of October, Fox had only about seven of the 30-second spots in the Super Bowl left to sell. Usually at that time of year, there are two or three times that many slots still unsold. One reason for that appeal is robust demand for commercial time in all sports programming, Mr. D’Ermilio said, on Fox or not. High demand during the Major League Baseball season last year continued through the spate of college football bowl games that ended Monday with the Bowl Championship Series title game.  Another reason for the ardor for Super Bowl spots is the magnitude of recent changes in the media marketplace. The Super Bowl is one of the few so-called big events that remain available to marketers eager to reach tens of millions of consumers at the same time; more than 90 million Americans typically watch each game. “It’s the last bastion of mass marketing, with incredible reach,” said Jim Nail, chief strategy and marketing officer at Cymfony, a research company that is part of the TNS Media Intelligence unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. “If you’ve got to sell a lot of beer or chips, or you have something big to announce, it’s a great venue,” he added, despite steep costs that otherwise may be “really hard to justify.” Viewers also respond to Super Bowl spots much differently than to commercials in most other TV shows. Ever since a spectacular Apple commercial called “1984” turned up during the 1984 Super Bowl, consumers have come to expect superior commercials, stuffed with celebrities, special effects, surprise endings, hit music, anthropomorphic animals and other enticements to pay attention. As a result, rather than change the channel or leave the room for a beer when the selling starts, the audience sticks around, talks about the spots the next day and even goes to Web sites like AOL and YouTube to watch them again. At every Super Bowl party, there is usually someone “who says, ‘Shhhhhhh! Here comes this cool commercial,’ ” Mr. Nail said. It is that buzz factor Procter is hoping to capitalize on. “The Super Bowl is the one time you watch a show and don’t want to miss the commercial breaks,” said Suzanne Watson, Tide brand manager for North America at Procter in Cincinnati. “Given the wide appeal for Tide to Go and the broad audience for the Super Bowl,” she added, “it’s a perfect fit.” Tide to Go, which was introduced in 2005, is particularly fitting for a Super Bowl berth, Ms. Watson said, because of its properties as a quick stain remover. “There are thousands of parties that night,” making Super Bowl Sunday “the biggest stain-based occasion of the year,” she added. “With Tide to Go right there, you don’t have to get up to clean your shirt or pants.” One reason this year’s Super Bowl has become more desirable for Procter than Super Bowl X or even XX is the growing number of women who tune in the game. In some years, more women have watched the Super Bowl than the Oscars, a show with such potent female appeal that it has been nicknamed on Madison Avenue “the Super Bowl for women.”  Another reason is that Procter has started seeking Tide buyers beyond the traditional market of women, adding pitches aimed at men and students of both sexes. The Tide to Go commercial will be supported by a wide-ranging marketing campaign, Ms. Watson said, that will include the Internet, public relations and promotions. Such nontraditional elements “can really connect with consumers outside the laundry room,” she added, “and in their daily lives.” Ms. Watson declined to discuss details of the campaign or the commercial because, she said, it was too soon. The Tide to Go commercial is only Procter’s third in the Super Bowl. The first, for Charmin bathroom tissue, ran in 2004. The second, in 2006, was for Gillette, which Procter had acquired months before. The initial Procter foray into the Super Bowl  in a commercial created by another Publicis agency in New York, Publicis Worldwide  drew mostly negative reviews. It was one of only two spots that Bob Garfield, the ad critic for the trade publication Advertising Age, slighted with 1.5 stars; he gave lower scores to just two spots and higher scores to 31. “We haven’t been focused on how this TV spot will measure relative to others,” Ms. Watson said. “We just want to do the best in communicating with our consumers.” Translation from marketing-speak: The pressure is on.

So, too, has the idea of ads that parody other ads. Now, with the increasing interest among marketers in embedding brands in entertainment programming, a viral campaign is arriving that spoofs the concept  while at the same time, of course, playing up the product. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Opening Credits for "The Harry Situation" Video Clip From "The Harry Situation" The United States consumer products division of L’Oréal is starting an online campaign  viral, because consumers are meant to pass it along  that sends up the concept of sponsors insinuating products into television shows, movies and video games. The humorous campaign includes a Web site, video clips and a blog. They were developed by the L’Oréal division’s digital agency, Avenue A/Razorfish, part of Microsoft, and Kirt Gunn &amp; Associates, an agency in New York that specializes in interactive advertising. The campaign introduces a line of hair-care products called Garnier Fructis Style Bold It, aimed at men ages 18 to 34. Because the intended audience is “extremely savvy when it comes to marketing,” said Pete Stein, senior vice president and general manager at the New York office of Avenue A/Razorfish, branded entertainment was considered a target ripe for satire. The campaign for hair gel is presented to consumers as if Garnier executives had made a branded entertainment agreement with “a low-rent, three-letter broadcast network named after an animal,” as one blog post foxily describes it. The deal ostensibly involved a new comedy, “The Harry Situation”  with innuendo-laden dialogue reminiscent of smarmy series like “Three’s Company”  and a companion Web site (theharrysituation.com).  The premise is that the incessant, heavy-handed product plugs in the first episodes supposedly made a creator of the series angry enough to hijack the site and expose the excessive commercialism of his brainchild. His purported blog entries are supplemented by video clips that pretend to offer excerpts from the offending episodes of “The Harry Situation” and from meetings with network executives. Also included on the Web site are mock memos from Garnier; fictitious reports of focus-group interviews with dim young consumers bearing names like Ashley, Brandon and Madison; and summaries of the imaginary reactions of test audiences to the series. “Everyone’s fair game, and that’s what makes it fun,” said Kirt Gunn, president at Gunn. Last year, he developed an equally elaborate online campaign for the ThermaCare brand of heat wraps sold by Procter &amp; Gamble, which was based on the fanciful notion that men can suffer menstrual cramping. The L’Oréal campaign partly bites the hand that feeds it, because products carrying the L’Oréal name are indeed incorporated into television shows like “America’s Next Top Model.” “It’s a little bit of a wink to the industry,” said Cheryl Vitali, senior vice president for marketing for the Garnier and Maybelline New York brands at the L’Oréal division. “The challenge was not doing what’s expected,” she added. Viral campaigns are multiplying for the same reason as branded entertainment: the urgency among advertisers to find alternative ways to reach jaded, distracted consumers as technologies like DVRs and iPods make it easier to avoid conventional pitches. Traditional types of advertising like commercials are passive and intrusive. By contrast, consumers decide to come to Web sites like theharrysituation.com, visiting when they want, reading what they want and staying as long  or as briefly  as they want. “The Internet has turned people into active seekers, active diggers,” said Eric M. Plaskonas, director for brand communications at Philips Electronics North America, which has sponsored viral campaigns based on whimsical Web sites like shaveeverywhere.com. “The site becomes the buzz factor,” Mr. Plaskonas said, “and consumers who know about it can brag they’re in the ‘in’ crowd.” The concept of the Garnier campaign required Avenue A/Razorfish and Gunn to produce a prodigious amount of content. In mid-October, they put up a Web site for “The Harry Situation” that looked as if it had been created by a network promotion department. Then, in mid-November, the “official” site was replaced with one intended to look as if the series creator had wrested it away to tell “the true story of the rise and fall of the show you’ll never see,” as he writes on his blog. “We wanted to do something different,” said Barbara Kittridge, vice president for integrated marketing communications for Garnier and Maybelline New York, “and we saw humor as a way in.” As for the idea that a burlesque of branded entertainment may go over the heads of some consumers, “we realized the humor had to work on a number of different levels,” she added. “There’s goofy slapstick,” Ms. Kittridge said. “There’s the type of humor to compete with the Comedy Centrals of the world. And we also wanted to go for an irreverent, smart, sophisticated level of comedy.” To appeal to as many men as possible, whether their favorite humorist is Dane Cook, Jon Stewart or Noël Coward, the contents of the Web site are liberally peppered with sex, to borrow a line from a movie, “The Bad and the Beautiful.”  Garnier is not the first brand to parody branded entertainment. On the NBC series “30 Rock,” advertisers like General Electric and Snapple have lampooned the deals that enabled them to be written into episodes. Not everyone appreciates the joke. “We love you more than life itself, ‘30 Rock,’” declared a writer in a recent issue of New York magazine, “but stop making jokes about your own egregious product placements.” Mr. Stein of Avenue A/Razorfish acknowledged there was “a fine line.” “We were very careful to be clear it was a spoof,” he said. “The product will be the hero of the story, but we’re making it about entertainment, not about the product itself.” The campaign is scheduled to run through late January or early February, by which time, Mr. Gunn said, the Web site will include more than 30 blog posts, more than 50 video clips and hundreds of photographs. To allay concerns that the campaign will be dismissed as a flog  the derisive name given to fake blogs that do not identify themselves as sponsored  the Web site is liberally peppered with references that it is “brought to you by” Garnier Fructis Style Bold It. “If someone was fooled, even for a minute,” Mr. Gunn said, “we hope they’d get a kick out of the fact they were fooled.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/20/business/worldbusiness/20cosmetics.html?ref=procterandgamble">A New Science, at First Blush<date>Published: November 20, 2007</date><text>GRASSE, France  The delicate hybrids thriving in the balmy climes of Provence, southern Frances traditional perfume region, include sweet jasmine, May roses  and fresh layers of artificial human skin. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Chris Jackson/Getty Images By 2009, only companies that shun the use of animals in testing will be allowed to sell makeup in Europe. Scientists here are working feverishly to develop new technologies to test cosmetics before a European Union ban on animal testing begins in March 2009. These advanced materials  including reconstructed eye tissue and tiny circles of skin developed from donor cells harvested from cosmetic operations  are a vital part of the industrys future as it faces rapidly tightening European regulations, rules that apply to any company wishing to sell in the 27-nation European Union. The looming European ban is not only forcing multinational companies to adopt new practices. It is also bringing together regulators in Brussels with agencies from the worlds other large cosmetics markets  the Food and Drug Administration in the United States and the Ministry of Health in Japan  to harmonize regulation. Even more surprising, the new standards are pushing longtime secretive rivals to cooperate, grudgingly and sometimes with prodding from regulators and politicians. The European commissioner for science, Janez Potocnik, appeared this month at a meeting for multinational companies and chided them for slowing the search for alternatives by failing to share information. The stakes are high: Europe is the worlds leading cosmetics market, and it also exports more than $23.4 billion worth of cosmetics every year. Cosmetics exported from the United States to Europe amount to nearly $2 billion a year, about 7 percent of the European market. After the United States, Japan is the second leading provider of cosmetics to Europe . Without question these regulations are having an impact, said Dr. Alan Goldberg, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. What company is going to want to eliminate 450 million customers by not complying? The cosmetics giant LOréal has devoted more than $800 million in the last 20 years to the development of alternatives to animal testing, while its American rival, Procter &amp; Gamble, maker of the Cover Girl line, has spent almost $225 million. For the cosmetics industry, its a race, said Hervé Groux, 45, a French immunology scientist who presides over a year-old research lab in Grasse that aids smaller companies lacking the resources of titans like LOréal and Procter &amp; Gamble. The rules are pushing everyone to move faster and to put more money into research. The European Commission itself is spending almost 25 million euros ($36.5 million) yearly on the search for animal alternatives, while many countries are seeding programs with annual budgets of 15 million to 20 million euros. Mr. Grouxs lab, Immunosearch, had its official debut party Wednesday in a boxy industrial park, where Mr. Groux and his wife, a molecular biologist, and other newly recruited veteran researchers are striving to shape a new world of beauty research  and at the same time spare the lives of thousands of rabbits, mice, rats and guinea pigs. As the 2009 deadline approaches, European regulators issue periodic tallies of the number of laboratory animals potentially spared by alternatives to animal tests, across all kinds of industrial uses. Part of the pressure for alternatives also stems from additional legislation, known as Reach, requiring companies to develop safety data on 30,000 chemicals over the next 11 years  research that could raise the prospect of increased animal testing. In fact, the actual number of animals tested for cosmetics is small compared with medical or educational uses, according to a new European Commission report. But from 2002 to 2005 the tally grew 50 percent in Europe, to 5,571 animals. Much of that testing was taking place here in France, the country that leads Europe in testing and vigorously fought the ban, ultimately appealing, in vain, to the European Court of Justice. But it is also in Provence  a region fabled for its fragrances and the professional noses who create them  where scientists are gathering to work on alternative testing research in vitro, literally in the glass. In nearby Nice, SkinEthic, a 15-year-old company, is developing and manufacturing a line of cellular tools that includes a wide range of human tissues. Last year, SkinEthic was purchased by LOréal, which propelled the parent company into a dominant position in the testing field, with two critical patents on reconstructed skin. SkinEthic produces its own form of reconstructed skin, RHE, while LOréal holds the patent to Episkin, which its scientists developed in Lyon. Episkin was validated this year by European regulators as a test tool that could fully replace animals. Its closest competitor, EpiDerm  developed by MatTek, a company in Ashland, Mass.  received only qualified approval for research use because the artificial skin reacted too sensitively, producing different results than natural skin would. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/19/business/media/19adcol.html?ref=procterandgamble">A Web Site for Pet Lovers, and Marketers Who Love Them<date>Published: November 19, 2007</date><text>KNOWING that you can never underestimate peoples love for their cats and dogs, NBC Universal and Procter &amp; Gamble have set up a Web portal that looks something like a Yahoo or AOL for pet owners, with a bit of Facebook and MySpace thrown in.

Procter &amp; Gamble is already planning to market its Iams pet food and Febreze air freshener there, and NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric, is promoting some of its programs. Petside will also be linked to a pet-specific site in NBCs iVillage site and promoted weekly on the Today show. But Petside will be open to any advertiser, including companies with products that compete with Procter. Yesterday, the site featured prominent ads for Bank of Americas investment services and for LasikPlus Vision Centers. Keeping it narrowly defined as a Procter thing would not let it acknowledge its potential, said Jim Stengel, the global marketing officer of Procter &amp; Gamble. It can make a bigger splash and a bigger difference if its bigger and if its more inclusive. Procter and NBC say that if Petside.com is successful, they may create more Web content together. The joint development model allows both partners to shape the site from an early stage, instead of just buying ad space at the end, the executives involved said. Other future expansion plans could include inviting owners of hamsters, birds and rabbits to join, the executives said. Although much of the information on Petside.com is drawn from other providers (like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals), the idea is to set up a formula to gather content from a variety of sources, and support it with strong brand names. Marketers and media companies are often very much aligned in what were trying to do, so why not try to do it together? said Beth Comstock, president for integrated media at NBC Universal. But passionate pet owners do not necessarily equal lots of Web traffic, according to Nielsen Onlines tracking. PetSmart.com, which sells supplies, attracted the most visitors pet site last month, about 2.48 million. PetFinder.com, an animal adoption site owned by Discovery Communications, was visited by 2.1 million people, and 1.1 million people clicked on DogBreedInfo.com. Yahoos pet site and Animal Planet generated such small amounts of traffic that they were not picked up at all by Nielsens Web panel. Procter and NBC executives said they thought their site would draw the sort of enthusiastic people whom advertisers want to reach. Theres a lot of content and e-commerce about pets, but its all fragmented, said Mr. Stengel of Procter &amp; Gamble. We thought there was a big service opportunity to put it all in one place. NBC is creating original videos for the site, including a series called On the Petside, and will offer advice from a veterinarian, who will take questions by e-mail and post answers online. The sites Pet Vet section will help people diagnose maladies, using diagrams of cats and dogs that map onto symptoms and possible remedies. Another feature helps people who are considering a new dog find the right breed. A visitor answers a series of questions about his home, family and the size pet he wants, and the site suggests possible matches. Photos of dogs and cats available for purchase or adoption are just a click away. Procter and NBC signed up a number of existing organizations to supply content to Petside. Jo Sullivan, senior vice president for development and communication for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said the site offered the most comprehensive information for pet owners that she had seen on the Internet. NBC is selling the ads on Petside as well as across a new pet ad network on other sites like Worldwide Fido and DogCentral. The Petside content will also be syndicated onto external social networking sites and video sites. More Articles in Business »</text></article></page></root>
