Amgen said it had reached an agreement in principle to settle criminal and civil investigations that had been under way for several years by the United States attorney offices in Brooklyn and Seattle. The company said a settlement, which it expected to be concluded in three to four months, would also resolve state Medicaid investigations and 10 whistle-blower lawsuits. It is not clear if the company will plead guilty to any criminal charges. Most of the whistle-blower lawsuits remain under seal, but Amgen has said in regulatory filings that the lawsuits “allege that Amgen engaged in a wide variety of illegal marketing practices.” The federal investigations, according to Amgen, seem to involve marketing, pricing and dosing of its anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen, and its dissemination of information about clinical trials on the safety and efficacy of those drugs. Numerous current and former executives have received civil and grand jury subpoenas, the company has said. One whistle-blower lawsuit that was unsealed accuses the company of overfilling vials of Aranesp, essentially providing doctors with free amounts of the drug to give patients and then charge to Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers. The lawsuit said that Amgen tried to persuade doctors to use Aranesp, rather than Procrit, a rival drug sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson, by pointing to the extra profits the doctors could make by using the overfill and billing for it. The lawsuit was filed by Kassie Westmoreland, a former Amgen sales representative and Aranesp product manager. The federal government declined to join the lawsuit, but more than a dozen states did join, including New York and California. Ms. Westmoreland would be entitled to part of any settlement under whistle-blower statutes. In the past, Amgen has said the accusations were without merit. During depositions in the case, five former Amgen executives invoked the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, according to court documents. That case was scheduled to go to trial in the United States District Court in Boston on Oct. 17, but the trial was then called off, apparently because a settlement was near. “We are very encouraged by the agreement in principle and will comment further at the appropriate time,” lawyers for Ms. Westmoreland said. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, revealed the agreement in its earnings announcement for the third quarter. It said the charge for the settlement reduced its third-quarter earnings by 77 cents a share after taxes. The settlement and the charge did not seem to interest investors. In the company’s conference call on Monday, no analyst asked a question about it. Excluding the legal charge and some other special items, Amgen reported that earnings for the quarter increased 3 percent, to $1.40 a share, compared with the third quarter of 2010. Revenue also increased 3 percent, to $3.94 billion. The company slightly raised its guidance for both revenue and earnings for 2011 as a whole. And it said it would increase its buyback of shares. Sales of most Amgen products rose in the quarter. But sales of its anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen, continued to fall, in part because the Food and Drug Administration issued new safety warnings about the drugs in June. Over the last few years, studies have shown that high doses of the drugs can raise the risk of heart attacks and other problems. Sales of Aranesp fell 4 percent in the quarter to $600 million. Sales of Epogen, which is used only by dialysis clinics, fell 27 percent, to $476 million. Medicare has changed the way it pays for dialysis to remove what had been a profit incentive for dialysis clinics to overuse Epogen.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/01/valeant-to-buy-pharmaswiss-for-481-million/?ref=amgeninc">Valeant to Buy PharmaSwiss for $481 Million<date>February 1, 2011, 7:10 am</date><text>Valeant Pharmaceuticals said on Tuesday that it would acquire PharmaSwiss, the maker of generic drugs, for 350 million euros ($481 million). PharmaSwiss, based in Switzerland, has operations in 19 Central and East European countries, as well as Greece and Israel. It reported revenue of about 180 million euros in 2010, and growth of about 20 percent annually for the last five years. The deal is expected to close this quarter or next, pending regulatory approval, and to be immediately accretive to Valeant shares. “This acquisition of PharmaSwiss solidifies our position as a leading pharmaceutical company in Central and Eastern Europe,” said J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive. “Valeant Europe’s strong presence in Poland, the region’s largest market, fills an important gap, and should contribute to transaction synergies,” said Pavel Mirovsky, the chief executive of PharmaSwiss, who will stay on with the combined company. Valeant specializes in neurology, dermatology and branded generics, it said. PharmaSwiss also represents multinational drug makers like Amgen, Lilly and Pfizer.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen to Buy BioVex, Maker of Cancer Drugs<date>Published: January 24, 2011</date><text>Amgen said it agreed to buy BioVex, a closely held maker of experimental cancer drugs, for $425 million and as much as $575 million in milestone payments. BioVex’s lead product, the experimental cancer vaccine Oncovex, is in the final stages of testing usually required for regulatory approval. It treats metastatic melanoma, a skin cancer. The drug also is being studied in head and neck cancer, the companies said. BioVex’s drugs may help Amgen add direct cancer therapy to its products that provide supportive care to cancer patients, like the bone drug Xgeva. Amgen has announced seven acquisitions in the last five years with an average disclosed size of $264.2 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BioVex, based in Woburn, Mass., is the largest, the data shows. The transaction has been approved by the boards of both companies. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., had $17.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, as of Dec. 31, the company said in a statement.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/health/21goldwasser.html?ref=amgeninc">Eugene Goldwasser, Developer of Anemia Drug, Dies at 88<date>Published: December 20, 2010</date><text>Eugene Goldwasser, a largely unsung biochemist whose 20-year pursuit of an elusive protein led to the development of a widely used anemia drug that became one of the biggest products of the biotechnology industry, died Friday at his home in Chicago. He was 88.The cause was kidney failure caused by a recurrence of prostate cancer, his son James said. In the late 1970s, Dr. Goldwasser, working at the University of Chicago, isolated and purified erythropoietin, or Epo, a protein that spurs the body to produce red blood cells. And he shared his precious material with a young biotechnology company, which figured out how to produce larger amounts of the protein using genetic engineering. That company, Amgen, became the world’s biggest biotechnology company on the basis of Epo. Sales of the protein under names like Epogen, Procrit and Aranesp amount to billions of dollars a year for Amgen, as well as for Johnson &amp; Johnson and Roche. Most people undergoing kidney dialysis now receive Epo, helping to relieve them of severe anemia, which can sap them of energy. Many cancer patients also get the drug to combat anemia caused by chemotherapy. “It just continually delighted him that the work he did ended up having an impact on patients,” said Dr. Gary Toback, a friend and colleague of Dr. Goldwasser’s at the University of Chicago. Epo has also been used surreptitiously by athletes, most notoriously Tour de France bicycle racers, to increase their endurance. In addition, recent studies have suggested that overuse of the drug can harm patients. Sales, as a result, have declined over the last few years. While Epo has meant huge profits for drug companies, Dr. Goldwasser, whom colleagues described as quiet and self-effacing, won neither fame nor fortune. Although he notified his university about his accomplishment, it never patented Epo, and Dr. Goldwasser did not follow up. “One percent of one percent of the drug’s annual revenues would have funded my lab quite handsomely,” he told a university publicist years later. Eugene Goldwasser was born in Brooklyn in 1922. When his father’s clothing business failed during the Depression, the family moved to Kansas City, Mo., to join a relative in a similar business. After attending high school and a community college there, he transferred as a junior to the University of Chicago on a scholarship, earning a bachelor’s degree and, in 1950, a doctorate in biochemistry. As far back as 1906, two French researchers had postulated the existence of a substance that prompts the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the body’s tissues. But if that substance did exist, it was in such minuscule quantities that no one could find it. Dr. Goldwasser began to look for it in 1955 at the urging of his mentor, the noted hematologist Leon O. Jacobson. “I estimated several months should see the task completed,” Dr. Goldwasser recalled in 1996 in an essay in the journal Perspectives in Biology and Medicine. Instead it took 20 years. In 1957, Dr. Goldwasser and colleagues, by systematically removing different organs from rats to see if they became anemic, concluded that Epo was made in the kidneys. That helped explain why patients with kidney failure became anemic. Figuring that animals with anemia would produce more Epo, making the protein easier to find, Dr. Goldwasser spent years visiting a slaughterhouse outside Chicago, injecting sheep with a chemical that would make them anemic. He would collect the blood and try to separate out the various components. But it turned out that Epo would be easier to find in urine than in blood. In 1973, when his search seemed to be at a dead end, Dr. Goldwasser received a letter from Takaji Miyake of Kumamoto University in Japan, who had been collecting urine from people with a disease called aplastic anemia. At the end of 1975, Dr. Miyake met Dr. Goldwasser in the lobby of the elegant Palmer House hotel in Chicago. He bowed low and held out a foot-square package wrapped in brightly colored silk, according to the book “The $800 Million Dollar Pill” by Merrill Goozner, which recounts the history of Epo. Inside was the dried concentrate of 2,550 liters, or about 674 gallons, of urine. From that material, Dr. Goldwasser, his assistant Charles Kung and Dr. Miyake purified 8 milligrams, or about 3 ten-thousandths of an ounce, of Epo, enough to fill a small vial. They published a paper in 1977. Such a difficult extraction process was not practical for producing enough Epo to use as a drug. But the age of gene splicing was dawning. Knowing some of the protein’s composition, Fu-Kuen Lin, a scientist at Amgen, was eventually able to clone the human gene for Epo. The gene was spliced into hamster cells, which churned out enough Epo to sell as a drug. The drug was tested first in patients undergoing dialysis, who suffered debilitating anemia. The only treatment at that time was frequent blood transfusions, which exposed patients to infectious diseases and to a dangerous buildup of iron in their livers. Epo was “a spectacular success,” said Dr. John W. Adamson, who conducted that first trial around 1985 while at the University of Washington. Patients who had so little energy they had to crawl up stairs became fully functional, he said. Nowadays, owing to Epo, such horribly anemic dialysis patients have “essentially disappeared,” said Dr. Adamson, who is now at the University of California, San Diego. Amgen patented the Epo gene, barely beating out another company, and through litigation has preserved its monopoly for more than 20 years. Some companies wanting to sell their own versions of Epo have complained that by choosing to work only with Amgen, Dr. Goldwasser, whose research was financed by the National Institutes of Health, had essentially privatized public property. In his 1996 essay, Dr. Goldwasser said he had gotten permission for this from the N.I.H. Dr. Goldwasser continued research on Epo, retiring from the university in 2002. He is survived by his second wife, Deone Jackman; three sons from his first marriage, Thomas, of San Francisco, Matthew, of Chicago, and James, of New York; two stepchildren, Tara and Tom Jackman; and seven grandchildren. His first wife, Florence Cohen, died in 1981. Dr. Goldwasser said in his 1996 essay that when he started his quest he had no idea the results would be so medically useful. “The enormous clinical success of Epo still astonishes me,” he wrote.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/14amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Drug Slows Prostate Cancer Spread but Doesn’t Extend Life<date>Published: December 13, 2010</date><text>Amgen’s bone drug denosumab delayed the spread of prostate cancer to bones in a clinical trial, the company said late Monday. However, the drug did not prolong the lives of men.Dr. Matthew R. Smith, the lead investigator in the trial and a consultant to Amgen, said the results were meaningful because no drug before had been proved to prevent the spread of cancer to the bone, a major cause of pain and disability in men with prostate cancer. “This study is the first to demonstrate prevention of bone metastasis, the most devastating complication of prostate cancer,” Dr. Smith, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts General Hospital, said in an e-mail. “It addresses a critical unmet need.” The results surprised Wall Street, which had generally been betting that the trial would not show a positive result. Amgen’s shares rose more than 7 percent after hours. “Who Says Miracles Don’t Happen in Biotech” was the headline on a note issued Monday by Yaron Werber, an analyst at Citigroup. But Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at the ISI Group, said in a note that the results were “at the low end of what would be considered clinically meaningful.” He also said the lack of a survival benefit was “likely to generate some debate.” The trial involved 1,432 men with so-called castrate-resistant prostate cancer who were randomly assigned to receive injections every four weeks of denosumab or a placebo. The cancer had not spread to the bone at the start of the trial, but that was considered to be a high risk because the men’s P.S.A. levels, markers of disease severity, were rising. The goal was to see if denosumab could delay the time until either the cancer spread to the bone or the patient died from any cause. The drug did delay the median time for this to occur by 4.2 months, a statistically significant difference. Using a different statistic, the risk of bone metastasis or death was reduced 15 percent. Major side effects were low calcium in the blood and a destruction of jaw bones that are associated with many bone drugs. The results were announced by press release, so they have not been reviewed by independent experts. Amgen did not provide further details, saying it would present them at a medical meeting. The benefit came entirely from delaying bone metastasis, not death. Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, said the trial had not been expected to show a survival benefit since most of the patients lived through the course of the trial. Also, men who experienced bone metastasis were removed from the study so they could be treated with a drug that helps prevent fractures. Denosumab blocks a protein involved in the destruction of bone. That presumably makes the bone a less hospitable environment for cancer cells to take root. The drug, sold under the name Xgeva, was approved in November to help prevent fractures and other skeletal problems after prostate and other cancers had already spread to the bone. The drug is also sold to treat osteoporosis under the name Prolia. Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, has suffered from declining sales of its anemia drug Aranesp because of safety concerns. Sales growth of some of its other drugs is slowing, so denosumab is considered a key to its future. Use in preventing bone metastasis could add several hundred million dollars a year to annual sales of denosumab.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/18/f-d-a-approves-a-bone-drug-for-cancer-patients/?ref=amgeninc">F.D.A. Approves a Bone Drug for Cancer Patients<date>November 18, 2010, 8:38 pm</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the use of Amgen’s bone drug denosumab as a treatment for cancer patients whose disease has spread to their bones. The drug, which will be called Xgeva, does not treat the cancer itself. Rather, it helps prevent fractures, spinal cord compression or other bone problems that can arise as cancers weaken the bones. Denosumab, which is considered crucial to Amgen’s future, was approved in June as a treatment for osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. It is sold for that purpose under the name Prolia. Sales so far have been slow. But the use for cancer patients might be more lucrative for Amgen because cancer patients would use 12 times as much of the drug a year than osteoporosis patients do. Sales could easily surpass $1 billion a year, some analysts estimate. The wholesale price of Xgeva will be $1,650 for an injection given every four weeks, the company said. Amgen needs strong sales of denosumab because growth is slowing for its now mature portfolio of other products. And sales of its anemia drug Aranesp have fallen over the last few years because of safety concerns. Bone metastases are quite common, particularly for advanced prostate, breast and lung cancer. For patients with advanced prostate cancer, bone metastases are the dominant cause of death and symptoms, said Dr. Matthew R. Smith, a prostate cancer specialist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. Amgen tested Xgeva directly against Novartis’s Zometa, which is already approved to prevent bone problems in cancer patients. Xgeva proved superior in prostate and breast cancer in reducing the risk of fractures, spinal cord compression or the need for surgery or radiation treatment for bone problems. For other solid tumors Xgeva was roughly equivalent to Zometa. But Xgeva did not work well in multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, so it is not approved for patients with that cancer or other blood and lymphatic cancers. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, is also testing whether denosumab could actually prevent the spread of cancer to the bone in the first place. There is no drug approved for that purpose. Results of that trial are expected before the end of this year.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/26/business/26amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Profit Falls, but It Affirms Forecast for Year<date>Published: October 25, 2010</date><text>Amgen reported on Monday that its third-quarter profit fell on declining sales of some of its biggest drugs.Investors are focused on the company’s new osteoporosis drug Prolia, and especially on an eagerly anticipated Food and Drug Administration decision on whether to approve the drug to treat bone problems in patients with advanced cancer. That use is seen as propelling the medicine to annual sales in excess of $1 billion. Amgen said that it expected an F.D.A. decision by Nov. 18, and that it still expected late-stage clinical data on the drug for the prevention of bone metastases in cancer patients to become available during the current quarter. Prolia, known chemically as denosumab, had disappointing sales of just $10 million in osteoporosis, but the drug is still in its early marketing stage. Amgen’s profit of $1.24 billion, or $1.28 a share, was down from a profit of $1.39 billion, or $1.36 a share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.36 a share. Analysts on average had expected $1.27, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue was flat at $3.82 billion and shy of Wall Street estimates of $3.77 billion. The company maintained its full-year forecast for revenue slightly below $15.1 billion.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE5DA143FF931A35755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">Amgen Drug Approved to Fight Osteoporosis<date>Published: June 2, 2010</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved the sale of Amgen's osteoporosis drug Prolia to help prevent fractures in postmenopausal women. Last week, the medicine received European approval. The drug, known chemically as denosumab, is considered to be Amgen's most important for its future. The F.D.A. decision was made nearly two months before the agency's expected action date, July 25. According to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, one out of every two women over age 50 will break a bone in their lifetime as a result of osteoporosis. ''Due to its prevalence, osteoporosis is a serious concern to public health,'' Dr. Julie Beitz, director of an F.D.A. office of drug evaluation, said in a statement. ''The approval of Prolia provides another treatment option for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are susceptible to fractures.'' In a pivotal study that was the basis for the approval, Prolia reduced the incidence of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Investors sent Amgen shares more than 3 percent higher in after-hours trading. Prolia, which is given by injection once every six months, works to decrease the destruction of bone and increase bone mass and strength by inhibiting proteins that activate bone-destroying cells. Analysts estimate that the product could draw annual global sales of $3.3 billion in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters. Shares of Amgen fell $1.02 , 0r 2 percent, to close at $50.76.

News of the results sent Amgen's shares up nearly 3 percent in after-hours trading. Amgen said the 1,900-patient trial, which compared its drug with Novartis's Zometa, met all of its goals. The company said the results were statistically significant, but did not provide details. It said full results would be announced at a medical meeting in June. Amgen said overall adverse events, including infections, were generally similar between the two treatment groups. Osteonecrosis of the jaw, death of jaw bone tissue, was seen in 22 patients receiving denosumab, compared with 12 patients receiving Zometa. In addition, the incidence of low blood calcium levels was more frequent in the denosumab arm, the company said. Credit Suisse has estimated that sales of denosumab could total $3 billion by 2013.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/31/business/31drug.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Is Accused of Illegal Kickbacks<date>Published: October 30, 2009</date><text>The biotechnology giant Amgen has been accused by New York and some other states of engaging in illegal kickbacks to promote sales of its anemia drug Aranesp. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Amgen Inc Go to your Portfolio » In a lawsuit filed Friday, the states say that Amgen, in effect, provided free samples to doctors and clinics by putting tiny extra amounts of the drug in each vial. The medical practices could then make a profit by billing insurers, including state Medicaid programs, for the extra drug. “In an egregious violation of the law, Amgen allegedly bribed medical providers and left taxpayers footing the bill for free drug samples,” Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, whose office led the investigation, said in a statement. The lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Boston by 14 states and the District of Columbia, also names AmerisourceBergen, a drug distributor. The suit joins a whistle-blower suit with similar allegations filed by Kassie Westmoreland, a former Amgen sales representative. Amgen said in a statement that it believed the allegations to be “without merit” and that it had a strong program to keep employees compliant with regulations. It said it could not comment in detail because the matter was in litigation. Michael N. Kilpatric, a spokesman for AmerisourceBergen, said, “We don’t believe we did anything wrong and we will fight it vigorously.” He said the company was cooperating with a subpoena it received this summer from the Justice Department, which is also investigating the matter. The lawsuit is just one of many state and federal investigations against pharmaceutical companies in recent years for unlawful marketing practices. Several companies have paid huge fines. Aranesp, which is used to treat the anemia caused by kidney disease or cancer chemotherapy, was once Amgen’s biggest-selling product. Sales, $4.1 billion in 2006, have declined in the last three years because of safety concerns, though the company is still expected to post sales of nearly $3 billion for Aranesp this year. On Friday, a study published online by The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology added to those concerns. The study found that patients with kidney disease and diabetes who received Aranesp had about twice the risk of stroke as those who received a placebo. Amgen competes with Johnson &amp; Johnson, which sells a similar drug called Procrit, that is also manufactured by Amgen under a licensing agreement. The drugs are bought by medical practices, which are then reimbursed by insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid. Medical practices can make a profit from the drugs if they buy them for less than their reimbursements. That, critics say, has led to overuse of drugs, putting patients at risk. Regulations require that syringes and vials contain a tiny extra amount of drug. This is meant to ensure that patients get a full dose, because not every molecule of drug makes it out of the syringe or vial. The suit says Amgen took advantage of this by increasing the amount of “overfill” in Aranesp vials beyond what was strictly necessary, while at the same time decreasing the amount of overfill for Procrit. It then told medical practices that they would make more money if they used Aranesp, because they could bill insurers for that extra amount  whether they gave it all to a single patient or saved the extra portions to give to other patients. “Aranesp vials had ‘built in’ free samples that the sales force could offer to medical providers,” the complaint says. It says that New York’s Medicaid program alone paid at least $1.8 million in reimbursements for the overfill from April 2004 through this July. The lawsuit also says that Amgen, in cooperation with a division of AmerisourceBergen, invited doctors to weekend retreats, paying for their food and lodging and giving them extra payments as “advisers.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 31, 2009, on page B2 of the New York edition.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/business/20amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">F.D.A. Says No to an Amgen Bone Drug<date>Published: October 19, 2009</date><text>Amgen has failed to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration, for now at least, for the bone-strengthening drug that the company has been counting on to propel its growth. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Amgen Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company said on Monday that the F.D.A. had instead asked for more information  though not new clinical trials  for the drug, denosumab. The drug is meant to be a treatment for osteoporosis, the bone-thinning disease, in women who have passed through menopause. In recent days some Wall Street analysts had speculated that the F.D.A. would delay its decision on denosumab by 90 days past Monday’s deadline. Such a delay is not uncommon because the agency’s staff is stretched thin. But the F.D.A. instead issued a “complete response” letter, essentially a rejection, which could possibly delay approval well beyond 90 days. Amgen’s stock fell $1.08, or nearly 2 percent, on Monday, closing at $60.24. Analysts have predicted that denosumab, which Amgen would sell under the name Prolia, could reach sales of at least $1 billion a year, and possibly much more. Amgen needs a hit product because sales of Aranesp, its flagship drug for anemia, have been hurt by safety concerns. And growth in sales of its other big-selling drugs has slowed. In a news release Monday morning, Amgen said the F.D.A. had asked for several items before it could approve denosumab to treat osteoporosis, including more information on the studies the company would perform after the drug is approved. The agency is also still discussing Amgen’s plans for limiting the risks from the drug’s use. However, the company said, the F.D.A. did not ask for more clinical trials, which would have meant a much longer delay. “We are confident that we can quickly respond to the F.D.A.’s request for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis indication and plan to do so in the near term,” Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, the company’s executive vice president for research and development, said in a statement. Analysts generally said they expected Amgen to be able to satisfy the F.D.A.’s requirements. Geoffrey Meacham of JPMorgan predicted the drug could be approved by the first quarter of 2010. Joshua Schimmer of Leerink Swann predicted a delay of five to 10 months. But while Amgen could win approval next year for treatment of osteoporosis, it will be harder to win approval for prevention of the disease. The company said Monday that the F.D.A. had asked for another clinical trial of the drug to prevent the bone disease in women who have less severe bone weakness. In August, an advisory committee to the F.D.A. had voted 15-0 in August in favor of approval of denosumab to treat osteoporosis, but 12-3 against approval for preventing it. Amgen is also expecting a decision soon on its application to sell denosumab as a treatment for the bone loss caused by hormone suppression therapies used to treat breast and prostate cancer. The advisory committee was not very enthusiastic about those uses of the drug. About 10 million women in the United States have osteoporosis, and an additional 34 million are at risk for it, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The main drugs now used to treat the condition are bisphosphonates  including Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva  which are taken as pills every day, or every week or every month. But those drugs can be hard to tolerate, and many patients stop taking them. Denosumab, which works through a mechanism discovered in Amgen’s own laboratories, is a protein called a monoclonal antibody. It would be given by an injection every six months, which could make it easier for patients to remain on therapy. But insurers are likely to require that patients try bisphosphonates first, particularly since generic versions of Fosamax are now available and likely to be far less expensive than denosumab.

The committee, which advises the Food and Drug Administration, voted 15 to 0 that the drug, called denosumab, should be approved to treat postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, a condition marked by weak bones that are prone to fracture. But the committee voted 12 to 3 that denosumab should not be approved to prevent osteoporosis in women with moderately low bone mineral density. And it voted against three of four possible uses for breast and prostate cancer patients whose therapy can weaken bones. Panel members expressed concern about a slight increase in certain infections and cancers in patients getting denosumab compared with those getting a placebo in clinical trials. While the differences could have been by chance in many cases, some committee members argued in favor of caution. ''I feel that the committee's consensus is that the drug should be limited to a high-risk subgroup, high risk for fracture,'' said Dr. Sandra Carson, the committee's chairwoman and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brown University. The F.D.A. is scheduled to decide by Oct. 19 whether to approve the drug, though such deadlines can be missed. The agency usually follows the advice of its advisory committees. Shares of Amgen fell $1.30, or 2 percent, to $60.86. Still, some analysts said the biggest commercial opportunity by far was treatment of osteoporosis, and that vote was positive for the company. ''They got what they needed,'' said Geoffrey Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. ''They didn't emerge unscathed, but what they lost wasn't particularly meaningful.'' But Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, said the committee did express some support, without a vote or much discussion, for having all patients getting denosumab entered into a registry and tracked over time. If the F.D.A. were to require that, he said, the extra paperwork would discourage doctors from using denosumab. ''That would be a real death knell,'' he said. Amgen declined to comment beyond a statement saying that it ''looks forward to collaborating with the F.D.A. to arrive at the best possible approach to making Prolia available to appropriate patients.'' Prolia is the brand name Amgen will use. Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, needs a big success. Sales of its anemia drug Aranesp have been declining because of safety concerns. Sales of Neulasta and Neupogen, which prevent infections that result from chemotherapy, have flattened. Enbrel, the arthritis drug, faces increased competition. Some analysts predict denosumab sales could reach $2 billion a year for treatment of osteoporosis. In a clinical trial involving 8,000 women, only 2.3 percent of those getting denosumab had a vertebral fracture over three years, compared with 7.2 percent of women getting a placebo. Those who got the drug also had fewer hip fractures. There are an estimated 10 million women with osteoporosis in the United States, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. Another 34 million women have low bone mineral density that puts them at risk of getting osteoporosis, but the committee voted against use of the drug for those women. The main treatments now for osteoporosis are drugs called bisphosphonates, like Actonel, Boniva and alendronate, the generic version of Merck's Fosamax. Many analysts expect that doctors, prodded by insurance companies, will try bisphosphonates first, in part because denosumab is expected to be more expensive. But many patients stop taking bisphosphonates because the drugs can be hard to tolerate. Denosumab, which is given only once every six months by an injection, might be an attractive alternative for such patients. Denosumab is a type of protein called a monoclonal antibody that blocks a molecule in the body called RANK ligand, which spurs the formation and activity of cells that break down bone. Women with breast cancer getting estrogen-deprivation therapy and men with prostate cancer getting androgen-deprivation therapy can experience bone weakness similar to osteoporosis. The panel, meeting in Gaithersburg, Md., voted in favor of using denosumab to treat bone loss, but not to prevent it, in men with prostate cancer. It voted against use of the drug for either treatment or prevention of bone loss in women with breast cancer. ''Bone loss is not the major thing,'' said Dr. Aman U. Buzdar, an oncologist at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and a panel member, said. ''The patients already have a fatal disease.''

Job Map,’ Explained<date>Published: March 27, 2009</date><text>THERE’S nothing that quite prepares you for this job. So as I started to think about my responsibilities, I had this synthesized idea of what I was trying to do. I’m trained as an engineer, and that chart probably, you know, outs me on that front. This isn’t perfect, but it at least begins to share the idea of what, on a daily basis, we try to do. That chart has a couple of concepts in it that I think are useful and illustrative. One is, you can break the job down into inside and outside. On the X axis, there are inside-the-company roles — everything from reviewing budgets, product plans, costs, personnel plans, giving speeches to employees, visiting factories. Then there’s the other aspect of the job, which I call outside. And I put the board of directors on that list because they don’t reside in our buildings. So that also includes working with regulators, Congress, the press, the community. Then there’s a concept called altitude. This isn’t a concept that I’ve seen in too many business books, but it’s really important. It’s part of why this job is fascinating and why it’s a challenge. Altitude means you have to have the orientation, energy, attitude, capability to be able to move from a very, very detailed conversation in one 15- or 20-minute meeting — let’s say, what were the sales this week of Product X in Geography Y, and what’s the trend and the implication? That’s a relatively highly detailed, in my jargon, “low altitude” thought. In the next meeting, or maybe even in the same meeting, you might have to move to a very high, strategic question — for example, the president wants to reform the health care system and the economy is struggling. What does all that mean for us in a 5- and 10-year window? So this idea of altitude — going from highly detailed to very, very conceptual — is part of the mix. Then the last thing, the Z axis, is style. Sometimes it’s important, for example, when I’m sitting around the table with my nine direct reports, to kind of have my shirt sleeves rolled up and just be out there in the vineyard working with everybody else and getting dirt under your fingernails and whatever metaphor you want. And then sometimes you have to stand up in front of maybe a group of 1,000 people in a conference or an important meeting and try to give a talk that would be statesmanlike in its delivery and concept and authenticity. So if you now take what I’ve just described, this X, Y, Z matrix, there are small cubes, hundreds of them, defined by topic, style and altitude. You have to instinctively be able to move among these cubes very rapidly and not get stuck in any one part. Some C.E.O.’s get in trouble when they dwell too often in one part of the cube. For example, an industry statesman might spend all of his or her time outside the company at high altitude, and leave the sort of in-the-vineyard work at low altitudes to someone else. Or on the other side you could be somebody who’s so enthralled in the details, you end up micromanaging your company, disempowering the people you work with, and never attending to the issues that only the C.E.O. can lead at least the discussion about, which are the long-range, more strategic questions. You have to be like an athlete in a flow sport, where you just know what the flow on the field is, and almost instinctively you’re able to shape the flow, adapt to it and change your own movements as necessary, depending on what the play of the game is at that moment or what outcome you want. It’s a rare set of skills to have this three-dimensional instinctive ability to move around such a complicated game board.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/business/29corner.html?ref=amgeninc">Feedback in Heaping Helpings<date>Published: March 28, 2009</date><text>This interview with Kevin Sharer, chief executive of Amgen, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Do you recall some insight about leadership and management that put your career on a different trajectory? A. I probably would point to maybe four things. My almost 86-year-old father was a Naval aviator and talked about leadership from my earliest days, and so the idea of leadership as an important concept was something that I kind of was introduced to at an early age. Second thing was that I ended up in the submarine force in the late 1970s, and I got a chance to be the chief engineer of a new construction submarine, which was, for somebody at that age, almost an overwhelmingly difficult job. I was the first officer that showed up on the submarine in the shipyard when it was just the hull on the waves. And to be able to figure out how to train the crew, how to work with the shipyard, I had to find a way to be efficient and organized or I just would have been crushed. So that was important. Third thing was I was fortunate enough to be hired at McKinsey in my early 30s and was able to learn about how to think as a top manager at a young age, how to do analysis, how to be clear and efficient in communications. And then, after that, in my mid-30s, Mike Carpenter, who then worked for Jack Welch as head of business development strategy, hired three people, and I was lucky enough to be one of them. And to be that close to the center of G.E. in those exciting times and watch Welch at his peak, close up, was instructional and inspirational. And then that led to being a general manager of some small G.E. divisions. But again, in my 30s, to be able to do that, that was sort of the capstone of the leadership training. I’ve certainly learned other things in the intervening years, but I think the family background, submarine, McKinsey, G.E. experience was foundationally important and I draw on it to this day. Q. There are also, of course, intangibles in leadership. Could you talk about those? A. Great leaders have something that when you see it, you know what it is, but it’s hard ahead of time to describe exactly what it is. But the first thing I’d say is that leadership is not about charisma and it’s not about style. It’s something about authenticity. It’s something about integrity. It’s something about willingness to take risks. It’s something about the ability to make others feel part of a larger thing. It’s part of being able to articulate the social architecture in a way that others can understand, believe in and follow. Q. What did you say to your staff on the day you took over as C.E.O.? A. It was announced in December of 1999 that I was going to take over as C.E.O in May 2000. I’d already been the president of the company for six or seven years. So I was well known, but I hadn’t supervised R.&amp; D., and that’s obviously the heart of Amgen. So I posed several questions to the senior staff: What are the three things you’d like to make sure that we keep? What three things would you like to change? What is it that you would like me to do? What is it you’re afraid I’m going to do? And then, finally: Is there anything else you want to talk about? I talked to the top 150 people in the company one at a time for an hour. I invited them to bring in, if they wished, written responses so I could have them. I took very careful notes. I wasn’t trying to sell anything. I was trying to deeply listen. And in a science-based company, we value data, and this was social data of profound importance. So I synthesized all the answers and I wrote, just before I became C.E.O., here’s what you guys told me and here’s what I think about it, and so here’s our priorities. People were enthusiastic and honest in talking to me, and it also helped me to get to know the top people in the company better. Q. Where did you get the idea to ask those questions? A. I’m a very coachable person and I’m sincerely open to and I seek feedback, because that’s the only way that you can grow as a C.E.O., which is a very isolating job. And so if you don’t create mechanisms to get authentic feedback, you won’t. Every year I have the head of human resources at Amgen who reports to me conduct an evaluation of me done by my team that they write up and then present to me and the board. And that’s an uncomfortable process, of course. You hope, as C.E.O., for the team to say, “Boy, boss, you did a great job this year, are we lucky to have you.” And, by gosh, every year they’ve come up with three or four things that are quite authentic that I ought to do better. So you’ve got to create those kinds of feedback loops. Q. How have you changed the way you operate as a C.E.O. as a result? A. I’ve been given feedback that says, “Kevin, sometimes you come to a conclusion or blurt out something in a meeting that is premature, which tends to stifle debate, and you know something — you’re wrong.” And so I’m very mindful of letting the conversation proceed and trying to be more Socratic in the way I lead, rather than dictatorial and impulsive. So that’s one place.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/27/business/27biotech.html?ref=amgeninc">Wyeth Deal May Slow Pfizer Biotech Acquisitions<date>Published: January 26, 2009</date><text>This month Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, held a breakfast for venture capitalists atop a hotel in San Francisco. Some guests took it as a sign that Pfizer was serious about buying young biotechnology companies or licensing their technology. Skip to next paragraph Related For Pfizer, a Big Deal and a Test (January 27, 2009) In Wyeth, Pfizer Sees a Drug Pipeline (January 27, 2009) Add to Portfolio Wyeth Pfizer Inc Amgen Inc Biogen Idec Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » But Pfizer’s deal to buy a big pharmaceuticals rival, Wyeth, raises questions about how willing  or able  Pfizer will be to enter deals anytime soon with biotechnology companies, many of which are struggling to stay in business. Wyeth itself will also now be unlikely to buy other companies. On Monday, it withdrew from talks about buying Crucell, a Dutch vaccine maker, sending Crucell’s shares tumbling about 14 percent in Nasdaq trading. In deciding to buy one of its Big Pharma brethren, albeit one with considerable expertise in biotech drugs, Pfizer dispelled the hopes of some investors that it would acquire a major biotechnology company like Amgen or Biogen Idec. Amgen’s shares fell nearly 4 percent on Friday, when news of a possible Wyeth deal surfaced, while Biogen shares, also hurt by positive news about a competitor’s drug, fell 7 percent. Both stocks recovered somewhat on Monday. But Amgen and Biogen are big enough to fend for themselves. More precarious is the condition of many smaller biotechnology companies, those without revenue-producing products and profits. With capital markets frozen, many of these companies are running out of cash and looking to sell themselves or their products to a larger company. “There are probably 5,000 biotech companies out there that are waiting for a deal to save them,” said Oleg Nodelman, portfolio manager at the Biotechnology Value Fund, which invests in smaller biotechnology companies. Pfizer executives say they remain interested in alliances and deals. “We are going to continue to look at opportunities for innovative drugs and technology,” Corey S. Goodman, the president of Pfizer’s Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center in South San Francisco, Calif., said Monday. But others say the debt that Pfizer took on to buy Wyeth might preclude it in the short run from buying any but the smallest of biotech companies. And when two big companies merge, talks for deals with smaller companies tend to get put on the back burner, as management’s attention is diverted and the newly combined company assesses its research pipeline. “It will just drag people’s attention away, and they will want to do only the critical things,” said Jonathan MacQuitty, a partner at venture capital firm Abingworth. With small, unprofitable private biotech companies unable to go public, venture capitalists’ hope for a payout are typically based on selling the companies they start to pharmaceutical companies. Matt Geller of Geller Biopharm, a boutique investment bank, says that because Wyeth is so science-oriented, it has been seen as a good potential partner for smaller and middle-size biotechnology companies. “Unfortunately,” he said, “it does take a potential buyer of smaller biotech companies off the market.” Pfizer, on the other hand, had a reputation for paying top dollar for products or for smaller companies. It raised many eyebrows last September, for instance, when it agreed to pay $225 million initially, and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars later, for the rights to an Alzheimer’s disease drug being developed by Medivation, a San Francisco company. Pfizer is behind many of the other large pharmaceutical companies in moving into biologic drugs, which are made in living cells and are more immune to generic competition. But it is trying to make strides. In late 2007 it hired Mr. Goodman, an academic neuroscientist and biotechnology entrepreneur, to lead its move in that direction, in part by arranging alliances with smaller companies and with universities. To keep the operation nimble, Mr. Goodman reports directly to Mr. Kindler, the chief executive, and has a fair degree of autonomy. Some experts say Pfizer’s purchase of Wyeth might actually spur other pharmaceutical companies to buy biotechnology companies. One reason Pfizer was interested in Wyeth was the latter’s expertise in manufacturing biotech drugs and vaccines. “I think it’s just further evidence of how valuable these assets are,” said Kris Jenner, portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Health Sciences Fund. “There are plenty of buyers outside of Pfizer who are interested in biotech assets.” Moreover, Pfizer’s ability to arrange $22.5 billion in debt financing from five banks for the Wyeth acquisition raises the chances that Roche will be able to raise the money it needs to acquire the 44 percent of Genentech that it does not already own. Roche, a Swiss pharmaceutical giant, first proposed to pay $43.7 billion for those shares in July, an offer Genentech rebuffed as too low. Analysts expect Roche to raise its bid, but its difficulty in arranging financing has slowed negotiations. Big pharmaceutical companies are not the only ones who can buy companies or drugs. In some cases, mid-size biotech companies like Cephalon and Myriad Genetics are outracing larger companies to snap up some drugs. That is why Mr. Nodelman, at the Biotechnology Value Fund, said he did not expect the Pfizer-Wyeth deal to have much of a braking effect on acquisitions of small companies or their drugs. “All it means is there is one less company that might do a deal with them,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Amgen Inc Wyeth GlaxoSmithKline PLC Go to your Portfolio » At Amgen, sales for all of its important medicines topped Wall Street estimates, providing a welcome surprise for investors in a tough economic environment. Amgen raised its full-year earnings forecast as it reversed the decline in sales of its top-selling anemia drug that had been hit by safety concerns and reimbursement restrictions. Amgen reported a net profit of $1.16 billion, or $1.09 a share. In the same quarter last year, it reported a net profit of $201 million, or 18 cents a share, when it took revamping charges and was affected by steep declines in its anemia drug sales. Revenue at Amgen for the quarter rose 7 percent, to $3.9 billion, from $3.6 billion. Excluding one-time items, Amgen earned $1.23 a share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 15 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Wyeth announced a delay in its closely watched experimental Alzheimer’s disease drug, highlighting some of the troubles facing the industry. Wyeth raised only the low end of its full-year forecast by 2 cents, but investors sold off the stock as the company did not raise the forecast over all. Wyeth reported flat third-quarter profit as it was affected by generic competition for Protonix, its drug to fight acid reflux. Wyeth said it earned $1.14 billion, or 84 cents a share, compared with $1.15 billion, or 84 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue at Wyeth rose 4 percent, to $5.83 billion, from $5.62 billion. But revenue would have risen only 2 percent if not for the weak dollar. The falling value of the British pound helped third-quarter results at GlaxoSmithKline, softening the blow of competition from generic alternatives for several products and a further drop in sales of its diabetes pill, Avandia. Glaxo’s top-selling drug Advair, used to treat for asthma and chronic respiratory disease, showed growth in the third quarter while vaccine sales were stronger than expected. Net income for Glaxo fell to £1.03 billion ($1.69 billion), from £1.31 billion, a year earlier, the company said. Earnings before revamping charges rose 6 percent, to 25.2 pence a share (41.4 cents). Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had on average forecast earnings of 24.3 pence a share.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Even Footing Related Health Sector Puts Its Money on Democrats (October 29, 2007) Blog The Caucus The latest political news from around the nation. Join the discussion. Election Guide | More Politics News Lobbyists and executives in the industry say the swing reflects the fact that Democrats control both houses of Congress, are expected to increase their majorities and may win the White House, giving them a dominant voice on health policy. “There’s a new world order,” Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said when asked why Democrats were getting more of the industry’s money. The figures illustrate the maxim that money follows power, all the more so since public programs account for a growing share of spending on prescription drugs: 34 percent in 2006, up from 23 percent in 2000. So the companies’ fortunes depend more than ever on government decisions, and leading Democrats have offered proposals that would further expand the role of the public sector in financing and delivering health care. The industry has shown strong Republican leanings in the past. While Democrats in Congress have severely criticized drug makers and health insurance companies, Republicans have worked closely with them on many issues, fending off countless proposals for stricter regulation. But a new trend in campaign contributions emerges from data reported by Pfizer, Amgen, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other companies and their trade associations. In the 2008 election cycle, pharmaceutical companies  their employees and political action committees  have donated $20 million to federal candidates and the parties, with 49 percent going to Democrats and 51 percent to Republicans, according to the data, compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance. Not since 1990 has the split been so nearly even. By contrast, Democrats got just 31 percent of the industry’s donations in 2000 and 2006, 26 percent in 2002 and 34 percent in 2004. Contributions by the American Medical Association show a similar pattern. Democrats have received 52 percent of the $882,000 in contributions reported by its political action committee in the current election cycle. In prior elections, the doctors’ group favored Republicans, giving them 61 percent of its donations in 2002, 80 percent in 2004 and 70 percent in 2006. Fred P. DuVal, treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association, said: “Parity between the parties is now the operating principle for many corporate political action committees in the health care industry. That’s a sea change.” Mr. DuVal is a government relations consultant whose clients include Pfizer and Aetna. The leading campaign contributors in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007-8, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, have been Pfizer, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. All three heavily favored Republicans in the last four election cycles, but the proportion of money going to Democrats now approaches or exceeds 50 percent at each company. “People in the pharmaceutical industry have not suddenly changed their spots,” said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. “They understand who will be writing legislation in the next few years. They want to be at the table.” The trend is well illustrated by the shift at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker. The company’s employees and its political action committee made 85 percent of their contributions to Republicans in 2000. Republicans got 81 percent in 2002, 69 percent in 2004 and 67 percent in 2006. But Democrats have received 51 percent of the $1.2 million in contributions reported in the current election cycle. On its Web site, Pfizer now boasts that its political action committee supports equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, Republicans received 70 percent of the contributions in 2000, 61 percent in 2002, 63 percent in 2004 and 61 percent in 2006. But in the current campaign, Democrats have received 59 percent of the $964,000 in donations reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson employees and the company’s political action committee. One other factor that may have chilled enthusiasm for giving to Republicans is that the party’s presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, has not taken a typically Republican stance toward the industry. Mr. McCain has supported legislation to let the government negotiate directly with drug companies to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, a position that is anathema to the industry. He wants to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada and some other countries. He has defied makers of brand-name drugs by pushing legislation to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs. And he championed legislation to codify patients’ rights, a bill strenuously opposed by insurers and President Bush. In a recent television advertisement, the McCain campaign boasts that “he took on the drug industry.” At a Republican presidential debate in January, after Mr. McCain criticized drug companies, one of his rivals, Mitt Romney, told him, “Don’t turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys.” Mr. McCain shot back, “Well, they are.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on October 14, 2008, on page A18 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00EEDB133CF934A2575AC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">Good Results for Bone Drug Buoy Amgen<date>Published: September 17, 2008</date><text>Amgen's experimental bone drug reduced the risk of spinal fractures in women with osteoporosis by 68 percent in a pivotal clinical trial, a robust result that raises hopes that the drug can help restore the luster of the embattled biotechnology company. The drug, called denosumab, also reduced the risk of hip fractures by 40 percent compared with a placebo and the risk of all fractures outside the spine by 20 percent. The results were presented Tuesday morning at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in Montreal. ''Expectations were very high, but we believe the data have lived up to those expectations,'' Michael Aberman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning. Amgen badly needs denosumab, the first potentially major drug from its research lab in years, to flourish. Sales of its flagship anemia drugs have been battered by safety concerns. Amgen's stock, which was trading at $75 in early 2007, had fallen below $40 by this March. But the stock has since rebounded on the prospects for denosumab. Shares of Amgen closed Tuesday up $3.70, or 6 percent, to $65.89. Amgen announced in late July that denosumab had succeeded in the clinical trial, which involved 7,800 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, a disease marked by fragile bones. But the company did not say at that time how much the drug had reduced the risk of fractures, which could help determine whether denosumab will be a blockbuster or just another competitor in a crowded global market for bone-density drugs that is valued at about $8 billion. In the trial, 2.3 percent of the women getting denosumab experienced a vertebral fracture over three years, compared with 7.2 percent of those getting a placebo. That relative risk reduction -- 68 percent fewer fractures -- compares favorably with the 40 to 50 percent reductions achieved against placebos in clinical trials involving the drugs now used to treat osteoporosis. However, one drug, Reclast from Novartis, has achieved a 70 percent reduction in spinal fractures compared with a placebo. The hip fracture risk reduction of 40 percent achieved by Amgen's denosumab was in line with or better than that achieved by some other drugs. Scientists caution that the only way to truly compare drugs is head-to-head in a clinical trial. Comparing across trials can be misleading because patients' characteristics can differ. Nevertheless, with little other data to go on, such comparisons were being made by Wall Street analysts and investors. One possible concern was that there were more serious infections among women treated with denosumab -- 4.3 percent of the patients, compared with 3.4 percent of those getting the placebo. This difference was not statistically significant. But some earlier trials had also shown an increased infection risk, so the issue could concern regulators. Otherwise, the rate of side effects from denosumab was roughly the same as from the placebo. Fewer patients on denosumab died, though that difference was not statistically significant. Analysts expect Amgen to apply by early next year for federal approval,, and denosumab could reach the market late next year. Analysts have estimated sales of $1 billion to several billion dollars just to treat osteoporosis. Amgen, which had revenue last year of $14.8 billion, is also testing denosumab as a treatment for bone complications from cancer. The main drugs for osteoporosis are a class known as bisphosphonates, which include Fosamax from Merck and its generic equivalents; Boniva from Roche and GlaxoSmithKline; Actonel from Procter &amp; Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis; and Reclast from Novartis. Ultimately, denosumab's sales could depend on factors other than how well it reduces fractures. Insurers, for instance, will probably insist that patients first try alendronate, the inexpensive generic version of Fosamax, before they will pay for the use of denosumab, which is likely to cost more than $1,000 a year. Geoffrey Meacham, an analyst at JPMorgan, said that because denosumab would not be the first-choice treatment, it ''isn't likely to provide material upside to Amgen's growth as many expected.'' But alendronate and most of the other bisphosphonates are pills that are very difficult to take because they can irritate the esophagus. As a result, half of patients discontinue their use within a year of starting, doctors say. Denosumab, by contrast, is given once every six months by an injection. In separate results announced at the Montreal meeting, Amgen said that about three-quarters of the patients in one of its clinical trials said that they preferred an injection of denosumab every six months to a bisphosphonate pill taken weekly. ''The whole idea is to convince people to take their medicine, and this might be an easier sell,'' Dr. Ethel S. Siris, an osteoporosis specialist at Columbia University, said at a meeting with securities analysts conducted by Amgen. For those discontinuing pills or opting not to take them, denosumab would compete most directly with Novartis's Reclast. The two drugs performed nearly identically in reducing fracture risk in the spine and hip. Reclast is given once a year, but it requires an intravenous infusion, which is more complex than an injection and which many doctors are not equipped to offer. ''Denosumab clearly becomes the second choice for us,'' after a pill, said Dr. Susan Bukata, associate professor of orthopedics at the University of Rochester. ''Right now the second choice is Reclast.'' About 10 million people in the United States, mainly postmenopausal women, suffer from osteoporosis and more than 30 million others have low bone mass that puts them at risk of the disease. Denosumab inhibits RANK ligand, a protein that spurs the development of cells that break down bone. Amgen scientists played a major role in discovering the role of RANK ligand after experimenting with genes and producing a mouse with unusually thick bones.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E0D61430F930A1575BC0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">Drug to Help Blood Clot Is Approved<date>Published: August 23, 2008</date><text>On Friday, federal regulators approved a biotechnology drug from Amgen that treats a rare blood-clotting disorder. The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Nplate, for patients with a disorder that causes the body to attack its own platelets, tiny components of blood that help with clotting. The condition, which can cause bruising and bleeding after minor injuries, affects about 140,000 people. Regulators said Nplate is the first drug that directly encourages platelet production by stimulating the patient's bone marrow. The F.D.A. approved the drug based on two studies that showed that it increased patients' platelet count over six months. Patients received weekly injections of Nplate, a genetically engineered version of the protein that encourages platelet production. ''The Nplate approval is the result of 15 years of research into understanding how platelets are produced in the bone marrow,'' Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said. Regulators said they would require all patients who receive the drug to enroll in a long-term safety study because of some risks associated with it. During its review of the drug, the F.D.A. questioned its potential to cause bone-marrow abnormalities and dangerous blood clots. In addition, four patients in studies of the drug developed leukemia. The F.D.A. said in its announcement that more studies ''will be needed to determine whether the development of leukemia may relate to the use of Nplate.''</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E0DB1E3FF932A05754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">Amgen Told To Reword Drug Label<date>Published: July 31, 2008</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Amgen to change the labels for its flagship anemia drugs in a way that could further restrict their use in treating patients with cancer. The move, which the F.D.A. announced on Wednesday, represents the first time the agency has invoked authority under a 2007 law that empowered it to order changes in a drug's prescribing information. Previously, the F.D.A. could only negotiate with a drug's manufacturer to change the label. Sales of the drugs, Aranesp and Procrit, have already plummeted in the last year because of studies suggesting that their use to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy could actually make cancer worse or shorten lives. Procrit is manufactured by Amgen but sold under license by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Sales of Aranesp, generally considered Amgen's flagship product, fell 13 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $825 million, the company announced Monday in posting its quarterly results. In the United States alone, sales plunged 26 percent, to $427 million. Yaron Werber, a biotechnology analyst at Citi Investment Research, estimated that the new label could reduce the use of Aranesp for cancer patients in this country -- the drug is also used by people with kidney disease -- by an additional 40 percent, further cutting annual sales by about $264 million. Despite the concerns about the drug, sales of Aranesp and Amgen's overall financial results were better than Wall Street expected in the second quarter. That, plus the positive result of a clinical trial for a new bone drug, lifted Amgen shares this week. Shares of Amgen rose 2 cents, to $62.30 Wednesday, near their 52-week high. Amgen said in a statement Wednesday that the new label was consistent with its expectations and that it had already factored the impact of the label change into updated financial guidance it provided to investors on Monday. Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would cooperate with the F.D.A. in using the new label. Its sales of Procrit and a similar drug, Eprex, dropped 14 percent worldwide in the second quarter, to $652 million, and fell 23 percent in the United States to $346 million. Because the company is larger and more diversified than Amgen, the sales of any one drug tend not to have as large an impact on its financial performance. The new labels will say that treatment with the drugs should not begin until a patient's hemoglobin drops to 10 grams per deciliter of blood. And language is being removed that seemed to imply that it was safe to continue treating patients until their hemoglobin rose to 12 grams per deciliter. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of blood and is at low levels in people with anemia, causing problems like fatigue. There are no accepted theories yet on why high doses of the anemia drugs seem to make cancer worse. The new labels also say the drugs should not be used if the chemotherapy is being given to cure patients, rather than to extend their lives. While that would be left to a doctor to judge, it would very likely apply, for instance, to so-called adjuvant therapy, in which chemotherapy is used after a tumor is removed by surgery in hopes of preventing cancer from coming back. When cancer is advanced, chemotherapy is often not considered curative. However, the new labels will not advise against use of the drugs for all patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. in March had called for such an advisory, because the drugs' risks seemed to be stronger for those two types of cancer. One effect of the label changes could be to make it less likely that Medicare would loosen reimbursement policies for the drugs. Amgen and many oncologists have been trying to get Medicare to amend a policy in which it will not pay for use of the drugs if hemoglobin is above 10. In their arguments, the company and doctors pointed to the drugs' labels, which seemed to suggest that the F.D.A. thought that a hemoglobin level of up to 12 was safe. But now the F.D.A. has also adopted the 10 gram level for initiating cancer therapy, and mention of 12 grams has been removed from the label. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the F.D.A.'s oncology drug office, said that the mention of the level of 12 was confusing people, making them think hemoglobins up to 12 were safe when, in fact, the safety is unknown. ''We felt people interpreted this as an upper safety limit,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. He said a hemoglobin level of 8 to 9, just high enough to avoid blood transfusions, was appropriate, though the new labels do not state a specific figure. The labels for the drugs have already been changed a few times since new safety concerns arose early last year. The F.D.A. and Amgen have been negotiating the latest changes since the advisory committee in March recommended further restrictions on use of the drugs. While the company and the agency agreed on most language, there were some points on which they could not reach agreement, Dr. Pazdur said. That prompted the F.D.A. to invoke its new authority to order the changes, he said. Amgen had wanted the label to give doctors discretion to initiate therapy before hemoglobin levels dropped to 10 in patients who could not tolerate that degree of anemia. And it wanted mention of the 12 gram upper limit for stopping therapy.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02EFDC1F3DF93AA15754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">Amgen Raises Forecast on Improved Sales and Successful Trial<date>Published: July 29, 2008</date><text>Amgen reported a far better than expected quarterly profit on Monday as sales of its anemia drug Aranesp rebounded from the preceding quarter, and the company raised its 2008 forecast. Shares of Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company by sales, rose more than 2 percent in extended trade on top of a 12 percent gain for the day, which was driven by positive news about the company's most important experimental medicine, the osteoporosis drug denosumab. The recent steep decline in sales of Aranesp, which has been dogged by safety concerns and reimbursement restrictions for the last year and a half, slowed, and sales far exceeded expectations for the quarter. Second-quarter net profit fell to $941 million, or 87 cents a share, from $1.02 billion, or 90 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding items, Amgen earned $1.14 a share, exceeding analysts' average expectation by 11 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Amgen raised its full-year forecast to earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 a share from its earlier estimate of $4 to $4.30 a share. Analysts had been forecasting $4.19 for the year. The company, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., now expects 2008 revenue of $14.6 billion to $14.9 billion, up from $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. The bullish results and forecast followed a report on Friday that denosumab met primary and all secondary goals in a pivotal fracture study. Treatment with the drug resulted in a statistically significant reduction in new vertebral fractures compared with placebo. Amgen shares rose to $62.12 in extended trading after closing at $60.48 on the Nasdaq.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/business/26amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Drug Test a Success for Amgen<date>Published: July 26, 2008</date><text>Amgen’s experimental bone drug, widely considered to be crucial to the company’s future, has succeeded in its most important clinical trial, sending the company’s shares up sharply. Skip to next paragraph Related Health Guide: Osteoporosis Add to Portfolio Amgen Inc Go to your Portfolio » Amgen said the drug reduced the risk of both spine and hip fractures by statistically significant amounts compared with a placebo in a three-year study of 7,800 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, a disease marked by fragile bones. The positive result will allow the company to apply for regulatory approval of the drug, called denosumab. Amgen announced the results after the close of trading Friday. In after-hours trading, the stock soared above $61 from a close in regular trading of $53.92. Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, has been battered in the last year and a half by falling sales of its anemia drugs after some studies linked the drugs to worsening of cancer, death and cardiovascular problems. That has meant that even more is riding on denosumab, which analysts have said could have sales of up to several billion dollars a year. “From a Wall Street perspective, people looking at Amgen say, ‘This is it,’ ” Mark Schoenebaum, biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said of denosumab. Still, Amgen’s news release did not provide data on how big a reduction in fractures the drug achieved, making it difficult to determine how denosumab would compete with other drugs, including inexpensive generic versions of Merck’s Fosamax that are already available. “It looks to me like it’s definitely a drug,” Mr. Schoenebaum said. “Now the debate will be how big a drug it will be.” Roger M. Perlmutter, Amgen’s executive vice president for research and development, said the data would not be presented until the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research meeting in September. But he said the results of the trial “exceeded my expectations.” Denosumab had already been shown in smaller studies to build bone mineral density. But there was a question of whether that would translate into a strong reduction in the risk of fractures, which the Food and Drug Administration regards as the most relevant measure of an osteoporosis drug. While most analysts and doctors expected a reduction in spinal fractures, the main goal of the trial, there was some surprise that denosumab also reduced hip fractures, which are costly and potentially lethal medical problems. Hip fractures are rarer than spine fractures, making it more difficult to show a statistically significant effect. Denosumab also reduced the incidence of fractures elsewhere in the body, like the arms and legs. The trial results might also assuage safety concerns. Some earlier studies suggested that patients getting denosumab had a higher rate of serious infections and cancer. But Amgen said Friday that in the new trial the incidence of serious side effects was similar among those getting denosumab and those getting the placebo. However, no numbers were provided. Dr. E. Michael Lewiecki, an investigator in the clinical trial who has not seen the data, said the results sounded “about the best that anybody could expect.” Dr. Lewiecki, osteoporosis director of the New Mexico Clinical Research and Osteoporosis Center and an adviser to Amgen, added, “That’s terrific news for everyone with osteoporosis.” About 44 million Americans over the age of 50 have osteoporosis, or low bone mass, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. The main drugs used now, called bisphosphonates, include Fosamax, Boniva from Roche and GlaxoSmithKline, and Actonel from Procter &amp; Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis. These drugs are difficult for some people to take because they can irritate the esophagus. People are supposed to take them first thing in the morning with a glass of water, then remain upright without eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes. The drugs also accumulate in the bone, and recently some concerns have arisen about rare side effects from long-term use of the drugs, like a rotting of jaw bones. Denosumab works by a different mechanism and is given by injection once every six months, while the bisphosphonate pills are taken daily, weekly or monthly. Novartis sells a bisphosphonate called Reclast that is given only once a year. But it requires an intravenous infusion, which is more complex than denosumab’s injection. One of the big questions facing Amgen, which now mainly sells high-priced drugs to specialists, is whether to sell denosumab by itself or license it to a big pharmaceutical company with a sales force that calls on general practitioners. Amgen is also testing denosumab as a treatment for bone problems of cancer patients. That fits more directly with its current business. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the action of RANK ligand, a protein that plays a fundamental role in how bones are continuously broken down and rebuilt. While many drugs are based on academic discoveries, Amgen itself discovered the role of RANK ligand in the 1990s. The Amgen scientists were studying the effects of different genes in mice and found some animals with particularly dense bones, setting off a search for the mechanism involved. “This was probably one of the greatest discoveries in bone physiology,” said Dr. J. Christopher Gallagher, professor and director of the bone metabolism section at Creighton University. As such, success of denosumab could help bolster Amgen’s reputation for innovation, which has lagged behind that of its rival Genentech. Amgen has vastly increased its research work in recent years.

Reviews Arthritis Drugs for Links to Cancer<date>Published: June 5, 2008</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it was investigating whether four drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system diseases might increase the risk of cancer in children. The F.D.A. said that it had received reports of 30 cases of cancer over 10 years among children and young adults treated with those drugs, which are sold by Amgen, Abbott Laboratories and other companies. But the agency did not make clear how many children had taken the drugs or whether the cancer incidence among them was higher than would be expected. And it said that for now, it believed that the potential benefits of the medicines outweighed the potential risks ''in certain children and young adults.'' The drugs involved are Enbrel, sold by Amgen and Wyeth; Remicade, sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson and, in Europe, by Schering-Plough; Humira, sold by Abbott Laboratories; and Cimzia, which won approval in April and is sold by UBC, a Belgian company. All the drugs try to damp inflammation by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor, and they are used to treat various immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, which is an inflammation of the bowel. The TNF-blockers, as they are known, represent one of the most successful classes of drugs ever developed using biotechnology. Remicade, Humira and Enbrel had combined sales of more than $13 billion last year. But use in children constitutes a small part of the total. Dr. Michael Severino, an Amgen executive, said about a half-million patients had been treated with Enbrel since its approval about a decade ago, of which only 12,000 were children. Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's disease in children. Enbrel and Humira are approved to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis, once known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In fact the label on Enbrel was changed in March to allow use in children as young as 2, from a previous suggested lower age of 4. Amgen is now seeking approval of Enbrel to treat psoriasis in children, an issue that will be discussed by an advisory panel to the F.D.A. on June 18. Since the drugs block part of the immune system, it has always been known that they might contribute to higher risk of cancers and also infections. The labels for the drugs all contain warnings to that effect -- particularly about the risk of lymphomas, which are cancers of immune system cells. About half the cancers reported in the children getting the drugs were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the F.D.A. said. A study that pooled data from randomized clinical trials, found that adults given Humira or Remicade to treat rheumatoid arthritis had 2.4 times the cancer rate of those in the control groups. ''It's clearly something we have to be concerned about and discuss with our patients,'' said Dr. Eric L. Matteson, chairman of rheumatology at the Mayo Clinic and an author of the study, which was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Matteson has been a consultant to many of the companies developing such drugs. Dr. Edward H. Giannini, professor of pediatric rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said that 70,000 to 100,000 children in the United States had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and that the biotech drugs were ''unequaled'' in their ability to control the disease. ''This was a disease that put kids in wheelchairs,'' he said. Dr. Giannini, who received consulting fees from the companies for helping to devise their pediatric clinical trials, said that no cases of cancer were seen in the clinical trials that led to Enbrel's approval for pediatric use. And a subsequent registry that followed 600 children found no cases after more than 800 patient-years of exposure. Still, he said, ''We have to be careful with the safety aspects of giving immune response modifiers to very young children,'' whose immune systems might not be mature yet. Michael Parks, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company had already submitted data to the F.D.A. Most of the cancer cases associated with Remicade use were in children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. And all but one of those children also received other immune-suppressing drugs with a known cancer risk, he said. Laureen Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said there had been no instances of cancer in children given Humira in clinical trials or in postapproval safety studies. Humira was approved for pediatric use a few months ago. The F.D.A. announcement had little impact on the stocks of the companies involved.

AstraZeneca, based in London, said its net income fell 3.7 percent, to $1.5 billion. Bristol-Myers’s earnings dropped 4.2 percent as costs offset soaring sales of its blood thinner Plavix. Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, said profit fell 73 percent, to 762 million euros ($1.21 billion), after asset sales. AstraZeneca said sales of the ulcer treatment Nexium fell in the United States and Western Europe, while Bristol-Myers won market share with the Plavix blood thinner after beating back generic competition. Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Thursday that its first-quarter profit climbed 2 percent as demand for the arthritis treatment Enbrel offset a decline in anemia drug sales. Net income rose to $1.14 billion, or $1.04 a share, from $1.11 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales slipped to $3.61 billion from $3.69 billion. Worldwide sales of Aranesp, the anemia drug that was Amgen’s biggest product in 2007, led the decline. The product’s revenue fell to $761 million, a 25 percent decline from $1.02 billion a year earlier. Sales of another anemia drug, Epogen, fell 11 percent to $554 million, from $625 million a year earlier, because of declining use and lower doses. ImClone Systems, a biotechnology company based in New York, reported its third straight quarterly loss, of $55.9 million, or 65 cents a share. An Irish competitor, the Elan Corporation, said its first-quarter loss narrowed to $85.5 million, or 18 cents a share, as sales of the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri tripled. AstraZeneca reported $1.03 in earnings per share. The drug maker said its profit fell from $1.56 billion. Sales increased 10 percent, to $7.68 billion. Bristol-Myers said it would sell as much as 20 percent of its infant-formula unit, Mead Johnson Nutritionals. First-quarter net income fell to $661 million, or 33 cents a share, from $690 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. The results included $113 million in charges as the company cut jobs, shut plants and shed products to deliver $1.5 billion in annual savings before 2012. Sales climbed to $5.18 billion from $4.32 billion as the company recovered from temporary competition to Plavix from a generic drug maker last year. Plavix sales climbed 39 percent. Bayer’s first-quarter profit was 0.96 euro a share, compared with 2.81 billion euros, or 3.44 euros a share, a year earlier when Bayer had a one-time gain of almost 2.2 billion euros. Sales rose 2.4 percent, to 8.54 billion euros, Bayer said.

The recommendation by a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration could lead to an additional decline in sales for the drugs: Aranesp, made by Amgen, and Procrit by Johnson &amp; Johnson. But the two companies avoided the outcome they most feared: a recommendation that the drugs not be used by any cancer patients. That probably would have meant the loss of at least $1 billion in sales for each company. “They dodged the really big bullet, but they still took some damage,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Yaron Werber, an analyst with Citigroup, estimated that Amgen would lose about $125 million in Aranesp sales if the recommendations were enacted. That would be about 25 percent of Mr. Werber’s already reduced projections for 2008 sales to cancer patients in the United States. The meeting was held because eight clinical trials suggested that the drugs might make cancer worse for some patients or even shorten their lives. Cancer patients take Aranesp or Procrit to counter the anemia caused by chemotherapy. The difficulty for the committee was that those eight studies involved high doses of the drugs. There was very little solid information on whether the drugs were dangerous at doses typically used by cancer doctors. Faced with that information, the panel voted 13 to 1 in favor of recommending that the drugs remain available for use by many cancer patients. But the committee then voted 9 to 5 in favor of recommending that the drugs not be used by patients with either breast cancer or head and neck cancer because the evidence of a risk was strongest for those types of tumors. The committee also voted 11 to 2, with 1 abstention, to recommend that the drug not be used by patients being treated with the intent of curing their cancers. The definition of that category is vague, but it generally refers to patients with early-stage cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy after surgical removal of a tumor, in which the doctors hope the cancer has been eliminated. F.D.A. officials said after the meeting that most use of the anemia drugs was for patients with more advanced cancers. The panel members also recommended that patients be made to sign consents in order to obtain the drugs. But the panel voted against carefully controlling distribution of the drugs. The F.D.A. itself is expected to revise the labels of the drugs in consultation with the manufacturers. The agency does not have to adhere to the recommendations of its advisory committees, although it usually does. In a statement, Amgen said it was “committed to working with the F.D.A. to consider the input from the committee and to implement future label changes.” Amgen’s shares rose nearly 5 percent, closing at $47.18. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is not as reliant on the drugs, closed up 26 cents, to $62.81. Sales of the anemia drugs have already been plummeting because of safety concerns and payment restrictions by Medicare and other insurers. Sales of Aranesp fell 12 percent, to $3.6 billion, in 2007, down from $4.1 billion the year before. The sales slump has forced Amgen to cut its work force. Amgen has said that $1.55 billion of its Aranesp sales last year were for cancer use in the United States and an additional $550 million for cancer use in other countries. Most of the rest involved treating anemia stemming from kidney disease. The use of the drugs on kidney patients was not the subject of the meeting on Thursday. Amgen’s other anemia drug, Epogen, is primarily used for kidney dialysis patients. Johnson &amp; Johnson had sales of $2.9 billion last year for Procrit and Eprex, a similar drug sold outside the United States. Both are sold under license from Amgen. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which made a joint presentation to the committee, argued that it was not clear the drugs were dangerous. They said that the drugs should remain available because they help chemotherapy patients avoid blood transfusions, which carry their own risks of infections and side effects. The risk of contracting AIDS or hepatitis from a transfusion has declined significantly in recent years, they said, but other unknown pathogens might arise. “The known risks of blood transfusions are less today than yesterday,” Dr. William N. Hait, a Johnson &amp; Johnson executive, told the panel. “We do not know if that will be true tomorrow.” The companies proposed some changes in the drugs’ labeling that would reduce their use somewhat, but less than if the drugs were barred completely for certain cancers. But Dr. Vinni Juneja, an F.D.A. official, said in his presentation that the drugs did not totally eliminate the need for transfusions but only reduced them by about 50 percent. Some patients or patient advocates testified in support of the drugs, while others said they were more concerned about the risks or that the matter was too confusing to know what position to take. The meeting on Thursday was the third advisory panel meeting the F.D.A. has held on the risks of these drugs’ use for cancer patients. The earlier ones were in 2004 and last May. “There is a perceived lack of progress,” said Carlea Bauman, president of the Colorectal Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. The drugs, she said, “have been on the market for many years, billions of dollars have been spent by insurers, millions of patients have been treated, and yet we still have many of the same unanswered questions,” as at the 2004 meeting. Several committee members and patient advocates called on the drug companies to end sales programs that might give doctors a financial incentive to overuse the drugs. Doctors typically buy the drugs, administer them to patients, and are reimbursed by insurers and patients. The doctors can profit if the reimbursement is greater than what they paid, and companies can sweeten that margin by giving the doctors discounts and rebates. “The current system has led to distrust,” Robert L. Erwin, president of the Marti Nelson Cancer Foundation, told the committee. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson said the payment system, common for oncology drugs, did not lead to overuse.

But in 1990 Dr. Anagnostou published some of the first evidence suggesting that Amgen's then brand-new anemia drug, Epogen, might fuel the growth of tumors. Few people paid heed. ''Many people believed the work I did was not reproducible,'' recalled Dr. Anagnostou, who was then a blood disease specialist at Brown University. Unable to obtain a federal grant to conduct further studies, he said he eventually moved on to other things. Now, people are paying more attention. Eight clinical trials have suggested that Epogen and related anemia drugs, widely used to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy, might make tumors worse or hasten the death of cancer patients. On Thursday an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration will consider placing further restrictions on use of the medicines -- Amgen's drugs Epogen and Aranesp, and the Johnson &amp; Johnson drug Procrit. Among the choices to be discussed, according to a briefing document the agency posted on its Web site on Tuesday, would be to eliminate use of the drugs for patients with certain types of tumors or for patients who still have hope of curing their cancers, or even to stop using the drugs among all cancer patients. But one of the big unanswered question is this: If the anemia drugs really are ''Miracle-Gro for cancer,'' as one F.D.A. adviser famously put it in a similar meeting last year, then what is the mechanism behind that? What do the drugs do to tumors? All the drugs are synthetic forms of a human hormone called erythropoietin, or Epo, that spurs production of red blood cells. Dr. Anagnostou's work hints at one possible explanation. His experiments suggested that Epo could spur growth of blood vessels that can nourish tumors. Another possible explanation is that Epo stimulates tumors directly to grow. Or, that Epo protects tumors from the destruction intended by chemotherapy. Evidence that could support these hypotheses has been building slowly, but it is far from ironclad. The studies have shortcomings and there are contradictory data. Animal studies, for instance, have generally not shown Epo making cancer worse. ''The sense is there's some smoke, but we don't know if there's any fire,'' said David A. Gewirtz, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University. In his study, Dr. Gewirtz found that Epo did not stimulate growth of breast cancer cells in a dish. When the National Cancer Institute held a workshop in December on whether Epo spurred tumor growth, there was little consensus, other than agreement that more study was needed. Amgen's representative at the workshop, Dr. C. Glenn Begley, sharply questioned any finding of a tumor-stimulating effect, according to a summary by the cancer institute. Amgen says there is no convincing evidence that Epo does anything in the body besides spur red blood cell production. The company thinks the excess deaths in the trials among Epo users might stem from blood clots. The clinical trials in question all used the anemia drugs to raise patients' red blood cell levels more than what is recommended in the drugs' labels. At those levels, blood clots are a known side effect. ''There's really no necessity to advance another explanation,'' Dr. Roy Baynes, an Amgen vice president, said in an interview. If the culprit is blood clots, the implication is the drugs would be safe if used at more modest levels, as called for on the labels. But if, as some scientists argue, Epo does spur tumor growth directly, then even modest doses of the drugs might be considered risky for cancer patients. Various scientists have reported that some types of tumor cells have receptors that can detect Epo and react to it. And they have reported that Epo spurs the growth of tumor cells in laboratory dishes. There are even reports that some tumors make their own Epo, in effect stimulating their own growth or protecting themselves from death. Amgen says that the techniques used to detect the receptors actually pick up other things, giving false readings. But Dr. Murat O. Arcasoy, associate professor of medicine at Duke, said, ''most people accept that there are receptors. The question is, 'How do they signal, how do they contribute to growth?' '' Another question is why it has taken so long to find such possible deleterious effects. Epogen was first approved for kidney dialysis patients in 1989 and Procrit for anemia caused by chemotherapy in 1993. When Procrit was approved, the F.D.A. realized there was a ''hypothetical risk'' that Epo could spur tumor growth, the agency said in its briefing document on Tuesday. But the agency still does not think the link has been established definitely, it said. Dr. Arthur J. Sytkowski, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard who has studied Epo for 30 years, said scientists assumed Epo did nothing except spur red blood cell formation. ''Nobody's to blame for this,'' he said. Dr. Anagnostou's 1990 study was one of the first to suggest a different role for Epo. He was trying to figure out why Epogen caused high blood pressure in some patients. So he put endothelial cells, the type that line blood vessels, into a lab dish and exposed them to Epo. To his surprise the cells were stimulated to proliferate. He commented in his paper that this could possibly spur the formation of blood vessels that would nourish tumors. Dr. Anagnostou patented the use of Epo to treat blood vessel injuries and profited when it was licensed to Johnson &amp; Johnson. Still, Dr. Anagnostou, now semi-retired, says safety issues were missed. ''We had been assured it was totally safe because it only affects red blood cells,'' he said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/27anemia.html?ref=amgeninc">Study Finds Death Risk From Anemia Drugs<date>Published: February 27, 2008</date><text>Widely used anemia drugs sold by Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson raise the risk of death among cancer patients by about 10 percent, according to a new analysis of previous clinical trials that is to be published Wednesday. Skip to next paragraph Related Health Guide: Anemia » The study is the first compilation of clinical trial data  called a meta-analysis  to show a statistically significant increase in the risk of death from the drugs, said Dr. Charles L. Bennett, a professor at Northwestern University and its lead author. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to convene an advisory committee on March 13 to discuss whether to impose further restrictions on the use of the drugs, Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson, with cancer patients. The Amgen drug Epogen, which is the same as Procrit but is aimed at kidney dialysis patients, will not be directly affected by the discussions. Amgen said the study, being published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, provided little new information. “What he observes is the risks that we’ve already talked about that are in the label,” said Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s executive vice president for research and development. The F.D.A. ordered stronger warnings on the drugs’ labels last year, after a flurry of studies suggested that the products, if used too aggressively, could worsen cancer conditions or hasten death. And Medicare sharply restricted reimbursement for the drugs when used to treat anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy. Sales of Aranesp, Amgen’s best-selling product, declined to $3.6 billion last year from $4.1 billion in 2006. One option that analysts expect to be discussed at the meeting in March would be to bar the use of the drugs for specific types of cancer, like breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Another would be to delay treatment with the drugs until patients became more anemic than the current threshold, a change that would more closely match the Medicare reimbursement policy. A third option, which many analysts say is unlikely, would be for the F.D.A. to no longer authorize the drugs’ use in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs would still be allowed to treat anemia caused by kidney disease. Jim Birchenough, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, estimated in a report on Monday that rescinding approval for chemotherapy-induced anemia would reduce Amgen’s sales of Aranesp by $1 billion a year. A change in the label to match the Medicare policy would cut them by $300 million. The new analysis on death risk, which could play into the discussions on March 13, combines data from 51 clinical trials involving 13,611 patients. The study also found a 57 percent increase in the risk of blood clots in veins, a known side effect of the drugs. Dr. Bennett, an oncologist and hematologist, said he did not think that the higher risk of death came from those blood clots. Rather, he said, there is evidence that the drugs, which are synthetic forms of a natural hormone called erythropoietin, directly stimulate the growth and spread of tumors. Amgen scientists dispute that explanation. Procrit, which Johnson &amp; Johnson sells under license from Amgen, was approved for treatment of cancer patients in 1993, and Aranesp in 2002, based on their ability to reduce the need for blood transfusions. But the studies on which the approvals were based were not large and long enough to measure the effect on patients’ longevity. As a result, efforts have been made to pool the results of many smaller trials to look for safety problems. A meta-analysis published in 2004 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research group, found that patients who were given the drugs tended to live longer. But in recent years, some new clinical trials, aimed at showing that using the drugs at higher doses than indicated on the label would improve survival, found the opposite. As those studies were added to the compilations, the safety balance appeared to shift. A meta-analysis published in 2006 by the Cochrane Collaboration found an 8 percent higher risk of death among users of the drugs, but the result just missed being statistically significant. The analysis being published Wednesday adds some more recent studies and reaches statistical significance. That still leaves unclear whether the drugs are dangerous if used at the levels indicated on the label, a question that bedeviled an F.D.A. advisory committee last year and is likely to do so again in March. “We didn’t ask the right questions for 15 years,” Dr. Bennett said.

Kevin W. Sharer, the chief executive, said the deal, which was announced early Monday and could bring the company as much as $1.2 billion, was forged because Amgen had too many experimental compounds to develop on its own. “We just can’t, either operationally or financially, develop all these molecules in the three principal geographies,” he said, referring to the United States, Europe and Japan. He said financial pressures contributed to the timing of the deal. But “this was an inevitable development” because of the high costs of research and development, he said. The pact calls for Amgen to sell Japanese rights to up to 13 of its experimental drugs to the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Japan’s largest drug company. Takeda will pay Amgen $200 million upfront. It will also chip in up to $340 million to help develop the drugs worldwide over the next several years, helping to defray Amgen’s costs of testing the drugs for use in the United States and Europe. It will also pay up to $362 million more if certain milestones are achieved in development, plus royalties on sales of the drugs in Japan. Takeda is also buying Amgen’s Japanese subsidiary, Amgen KK. For Takeda, known most for its diabetes drug Actos, the deal moves it further into biologics  protein-based drugs made in living organisms. The company, based in Osaka, Japan, has concentrated mainly on pills made from chemicals. Mr. Sharer said the deal validated the value of Amgen’s pipeline. But some analysts said that pulling back from its Japanese operations could eventually diminish the company’s prospects. “They are basically capitulating on having any real stake in the Japanese market,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “It’s definitely a retrenchment, as well as all the retrenchments they’ve gone through.” Japan, with its unique regulatory requirements and marketing issues, has been a tough market for some drug companies to penetrate on their own. Amgen’s existing drugs are all sold in Japan by partners. Over all, the market reaction was subdued, with Amgen’s shares falling 18 cents Monday to close at $47.18. “The money that they are taking in from Takeda aren’t significant enough to move the dial, either on their revenues on in terms of their cost line,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst who follows Amgen for Cowen &amp; Company. There are many issues of more importance to Amgen investors, particularly a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration in March to discuss the safety of the company’s anemia drugs, which once accounted for nearly half of its corporate revenue. Sales of the drugs have been falling on those safety concerns, prompting the company to cut its work force by more than 12 percent last year. It was during their announcement of that revamping last summer that Amgen’s executives first said publicly that they would sell rights to some of the drugs under development. The drugs included in the deal are mainly in early or middle-stage clinical trials, except for Vectibix, a colon cancer drug that Amgen sells in the United States. In addition to the Japan-only rights to the 13 drugs, Takeda is buying a share of the worldwide rights to an Amgen cancer drug under development, motesanib diphosphate, also called AMG 706. It will pay $100 million upfront and up to $175 million more. Prospects for AMG 706 had seemed to dim, in part because many similar drugs were either on the market or under development by other companies. Takeda is not getting Japanese rights to what is widely considered Amgen’s best experimental product: the osteoporosis drug denosumab. Those rights were sold last summer to Takeda’s rival, Daiichi Sankyo.

The announcement provided a positive note as Amgen announced results for 2007, perhaps the toughest year in its history. Sales of its anemia drug Aranesp plunged 25 percent in the fourth quarter and 12 percent for the year because of safety concerns. The company projected that both its revenue and earnings would decline in 2008. Amgen desperately needs the osteoporosis drug, called denosumab, to become a big seller. And with Fosamax scheduled to face cheaper generic competition in two weeks, it was important for denosumab to prove superior. Amgen said its drug, which is injected twice a year, proved about 40 percent superior to weekly Fosamax pills in improving bone mineral density at the hip and was also better at some other locations. It said side effects of the two drugs appear to be similar. ''Simply put, we could not have hoped in this study for better results,'' Amgen's chief executive, Kevin W. Sharer, told analysts on a conference call. The company said full data would be presented at a medical meeting. Still, the important measure for an osteoporosis drug is whether it prevents fractures. This trial, involving 1,189 women followed for a year, was too small and short to determine that. Results comparing denosumab with a placebo in fracture prevention are expected later this year. In its financial results, Amgen said fourth-quarter revenue decreased 2 percent from the period a year earlier, to $3.7 billion, because of the decline in Aranesp sales. For the year, revenue was $14.8 billion, up 4 percent. Earnings, after adjustments, were $1 a share for the quarter, up 11 percent, and $4.29 for the year, up 10 percent. Earnings were helped by layoffs and other cost cutbacks, with the $739 million in restructuring charges not included in the adjusted earnings. Adjusted net income increased 3 percent, to $1.09 billion in the quarter from $1.06 billion in the period a year earlier. Aranesp sales have been severely hurt by concerns that the drug, often used to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy, could make cancer worse or shorten lives. Warnings were added to the drug's label and Medicare sharply restricted reimbursement. Sales of Aranesp fell 25 percent in the fourth quarter, to $827 million, with a 39 percent decrease in the United States alone. For the year, Aranesp sales fell 12 percent, to $3.61 billion. But Amgen executives said sales seemed to have stabilized. The Food and Drug Administration has scheduled another advisory committee meeting for March that could lead to further restrictions on Aranesp's use. Sales of Epogen, Amgen's older anemia drug, which is used only to treat kidney dialysis patients, held up better. Fourth quarter sales fell 3 percent, to $638 million. For the year, sales dipped 1 percent, to $2.49 billion. For 2008, Amgen said it expected revenue to drop slightly to $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion. It projected adjusted earnings at $4 to $4.30 a share, flat to down compared with the $4.29 in 2007. Shares of Amgen rose $1.37, to $46.12 Thursday, with its announcements coming after the close of regular trading. After hours the stock was up about 4 percent, to $47.90.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/18/business/18amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">New Jersey Investigating Amgen’s Marketing of a Psoriasis Drug<date>Published: January 18, 2008</date><text>New Jersey’s attorney general has begun investigating whether the biotechnology giant Amgen violated patient confidentiality laws in its effort to sell its drug Enbrel. The investigation was prompted by accusations from two former Amgen sales representatives, who said they had been pressured by their managers to gain access to patient data to find people with psoriasis who might be candidates for treatment with Enbrel. The attorney general, Anne Milgram, who has been looking into pharmaceutical marketing practices, said in a news release Thursday that the state had issued a subpoena to Amgen for “a comprehensive array of documents and information” related to the sale, marketing and prescribing of Enbrel. Ms. Milgram said she was also looking into whether Amgen had engaged in off-label marketing. Enbrel is approved for moderate or severe psoriasis, but the two former sales representatives say the company tried to sell it for mild psoriasis as well. The two former employees are now in arbitration with Amgen, saying they lost their jobs because they did not engage in what they considered illegal practices. One, Elena Ferrante, who was a sales representative in New Jersey, said she was fired in 2005. The other, Marc Engelman, whose territory was Southern California, said he quit last year after getting a poor performance review. A spokeswoman for Amgen, Mary Klem, said that the accusations were “completely without merit” and that Amgen would cooperate with the investigation. She said Amgen representatives were instructed to “follow compliance guidelines with absolute consistency.” Federal laws prohibit the sharing of medical information with unnecessary parties, though there are different interpretations of the rules. It is not clear whether there were violations in this case or, if there were, whether they were by Amgen or by the doctors The accusations come as Amgen is facing declining sales of its popular anemia drugs because of safety questions. Enbrel, first approved as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, is also a big-selling product. But its growth as a treatment for psoriasis has at times been slower than expected, in part because insurers balked at its cost, up to $20,000 a year. Mr. Engelman said in an interview recently that sales representatives were told to find doctors willing to search through patient records to find patients with psoriasis, or to let the Amgen representatives find candidates in the same way. The doctors would then be asked to write to the patients suggesting Enbrel, though Amgen employees might do the work and pay for the postage, he said. Mr. Engelman also said Amgen representatives would sometimes call or write to insurance companies, posing as a member of the doctor’s staff, to try to arrange reimbursement. “You knew these patients’ data when you were calling the insurance company,” he said. “You would know the patient’s name when you are stuffing the envelope.” Mr. Engelman provided a voice mail message that his manager had left for him, as well as a memo urging him to have searches of patient records done at two or more medical practices.

Mayo Clinic researchers reviewed records of 311 patients with primary myelofibrosis, a scarring of the bone marrow, from 1976 to 2006. The drugs -- Aranesp and Epogen from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson -- were linked to leukemia among 27 patients who developed the disease, according to research presented yesterday at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Atlanta. Past studies linked anemia drugs to heart attack, stroke and death when used in high doses. Warnings from regulators about the risks caused sales of Aranesp in the United States to drop 36 percent in the third quarter. Aranesp is Amgen's biggest product, with $4.12 billion in sales in 2006. The study also found a higher risk of leukemia among patients who took danazol, a modified form of testosterone. Risk was also higher for patients with a high count of immature leukemia cells and a low number of platelet cells in the blood. Patients who took other treatments, like thalidomide and interferon-alpha, had no higher risk, researchers said. Patients with primary myelofibrosis feel fatigued, and they sometimes take an anemia drug to stimulate growth of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. The findings needed to be confirmed in a trial to answer the question about anemia drug risk, Dr. Ayalew Tefferi, a Mayo Clinic hematologist and the study's lead investigator, said in a statement. ''While we cannot take these findings as an absolute, at the same time, they cannot be ignored,'' Dr. Tefferi said. ''Treatment decisions regarding the use of anemia drugs in patients with primary myelofibrosis should carefully be evaluated.''</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/08/business/08amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Shares Fall on Safety Concerns<date>Published: December 8, 2007</date><text>Shares of Amgen had their biggest decline in seven months on Nasdaq yesterday after the company reported it might revise the safety information on its biggest product, the anemia drug Aranesp. Amgen fell $3.05, or 5.5 percent, to $52.10 in regular trading, the most since May 10, when a Food and Drug Administration panel suggested new restrictions in prescribing information for the anemia drug. An F.D.A. advisory panel will meet before the end of March in a continuing review of the class of drugs that includes Aranesp, Amgen said late Thursday in a statement. A preliminary study showed that more breast cancer patients who took Aranesp, which counters weakness and fatigue from chemotherapy, died or had growing tumors than those not receiving the drug, Amgen said last week. “We anticipate another difficult meeting for Amgen, possibly resulting in the exclusion of breast cancer from the Aranesp label,” Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Company in Chicago, wrote in a note to clients yesterday. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., has lost about $19 billion in market value this year after studies showed its anemia drugs raised the risk of heart attack, stroke and death at high doses. Aranesp generated $4.12 billion last year. The breast cancer study is one of five that the company agreed to conduct to monitor safety as part of an agreement with the drug agency in 2004. “The results certainly don’t offer any support to Amgen’s defense of Aranesp’s use in this indication, but neither do they definitely establish that the use of the drug is detrimental in all cancer patients,” Geoff Porges at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company wrote in a note to clients.

The changes, made in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration, come after a year in which accumulating data have suggested that the drugs -- Amgen's Epogen and Aranesp, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Procrit -- can be dangerous if overused. The new warnings also state for the first time that the drugs' risks for cancer patients cannot be excluded even at doses previously considered safe and routinely used. The warnings could contribute to a decline in use of the drugs that is already well under way. But analysts said in general that the new labeling was not as restrictive as it could have been. James F. Reddoch, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, called the label changes ''not bad,'' and said in a note to clients that it was now less likely that insurance companies would further restrict reimbursement for the drugs. Amgen's shares fell 17 cents yesterday to $56.03, while Johnson &amp; Johnson's rose 68 cents to $64.59. The drugs are used by about one million Americans a year, mostly people with anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy or kidney failure. Combined sales worldwide were nearly $10 billion last year. The main factor expected to depress sales of the drugs in the coming year is a new reimbursement policy by Medicare. Amgen said yesterday that it would formally ask the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or C.M.S., to overturn that policy. Medicare's new policy applies to patients with anemia caused by chemotherapy. Medicare cuts off reimbursement for the drugs once a patient's hemoglobin -- the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen -- rises above 10 grams for each deciliter of blood. Amgen said the new labels on the drugs support its cause. For cancer patients, the label calls for using the lowest possible dose that allows a patient to avoid blood transfusions, with hemoglobin levels not to exceed 12 grams for each deciliter. ''The label gives physicians discretion between 10 and 12,'' Kevin W. Sharer, Amgen's chief executive, told securities analysts yesterday. ''That's the main point. And the C.M.S. decision does not.'' But F.D.A. officials said that the Medicare decision was consistent with the new label. ''This is not a target,'' Dr. Richard Pazdur, the director of the agency's cancer drug office, said about the hemoglobin level of 12. ''This is an upper boundary for safety concerns.'' Medicare has said that it cannot overturn its decision without new evidence. Amgen said it would present some new evidence, including information showing that more cancer patients are now needing blood transfusions. But some analysts were skeptical that the company would succeed in overturning Medicare's decision. The new labels came after the F.D.A. held two advisory committee meetings to consider the safety of the drugs. The agency had first slapped a so-called black box warning, the toughest kind, on the drugs in March as an interim measure. For patients with kidney failure, the label calls for hemoglobin levels to be maintained at between 10 and 12. That is perhaps a bit less restrictive than the label in March. But new wording in the label calls for doctors to exercise restraint or possibly discontinue use for patients who do not reach the desired hemoglobin levels after 12 weeks of treatment. Until now, dialysis centers have tended to give such patients astronomical doses in an effort to raise their hemoglobin levels. Joel Sendek said in a note to clients that the new label would reduce sales by ''eliminating the exorbitant doses given to those patients who have historically been a major source of revenue for Amgen'' and for dialysis centers.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/business/24amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Wins Patent Battle Over Roche’s Anemia Drug<date>Published: October 24, 2007</date><text>Amgen won a decisive victory yesterday in a closely watched patent infringement lawsuit against Roche. The outcome could help protect Amgen’s multibillion dollar anemia drug franchise in this country by blocking Roche’s plan to introduce a competing medicine. A jury in Federal District Court in Boston ruled that Roche’s new drug, Mircera, infringed on three Amgen patents and upheld the validity of those patents and two others. Amgen said it was pleased with the verdict and would seek an injunction to prevent Roche from releasing Mircera in the United States. The presiding judge, William G. Young, will hold a hearing on Nov. 15 to consider the injunction. The Supreme Court last year, in a case involving eBay, said injunctions should not be automatic in the case of patent infringement. Roche plans to argue that the public interest would be served if Mircera were allowed on the market, a spokeswoman said. Some legal experts, however, said that approach would be a long shot. Roche, which is based in Switzerland, said in a statement that it was considering all its legal options, including an appeal. The decision is a reprieve for Amgen, which is already facing declining sales of its anemia drugs because of safety concerns and a resulting cutback in reimbursement by Medicare. Shares of Amgen rose $1.58, or 3 percent, to close at $57.70. “This wasn’t just a victory, it was a shutout,” said Mark Schoenebaum, the biotechnology analyst at Bear Stearns, referring to the verdict. He said it would be difficult for Roche to win on appeal. Mr. Schoenebaum said Amgen’s anemia business was still likely to decline sharply in the coming years because of the Medicare cutback. But he said that there were now probably no more “landmines” that could hurt the stock. Amgen’s two anemia drugs, Epogen and Aranesp, had sales of $6.6 billion last year, nearly half the company’s total revenue. Mircera would have broken a monopoly Amgen has had on selling this type of anemia drug to kidney dialysis centers since 1989, when Epogen was approved. Since then, Amgen has sold more than $25 billion of Epogen, including $2.5 billion last year. Medicare, which pays for most dialysis treatments, spends more than $2 billion a year on Epogen. Mircera would also have competed with Aranesp and with Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is sold under license from Amgen. Those drugs are used to treat anemia in kidney patients not undergoing dialysis and patients receiving cancer chemotherapy. All the drugs are synthetic forms of erythropoietin, or Epo, a protein made by the kidneys that stimulates the body to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells. An Amgen scientist, Fu-Kuen Lin, isolated the human gene for Epo, allowing the protein to be produced in genetically engineered hamster cells. The work was done in the early 1980s, and the first patent on that work expired late in 2004. In Europe, where there was only one patent, competition is beginning. But in the United States, owing to quirks in patent law, Amgen received seven patents on the same work by Mr. Lin. Because some patents were not granted until years after Amgen applied, the patent protection could extend until 2015, longer than the 20 years contemplated by patent law. Roche argued that Amgen’s newer patents were invalid. “Amgen has had an extended monopoly for the last 20 years, not allowing for new therapeutic options to treat anemia to be introduced to patients in this country,” George B. Abercrombie, the president of Roche’s American pharmaceuticals operations, said in a statement yesterday. But Amgen has successfully defended its patents twice before, also before Judge Young in Boston. Roche has been expecting the Food and Drug Administration to approve Mircera by Nov. 14. Amgen’s victory is likely to mean several more years before dialysis centers have another source of anemia treatments. Dialysis center managers are dependent on Amgen for a vital drug and for other support, so they tend to be in its corner. At last month’s fall conference of a professional society, the National Renal Administrators Association, held in Huntington Beach, Calif., the tote bags said “Amgen,” the name badge holders said “Amgen” and the breakfast, lunch and refreshments were paid for by Amgen. Still, some managers said privately at that meeting that they would welcome competition. The next new competitor might be Affymax, a small California company that hopes by 2011 to win approval for an anemia drug that it says will not infringe Amgen’s patents. The apparent elimination of Roche as a potential competitor helped lift Affymax’s stock, which rose $2.41 to $30.76 yesterday.

A million dollars certainly isn’t what it used to be, but it is still a reasonable benchmark to use for saying someone is well off. And it appears a lot of Americans are well off. There are 9.3 million households in the United States  about one of every 12  with a net worth of at least $1 million, writes Financial Planning magazine, citing figures compiled by the Phoenix Companies and TNS Financial Services. Net worth here is defined oddly: It is the value of all assets a household owns, minus debts and the value of the primary residence. (But while the primary residence is not counted, a second home and other real estate is.) Traditionally, when financial planners talk about high-net-worth individuals, they mean people with at least $1 million in assets to invest. The numbers here are impressive as well. “Of the 114 million houses in the U.S., roughly 109 million, or 95 percent, have less than $1 million in investable assets,” writes Elizabeth O’Brien. But there are about five million households “with $1 million to $10 million to invest; 200,000 households with $10 million to $25 million to invest” and another 40,000 designated “ultra-high net worth,” who have more than $25 million in investable assets. BARGAIN HUNTING The stock market volatility lately is, to say the least, unsettling. “But these moments, which can make the squeamish reach for the Pepto-Bismol, also can be golden opportunities for patient investors,” Russell Pearlman writes in Smart Money. “Traders can forget just how valuable a firm’s underlying business really is,” he writes. “Just as scary as buying a stock that has been hammered in shaky times like these is buying a growth stock that has been soaring and trades at a high valuation. But in either case, patient and discerning investors can make a killing.” He then identifies five stocks, labeled “the new Pepto Portfolio.” Three have been punished by Wall Street relatively recently: Amgen, Best Buy and Washington Mutual. The other two  Precision Castparts and Foster Wheeler  have been trading at higher multiples than some investors would like, but, Mr. Pearlman says, are worth the price. GOING (FOR THE) GREEN There have been countless articles about where to invest to capitalize on the interest in going green. But what is so appealing about the Kiplinger’s article by David Landis and Andrew Tanzer on 25 stocks that will benefit from the green movement is that it goes beyond naming the usual suspects. Yes, they mention General Electric, which manufactures wind turbines and clean coal technology, and the makers of solar cells and panels like SunPower. But the article goes out of its way to point out ways that other companies that do not instantly spring to mind could benefit as well. For example, as environmental laws grow more stringent, the insurer American International Group, “has been writing policies that protect business against environmental claims since the early 1980s” and is likely to get more business. Also, how about American Standard, which is “a leader in energy-efficient air-conditioning and climate control systems.” FINAL TAKE Asa Fitch in Money magazine provides a gentle reminder not to try to time the market. “You’d have made 7.4 percent in the average stock fund if you bought in 1997 and held on,” reports Morningstar. “But actual investors made just 5.9 percent, in part because they kept popping in and out of the market trying to anticipate its swings. Moral: stay calm and stay put.” PAUL B.

Then, according to the chains chief financial officer, she delivered a chilling warning. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Illustration by The New York Times Multimedia Graphic A Bare-Knuckled Strategy Enlarge This Image Axel Koester for The New York Times Crescent Heights Dialysis Center in Los Angeles, like many of its counterparts, administers Amgens drug Epogen. If the clinics switched from Amgens anemia drug to a new medicine planned by a big competitor, and then the competing drug was knocked off the market by an Amgen patent lawsuit, the chain might have to pay a much higher price to resume using Amgens drug. And I was like, Did I just meet with the mob? said Tracey Mooney, the chains chief financial officer, recalling the July 2006 exchange. Amgen, she said, was effectively threatening to turn her clinics, run by the nonprofit Independent Dialysis Foundation, into a money-losing operation. With the anemia drug accounting for about a third of total costs, she said, Amgen can make or break me. Amgen would not comment, saying the matter was part of its litigation with the competitor, the Swiss drug giant Roche  a case that could go to a federal jury in Boston this week. In its legal briefs, Amgen says that any alleged threats, even if they were made, were inconsequential. But there is nothing inconsequential about the looming clash. Even as Amgen reels from recent safety questions about its anemia drugs, it is bracing for a possible assault by Roche on its franchise, worth $7 billion a year. It is a war that will be waged not so much with medical studies as with marketing muscle and bare-knuckles pricing tactics intended to capitalize on the rules of Medicare. And because of quirks in those rules, the product with the higher price might have the competitive edge. Roche says it expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve its drug, Mircera, by Nov. 14. If it reaches the market, Mircera will break the monopoly Amgen has had selling anemia treatments to American dialysis centers since the approval of its drug, Epogen, in 1989. Since then, Amgen has sold more than $25 billion worth of Epogen, including $2.5 billion worth last year. Most of those billions came from Medicare, which pays to treat almost all the nations 350,000 dialysis patients. Almost everyone whose kidneys stop functioning develops anemia. Mircera would also compete with Amgens newer anemia drug, Aranesp, which now has even bigger sales than Epogen, and with Procrit, a drug sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson under a license from Amgen. Aranesp and Procrit are used primarily to treat patients with kidney disease who are not on dialysis, as well as patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. Roche is seeking approval of Mircera only as a treatment for kidney disease, not for use in cancer therapy. Amgens first line of defense is its patent-infringement lawsuit in Boston. Because the judge has already ruled that Mircera infringes one Amgen patent, Roche must convince the jury that the patent itself is invalid. If Roche fails, Mircera might never reach the market. But if Roche prevails, the fight will move out of the courtroom and into the marketplace. According to documents made public in the litigation, both companies have planned for years for their showdown, even conducting war games in which some executives acted as the competition to develop pricing strategy. A crucial factor in the battle is that dialysis clinics can profit from drugs they administer on site, including the anemia drugs, which are usually infused intravenously during dialysis. The profits come from the difference between the clinics cost for the drugs and the often higher rates at which Medicare and private insurers reimburse them. Hospitals and doctors offices can also make money this way. In the past, some drug companies have gamed this system by setting list prices far higher than actual prices, increasing profit for doctors as a way to win their loyalty. Pharmaceutical companies caught rigging the reimbursements in this way have been assessed big fines. Medicare has since changed its rules to greatly reduce the ability of drug companies to market the spread, as the tactic is known. Medicare now reimburses doctors and clinics for medicines at 6 percent over the drugs actual average selling price, which is about $170 for an average weekly dose of Epogen. A small dialysis provider might make about $7 on that weekly treatment; a large chain, with bigger discounts from Amgen, could make much more. But there is a six-month lag in calculating the average price. So for the first six months a new product is on the market, Medicare generally reimburses at 6 percent above the wholesale price set by the maker. Documents unsealed as evidence in the litigation indicate that Roche planned to use that six-month period to essentially buy market share by setting a wholesale price that, although a bit lower than Aranesps official list price, would be about 38 percent higher than Aranesps current average selling price and 78 percent higher than Epogens. Roche could then offer big discounts off the wholesale price to clinics, hospitals and kidney centers  potentially allowing them several times the profit they would get from using Amgens products. If that happens, Economics 101 would be stood temporarily on its head. Rather than lowering prices, competition would end up raising Medicares costs, at least for the first six months. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/business/16dial.html?ref=amgeninc">The Dialysis Business: Fair Treatment?<date>Published: September 16, 2007</date><text>El Segundo, Calif. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic How Much Epogen Is Too Much? Enlarge This Image Axel Koester for The New York Times Kent J. Thiry at DaVitas headquarters in El Segundo, Calif. DaVitas offices and clinics have photos of patients and employees. Concern is mounting that Epogen, the drug that provides much of DaVitas revenue, is being overused. KENT J. THIRY, the chief executive of DaVita, a leading provider of dialysis services, regularly dons a Three Musketeers costume at company meetings, brandishes a sword and leads employees in chants of All for One and One for All. At a meeting last year in Dallas, he rode a longhorn bull around the hotel, surrounded by parade floats made by employees. Amid all this boosterism is a combative streak. In a skit presented at a DaVita employee meeting two years ago, a DaVita musketeer killed a federal bureaucrat  dressed in black hat and bandits mask  who threatened to cut the reimbursement for dialysis. Another musketeer killed a federal prosecutor. For his part, Mr. Thiry favors a warmer, homier approach at the companys headquarters here. He insists that DaVita is a village and that he, as the sign on his office door says, is KT, Mayor. Office aisles even sport street signs like Be Our Guest Ln. and Acquisition Ave. With the help of such slogans, skits and shtick, Mr. Thiry has rescued DaVita from near collapse and turned it into an enterprise that, he asserts, is becoming the best dialysis company the world has ever seen. And that, he says, using another expression that his DaVita employees faithfully repeat, is no brag, just fact. But the mayor and his profitable little community (2006 sales, $4.9 billion; earnings, $290 million) are threatened. Federal officials are cracking down on how DaVita makes much of its money: by administering the drug Epogen to treat anemia in dialysis patients. DaVita receives more from Medicare and private insurers for providing Epogen than it pays to buy the drug from its manufacturer, Amgen. Concerns are mounting that such financial incentives are contributing to an overuse of Epogen that may lead to heart problems, blood clots or even premature deaths. The payment system leads to perverse incentives, said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, during a Congressional hearing in June at which DaVita was singled out for criticism. The Food and Drug Administration, which has already forced Amgen to provide stricter warnings about Epogen and similar products, convened a panel of experts last week to consider further restrictions on the drugs use. While the panel advised against such a move, use of the drug is still expected to drop from last years levels, industry analysts say. Medicare and Congress are moving to stop separate Medicare reimbursement for Epogen to end the incentives to overuse the drug. Law enforcement authorities, including those at the Justice Department and at the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, are conducting criminal and civil investigations into how DaVita and some other dialysis providers bill for Epogen. All of this casts an unfavorable spotlight on the dialysis business, which might be the closest thing the United States has to nationalized health care. Medicare pays for almost all dialysis, even for patients younger than 65. Dialysis is a dreary experience, one in which people with failed kidneys sit for hours hooked to machines that cleanse their blood, assisted by technicians who often have to work a second job to make ends meet. More than one in five of the nations dialysis patients die each year  a rate as much as double that in Europe and Japan  for reasons that arent clear. Some 350,000 or so Americans currently need dialysis; that population is growing about 3 percent a year, fueled by a rise in diabetes. DaVita treats about 106,000 patients in more than 1,300 clinics and appears to be the most aggressive Epogen user among major dialysis chains, according to the United States Renal Data System, a government-funded registry of dialysis data. Epogen accounts for 25 percent of DaVitas revenue and up to 40 percent of its earnings, according to the Stanford Group Company, a research firm. As he sorties forth to defend DaVita, Mr. Thiry has become the most visible dialysis executive in Washington, taking issue with what he describes as unfair accusations that his companys profits are built on a product that causes harm to patients. The suspension of logic in this discussion has been remarkable, he said. He said he was confident that DaVita would emerge unscathed from the government investigations. Mr. Thiry added that he would welcome a well-designed change in the reimbursement system to eliminate perceived incentives to overuse Epogen, which is commonly referred to as Epo. Do that tomorrow so we get rid of the taint, he said. Were still going to use the same amount of Epo. THE controversy comes just as Mr. Thiry, 51, has started to attract favorable attention in business schools and the media for DaVitas management practices, like an extensive emphasis on employee training. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/business/12anemia.html?ref=amgeninc">F.D.A. Advisory Panel Opposes Curb on Anemia Drugs<date>Published: September 12, 2007</date><text>A federal advisory committee voted yesterday against imposing a new restriction on the use of anemia drugs to treat patients with kidney disease, offering a rare reprieve to Amgen, the manufacturer of the drugs. The panel, advising the Food and Drug Administration, voted 14-to-5 against an F.D.A. proposal to set a fairly specific upper range on the drugs use. Several studies have linked overuse of the drugs to cardiovascular problems and deaths and, when used to treat cancer patients, to a worsening of tumors. Shares of Amgen, which had fallen sharply since safety concerns about the drug intensified in January, shot up more than 5 percent yesterday, closing at $53.88. The vote was also considered important to kidney dialysis chains like DaVita and Fresenius that, under Medicare rules, profit from the use of the anemia drugs. Some panel members seemed swayed by testimony from Amgen and from some outside kidney specialists and patient representatives that setting too strict an upper limit would mean that many patients would be undertreated, leaving them with debilitating anemia or needing risky and inconvenient blood transfusions. Such an approach alone would undoubtedly return us to the days of frequent blood transfusions, Dr. Allen R. Nissenson, a nephrologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, told the committee, speaking on Amgens behalf. Still, while yesterdays vote made it less likely that there would be drastic restrictions on the use of the drugs in kidney patients, the levels of use are unlikely to return to those common before the safety concerns took hold. Even while rejecting the F.D.A.s proposed ceiling, most panel members recommended a treatment target lower than what some dialysis clinics and kidney specialists previously used. Moreover, the F.D.A. said it was proposing to remove assertions on labels that the drugs improved the quality of life for patients, saying the data to support such claims was inadequate. Amgen has proposed keeping some, but not all, the claims. The committee was not asked to vote on the matter. The panels outcome was not as benign as the initial vote, Jim Birchenough, a Lehman Brothers analyst, wrote in a note to clients. The drug most affected by the committees vote was Epogen, an Amgen medication used to treat nearly all the roughly 350,000 dialysis patients in the United States. It had sales of $2.5 billion last year. Johnson &amp; Johnson sells the same drug under license as Procrit. Both Procrit and another Amgen drug called Aranesp are used primarily to treat cancer patients and kidney disease patients who are not undergoing dialysis. Yesterdays panel, which met in Gaithersburg, Md., was far easier on Amgen than one in May that considered the safety of the drugs for use by cancer patients. After that meeting, Medicare sharply reduced its reimbursement for cancer use. The Medicare action resulted in a drop in sales that contributed to Amgens decision last month to cut its work force by 12 to 14 percent. The drugs work by raising the level of the bodys red blood cells, which carry oxygen to tissues. Epogen, first approved for dialysis patients in 1989, has become a mainstay for such patients. But safety issues arose when researchers tried to use the drugs not merely to correct severe anemia but also to try to raise kidney patients levels of hemoglobin  the oxygen-carrying component of red cells  to 13.5 or 14 grams for each deciliter of blood, nearly the level of a healthy person. Two clinical trials, one in dialysis and one in predialysis patients, showed that patients given additional quantities of the drugs to raise their hemoglobin to those levels suffered more heart problems and deaths than those treated with a hemoglobin goal of 10 or 11 grams a deciliter. In March, the F.D.A. changed the labels to say that the drugs should be used as sparingly as necessary to avoid blood transfusions and that hemoglobin levels should not exceed 12 grams a deciliter. But yesterday it proposed setting an upper target of about 11. The committee  in two 14-to-5 votes, one for dialysis and one for predialysis patents  rejected that idea, saying somewhat more flexibility was needed. Malazia Y. Scott, a kidney patient from Tuscaloosa, Ala., the patient representative on the panel, said, At 11, Im not in the bed, but I think most of the day is spent in bed. Some panel members favored a range of 10 to 12 grams, which had also been proposed by Amgen. Still, that was lower than the 11-to-13 range that had been suggested by some kidney treatment guidelines. Many panel members said there was not enough data to distinguish the effects of 11 grams compared with 12 grams. The committees chairman, Dr. Richard Platt, decried the lack of data, saying it was extraordinary that 18 years after Epogen was first approved, doctors still did not know how to best use the drugs. He said the drugs developers should have conducted more thorough clinical trials. As individuals and society, said Dr. Platt, a professor at Harvard Medical School, we should demand much better evidence much earlier on. We are in a very difficult situation here being asked to advise in the absence of data. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/18/business/18values.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Finds Growing Up Isn’t So Easy<date>Published: August 18, 2007</date><text>AMGEN won over investors who viewed it as the first biotechnology company to graduate from adolescence to adulthood. It continued to grow fast, and its new maturity added something that other biotechs lacked: profits. Now Amgen seems to be suffering through a midlife crisis. Last month administrators for the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs reduced maximum reimbursements on the company’s anemia treatment Aranesp. That ruling followed a Food and Drug Administration recommendation of lower dosages of the class of anemia drugs that includes Aranesp and another Amgen product, Epogen, after trials raised safety questions. Those two drugs account for about half of Amgen’s sales and more than half of profits, so the agencies’ actions provoked shareholders to issue an adverse ruling of their own, pushing the stock to a four-year low. After trading above $85 a share two years ago, it sank below $50. It closed yesterday at $50.08. The setbacks have taken a toll. Amgen managed to increase sales by 3 percent in the second quarter, but Aranesp sales were down 19 percent, and the company warned of more to come. “Future product sales growth will be more difficult than in previous years,” it announced last week. Then on Wednesday the company said it would lay off up to 14 percent of its employees and reduce capital spending by $1.9 billion over two years. Opinion on Amgen runs the gamut. Some investors are taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding to buy or sell. A crucial event for them is a meeting of an F.D.A. panel on Sept. 11 that will assess the way anemia drugs are used in treating kidney ailments. Others have seen enough. They believe that Amgen’s share price does not fully take into consideration the impact of reduced sales of Aranesp and Epogen. Still others are willing to look past the current difficulties. They contend that Amgen retains the strength in drug development that helped it grow over the last decade and a half. Karen Andersen, an analyst at Morningstar, is one of the optimists. The falloff in sales of the anemia treatments may not be as bad as many foresee, she said. Either way, even before the bad news, the company, along with analysts like her, predicted that sales of Aranesp and Epogen would decline steadily but that Amgen would be creating new products. The most promising, Ms. Andersen said, is Denosumab, for treating osteoporosis and bone cancer. It could be sold as soon as late 2008 and reach $1 billion in annual sales within a few years. Vijay Shankaran, co-manager of the Turner Touchstone Health Care and Biotechnology fund, does not anticipate a sales recovery in Aranesp or Epogen, and he is not counting on new products, particularly Denosumab, to make up the shortfall. “Street models are putting a high probability of success on these trials,” he said. “People are expecting these trials to be positive, and if they’re not, the stock could suffer.” IF the Denosumab trials do go well, Mr. Shankaran said, he may consider Amgen’s stock worth buying. Meanwhile, he prefers shares of Gilead, a specialist in H.I.V. drugs, and Cellgene, which has licensed the once-notorious drug thalidomide to treat bone cancer. Ms. Andersen also likes Gilead, albeit less enthusiastically. Her other choices include Genzyme and a much smaller company, Mannkind, which makes a form of inhaled insulin that she expects to be a solid alternative to injected insulin and to Pfizer’s inhaled version, Exubera, which has had disappointing sales. Her favorite biotech remains Amgen, which she calculates is worth $69 a share. Reducing operating expenses might help push the stock toward her goal. So might giving shareholders their first dividend. “Paying a dividend would be a really interesting step that they could take to become more like a big pharma company,” Ms. Andersen said. Doling out a regular dividend would befit a grown-up drug maker. Yet while she would welcome such a sign, she recommends the stock mainly because she expects Amgen to retain its youthful vigor. “Amgen has a sustainable competitive advantage,” she said. “At these prices there is definitely value in Amgen’s shares.” More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/business/16amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">After Sales Setback, Amgen Moves to Cut Jobs and Capital Expenses<date>Published: August 16, 2007</date><text>LOS ANGELES, Aug. 15  The biotechnology giant Amgen announced the first major layoffs in its heretofore charmed history Wednesday as it sought to cope with sliding sales of the anemia drug Aranesp, its biggest selling product. The company said it would cut its work force by 2,200 to 2,600 people, or about 12 to 14 percent. It also said that it would reduce its planned capital expenses by $1.9 billion over two years, close certain production operations and prune a research and development organization that has mushroomed in the last few years. We are a company and a management group that faces reality and deals with it, and we have a new reality to face today compared to when we planned this year, Kevin W. Sharer, Amgens chief executive, told analysts and investors in a conference call Wednesday afternoon. The new reality is that sales of Aranesp and an older anemia drug, Epogen, are being buffeted by recent findings suggesting that overuse can worsen cancer, cause blood clots or heart attacks and perhaps hasten death. Sales of Aranesp fell 10 percent in the second quarter worldwide and 19 percent in the United States. But Amgen executives said sales could fall much further after a decision by Medicare in late July that would drastically curtail reimbursement for Aranesp when used to treat anemia in cancer patients. Amgen had already stopped hiring and put off some factory construction this year. But the recent Medicare decision helped bring about the deeper cutbacks. The layoffs would be a serious shock to the company, which was founded in 1980 and has experienced a virtually continuous rise in sales and profit since its first product, Epogen, reached the market in 1989. Amgen is the worlds largest biotechnology company by sales, with revenue of $14.3 billion last year. The anemia drugs counted for nearly half of that. Amgen officials said the moves would save $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion next year. Despite the cuts, Amgen said its earnings for this year would fall below its previous expectation of $4.28 a share. The new projections are for $4.13 to $4.23 a share. Last year the company earned $3.90 a share. Amgens shares fell 73 cents, or 1.42 percent, to $50.59, in regular trading and dropped an additional 29 cents after hours. This is a company thats focused on the investor here, said Kurt von Emster, portfolio manager of the MPM BioEquities Fund. Downsizing to 2006 employee levels is sort of necessitated by the revenue predicament they are in. Amgen executives said the new Medicare policy would force huge restrictions on use of Aranesp and force doctors to change how they practice. Doctors and patient groups are protesting the decision, but it is not clear that Medicare will change it. But even if the decision were reversed, Amgen faces other pressures, including the possible entry of Roche into the anemia drug market later this year. And despite Amgens use of stock buybacks and now cost cuts to raise earnings, some investors are still looking to see whether the company can bring big new drugs to market. Mr. Sharer, who took over as chief executive in 2000, vastly increased the investment in research and development. Last year the company spent $3.2 billion in that area, up about 40 percent from the year before and equal to about 23 percent of company sales, a high level for a pharmaceutical company. But it is as yet uncertain whether the bet will pay off. In the overhaul, Amgen will try to focus on the most promising prospects. Executives said the company might try to find partners to help develop certain drugs in its pipeline and might also sell off the rights to some of the companys smaller-selling drugs that are already on the market. The company will aim for research and development spending to be 20 percent of sales. The executives said most of the job cuts would come in manufacturing and research and development rather than in the sales force, which is relatively small compared with other pharmaceutical companies. The cuts will come from a combination of voluntary buyouts and layoffs. The job reduction is among the largest ever in the biotechnology business. By percentage of employees, it is larger than cutbacks announced recently by Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. Those companies in part faced competition to big-selling drugs from generic drug companies, something Amgen is only starting to face in a limited way. The job losses will be a blow to Thousand Oaks, the Los Angeles suburb where Amgen is based and which has prospered with the company. Amgen is the highest-paying job source in the county, said Bill Watkins, executive director of the Economic Forecast Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, referring to Ventura County, in which Thousand Oaks is located. We can tell what year theyve had good bonuses. Amgen employees in Thousand Oaks might not be able to find jobs in the biotechnology industry without moving. The Los Angeles area does not have the same thriving biotechnology community as San Francisco and San Diego. In San Francisco and San Diego, executives frequently leave established companies, like the industry pioneer Genentech, to start new ventures. But there are virtually no such spinoffs from Amgen.

On Monday, the federal agency, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, eased some of the restrictions it had proposed in May for the use of anemia drugs in cancer patients. The agency was concerned that the products might be making some cancers worse, but relented in the face of an outcry from cancer patients and their doctors. But the agency also said it would deny payment for drugs like Aranesp and Epogen from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson if a patient's hemoglobin level was greater than 10 grams per deciliter. Many doctors aim for a hemoglobin level of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter in their cancer patients (the normal range is generally 13 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women). Amgen said it was concerned that the new limits on coverage would increase the need for blood transfusions and compromise quality of care. ''In our view, restricting coverage in this way is unreasonable, impractical and unworkable,'' Dr. Roger M. Perlmutter, Amgen's executive vice president for global research and development, said. The company added that limiting reimbursement to patients with hemoglobin levels of less than 10 grams per deciliter is contrary to the Food and Drug Administration's approved labeling for the drugs, which stimulate the body's production of erythropoietin, a hormone needed in the production of red blood cells. Amgen, whose Aranesp and Epogen were last year's best-selling biotech drugs, also said the new policy goes against a recommendation by the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee against changing the upper hemoglobin limit of 12 grams per deciliter in the current F.D.A. label for its drugs and in clinical practice guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Hematology. In March, the F.D.A. put its strongest warning on the label of Aranesp and similar anemia drugs, calling on doctors to use the lowest dose that can effectively avert the need for blood transfusions, because of concerns over safety and overuse. Last month, the Medicare agency also proposed reducing payments for anemia drugs used to treat patients who are undergoing kidney dialysis. Shares of Amgen lost 3.07 percent, or $1.65, to close at $52.09 Wednesday on Nasdaq.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/business/31amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Medicare Eases Proposed Restrictions on Anemia Drugs Used by Cancer Patients<date>Published: July 31, 2007</date><text>Medicare has eased up on some of its proposed restrictions on the use of popular anemia drugs made by Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. The decision, announced late yesterday, could provide some relief for the two companies, which have already experienced steep drops in sales of the drugs because of concerns that the products might be making cancer worse. The new policy is still expected to curtail use of the drugs, however. The federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services had proposed in May to sharply limit coverage for the drugs  Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Some analysts had predicted at that time that use of the drugs could be cut by as much as 50 percent. But in a public comment period that followed, the agency received more than 2,600 comments, many of them from doctors, medical societies and patient groups who said the proposed restrictions went too far, were not based on scientific evidence and would possibly harm patients. That prompted yesterday’s pullback. “In a lot of respects it looks as though C.M.S. has blinked in the face of the huge outcry over the initial proposal,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Still, he said, the new policy would nevertheless mean a “significant reduction” in use of the drugs. Both Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson said yesterday that they were still studying the 61-page decision and could not comment immediately. But investors reacted favorably, sending shares of Amgen by more than $2 in early after-hours trading, though it then began to drop back. Shares had closed at $56.19, up 57 cents. Shares of the larger and more diversified Johnson &amp; Johnson rose about 30 cents after hours, having closed at $60.07, up 30 cents. Medicare’s decision is expected to influence how private insurers pay for the drugs, which are synthetic versions of erythropoietin, or EPO, a hormone that increases the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. “Our goal was to maintain physician autonomy while ensuring the safety of our Medicare beneficiaries,” Herb B. Kuhn, the acting deputy administrator of the agency, said in a statement. Medicare’s final “national coverage determination” still retains some significant restrictions. For instance, the program will not cover the use of the drugs to treat the anemia caused by cancer itself, as opposed to anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs are approved only for the anemia from chemotherapy but had been widely used by patients not getting chemotherapy. But other proposed restrictions have been lifted, like ones that would have barred reimbursement for the drugs’ use during chemotherapy for certain types of cancer or for patients being treated with the cancer drugs Avastin and Erbitux. Medicare also relaxed the requirements for beginning anemia treatment. Its proposal in May had said doctors should wait until a patient’s hemoglobin  the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells  dropped below 9 grams per deciliter, close to the point at which blood transfusions would be considered. Yesterday it said treatment could begin when the hemoglobin level drops to 10. In the past many doctors had started treatment when hemoglobin levels were even higher than 10. The agency also said it would leave to local contractors the decision on whether to pay for the drugs to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a family of bone marrow diseases that can lead to leukemia. Medicare had proposed to deny such coverage, drawing protests from patient groups. The policy issued yesterday relates only to the use of the drugs for cancer patients, not for patients with kidney failure. Aranesp is Amgen’s biggest-selling product, with sales last year reaching $4.1 billion. But the safety concerns have already started to take a toll. Worldwide sales of Aranesp fell 10 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $949 million. In the United States the decline was even steeper  19 percent, to $578 million. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s worldwide sales of Procrit, which is called Eprex outside the United States, fell 6 percent, to $758 million. In the United States, sales plunged 14 percent, to $449 million.

A slim sales increase helped raise second-quarter profit for Bristol-Myers Squibb, which raised its 2007 outlook and offered a 2008 forecast, citing confidence in controlling costs and increasing sales. Amgen reported net income of $1.02 billion, or 90 cents a share, for the quarter that ended June 30, compared with $14 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same period last year. Revenue grew slightly to $3.73 billion, from $3.6 billion in the year-ago period. The company said that on an adjusted basis, excluding the cost of expensing stock options and other charges, its net profit was $1.27 billion, or $1.12 a share, compared with $1.24 billion, or $1.05 a share, in the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected net profit of $1.06 per share on revenues of $3.7 billion. Analysts consider Amgens adjusted earnings excluding stock options expense in their estimates. This has been a difficult period and this quarters low growth is a reflection of that reality, Amgens chairman and chief executive, Kevin Sharer, said. That said, we are making progress on many fronts to change this trend and return Amgen to strong future performance. Still, the company said it was on track to deliver growth at the low end of its previous full-year earnings forecast of $4.30 a share. Worldwide sales of its anemia-treating drug Aranesp decreased 10 percent, to $949 million, in the second quarter in reaction to the Food and Drug Administration finding that the drug should carry a stronger warning label when used in cancer patients with anemia. The warning label addition called for doctors to use the lowest possible dose of the drug. Aranesp was the companys best-selling drug last year, with $4.12 billion in sales. The F.D.A. also decided that additional studies were needed to ensure the safety of anemia drugs, including Amgens Epogen and Johnson &amp; Johnsons Procrit. Sales of Epogen increased 2 percent in the quarter, to $624 million, because of a growing patient population, offset in part by lower doses and demand, the company said. Shares of Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, fell $1, or 1.8 percent, to $56.16 at the end of regular trading Thursday. They gained 57 cents in extended trading after the second-quarter results were released. Bristol-Myerss profit rose nearly 6 percent to $706 million, or 36 cents a share, on a 1 percent increase in revenue to $4.93 billion. The blood-thinner Plavix again led sales for the company, rising 4 percent to $1.19 billion. James M. Cornelius, the chief executive, said he expected the drug to drive growth for the company over the next few years. He said the company would cut its work force by the end of the year as part of a cost-cutting program, though exact details are not expected until December. Bristol-Myerss goal is to streamline operations while investing more in specialty pharmaceuticals and biologic-based drug development over the next three years, Mr. Cornelius said.

Is Delaying Approval of Anemia Drug From Roche<date>Published: May 19, 2007</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration has delayed approval of Roches new anemia drug, as concerns mount about the safety of drugs in its class. The delay, which Roche announced late yesterday, provides a temporary reprieve to Amgen. Roches entry into the market would have ended the monopoly Amgen has held since 1989 on drugs to treat anemia in people undergoing kidney dialysis, a monopoly that has brought it approximately $25 billion in total sales. Shares of Amgen rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading, as word of the F.D.A. decision circulated. But Amgens reprieve from competition could be only temporary. The F.D.A. issued what Roche called an approvable letter, meaning its drug, Mircera, could be approved if certain conditions were met and questions were answered. Roche declined to say what those conditions and questions were, disclosing only portions of the letter favorable to the company. Particularly, it said, Roche would not have to conduct additional clinical trials before approval. The F.D.A. typically does not comment on its letters to companies. The delay comes as several studies in the last six months have suggested that the widely used anemia drugs can cause heart problems and blood clots and  when used to treat the anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy  make cancer worse. An advisory committee to the F.D.A. last week recommended new restrictions on use of the drugs to treat the anemia from cancer chemotherapy. A second advisory panel is expected to meet in the early autumn to discuss using the drugs for patients with kidney disease. Roche said yesterday that it expected Mircera to be approved after that fall meeting. The companys application is only for kidney failure, not cancer, although it says it eventually hopes to win approval for cancer patients as well. We are confident that Mircera will be approved in the United States, George B. Abercrombie, the chief executive of the American operations of Switzerland-based Roche, said in a statement. And we understand and support the F.D.A.s initiative to convene an advisory panel to review the use of anemia agents in the renal setting. A year ago, Roches pending market entry was perceived by many analysts as the biggest looming threat to Amgen, which gets nearly half its revenues from sales of its anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen. Amgen also receives royalties from Johnson &amp; Johnsons sales of its anemia drug, Procrit, which is not allowed be used for dialysis patients under terms of that agreement. But as the safety concerns have mounted, the threat from Roche had become almost an afterthought. And approval of Mircera, once considered certain, also came into doubt. The biggest impact of an approval for Roche would be in the kidney dialysis market, in which Johnson &amp; Johnson is not allowed to compete under the terms of its contract with Amgen. Amgens Epogen, which is sold only for dialysis use in the United States, had sales last year of $2.5 billion. Medicare, which pays for most dialysis, spends more than $2 billion a year on the drug. Mirceras marketing advantage would be that it could be given as infrequently as once every four weeks. Epogen and Procrit are given as often as three times a week. Aranesp can be given as once every three weeks for use in cancer, according to its label. Even if Roche finally wins F.D.A. approval, its challenges will not be over. Amgen can still keep Mircera off the market if it wins a patent infringement lawsuit it filed against Roche. Roche says Mircera, which was known as C.E.R.A. during its development, does not infringe. Roche had planned to start selling Mircera before the patent case was resolved. Such an at-risk product introduction would have subjected Roche to greater penalties if it ultimately lost the patent suit. But with the trial scheduled to start in September in federal court in Boston, it is now possible the court will rule on patent infringement before the F.D.A. approves Mircera. Amgens patents are based on work done in the early 1980s by one of its scientists to clone the gene for the production of EPO, as the class of drugs is known. The patent on that work expired at the end of 2004. But Amgen managed to get six other patents based on the same 1980s work, covering things like the method of manufacturing and pharmaceutical formulations. Those patents were not granted until years after the first one, extending Amgens patent protection until as late as 2015.

Some analysts said the proposed restrictions, announced late Monday, could cut use of the drug by as much as half. But the Medicare effort is likely to face opposition from some doctors and patient groups, who say such drugs help cancer patients cope with chemotherapy. Medicare ''has acted prematurely to come out with these coverage policies,'' said Deborah Kamin, the senior director for cancer policy and clinical affairs at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer doctors. She said that some of the recommendations ''seem not to have any basis in scientific evidence.'' The proposals, which would also apply to Johnson &amp; Johnson's anemia drug, Procrit, follow recent reports suggesting that the drugs, widely used to treat anemia in cancer patients, could actually be making the tumors worse or hastening deaths. Citing such evidence, the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, proposed limiting the duration of treatment and requiring that anemia reach a certain severity before therapy can be started. The Medicare agency also proposed denying reimbursement for use of the drug for patients with certain types of cancer, including common ones like those of the breast, lung and colon. Any measure Medicare adopts is certain to strongly influence private insurers. Last week, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration also recommended restrictions on use of the drugs. But the Medicare proposals, if anything, would be even more restrictive than that committee's recommendation, stunning many Wall Street analysts. ''We could never have anticipated that the extent of regulatory and reimbursement threat could reach these levels,'' Geoffrey C. Porges, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said in a note to clients yesterday. He estimated that the proposals could cut Aranesp use in half. Amgen shares closed yesterday down $2.06, or 4 percent, to $54.01. Earlier in the day the shares were as low as $52.36, the lowest level in two and a half years. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is a much more diversified health care company, fell 79 cents, or about 1 percent, to $61.82. The drugs, genetically engineered versions of a human hormone that stimulates production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells, constitute Medicare's biggest drug expenditure. Last year Aranesp had sales of $4.1 billion. Sales of Aranesp and Epogen, a similar drug used to treat anemia in kidney dialysis patients, accounted for nearly half of Amgen's $14.3 billion in revenue. Sales of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Procrit, known as Eprex outside the United States, were $3.2 billion. Medicare's proposals will be open to public comment for a month and are expected to go into effect later this year. Amgen, known in Washington as a formidable lobbyist, is bound to fight them. It said in a statement that it planned to work with Medicare officials ''to ensure that coverage decisions are consistent with the available science and in the best interest of patients.'' Stephanie Fagan, a spokeswoman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said that Medicare should not have acted until a final decision by the F.D.A. on the advisory panel's recommendation. Dr. George Demetri, an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University, who has also consulted for both Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the proposed restrictions ''seem very strict,'' though he added that Medicare might have evidence that he was not aware of. Still, Dr. Demetri, who is on a committee that develops anemia treatment guidelines for an organization of leading cancer centers, said that solid studies on the safety of the drugs were ''distressingly limited.'' One group of patients likely to object to the new proposals suffer from myelodysplastic syndromes, or M.D.S., a family of bone marrow diseases that can lead to leukemia. The drugs are not approved to treat the anemia that often accompanies M.D.S., but Medicare has been paying for such use. Now, it proposes to stop. ''There's a body of literature that supports their use in M.D.S. even though they don't have the indication,'' said Dr. Mikkael Sekeres, the co-chairman of the medical advisory board of the Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/business/15amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Justices Turn Down Drug Patent Dispute<date>Published: May 15, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, May 14 (AP)  The Supreme Court on Monday declined to consider a patent dispute between the biotechnology drug producer Amgen and two other companies involving the Amgen anemia drug Epogen. Despite passing on this case, the justices have recently shown heightened interest in patent law, taking up half a dozen cases in the last two years and issuing two decisions in April. Amgen began the dispute in 1997 when it accused Aventis Pharmaceuticals, now a unit of Sanofi-Aventis of Paris, and Shire Human Genetic Therapies, a division of the British drug developer Shire, of infringing its patents on Epogen. A federal district court largely agreed with Amgens arguments, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a mixed decision last year, ruling that two of Amgens patents were valid and reversing the lower courts findings on two others. Amgen urged the Supreme Court to rule on the Federal Circuits practice of considering the factual record behind its patent claims. Typically, United States appeals courts consider issues of law, rather than fact. Last year, Amgen received $2.5 billion in revenue from Epogen sales.

Thanks to big payoffs to doctors, and reckless promotional ads permitted by lax regulators, the drugs have reached blockbuster status. Now we learn that the dosage levels routinely injected or given intravenously in doctors offices and dialysis centers may be harmful to patients. As Alex Berenson and Andrew Pollack laid bare in The Times on May 9, wide use of the medicines  Aranesp and Epogen, from Amgen; and Procrit, from Johnson &amp; Johnson  has been propelled by the two companies paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in so-called rebates. Doctors typically buy the drugs from the companies, get reimbursed for much of the cost by Medicare and private insurers, and on top of that get these rebates based on the amount they have purchased. Although many doctors complain that they barely break even or even lose money on the costly drugs, for high-volume providers the profits can be substantial. One group of six cancer doctors in the Pacific Northwest earned a profit of about $1.8 million last year thanks to rebates from Amgen, while a large chain of dialysis centers gets an estimated 25 percent of its revenue, and a higher percentage of its profits, from the anemia drugs. It seems likely that these financial incentives have led to wider use and the prescribing of higher doses than medically desirable. Although the drugs are deemed valuable in fighting severe anemia, there is scant evidence they help much in moderate cases and some evidence that high doses can be dangerous. Half of the dialysis patients in this country are now receiving enough of the drugs to raise their red blood cell counts to levels deemed risky by the Food and Drug Administration. And last week a panel of cancer experts urged the F.D.A. to impose additional restrictions on use of the drugs in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy, based on studies that the drugs might make some cancers worse or hasten the deaths of patients. Use of Procrit has also been fueled by television ads suggesting that it makes elderly cancer patients more energetic and, pushing all the emotional buttons, allows them to keep up with their grandchildren. That claim has not been established to the F.D.A.s satisfaction, and a top official said last week that his agency owes the public a good explanation for why it allowed the ads to continue. With any luck, the advisory panels concerns should cause many oncologists to think twice before dispensing the anti-anemia drugs. But the surest way to slow the overprescribing is to stop the rebates. Federal laws already bar drug companies from paying doctors to prescribe medicines in pill form. That prohibition should be extended to injected and intravenous medicines.

This is not a surprise because it reflects our broken health system, a system driven by greed. Although drug companies say their intentions are not to promote the use of more medicine for profit, there will always be the risk that some doctors will prescribe higher doses to gain that extra dollar. As patients, we should work to eliminate the incentives to doctors and to raise patient awareness about them. We deserve the right to know the benefits of a medicine, both for us and for the doctors. Luis Rodriguez Daly City, Calif., May 9, 2007 To the Editor: Medical care should be guided only by what is best for patients. But throughout the medical system, rebates and volume discounts are common and can create the perception of improper incentives. Our organization has long advocated evidence-based guidelines, including those we produced in 2002 with the American Society of Hematology on erythropoietin use for chemotherapy-related anemia. With the appropriate use of erythropoietin, many thousands of patients have avoided potentially dangerous blood transfusions. Oncologists care deeply about their patients, and the overwhelming majority treat them based on the best available evidence. In the case of erythropoietin, recent studies prompted the Food and Drug Administration to issue a ''black box'' warning in March about the potential dangers of using erythropoietin to boost hemoglobin to levels higher than guidelines recommend. Early evidence suggests that doctors factored this new data into their prescribing decisions and have reduced erythropoietin use. As a whole, the medical community needs to better determine the impact financial incentives may have on prescribing patterns and patient care, to ensure that patient needs continue to be at the forefront of medical decisions. Allen S. Lichter, M.D. Exec. V.P., American Society of Clinical Oncology Alexandria, Va., May 10, 2007 To the Editor: Many doctors appear dissatisfied with fees ethically garnered from clinical evaluation and management. They can and will prescribe for personal profit, and will readily reshape and expand diseases to suit the available reimbursement. Without disclosure, patients are typically the last to know there might be a problem. The investigation of anemia drugs no doubt could expose the self-serving logic, unethical inducements and poor administrative surveillance that permit exploitation of the public's soft financial underbelly. Unfortunately, there are plenty of other specialties of medicine where such professional betrayals occur. And adequate regulation is not likely to occur in the financial free-for-all of private medicine. James H. Lampman, M.D. Bismarck, N.D., May 9, 2007 To the Editor: The discovery and development of growth factors that stimulate the bone marrow to produce red cells was a milestone in modern medicine. In the appropriate setting, these growth factors can improve blood counts and quality of life and spare patients time-consuming, expensive, short-lasting and risky transfusions. In our practice the increasing use of these medicines is driven by the fact that they work so well. As with any new therapy, these medicines need to be used within established and developing guidelines to avoid serious side effects. Since there are two competing and equally effective drugs, the drug makers are offering incentives for preferential use -- the natural outcome of a free-market economy. Deciding how regulators might control drug makers is an important undertaking, but it should not detract from the tremendous benefits of these drugs when used in the right situation. Birjis Akhund, M.D. Chief of Medical Oncology Huntington Hospital Huntington, N.Y., May 9, 2007 To the Editor: America has the best medical care in the world. It is the most advanced and expensive. The first two qualifications are debatable, but the third is difficult to refute. The great expense is complicated by the high cost of drugs and procedures of dubious benefit. The likelihood of being prescribed drugs of dubious benefit is obviously increased by kickbacks to doctors. The kickbacks may be legal, but should they really be allowed? The cost of medicine is increased by this practice, and the quality is sure to suffer. Alex Floyd Lexington, Ky., May 9, 2007 To the Editor: ''Doctors Reaping Millions for Use of Anemia Drugs'' (front page, May 9) was disturbing. I found it equally disturbing that the continuation of the article was in Business Day. In the past two decades, I have observed that news of important medical advances increasingly appears in, or is continued in, the business section. This practice advances the thinking that health care is primarily a business in which providers reap riches, rather than a humane social endeavor in which providers earn their living. Ira D.

Skip to next paragraph Getting Paid to Prescribe Drugs Do you trust your doctor to prescribe the appropriate drugs for you? Post a Comment Multimedia Graphic Aggressively Treating Anemia The payments are legal, but very few people outside of the doctors who receive them are aware of their size. Critics, including prominent cancer and kidney doctors, say the payments give physicians an incentive to prescribe the medicines at levels that might increase patients risks of heart attacks or strokes. Industry analysts estimate that such payments  to cancer doctors and the other big users of the drugs, kidney dialysis centers  total hundreds of millions of dollars a year and are an important source of profit for doctors and the centers. The payments have risen over the last several years, as the makers of the drugs, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, compete for market share and try to expand the overall business. Neither Amgen nor Johnson &amp; Johnson has disclosed the total amount of the payments. But documents given to The New York Times show that at just one practice in the Pacific Northwest, a group of six cancer doctors received $2.7 million from Amgen for prescribing $9 million worth of its drugs last year. Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration added to concerns about the drugs, releasing a report that suggested that their use might need to be curtailed in cancer patients. The report, prepared by F.D.A. staff scientists, said no evidence indicated that the medicines either improved quality of life in patients or extended their survival, while several studies suggested that the drugs can shorten patients lives when used at high doses. Yesterdays report followed the F.D.A.s decision in March to strengthen warnings on the drugs labels. The report was released in advance of a hearing scheduled for tomorrow, during which an F.D.A. advisory panel will consider whether the drugs are overused. The medicines  Aranesp and Epogen, from Amgen; and Procrit, from Johnson &amp; Johnson  are among the worlds top-selling drugs, with combined sales of $10 billion last year. In this country, they represent the single biggest drug expense for Medicare and are given to about a million patients each year to treat anemia caused by kidney disease or cancer chemotherapy. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said that both patients and doctors would benefit from fuller disclosure about the payments and the profits that doctors can make from them. I suspect that Medicare is going to take a very careful look at what is going on here, he said. Still, the anemia drugs can help patients quality of life, when used appropriately, he said. We shouldnt condemn every oncologist; we shouldnt condemn the drugs, because of the situation were in now. Federal laws bar drug companies from paying doctors to prescribe medicines that are given in pill form and purchased by patients from pharmacies. But companies can rebate part of the price that doctors pay for drugs, like the anemia medicines, which they dispense in their offices as part of treatment. The anemia drugs are injected or given intravenously in physicians offices or dialysis centers. Doctors receive the rebates after they buy the drugs from the companies. But they also receive reimbursement from Medicare or private insurers for the drugs, often at a markup over the doctors purchase price. Medicare has changed its payment structure since 2003 to reduce the markup, but private insurers still often pay more. Combined with those insurance reimbursements, the rebates enable many doctors to profit substantially on the medicines they buy and then give to patients. The rebates are related to the amount of drugs that doctors buy, and physicians that agree to use one companys drugs exclusively typically receive higher rebates. Johnson &amp; Johnson said yesterday in a statement that its rebates were not intended to induce doctors to use more medicine. Instead, the rebates reflect intense competition in the market for the drugs, the company said. Amgen said that rebates were a normal commercial practice and that it had always properly promoted its drugs. Amgen is dedicated to patient safety, said David Polk, a spokesman. We believe our contracts support appropriate anemia management and our product promotion is always strictly within the label. Both companies stocks fell yesterday after release of the F.D.A. report. Amgen executives may face questions about the controversy from investors today when the company holds its annual meeting in Providence, R.I. Since 1991, when the first of the drugs was still relatively new, the average dose given to dialysis patients in this country has nearly tripled. About 50 percent of dialysis patients now receive enough of the drugs to raise their red blood cell counts above the level considered risky by the F.D.A. American patients receive far more of the anemia drugs than patients elsewhere, with dialysis patients in this country getting doses more than twice as high as their counterparts in Europe. Cancer care shows a similar pattern. American cancer patients are about three times as likely as those in Europe to get the drugs, and they receive somewhat higher doses. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/20/business/20amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Trial of Amgen Drug May Dispel Some Safety Concerns<date>Published: April 20, 2007</date><text>In an announcement that could dispel at least some of the recent safety concerns over a widely used class of drugs, Amgen said yesterday that its anemia drug Aranesp did not increase the death rate of lung cancer patients in a closely watched clinical trial. In the trial, which involved 600 patients with small-cell lung cancer who were receiving chemotherapy, there was essentially no difference in survival between those who received Aranesp and those who received a placebo. Amgens stock surged $2.31, or 4 percent, to close at $62.32. The results mean that Amgen has dodged a bullet, analysts said. Had the results shown a safety problem, sales would have plunged. That is not expected to happen now, although some analysts said there were still safety concerns. The drug maker Roche, for instance, has ended a clinical trial with lung cancer patients that compared Aranesp with an anemia drug it is developing because of an unexpected number of deaths in at least some of the treatment groups, a Roche spokeswoman confirmed yesterday. Roche had announced in February that enrollment of new patients had been suspended. But after further review of the data, treatment of already enrolled patients has now also been terminated. That suggests the safety concerns are serious. Aranesp, along with Epogen from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson, are used by nearly a million Americans a year, mainly to treat anemia from kidney disease or cancer chemotherapy. Combined sales of the three drugs were nearly $10 billion last year. Aranesp and Epogen together accounted for $6.6 billion of Amgens $14.3 billion in 2006 revenue. Last month, the Food and Drug Administration imposed strict new warnings on all three drugs after evidence emerged suggesting they could make cancer worse, cause heart problems or hasten death. But some of the evidence, particularly involving cancer, has come from trials that were not specifically set up to study survival, making it more difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the risk. That is why attention has focused on the lung cancer study, which was devised from the outset to measure patients survival. Yesterday, Amgen issued a news release with sketchy details of the trial, known as the 145 study, declining to say more until it announces quarterly earnings on Monday. The release noted that the risk of death was actually reduced by 7 percent in the people who received Aranesp, but the effect was far too small to be statistically significant. Roger M. Perlmutter, Amgens executive vice president for research and development, said in a statement that the results contributed to reinforcing the neutral impact of the anemia drugs on patients survival. But Geoffrey C. Porges, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said it was premature to say Amgen was out of the woods. If the study had been bad, it would have been an unmitigated disaster, Mr. Porges said. But leaping to the conclusion that just because its O.K. in small-cell lung cancer, that makes it O.K. in head and neck cancer and breast cancer and colon cancer is ridiculous. Dr. John A. Glaspy, an oncologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the new results went a long way toward assuaging my concerns, although he said it would be good to see similar results in one or two other types of cancer. Dr. Glaspy, who has received research and consulting fees from Amgen, said the company had chosen small-cell lung cancer for the 145 study because it had reason to believe results would be more favorable than for other types of cancer. Further pressure on Amgen could come from Congress. Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, sent a letter to his House colleagues yesterday urging a change in Medicare to remove incentives for dialysis centers to overuse the anemia drugs. A study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association this week showed that profit-making dialysis centers used significantly more of the drugs than nonprofit centers did. The 145 study was devised in 2001 and 2002 during headier times when Amgen thought it could expand use of Aranesp. The goal was to show that using more of the drug than absolutely necessary to treat anemia could actually help patients live longer. Patients in the study were treated with Aranesp with a goal of raising the levels of hemoglobin  the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells  to 13 to 14 grams per deciliter, even though the recommended level on the drugs label is 12 or less. But as evidence mounted that the drugs could be dangerous, Amgen executives began hoping merely that the 145 trial would not show a negative effect. That is apparently what happened. And the lack of risk seen at the higher hemoglobin levels is likely to reassure doctors about the safety of the drug when it is used less aggressively.

Sharer, the chief executive, said, We can deal with any conceivable revenue scenario I can imagine. Multimedia Graphic Stumbling Blockbusters Until recently, Amgen was still considered one of the biggest success stories of the fast-growing biotechnology industry. Now some analysts are comparing it to a lumbering, stumbling pharmaceutical giant that leans too heavily on an aging product portfolio. A series of setbacks, some unexpected and some perhaps self-inflicted, pose the greatest challenge in the companys previously charmed 27-year history. And some crucial events in coming weeks could make clearer whether Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., has hit some choppy water  as its chief executive contends  or whether, as some analysts say, its best days may be behind it. The barrage of bad news thats come out on Amgen in the past 60 days is absolutely unprecedented in the biotech sector, said Mark Schoenebaum, a biotechnology stock analyst at Bear Stearns. Amgens shares are down about 20 percent since late January, knocking nearly $20 billion off the companys market value. But the stock has edged up a bit since its recent low of $55.13 on March 29, as some investors have been tempted by managements view that it is too soon for a fire sale. Yesterday, the shares rose 62 cents, to $59.65, as details of a study were released suggesting that the risks of the companys biggest drug were not as clear cut as recently thought. We are not in a crisis, thats for sure, Kevin W. Sharer, Amgens chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. In a crisis, people dont know what to do, he said. Peoples hair is on fire. Confidence is challenged. Were not there. At best, though, the company faces plenty of challenges. Several recent studies suggest that its blockbuster anemia drugs, Aranesp and Epogen, might be harming patients, particularly if overused. Those products accounted for $6.6 billion of Amgens $14.3 billion in revenue last year. The Food and Drug Administration put new warnings on the drugs last month, citing studies suggesting that Aranesp and Epogen might cause heart problems or hasten the deaths of cancer patients. Last Wednesday, the company said it would briefly delay the reporting of its first-quarter results, originally scheduled for this week, to allow it to include data from a clinical trial of Aranesp. The financial results are now expected next Monday. The company also disclosed last week that its chief financial officer, Richard D. Nanula, was resigning to pursue other opportunities, but would stay on for three months to aid the transition to his successor, Robert Bradway. Adding to its woes, Amgen recently reported that patients in a clinical trial combining its new colon cancer drug, Vectibix, with other treatments were more likely to die than patients who got only the other treatments. As a result, Vectibix is likely to remain only a niche drug for now. Sizing up Amgens situation in a report titled Looking More Like Large Pharma, a Citigroup analyst, Yaron Werber, predicted that Amgens revenues would grow only 4 percent a year through 2010. That would be well below its 20 percent annual sales growth from 2003 to 2006. Geoffrey C. Porges of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company has asked whether Amgen should start paying a dividend to attract shareholders, an inducement common among big drug companies. And some are even starting to raise questions quietly about Amgens long-vaunted management. Michael Aberman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Mr. Sharers team may have tried to expand the use of its drugs too much, resulting in unsuccessful clinical trials and safety problems that could now endanger sales. Amgen executives say that their strategies have been driven by science and sound medical considerations. And so far, Mr. Sharer said, Amgen has not changed its financial guidance for the year, which calls for 8 percent to 12 percent revenue growth, along with 10 percent to 15 percent growth in earnings per share. The company has mainly reacted to the mounting uncertainty about future sales by taking cost-control steps, imposing a hiring slowdown and postponing the opening of a new factory in Ireland. If sales drop further, Amgen says, more cuts can be made. We certainly have enormous expense flexibility here, Mr. Sharer said. And we can deal with any conceivable revenue scenario I can imagine. Itll either be more or less painful to deal with, but we can certainly deal with it. Just how painful should become clearer in the next few weeks. Next Monday, the company is expected to release the results of a crucial study testing Aranesps effect on the longevity of patients with small-cell lung cancer. Aranesp is approved to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy. If the results from that study indicate that patients taking Aranesp are more likely to die sooner than they might otherwise, the tide will turn against the drugs, said Dr. John A. Glaspy, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. We will not be able to justify treating lots of patients with Aranesp, said Dr. Glaspy, who has received consulting and research fees from Amgen. An F.D.A. advisory committee plans to meet on May 10 to discuss the safety of the anemia drugs. And later that month another big drug maker, Roche, might win F.D.A. approval for an anemia drug that would compete with Amgens products. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/business/12amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Delays on Earnings to Include Study Data<date>Published: April 12, 2007</date><text>Amgen, the biotechnology company, said yesterday that it would delay reporting first-quarter earnings by four days, until Monday, to include data from an eagerly anticipated study of its Aranesp anemia drug among patients with small-cell lung cancer. The company said it would include “top-line results,” meaning important but limited data from the so-called 145 study, which involved patients who had the less common form of lung cancer and were undergoing chemotherapy. Some doctors have expressed concern that anemia drugs like Aranesp, that are forms of the natural protein erythropoietin, may feed the growth of tumors. Industry analysts have called results of the study, which will look at Aranesp’s effect on death rates, critical to future use of Amgen’s most important product. Aranesp had sales of about $4.1 billion last year, and along with its predecessor, Epogen, accounted for about half of Amgen’s sales. Wall Street appears to be bracing for a borderline negative outcome on survival, especially after the Food and Drug Administration last month required a strong new warning on the label of Aranesp and similar anemia drugs, calling on doctors to use the lowest dose that can effectively avoid the need for blood transfusions. “If it shows a very clear mortality trend against Aranesp that would be the strongest result we’ve seen so far on this drug’s safety issues, and that could lead to even stronger warnings and more reduction in use, but I don’t think you will see a huge success or failure from this study,” an analyst at Cowen and Company, Eric Schmidt, said. Shares of Amgen fell 78 cents, to $56.34. Its shares have fallen about 25 percent since mid-January. On Tuesday, Amgen said that its chief financial officer, Richard D. Nanula, was leaving to “pursue other opportunities” and would be succeeded by Robert Bradway, who is a vice president in charge of operations.

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has sent letters to Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, the drugs’ marketers, requesting information about when they knew of possible risks and about how they have promoted the products. The letters also asked them to suspend any consumer advertising of the drugs and any incentive programs for doctors who prescribe them until after the Food and Drug Administration has time to determine whether further safety precautions are necessary. The products  Epogen and Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson  are all forms of erythropoietin, or Epo, a protein made by the human kidney to spur production of red blood cells. The drugs are mainly used to treat the anemia caused by kidney failure or cancer chemotherapy and have combined worldwide sales of roughly $10 billion a year. On March 9, the F.D.A. and the companies agreed to put a “black box” warning, the most serious kind, on the drugs’ labels after new evidence showed the medicines might cause blood clots, worsen cancer or increase the risk of death if overused. In its letters, the lawmakers said they viewed the reports of safety issues “with increasing alarm,” adding that as much as $700 million in annual sales of the three drugs were from uses that did not conform to the label. An F.D.A. advisory panel is scheduled to meet May 10 to further discuss the safety of the drugs. In issuing its warning last week, the F.D.A. said the companies had agreed to suspend direct-to-consumer advertising of the drugs on television and radio until after the advisory committee meeting. David Polk, a spokesman for Amgen, said Wednesday that the company had never directly advertised Epogen or Aranesp to consumers and did not provide financial incentives to doctors. He said the company would cooperate with the inquiry and that it believed the drugs were safe if used in accordance with the label. Kassy McGourty, a spokeswoman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company had not conducted direct-to-consumer advertising for Procrit since 2005. She said the company could not yet comment. The letters, dated Tuesday, were signed by John D. Dingell, the committee’s chairman, and Bart Stupak, the chairman of its Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, both Michigan Democrats. The Republican leaders of the committee and subcommittee did not sign. Mr. Dingell and Mr. Stupak said in the letters that the questions about the anemia drugs were part of a larger inquiry into whether the F.D.A. was adequately protecting the public from the risks of prescription medicines. Many of the questions to the companies were about their communications with the F.D.A. The lawmakers also asked when the companies had learned about suspensions of clinical trials for safety issues and when they had notified the regulators.

He is president of the National Kidney Foundation and director of a government-financed research center on kidney disease. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Drug Company Payments to Doctors In 2004, the year he was chosen as president-elect of the kidney foundation, the pharmaceutical company Amgen, which makes the most expensive drugs used in the treatment of kidney disease, underwrote more than $1.9 million worth of research and education programs led by Dr. Collins, according to records examined by The New York Times. In 2005, Amgen paid Dr. Collins at least $25,800, mostly in consulting and speaking fees, the records show. The payments to Dr. Collins and the research center appear in an unusual set of records. They come from Minnesota, the first of a handful of states to pass a law requiring drug makers to disclose payments to doctors. The Minnesota records are a window on the widespread financial ties between pharmaceutical companies and the doctors who prescribe and recommend their products. Patient advocacy groups and many doctors themselves have long complained that drug companies exert undue influence on doctors, but the extent of such payments has been hard to quantify. The Minnesota records begin in 1997. From then through 2005, drug makers paid more than 5,500 doctors, nurses and other health care workers in the state at least $57 million. Another $40 million went to clinics, research centers and other organizations. More than 20 percent of the states licensed physicians received money. The median payment per consultant was $1,000; more than 100 people received more than $100,000. Doctors receive money typically in return for delivering lectures about drugs to other doctors. Some of the doctors receiving the most money sit on committees that prepare guidelines instructing doctors nationwide about when to use medicines. Dr. Collins, who received more money than anyone else in the state, is among a limited number whose payments financed research. In dozens of interviews, most doctors said that these payments had no effect on their care of patients. Dr. Collins said his sole focus was the health and well-being of patients. Just because I might do consulting work doesnt mean I dont press the agenda of the public health, he said. Ken Johnson, senior vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said interactions between drug companies and doctors were beneficial. In the end, patients are well-served when technically trained pharmaceutical research company representatives work with health care professionals to make sure medicines are used properly, he said. There is nothing illegal about doctors accepting money for marketing talks, and professional organizations have largely ignored the issue. But research shows that doctors who have close relationships with drug makers tend to prescribe more, newer and pricier drugs  whether or not they are in the best interests of patients. When honest human beings have a vested stake in seeing the world in a particular way, theyre incapable of objectivity and independence, said Max H. Bazerman, a professor at Harvard Business School. A doctor who represents a pharmaceutical company will tend to see the data in a slightly more positive light and as a result will overprescribe that companys drugs. In an e-mail message, Dr. Collins said he personally received in 2004 less than $10,000 from Amgen for educational presentations. The contract amount of $1.9 million from Amgen was paid to the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation (MMRF) for the research contract, on which I am the designated senior researcher, Dr. Collins wrote. He wrote that he did not work for or serve on the board of directors of the foundation. Dr. Collins discloses on his Web site and research papers that he is a consultant to Amgen, among other companies. Dan Whelan, an Amgen spokesman, said the company paid the Minneapolis Medical Research Foundation to conduct sophisticated research and data analyses that have enhanced the understanding of health care delivery for kidney patients. But Dr. Daniel Coyne, a kidney specialist at Washington University, said he was troubled by the payments. Amgens funding for Dr. Collinss MMRF is another huge financial connection to individuals at the National Kidney Foundation, Dr. Coyne said. The foundations recent pro-industry anemia guidelines  and the revisions due next month  have to be viewed with great skepticism. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in National »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/15/business/15amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">U.S. to Review Anemia Drugs for Safety<date>Published: March 15, 2007</date><text>Use of the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen, made by Amgen, and Procrit, from Johnson &amp; Johnson, will be reviewed by federal health insurance programs because of concerns that side effects may be harming patients. The study will lead to a determination by the Medicare agency on whether it will continue to pay for use of the drugs. Plans for the review were disclosed in a statement released yesterday in Washington by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The announcement followed the Food and Drug Administration’s disclosure on March 9 that it would require the makers of the three drugs to include stronger warnings about health risks, including death. “We pay close attention to F.D.A. black box warnings because the safety of our Medicare beneficiaries is paramount,” said Leslie V. Norwalk, acting director of the Medicare agency. “We will carefully examine the effect of these labeling changes on Medicare’s policies.” Black boxes are the highest level of warning contained in drug information provided to doctors and patients. The F.D.A. said last week that it was advising doctors to prescribe the lowest doses adequate to help patients avoid blood transfusions necessitated by anemia. Epogen is the single biggest drug expense for Medicare. A review by Medicare is appropriate “in light of the new F.D.A. labeling changes,” said Josh Ofman, the vice president of reimbursement and payment policy at Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif. A call after business hours to Jeff Leebaw, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., was not immediately returned.

Warning Is Issued on Anemia Drugs’ Overuse<date>Published: March 10, 2007</date><text>The Food and Drug Administration issued strict new warnings yesterday about overuse of widely prescribed anemia drugs after a flurry of recent studies suggested they might cause heart problems or hasten the death of cancer patients. The agency said that a “black box” warning  the strongest kind  had been added to the labels of the drugs and that doctors should use the lowest possible dose needed to help patients avoid blood transfusions. It also said it was re-evaluating the validity of claims in the labels and in advertisements that the drugs can raise energy levels or otherwise improve a patient’s quality of life. Almost one million Americans take one of the drugs, which are mostly used to treat anemia caused by kidney failure or chemotherapy. The drugs are darbepoetin alfa, sold as Aranesp by Amgen, and epoetin alfa, sold as Epogen by Amgen and as Procrit by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Both drugs are genetically engineered forms of erythropoietin or Epo, a substance made by the human kidney that increases the production of red blood cells, which ferry oxygen to the body’s tissues. Sales of the drugs worldwide totaled about $10 billion last year, making Epo the most lucrative product ever produced by the biotechnology industry. It is also the largest drug expense for Medicare, which spent $2 billion in 2005 just for the use of Epogen in kidney dialysis patients. The drugs, given by injection, have been heavily advertised, and there is evidence that they have been overused, in part because dialysis centers and oncologists can make money by using more of the drug. But the F.D.A.’s public health advisory yesterday could now mean that physicians are likely to be more restrained in their use of the drugs. “The recommendation that we treat our patients largely to avoid transfusion is a seismic change in our management,” said Dr. Daniel Coyne, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. F.D.A. officials stressed that the drugs’ main safety risks seemed to occur when they were used to raise hemoglobin above 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The labels for the drugs had recommended not exceeding that level, and the new labels emphasize this strongly. Hemoglobin is the component of red blood cells that carry oxygen. Even then, the data showing risks are “very, very preliminary,” but show a consistent enough pattern to merit the new warnings, Dr. Patricia Keegan, an F.D.A. official, told reporters yesterday. The agency’s cancer drug advisory committee will meet in May to further examine the drugs’ safety. Dr. Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, said he “absolutely” stood behind the safety of the products when used properly. Dr. Perlmutter said most physicians were already adhering to the 12-gram level for hemoglobin. But Dr. Coyne of Washington University said the F.D.A.’s new advisory  to use the smallest amount needed to avoid transfusion  would mean aiming for hemoglobin levels of 10 or 11, limiting use of the drugs. Aranesp and Epogen together had sales of $6.6 billion last year, nearly half of Amgen’s total. The company’s stock fell yesterday by $1.31, or 2 percent, to $60.86. It had touched above $75 in late January before the safety concerns intensified. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s stock rose 42 cents to $62.14 yesterday. The company is far bigger than Amgen and much less reliant on Epo. In issuing a public health advisory yesterday, the F.D.A. cited six studies, most of which have come out in the last few months. In one study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November, patients with kidney disease who were aggressively treated with Procrit had more heart problems and deaths than those treated less aggressively. One of Amgen’s own studies showed an increased death rate in cancer patients treated with Aranesp compared with those who got a placebo. The patients in that study had anemia that was presumably caused by their cancer and were not getting chemotherapy. Aranesp is not approved to treat anemia caused by cancer itself, though Amgen has estimated that more than $500 million of the drug’s annual sales are for that use. Yesterday, the American Society of Clinical Oncology sent a note to its members saying that it had learned that Medicare was cutting off reimbursement of Epo for that use, effective immediately. The new warning is also likely to put pressure on Medicare to restrain reimbursement for dialysis use. Critics have accused Medicare of issuing more and more lenient guidelines over the years, thereby encouraging greater use of Epo. In a statement, Medicare said it would “carefully examine our policies.” F.D.A. officials said yesterday that the manufacturers had never demonstrated that use of Epo actually improved energy levels or quality of life for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Rather, the drugs were approved only to reduce the need for blood transfusions. The labels for kidney patient use do contain evidence that the drugs can improve energy as well as sleep, eating, sex life and a range of other things. However, F.D.A. officials said they would re-evaluate the evidence for those claims since techniques for measuring how a drug affects quality of life have improved since those drugs were approved. Epogen was first approved for kidney disease use in 1989, and Procrit for cancer use in 1993. Dr. George Rodgers, a hematologist at the University of Utah, said that “the consensus of most people is that the drugs do improve the patients’ quality of life,” and that this was generally seen when hemoglobin levels were raised to 11 to 12. “Right now I don’t know if physicians are going to drastically change their behavior based on this data,” he said. Dr. Rodgers, who has consulted for Amgen, is chairman of a committee that develops anemia treatment guidelines for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an organization of major cancer centers.

Asks Amgen About Anemia Drug<date>Published: March 1, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 (AP)  Amgen said Wednesday that it had received an informal inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission seeking more information about a Danish study of the company’s Aranesp anemia drug. Researchers halted the study to assess Aranesp’s potential as a treatment for head and neck cancer in October after concluding that it probably would not have a positive outcome. The Atlanta bureau of the S.E.C. asked Amgen to voluntarily provide information and documentation related to the study. Amgen, which disclosed the request in its annual report filed with the S.E.C., said it would cooperate fully with the request. In a separate press release Wednesday, Amgen said it intended to provide an update on Aranesp trials at a meeting in May of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee. Last month, Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said a separate study of Aranesp showed an increased risk of death in people with anemia possibly caused by cancer, compared with a placebo treatment. Aranesp, which had more than $4 billion in sales during 2006, is approved to treat anemia associated with chemotherapy and kidney dialysis.

The drugs, sold by Amgen, Roche and Johnson &amp; Johnson, are used to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy and meant to reduce the need for blood transfusions and give patients more energy. But the new results suggest that the drugs may make the cancer itself worse. In the studies, the drugs have generally been used in ways not approved on the labels. And the companies say that, when used according to instructions, the drugs have a long history of safety. In a statement yesterday, Amgen said it strongly believed its drugs were safe and effective medicines when used in approved populations consistent with label dosing recommendations. Nevertheless, some cancer specialists and securities analysts say the new information may make doctors more cautious in using the drugs, which have combined sales for the three companies exceeding $11 billion and have been heavily promoted through efforts that include television commercials. These are drugs that were presumed to be entirely safe, given for supportive care and to improve quality of life, not to actually treat cancer, said Dr. Eric Winer, director of breast oncology center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. So any concern that they could shorten someones life are taken quite seriously. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to convene an advisory committee meeting to review the products, Dr. Richard Pazdur, the agencys director for cancer drugs, said in an e-mail message last week alerting cancer doctors to the new findings. All the drugs are versions of erythropoietin, or Epo, a substance made by the human kidney that increases levels of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. Amgen makes Aranesp, with sales of $4.1 billion last year, as well as Epogen, which had sales of $2.5 billion, although Epogen is supposed to be used only to treat anemia in kidney dialysis patients. Under license from Amgen, Johnson &amp; Johnson sells Procrit in the United States and Eprex abroad, with combined sales last year of $3.2 billion. Roches drugs NeoRecormon and Epogin, now sold only outside the United States, had sales last year of $1.8 billion. But Roche is hoping to enter the American market with a new drug called Cera. Amgen has the most to lose from any setback because it relies more heavily on the Epo drugs, which account for nearly half its revenue. Amgens stock touched above $75 briefly in late January, before word of the negative studies began emerging. The shares closed yesterday at $66.20, down 3 cents. The new doubts about cancer safety add to those raised recently regarding the drugs other major use  to treat anemia caused by kidney disease. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November found that patients treated aggressively with Procrit had a higher risk of heart problems or death than those treated less aggressively. The run of bad news for cancer treatment started in late January when Amgen announced that in one of its clinical trials, patients getting Aranesp were more likely to die than those getting placebo. The trial was testing the drug in patients whose anemia was caused by the cancer itself, not by chemotherapy. On Feb. 16, the Cancer Letter, an influential Washington newsletter, reported that a Danish study in patients with head and neck cancer had been stopped early because the cancer seemed to recur more in patients being treated with Aranesp. Last week, The Journal of Clinical Oncology published a paper online describing a small Canadian trial in lung cancer patients that had been stopped early because those getting Eprex were dying sooner. And on Friday, Roche said it was suspending patient enrollment in a lung cancer trial comparing its Cera against Amgens Aranesp because of apparently greater than expected number of deaths in at least some of the arms of the trial. It is not known why the drugs cause problems, if they do. It is known that raising hemoglobin levels too high increases the risk of blood clots. And most of these new trials did aim to increase hemoglobin above the levels recommended in the drugs labels, though that was not the case with Amgens own trial. But there is some evidence that clots were not the problem in these trials. Rather, some experts say, Epo may spur tumor growth. Some studies suggest that certain tumor cells, such as those in head and neck cancer, have proteins on their surface that bind to Epo. When that happens it sets off a cascade of reactions spurring growth. I think theres enough biologic plausibility to the argument that they can serve as a growth factor for the cancer cell, said Dr. Jennifer R. Grandis, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has done studies of the matter. She said the head and neck cancer practice at her institution does not routinely use Epo and that she would not want it herself. But Dr. David P. Steensma at the Mayo Clinic, who has reviewed studies of Epo safety, said the existence of Epo receptors on tumors had not been proved because the studies have been flawed. He said that there have been previous studies of the drugs that suggested they actually had a positive effect on survival. A combined analysis of 57 trials concluded the impact of the drugs on survival was uncertain. Dr. Steensma said he was still comfortable using the drugs to correct severe anemia, but added, I think we need to be real careful about going beyond that. Concerns about the safety of the drugs for cancer were first raised in 2003 by two studies that showed patients getting Epo had worse outcomes. But some experts said those studies were flawed and not convincing.

The development was reported in The Cancer Letter, which said the study was temporarily halted in October after an interim analysis of the first 484 patients turned up a statistically significant increase in disease recurrence. It said a decision not to resume the study was made on Dec. 1. Amgen said it had not seen the complete data from the study, which was conducted by the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group, but added that it informed the Food and Drug Administration of the trial's suspension within 24 hours of receiving preliminary data. An Amgen spokeswoman said the company received only preliminary and incomplete safety data and does not usually comment on third-party reports. Amgen previously revealed a statistically significant increased risk of death in a different study of cancer patients not undergoing chemotherapy who were treated with Aranesp.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/26/business/26amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Finds Anemia Drug Holds Risks in Cancer Use<date>Published: January 26, 2007</date><text>LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25  Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Thursday that its anemia drug Aranesp increased the risk of death when used to treat certain cancer patients, a finding that will probably raise more questions about it and similar drugs. Almost one million Americans a year receive prescriptions for Aranesp or one of two similar products  Epogen from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Combined global sales of the three products, which increase the number of oxygen-carrying red cells in the blood, are around $10 billion. But concern has been rising about the risks from overuse of the drugs. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in November found that kidney disease patients treated aggressively with Procrit had a 34 percent higher risk of heart problems or death than those treated less aggressively. An expert panel of doctors for the National Kidney Foundation is now assessing whether to change guidelines for how patients should be treated. The latest trial was an attempt by Amgen to expand the use of Aranesp to a new group of patients: those with anemia presumably caused by their cancer. Aranesp is now approved to treat anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy but not by the cancer itself. The 1,000 patients in the trial had active cancer, meaning they were not in remission, but were not getting chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The goal of the trial was to see if Aranesp could reduce the need for blood transfusions, which anemic people frequently require. The company found that the drug did not reduce the need for transfusions compared with a placebo, but did increase the number of deaths by the end of 16 weeks by a statistically significant amount. Amgen, which did not provide any numerical results from the trial, said in a news release that in this particular population the “risk/benefit ratio for Aranesp use is at best neutral and perhaps negative.” While such use of Aranesp is not approved, doctors do use it off label for that purpose. On a conference call Thursday with securities analysts, George Morrow, Amgen’s executive vice president for global commercial operations, estimated that about 10 percent to 12 percent of Aranesp sales are for such “anemia of cancer.” Amgen announced the results of the trial along with its fourth-quarter earnings after the close of trading. The company’s shares fell by $2.37, or 3 percent, to $72.48 in after-hours trading, after closing in regular trading at $74.85, down 29 cents. Several factors could have contributed to the shares’ decline besides the trial results. Amgen’s earnings per share, excluding special items, while up 20 percent for the quarter, were below analyst estimates. The company also announced somewhat disappointing results in a clinical trial involving Vectibix, its recently approved colon cancer drug. Still, some analysts on the conference call were clearly concerned that the Aranesp results could lead to a cutback in use of Aranesp and Epogen. The two drugs accounted for $6.6 billion, or 46 percent, of Amgen’s $14.3 billion in 2006 revenue. Amgen executives said that the trial was not intended to measure survival, so it was possible that the patients in the group that received Aranesp might have had a greater risk of dying to begin with than those in the placebo group. They said the results could not be extrapolated to other types of patients, like those getting chemotherapy or those with kidney disease. Still, Kevin Sharer, Amgen’s chief executive, conceded it was possible that the growing concerns over safety could lead to the drugs’ being given a black-box warning, the strongest kind. In 2003 Johnson &amp; Johnson halted several studies of Procrit in cancer patients after they developed a higher-than-expected number of blood clots. In those trials, doctors were trying to treat the anemia more aggressively in hopes that an increase in oxygen in the blood would increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

One sign of that is the sluggish sales of drugs for psoriasis. Skip to next paragraph Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times Remicade won regulatory approval for psoriasis in September. When the biotech industry began rolling out psoriasis drugs a few years ago, experts heralded the new medications as safer, more effective treatments for the skin disease. And the companies  Amgen, Genentech and Biogen Idec, arguably the industry’s best-known firms  forecast a repeat of the success they have had with similarly priced drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and cancer. But they may have overestimated the medical establishment’s willingness to spend $10,000 to $35,000 a year on treatments for psoriasis, a condition that is often, though incorrectly, perceived as merely a cosmetic problem. Many insurers are insisting that psoriasis patients try older, cheaper therapies first before approving reimbursement of a biotech drug, frustrating some doctors and patients. Dr. Mark G. Lebwohl, chairman of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and a consultant to many of the drug developers, said he grew so frustrated he had sought help from the New York attorney general’s office on a number of occasions to persuade insurance companies to pay for the drugs. The tactic usually worked, he said. Price is not the only barrier. Dermatologists, many of whom prefer doing lucrative Botox procedures to treating psoriasis, worry about the side effects of the drugs, not to mention the vexation of trying to help patients seek insurance reimbursement. “In today’s market I can see four acne patients in the time I see one patient on biologics,”’ said Dr. William Abramovits, a professor of dermatology at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, referring to the biotech psoriasis drugs, which he prescribes despite the obstacles. Even many patients seem to have little enthusiasm for the drugs, which users typically take by injecting themselves as often as twice a week. “Have drugs, need patients,”’ said Dr. Craig Leonardi, a St. Louis dermatologist who is a consultant to many of the drug developers. Amgen, which sells the field’s leader, Enbrel, estimates there are 1.1 million Americans with severe enough psoriasis to warrant one of the biotechnology drugs, which are called biologics because they are manufactured in cultures of living cells. But the company estimates that only about 60,000 people are using one of the drugs. Psoriasis can be far more than the bad case of dandruff that might come to mind for people old enough to recall a vintage shampoo commercial that lamented “the heartbreak of psoriasis.” An autoimmune disease, in which the body’s defenses mistakenly attack the skin, psoriasis is marked by red, scaly patches that can be itchy or painful. And because of its potential impact on a patient’s social or sexual life, psoriasis can cause severe emotional distress. In some cases the condition is linked to a joint disease known as psoriatic arthritis. The sluggish sales of the biotech drugs have already started taking a toll on their makers. Biogen Idec, which introduced the first biologic for psoriasis in 2003, has already given up, divesting its drug to Astellas Pharma, a Japanese pharmaceutical company. The drug, Amevive, had sales of only $48.5 million in 2005. Raptiva from Genentech, which was approved later in 2003, had $90 million in sales last year, up 14 percent from 2005. That makes the drug a laggard by that company’s standards. Its new eye drug, Lucentis, for instance, had $153 million in sales in just its first three months on the market. Raptiva’s sluggish sales have also dashed the hopes of Xoma, a small company that helped develop the drug and had hoped to become profitable from its share of the proceeds. Both Amevive and Raptiva lost out to Enbrel, which many doctors perceive as more effective. But even Enbrel is “not meeting expectations, despite considerable effort,” George Morrow, an executive vice president at Amgen, told analysts recently. Enbrel sales in North America did rise 10 percent in the first nine months of last year, to $2.1 billion. But that is down from 35 percent growth in 2005 and is likely to leave 2006 sales less than $3 billion, a figure Amgen had originally expected to reach by 2005. Wyeth helps market the drug in North America and handles overseas sales by itself. One reason for the slowdown is that Enbrel is losing market share for its main use  as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, a different autoimmune disease, which accounts for as much as 70 percent of its sales. But another factor is slow growth of the psoriasis market, which accounts for much of the rest. Amgen is trying to underline the seriousness of the disease with television commercials using the theme “Enough is enough.” The ads do not mention Enbrel by name. A previous commercial that did was withdrawn in 2005 after the Food and Drug Administration warned that the ad  which featured actors with perfect skin frolicking on the beach  exaggerated the drug’s effectiveness and underplayed its risks. Adhering to voluntary industry guidelines, Amgen is discussing with the F.D.A. proposed new ads that mention Enbrel. Manufacturers say they remain enthusiastic, though. And indeed, the market is getting more crowded. A Johnson &amp; Johnson drug, Remicade, already used for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, won approval for psoriasis in September. Humira, from Abbott Laboratories, is approved for psoriatic arthritis and is now being tested for psoriasis itself. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/business/03drug.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Acquires Option for a Heart Failure Drug<date>Published: January 3, 2007</date><text>Making a further move into the market for cardiovascular drugs, the biotechnology giant Amgen has formed an alliance with Cytokinetics, a smaller company developing an experimental drug to treat heart failure. Skip to next paragraph Under the agreement, which is expected to be announced this morning, Amgen will pay Cytokinetics $75 million to gain an option on the drug, which is about to enter the second of three stages of clinical trials. Cytokinetics, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif., could eventually receive additional payments of more than $600 million, plus royalties, if the drug reaches the market and has significant sales. Amgen does not sell any drugs for heart diseases, but it is in late-stage trials of an anemia drug, Aranesp, as a treatment for heart failure. One uncertainty, however, is that a recent study in kidney disease patients showed overuse of drugs like Aranesp could actually cause heart problems. About five million Americans suffer from heart failure, in which the heart does not pump blood adequately. The disease is the leading cause of hospitalization among those over 65. Dr. Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, said his company had become intrigued with Cytokinetics approach. Its not been an area where theres been an enormous number of mechanistically new opportunities, Dr. Perlmutter said. The drug, called CK-1827452, activates cardiac myosin, a protein that plays a central role in making heart muscles contract to pump blood. The drug has not been tested in anyone with heart failure, only in healthy volunteers in Phase 1 studies designed primarily to test safety. But the president of Cytokinetics, Robert I. Blum, said the drug did increase heart-contracting ability in the volunteers and worked in dogs with heart failure. The agreements terms reflect the uncertainty that the drug will get to market. Amgens $75 million initial payment gives it only an option on the drug. After additional trials Amgen would have the right to take over development and commercialization of the drug for a payment of $50 million. The initial $75 million payment will consist of $42 million in cash and the purchase of $33 million in Cytokinetics stock, giving Amgen roughly 7 percent of the smaller company. Amgen will pay $9.47 a share, a 27 percent premium to Cytokinetics closing price on Friday.

The Medicare insurance program for the elderly and disabled pays for the anemia drug, Epogen by Amgen, at the average sales price plus a 6 percent premium. Payment for kidney dialysis is separate. This is a recipe for disaster, said Dennis J. Cotter, head of the research group Medical Technology and Practice Patterns Institute Inc., saying it allowed the drug payments to become a revenue stream for providers. Instead, Medicare should lump the price of anemia drugs with overall payments for kidney dialysis services, Mr. Cotter and other specialists told the House Ways and Means Committee. Increasing the dialysis portion of bundled payments would encourage doctors to use only enough of the drug to help patients, without losing money. Congress called for payment changes under the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003. The agency said it had begun research but had not yet acted. I believe Congress will move if you dont, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the committee, warned Medicare officials at the hearing. Democrats, who will take over Congress in January, were also supporting payment changes at the hearing. Medicare, which pays for more than 90 percent of all dialysis treatment in the United States, spent $2 billion on the treatment in 2005, according to the Government Accountability Office. The agency also said Medicare should bundle anemia drug and dialysis services payments. Infused or injected medicines like Epogen are covered under a Medicare provision for drugs administered in doctors offices or clinics. They are not part of the agencys new prescription drug benefit known as Part D. Patients with kidney failure need regular dialysis to help clear their blood of wastes. Anemia, a shortage of red blood cells or the iron-rich protein hemoglobin, is a common side effect of the condition and can cause fatigue and headaches. Lawmakers criticized what they considered Medicares policy for encouraging excessive Epogen use. Medical experts testified that current practice has promoted aggressive drug treatment to achieve high blood hemoglobin levels, but recent studies show that can lead to heart complications or death. Leslie V. Norwalk, the acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said she supported combining drug and dialysis payments but said current policy gives physicians flexibility to monitor patients and adjust dosing. The agency is to present its research report to Congress next summer. Analysts say they do not expect any major reimbursement changes soon, but any action to curb anemia drug payments could lead investors to be cautious about Amgen.

The decision to convene the panel comes two weeks after studies in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that kidney patients whose anemia was more aggressively treated were more likely to die or suffer heart problems than those who were allowed to remain more anemic. As a result, the panel, which will meet early next year, may recommend less aggressive treatment of anemia, potentially hurting sales for Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which market the drugs, which are among the worlds best-selling prescription medicines. There are substantial sums of money involved here, said Kerry Willis, vice president for medical and scientific activities of the National Kidney Foundation. The foundation, in response to a reporters question, confirmed the panels plans to meet. The panels recommendations would not have the force of law. But they are certain to be closely watched by kidney doctors as well as administrators of the federal Medicare program, which is by far the largest buyer of the drugs worldwide. Sold under the brand names Epogen, Procrit, and Aranesp, the anemia drugs will reach almost $10 billion in sales worldwide in 2006. Medicare will spend $2 billion on them for kidney dialysis patients alone, and a similar amount for cancer patients and patients with kidney disease not yet on dialysis. Nearly one million Americans, including 500,000 kidney patients, receive the drugs every year. But some independent scientists say they believe that kidney patients are receiving too much of the drugs, in part because dialysis clinics make bigger profits for providing higher doses. The clinics make little profit on the actual dialysis services they provide for Medicare enrollees, who are the vast majority of dialysis patients. The foundations panel will probably meet in January or early February and could release new treatment recommendations for public review a few weeks later, the foundation said. The anemia panel consists of 15 nephrologists who meet under the auspices of the foundation, a private nonprofit group based in New York that provides financing for kidney researchers. The panel is one of several panels sponsored by the foundation that make recommendations about how to improve treatment for kidney patients. But some scientists complain that Amgen has until now had too much influence on the creation of the foundations guidelines. The most recent version of the anemia guidelines, released earlier this year, encourages more aggressive treatment than the Food and Drug Administration recommends. The guidelines are funded through the National Kidney Foundation by industry, by and large, said Dr. Daniel Coyne, professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. They write guidelines that are opinion-based, by and large, and favor industry or would appear to favor industry. While Amgen sponsors the creation of the guidelines and donated $4 million to the foundation last year, both the foundation and the company say that the company does not control which doctors are chosen for the panel or influence their choice of treatment. Dr. Rob Brenner, senior director of medical affairs at Amgen, said the company had always promoted use of its drugs in accordance with the more cautious F.D.A. label, not the more aggressive guidelines created by the foundation. The anemia drugs are proteins that stimulate bone marrow cells to produce hemoglobin, the main component of red blood cells. They must be given via injection, either intravenously or through the skin. The original drug, called epoetin, is made by Amgen, which markets it under the brand name Epogen. Johnson &amp; Johnson sells the identical drug, also produced by Amgen, as Procrit. The other drug, darbepoetin, is sold under the name Aranesp. It was introduced in 2001 by Amgen and is a slightly modified version of epoetin that can be given less frequently. Neither the National Kidney Foundation panel nor the F.D.A. suggest how much of the drugs patients should receive. Instead, they have guidelines for hemoglobin targets in the blood. In general, healthy adults have hemoglobin levels of 14 grams or more per deciliter of blood, while patients are considered to need treatment if their levels are below 10 grams. Severe anemia can be devastating, leaving patients unable to work, walk for more than a few minutes, or even think clearly, while also increasing their risk of infection and heart disease. But high levels of hemoglobin can cause high blood pressure, strokes and heart attacks, even in healthy adults. Now some scientists say they believe that kidney doctors need to become more conservative about treating anemia, which probably means using less of the drugs. The prescribing label for Epogen, as approved by the F.D.A., says dialysis patients should have a target hemoglobin level of 10 to 12 grams per deciliter of blood. In its most recent guideline, the panel of doctors overseen by the kidney foundation said a target of 11 to 13 grams was appropriate. It is that target that will now be under review. In practice, almost all dialysis patients receive the drugs, and almost none have hemoglobin levels below 11 grams after treatment. About half have levels of more than 12 grams, according to data from the United States Renal Data System, a federally sponsored group that monitors kidney patient care. Almost 20 percent of patients have levels above 13 grams. The differences may seem small, but one of the studies published in The New England Journal found that patients treated to an average hemoglobin level of 12.6 grams had a 34 percent higher risk of death or serious heart problems than those treated to a level of 11.3 grams. And the average patient at the higher level required about twice as much of the anemia drug to get to that level.

Skip to next paragraph Jay Mallin/Bloomberg News Billy Tauzin, who heads a lobbying group for drug companies, speaks of new political realities. Hoping to prevent Congress from letting the government negotiate lower drug prices for millions of older Americans on Medicare, the pharmaceutical companies have been recruiting Democratic lobbyists, lining up allies in the Bush administration and Congress, and renewing ties with organizations of patients who depend on brand-name drugs. Many drug company lobbyists concede that the House is likely to pass a bill intended to drive down drug prices, but they are determined to block such legislation in the Senate. If that strategy fails, they are counting on President Bush to veto any bill that passes. With 49 Republicans in the Senate next year, the industry is confident that it can round up the 34 votes normally needed to uphold a veto. While that showdown is a long way off, the drug companies are not wasting time. They began developing strategy last week at a meeting of the board of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Billy Tauzin, president of that group, a lobbying organization for brand-name drug companies, recently urged Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, to seek a position as chairman of a powerful House subcommittee, said Karen Johnson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Towns. The subcommittee has authority over Medicare and the Food and Drug Administration. Democrats have yet to decide who will head the subcommittee. Mr. Tauzin, a former congressman, also met with Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who has been trying for six years to allow drug imports from Canada. The industry vehemently opposes such legislation. James C. Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, another trade group, said, There is a lot of pent-up animosity among Democrats against the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Greenwood, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, said he had a list of 37 Congressional Democrats whom he intended to call in the next month. Amgen, the biotechnology company, recently disclosed that it had retained as a lobbyist George C. Crawford, a former chief of staff for Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is in line to become speaker in January and has said that the House will immediately take up legislation authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. The 2003 Medicare law prohibits the federal government from negotiating drug prices or establishing a list of preferred drugs. Amgen is also seeking strategic advice from the Glover Park Group, a consulting firm whose founders include Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for President Bill Clinton. Other major drug companies have been snatching up Democratic former-aides-turned-lobbyists. Merck recently has hired Peter Rubin, a former aide to Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, one of the more liberal House Democrats. Cephalon has hired Kim Zimmerman, a health policy aide to Senator Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat of Nebraska. The Biotechnology Industry Organization has retained Paul T. Kim, a former aide to two influential Democrats, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California. A Medicare expert who works for House Democrats said he recently received three job offers in one day from the drug industry, by telephone and in person. At a dinner last week at the Hotel Monaco here, as part of their board meeting, pharmaceutical executives dissected the midterm election results with experts including Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, and Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a political newsletter. Drug makers have not set a budget for their campaign. They and their trade groups already spend some $100 million a year on lobbying in Washington. We have new political realities to attend to, Mr. Tauzin said in an interview after the board meeting. We and our allies will do everything we can to defend the Medicare drug benefit, to get out the message that it is working. To reinforce that message, drug companies plan to mobilize beneficiaries and urge them to contact Congress. Im putting my trust in beneficiaries, said Mr. Tauzin, who represented Louisiana in the House for more than two decades, first as a Democrat and then as a Republican. Several recent surveys suggest that at least three-fourths of the people with Medicare drug coverage are satisfied. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who hopes to head the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said price negotiations for Medicare were his priority. The 2003 Medicare law was essentially written by the drug industry, Mr. Pallone said in an interview. Thats why you dont have negotiated prices. Republican policies have served special interests like the pharmaceutical industry, and the American taxpayer is paying the price. Drug lobbyists believe that the Senate will be receptive to their argument that price negotiations lead inevitably to price controls, and to restrictions on access to drugs, likely to be unpopular with beneficiaries. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Washington »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/23/business/23drug.html?ref=amgeninc">J.&amp; J. Loses Injunction Bid<date>Published: November 23, 2006</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson lost a bid in a federal court to block Amgen, the world’s biggest biotechnology company, from providing discounts on its Aranesp anemia treatment while an antitrust lawsuit proceeds. Judge Stanley R. Chesler of Federal District Court in New Jersey denied a preliminary injunction requested by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Ortho Biotech unit, which makes Procrit, the only other drug approved in the United States for chemotherapy-induced anemia. The ruling allows Amgen to continue the discounts for what it considers its “best customers,” while Johnson &amp; Johnson pursues the suit. Amgen developed the drug, which stimulates the growth of red blood cells, and in 1985 licensed it exclusively to Johnson &amp; Johnson for treatment of anemia not caused by kidney disease. Johnson &amp; Johnson complained in the lawsuit, filed in 2005, that Amgen competed improperly by offering discounts to cancer clinics that bundled Aranesp purchases with two Amgen drugs for stimulating the growth of white blood cells, Neulasta and Neupogen. Johnson &amp; Johnson has no product in that category. In Washington, meanwhile, Amgen lost a bid to persuade an appeals court to reconsider part of a lawsuit over the anemia drug Dynepo, marketed by the British drug maker Shire. The court rejected the request yesterday, saying that one of Amgen’s patents was not infringed and sending another patent back to a trial court for further action. Amgen did not challenge rulings in the same case that said Dynepo infringed on two other Amgen patents. The ruling keeps the Shire drug out of the United States market. Analysts are watching the case because of a dispute over another anemia drug. Amgen is using these four and two other patents in a legal battle to keep Roche Holding from introducing an anemia medicine called Cera.

Almost a million Americans a year receive prescriptions for the drug, known as epoetin, or darbepoetin, a closely related drug also used in anemia treatment. Worldwide, sales of the two drugs  sold under the brand names Epogen, Procrit and Aranesp  topped $9 billion last year for Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, their makers. Researchers for the study, to be published in The New England Journal of Medicine, divided anemic patients with kidney disease into two groups. One group received epoetin with a goal of almost fully correcting their anemia, a lack of red blood cells associated with fatigue and shortness of breath. The others were allowed to remain more anemic and generally received less epoetin. Patients in the first group were 34 percent more likely to die or suffer heart problems than those in the second. Dr. Ajay Singh, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the study’s lead author, said the results were surprising and should encourage doctors to treat anemia less aggressively. The study tested anemia in kidney patients who did not yet need dialysis, a mechanical blood-filtering technique used to keep alive patients whose kidneys have almost entirely failed. But its findings should apply to patients on dialysis as well, Dr. Singh said. The findings reinforce mounting concerns that kidney patients may be receiving too much epoetin, in part because dialysis clinics make bigger profits for providing larger doses. Studies show that the clinics make little, if any, profit on the actual dialysis services they provide for Medicare patients, who are the vast majority of patients. The amount of epoetin received by the typical American dialysis patient has nearly tripled since the early 1990s. The average patient now gets epoetin doses similar to those given to the first group in Dr. Singh’s study. Death rates for dialysis patients are higher in the United States than in Europe, where doses are comparable to the second group’s, although doctors say other factors may also explain the difference. About 22 percent of American patients die every year, compared with about 15 percent in Europe. Dr. Singh said his study, with a second trial with similar results also to be published today in The New England Journal, did not necessarily prove that epoetin use was harmful. But the studies show that the anemia of many patients is being overcorrected and that doctors should aim for lower levels of red blood cells in their patients, he said. The simplest way to do that would be to give patients less epoetin. Susan Cruzan, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency was aware of the study results and would evaluate the data. She noted that Epogen’s label already offered advice for doctors. The F.D.A., she said, will release a more complete advisory today. Amgen, which sells epoetin under the brand name Epogen and darbepoetin under the name Aranesp, said its drugs had been a boon for people with anemia and are properly used in the vast majority of patients. In fact, anemia may be undertreated in cancer and kidney patients, scientists at Amgen argue. Amgen said it was committed to the safety of its drugs and was conducting a clinical trial to study Aranesp in 4,000 kidney patients. But some scientists say that trial will not settle the most crucial issue about epoetin and darbepoetin: whether the drugs are routinely overused. In the first nine months of 2006, Amgen sold $4.9 billion of Aranesp and Epogen, accounting for almost half its revenue. Sales of the two drugs rose almost 15 percent compared with the period in 2005. Johnson &amp; Johnson, which sells epoetin under the brand names Procrit in the United States and Eprex everywhere else, reported sales of $2.4 billion in the first nine months of 2006, down slightly from 2005. Epoetin, a naturally occurring protein produced mainly in the kidneys, stimulates bone marrow cells to produce hemoglobin, the main component of red blood cells. Darbepoetin, which was introduced in 2001, is a version of epoetin that has been slightly modified so that it does not need to be given as frequently. Both drugs are given via injection. Since epoetin was approved in 1989, it has become a standard treatment for more than 90 percent of dialysis patients in the United States, and it is increasingly used for patients with earlier-stage kidney disease. The drug is also widely used for cancer patients, who often suffer from anemia as a side effect of chemotherapy. Some cancers can also cause anemia on their own. Many kidney and cancer doctors and patients say epoetin has greatly improved the lives of people receiving dialysis or chemotherapy. Severe anemia can be debilitating, leaving patients unable to work, walk for over a few minutes or even think clearly, as well as increasing their risk of infection and heart disease. Before epoetin, blood transfusions were the only effective treatment for anemia. But transfusions carry a risk of infection and can eventually prevent patients from receiving transplants. For most patients, epoetin appeared a safe alternative. “The drug in and of itself has really advanced care for patients, so that they’re able to go back to do the things that they previously couldn’t,” said Kris Robinson, the executive director of the American Association of Kidney Patients and a kidney transplant recipient. “It makes a huge difference.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/20amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Kidney Dialysis Center Deal With Amgen Blocks Roche<date>Published: October 20, 2006</date><text>In a move that could help preserve its lucrative monopoly on an important anemia drug, Amgen has reached an agreement that will make it the sole supplier of the drug to one of the nation’s two main operators of kidney dialysis centers. The deal, announced yesterday by the dialysis provider, Fresenius Medical Care, comes as Roche is preparing to enter the market next year with a drug that would offer the first competition to Amgen’s drug, which is known as Epogen. Now, it appears, Roche will not be able to sell its drug to Fresenius, which represents about 35 percent of the American dialysis market. Some analysts said the deal, which lasts for five years, could raise antitrust concerns. “We would use an analogy of Microsoft signing an exclusive supply agreement with Dell precluding Dell from selling any computers with a competitive operating system a few months before a market entry of a competitor,” Michael Aberman, biotechnology analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote yesterday in a note to clients. Dr. Aberman said in an interview that a deal with Fresenius alone might not attract concern. But if Amgen were to arrange a similar exclusive supply agreement with DaVita, the other major provider of dialysis, with about 30 percent of the market, it would draw attention. Marie Fay, an Amgen spokeswoman, said the company did not think the deal presented any antitrust issues. She said that Fresenius had approached Amgen, not the other way around, about having a broader collaboration. Still, the deal comes as Amgen’s marketing practices are drawing increasing scrutiny. Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has asked the Government Accountability Office to do a report on pricing and other aspects of drugs used for dialysis patients. Medicare, which pays most expenses for dialysis, even for people younger than 65, is estimated to spend roughly $2 billion a year on Epogen, representing one of its biggest expenditures on any drug. Epogen had $2.5 billion in sales last year. It and Aranesp, a similar drug that also is used to treat anemia, together accounted for nearly half of Amgen’s overall $12.4 billion in revenue last year. Both drugs are synthetic forms of erythropoietin, also called EPO, a protein normally made in the kidney that spurs the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Epogen, approved in 1989, was Amgen’s first product and helped transform the company into the world’s largest biotechnology concern. While the basic patent protecting the product has already expired in Europe, Amgen got several patents in the United States, which could protect its franchise here until 2015. Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company, has developed CERA, a form of EPO it says can be given less frequently than Amgen’s drugs. Roche is expected to begin selling the drug next year, assuming approval by the Food and Drug Administration. To block Roche, Amgen has filed a patent infringement suit against it in federal District Court in Boston. Roche said its drug did not infringe on the patent. The deal with Fresenius, which is based in Germany, could provide further protection to Amgen. Dr. Ben Lipps, chief executive of Fresenius, said that his company “selected Amgen as our sole supplier based on more than 10 years of demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety with Epogen.” Analysts said Fresenius probably used the looming threat from Roche to extract a bigger discount from Amgen in return for making it the sole supplier.

The move by Amgen appeared to be both a competitive strategy and an acknowledgment of recent public concerns about the costs of some of the newest cancer drugs, which run tens of thousands of dollars a year. “Given the nature of scrutiny now on oncology therapeutics,” Jim Daly, the senior vice president for North American commercial operations, said in an interview, “we thought the best policy was a meaningful discount on Erbitux.” Still, Vectibix will cost $4,000 for an infusion every two weeks, or more than $100,000 for a year’s treatment, though most of the patients for whom the drug is approved are expected to survive only a few months. Dr. Leonard B. Saltz, a colon cancer specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said: “I don’t think this solves the problem in any way, shape or form in terms of the ridiculous price of chemotherapy drugs. It is a baby step in the right direction.” Amgen also announced a limit on patients’ out-of-pocket expenditures on co-payments. If those exceed 5 percent of a patient’s adjusted gross income, he or she could get the drug free from then on. Vectibix, or panitumumab, is the first drug from Amgen that attacks tumors directly. The company sells billions of dollars a year worth of drugs that treat the side effects of chemotherapy. Amgen gained full rights to Vectibix with its $2.2 billion acquisition of Abgenix this year. The Food and Drug Administration approved Vectibix as essentially a last-resort treatment for late-stage colorectal cancer, after other drugs have failed. In a clinical trial, Vectibix delayed the worsening of cancer by about five weeks compared with supportive care to ease pain and suffering. But it did not increase overall survival, according to the F.D.A. Both Vectibix and Erbitux, which is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone, render inactive a growth-stimulating protein on tumor cells called the epidermal growth-factor receptor. The main advantage of Vectibix, doctors say, is that it causes fewer dangerous allergic reactions than Erbitux. Erbitux, though, is approved for a broader range of uses. Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Company, estimated that Vectibix could eventually achieve annual sales in a range of $500 million to $2 billion. He said the price of Erbitux might now have to come down to match that of Vectibix. He also said that Amgen’s pricing was as expected. “Amgen doesn’t want to be a charity,” he said, “And if others are getting away with it and they can price at a modest discount instead of a substantial discount, why not?” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/21/business/21drug.html?ref=amgeninc">Drug Makers Beat Estimates on Generally Strong Sales<date>Published: July 21, 2006</date><text>Drug makers posted second-quarter earnings yesterday that beat analysts expectations, as sales climbed. Pfizer also raised its outlook. Net income at Pfizer dropped 30 percent, but results in the year-ago period were bolstered by one-time tax gains. The company said that after adjusting for a planned asset sale, income in the most recent quarter rose 10 percent. Last month, Pfizer announced the sale of its consumer business to Johnson &amp; Johnson for $16.6 billion in a deal that is expected to close later this year. Pfizer now accounts for the division as a discontinued operation. The company forecast earnings of $2 a share in 2006, even with the asset sale. Pfizer said that estimate was the equivalent of about $1.93 a share, meaning it had essentially raised its outlook by sticking to previous guidance. Net income at Pfizer fell to $2.42 billion, or 33 cents a share, from $3.46 billion, or 47 cents a share, in the period a year ago. After adjusting for the sale of the consumer division, Pfizer earned $3.66 billion, or 50 cents a share, up from $3.32 billion, or 45 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had estimated that even including the consumer business, Pfizer would earn 48 cents a share. Revenue at Pfizer increased 3 percent, to $11.74 billion. Sales of the cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor, the companys best-selling drug, rose 9 percent, to $3.1 billion. Analysts had been concerned about its sales as health plans encouraged patients to switch to cheaper generic versions of Zocor, a competing drug made by Merck that lost patent protection last month. Shares of Pfizer rose 41 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $23.71. Wyeth reported its net income for the second quarter rose to $1.06 billion, or 78 cents a share, from $976.6 million, or 72 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding certain items, earnings in the latest quarter were $1.09 billion, or 80 cents a share. On that basis, analysts expected Wyeth to earn 76 cents a share. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $5.16 billion. Shares of Wyeth rose 66 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $44.99. Amgen, the biotechnology company, said yesterday that its second-quarter profit fell because of several acquisitions, but the company nevertheless posted a solid quarter and increased full-year guidance. Amgen earned $14 million, or a penny a share, compared with $1.03 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue jumped 13.6 percent, to $3.6 billion, from $3.17 billion. Adjusted for stock option expenses and acquisitions, including the purchase of Abgenix this spring for more than $2 billion, the company said it earned $1.24 billion, or $1.05 a share, a 11.9 percent increase over last years results. Shares of Amgen fell 64 cents, to $63.92. In after-hours trading, shares gained more than 3.7 percent, to $66.31. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Holding said first-half net profit, after dividends to minority interests, rose 38 percent, driven by sales of cancer medicines and the antiviral medicine Tamiflu. The company reports earnings every six months. Roche said profit rose to 3.97 billion Swiss francs ($3.17 billion) in the six months ended June 30, from 2.88 billion francs a year earlier. Sales increased 19 percent, to 19.85 billion francs ($15.85 billion). Roche shares closed up 3.3 percent at 214.90 francs ($171.55) in Zurich.

The companies said that the judge at the International Trade Commission had determined that Roche could import its experimental drug peg-EPO, also known as Cera, under a special exception for clinical trials. Amgen, the biotechnology company based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., had requested that the trade commission prohibit Roche from importing the drug, which is not yet approved. Roche said the decision cleared the way for it to focus on obtaining regulatory approval. It has said it intends to file this year for clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to sell the drug. Amgen is trying to stave off competition from Roche's drug Cera, which could rival Amgen's anemia drug Epogen. Amgen earned $6 billion in 2005 from sales of Epogen and a related version called Aranesp. Roche argued that Cera did not infringe Amgen's patent because it was linked to a chemical that made it last longer in the body than Epogen. Amgen is fighting Roche in both the trade commission and also in the Federal District Court in Boston.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/04/business/04place.html?ref=amgeninc">Signs That Biotech Has a Healthier Future<date>Published: April 4, 2006</date><text>Correction Appended THE biotechnology industry is finally getting closer to an elusive goal: breaking even. Despite its reputation for developing lifesaving drugs and providing high-paying jobs, the industry has lost tens of billions of dollars since Genentech, the first genetic engineering company, was founded 30 years ago this Friday. Although the biotechnology giants Genentech and Amgen are now profitable, as are about four dozen smaller players, the overall industry has been kept afloat only by the willingness of investors to finance research and development. "Investors have been very patient with the biotech industry, which has been one of the biggest money-losing industries in the history of mankind," Arthur D. Levinson, the chief executive of Genentech, told analysts last month. "The cumulative loss by this industry from its inception in 1976 is nearing $100 billion." But perhaps the tide is turning. Publicly traded American biotechnology companies lost only $2.1 billion in 2005, down from $4.9 billion in 2004, according to the latest annual scorecard compiled by Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting and consulting firm. More important, the firm said, the loss last year was equivalent to only 4 percent of the $47.8 billion in combined revenue from the 329 public companies in the biotech industry. That is the first time that figure has ever been below 5 percent. "We still feel pretty bullish that profitability for the entire industry, at least in the United States, will occur by the end of this decade," said Donn Szaro, leader of the global biotechnology practice for Ernst &amp; Young. The prediction is for profitability on a yearly basis, not an erasure of three decades of cumulative losses. For investors, of course, what matters most is what happens to the share price, not profits. Even shares of unprofitable companies can rise substantially  at least for a while  based on prospects for new drugs. The stock of New River Pharmaceuticals, for instance, has more than quadrupled since its initial offering in 2004, propelled by hopes that the company's experimental drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder will be safer than alternatives. The stock closed yesterday at $33.51, up 30 cents. Moreover, investors generally seek out particular stocks, not the industry as a whole, and big hits can pay off well. Amgen and Genentech, the two largest biotech companies, have market values of more than $85 billion, exceeding those of many of the traditional pharmaceutical companies. At the end of 2005, the market capitalization of those two companies alone accounted for nearly half the total $410 billion for all publicly traded American biotech companies. And much of the improvement in the industry's bottom line in 2005 came from an increase of $1.8 billion in the combined net profit of Amgen and Genentech. But even as those companies succeeded, the industry's overall income has been dragged down by companies that failed, and by newer companies that are still too young to have reached profitability. The American industry is generally far ahead of its competitors elsewhere in sales and product development and market value. Oddly, however, the biotechnology industry in the Asia-Pacific region eked out a small profit of $7 million, according to the Ernst &amp; Young calculations, because big profits from an Australian company, CSL, more than offset small losses from many other companies. The accounting firm's calculation of income favors the industry because it leaves out private companies, which tend to be in earlier stages of development, and therefore more likely to be in the red. The 1,086 private American biotech companies lost $2 billion last year, about the same as the public companies, but on revenue of only $2.9 billion. On the other hand, the Ernst &amp; Young data may also be shortchanging the industry because some successful biotech companies end up being acquired by larger pharmaceutical companies and are no longer counted. So far, despite losses, investors continue to put money into the sector. The public and private American companies combined raised $14.7 billion last year, down slightly from 2004 but still the third-largest sum ever. But investors have become increasingly wary of initial public stock offerings, particularly when companies do not have products close to reaching the market. Only 13 biotech companies went public last year, less than half the 2004 figure, and most of them were at lower prices than the companies had expected, according to the report. If the industry has not fared well in terms of profit and loss, how about drug development? In 2005, for the third consecutive year, new biotechnology drugs received more approvals from the Food and Drug Administration than drugs from big pharmaceutical companies. The F.D.A. approved 18 novel biotech drugs, compared with only 11 from big conventional drug makers. Still, biotechnology companies have by no means figured out how to avoid the pitfalls in drug development. And for companies without profits, any setback in development can mean a steep fall in the stock. That happened three times just yesterday. Inhibitex lost two-thirds of its market value after reports that the company's leading drug candidate, Veronate, did not prevent infections in premature babies in a late-stage clinical trial. Cortex Pharmaceuticals lost half its value when the F.D.A. halted clinical trials of a drug, citing problems seen in animal testing. And shares of Incyte plummeted 40 percent when the company said it would discontinue development of a drug for treating H.I.V. because of side effects. Correction: April 5, 2006 The Market Place column in Business Day yesterday, about financial losses of biotechnology companies, misstated the increase in the share price for one such company, New River Pharmaceuticals. Adjusted for a split, the stock now sells for more than eight times the price of its initial offering in 2004; it has not just quadrupled.

Also yesterday Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company by sales, said that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 20 percent, driven by sales of rheumatoid arthritis and anemia drugs. Lilly, which is based in Indianapolis, said its net income for the fourth quarter was $700.6 million, or 64 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $2.4 million, or less than a cent, a year earlier, when the company incurred tax expenses from repatriated overseas earnings. Sales of Cymbalta more than tripled. Newer products accounted for 20 percent of total sales in the quarter and will increase to 24 percent in 2006 from 18 percent last year, Lilly said. Excluding restructuring costs, Lilly said fourth-quarter profit was 80 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected 78 cents, based on the average of 24 estimates. Shares of Lilly, the seventh-biggest United States drug maker, rose 24 cents, to $56.93 yesterday. Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., reported a fourth-quarter profit of $824 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with $689 million, or 53 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Excluding one-time expenses and other special charges, Amgen's earnings would have been $928 million, or 75 cents a share, a 24 percent increase over the fourth quarter last year. On that basis, the earnings missed Wall Street analysts' expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Financial. Shares of Amgen fell $3.57, to $71.90.

But now, Amgen's money machine is coming under attack. Skip to next paragraph Patent Power A host of companies - ranging from the Swiss giant Roche to Silicon Valley start-ups - are developing anemia drugs to compete against Epogen and Aranesp, the blockbusters that will account for nearly half of Amgen's expected $12 billion in revenues this year. But Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, will not give up its empire without a fight. Last month it filed a pre-emptive patent infringement suit against Roche, setting the stage for what Mark Schoenebaum, biotechnology analyst at Bear Stearns, predicts will be "the mother of all biotech patent cases." He estimated that Amgen's annual earnings growth over the next five years could be cut by more than 50 percent if Roche were to capture half the American market. While a potential blow to Amgen and its shareholders, competition would be good news for consumers, insurers and taxpayers. Collectively, they will spend about $7 billion this year for Epogen and Aranesp and for the Johnson &amp; Johnson drug Procrit, which is sold under license from Amgen. Medicare spends more on those drugs than almost any other, laying out at least $1 billion a year for each. Some Amgen critics say that while its anemia drugs have truly helped people, its near monopoly is lasting much longer than patent law was meant to allow. The company has sold about $22 billion worth of Epogen since its approval in 1989 and $7 billion worth of Aranesp, a newer, longer-lasting version, since 2001. "Simply put, this is a monopoly within Medicare that is now working against the patients it was intended to help and is costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars," Gary Peterson, the president of Renalweb, a Web site about dialysis, wrote in July after a price increase for Epogen. Epogen, used by most of the nation's 300,000 dialysis patients, costs about $7,000 to $10,000 a year. Aranesp and Procrit, which do compete against each other, are used primarily to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy and cost $1,200 or more a month. Amgen gets a 10 percent royalty on Procrit sales in the United States. In Europe, Amgen's original patent on the drugs has expired and competition is set to begin. Roche plans to introduce its drug CERA, which it claims is better than Amgen's products, in 2007. Several companies are planning lower-priced generic versions of Epogen. In the United States, Amgen received seven patents. All were based on the work done in the early 1980's by one of its scientists, Fu-Kuen Lin, who isolated the human gene for erythropoietin, or EPO, the protein that makes up the drugs. While the first of these patents expired late last year, the others were not granted until the mid-to-late 1990's and could preserve Amgen's monopoly until 2015 - well beyond the 17 or 20 years contemplated in patent law for an innovation. "Amgen is absolutely determined to ensure that this is the case, that the effective patent life for EPO in the United States will be 32 years," said C. Boyd Clarke, the chief executive of Neose Technologies, which is trying to develop EPO in a way that would get around Amgen's patents. Even Kevin W. Sharer, Amgen's chief executive, when asked why EPO's patent life lasted so long, replied, "It's an obvious question; I've had it myself." He and other Amgen executives say that the patent office delayed issuing the patents in part because of years of challenges from Amgen's competitors. "Because we lacked protection for many of our inventions, we pushed hard to get those patents issued as soon as possible," Stuart Watt, Amgen's chief patent counsel, said in a written statement. But critics note that Amgen played a role in the protracted process. Some of its applications were repeatedly rejected or abandoned and then resubmitted with different wording, keeping the patent application mill grinding for years. All of the patents contain an identical description of the work done by Mr. Lin. But each contains different claims. The original, for instance, covered the EPO gene. Others deal with genetically engineered cells for making EPO; with processes for manufacturing; with drugs using the protein; and with methods of treatment. Experts say Amgen's approach was common until the mid-1990's. In some cases examiners requested that a patent be divided. "That's not an abuse of the system; that's the way it was done," said Rochelle Seide, a biotechnology patent lawyer with Arent Fox in New York who is not involved in litigation involving EPO. She said Amgen's patents "have been examined and re-examined" and have held up. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/business/15amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen to Buy Abgenix, Getting Complete Control of New Colon Cancer Drug<date>Published: December 15, 2005</date><text>The biotechnology giant Amgen has agreed to acquire Abgenix for $2.2 billion in cash, giving it full ownership of a promising cancer drug the companies have been developing together. The companies said yesterday that Amgen would pay $22.50 a share for Abgenix, a company based in Fremont, Calif. The offer was 54 percent higher than Abgenix's closing price Wednesday of $14.65, and the shares soared in after-hours trading. The main prize for Amgen is full ownership of panitumumab, which slowed the progression of advanced colorectal cancer in a late-stage clinical trial. The companies said they would apply for federal approval over the next few months, meaning the drug could reach the market late in 2006 or early in 2007. "Abgenix is a natural strategic fit for Amgen given our long-term partnership with them and the opportunity we see for panitumumab," Kevin Sharer, Amgen's chief executive, said in a conference call with securities analysts. Amgen said the deal would decrease its earnings per share by 5 to 10 cents in 2006 and 2007, but add to earnings after that. Amgen expects sales of panitumumab to exceed $2 billion a year eventually. In an interview, Mr. Sharer said Amgen calculated that its shareholders would break even if peak sales of panitumumab reach $1 billion a year. But panitumumab is quite similar to Erbitux, a drug already sold jointly by ImClone Systems and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Amgen maintains its drug is potentially safer and can be given less frequently, but Erbitux has a big head start. ImClone also has a patent that could potentially limit use of panitumumab, although Mr. Sharer said Amgen was confident that the patent would not be an obstacle. The market reacted favorably to the deal, which was announced at the close of trading. Shares of Amgen, which closed in regular trading at $76.78, rose about $1.40 in after-hours trading. Shares of Abgenix soared about 50 percent, after hours, while shares of ImClone fell about 5 percent. The acquisition is the third major one in recent years for Amgen, which is the world's largest biotechnology company, with revenues this year expected to exceed $12 billion. Last year, Amgen paid $1.5 billion to buy Tularik in a move seen as a way to increase its drug discovery prowess. In 2002, it paid about $10 billion for Immunex to obtain the big-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel. The Immunex acquisition had been somewhat controversial because of its expense. And it now looks as if Amgen will narrowly miss the projection it made at the time of the deal that sales of Enbrel would reach $3 billion by 2005. But it was the Immunex deal that gave Amgen half-ownership of panitumumab, although it was an afterthought at the time. "This week, at least, we're feeling pretty good about Immunex," Mr. Sharer said. In addition to obtaining the colon cancer drug, Amgen will be relieved of having to pay Abgenix future royalties on sales of another drug, denosumab, a treatment for osteoporosis that is now in clinical trials. Amgen will also obtain Abgenix's manufacturing plant in Fremont. Abgenix, founded in 1996, specializes in monoclonal antibodies, which are engineered versions of the proteins the body uses to fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases. With Abgenix's technology, genetically engineered mice produce monoclonal antibodies that have completely human characteristics - making the antibodies less likely to provoke an immune response when injected into patients. Abgenix has licensed its technology to many other drug companies and has a cancer partnership with AstraZeneca. Those companies might be uncomfortable dealing with Amgen, a rival. "We are mindful of that," Mr. Sharer said, adding Amgen would honor those agreements but anticipated some would be modified. Amgen and Abgenix had talked in the past about a merger but decided to wait for the late-stage clinical trial data, which came in early November, to prove that panitumumab drug worked. "We needed to see how the clinical data played out," William R. Ringo, Abgenix's chief executive, said in an interview. Mr. Ringo will leave the company after the deal is done. Amgen said that it would keep most of Abgenix's manufacturing employees but that job losses were likely in other areas. Abgenix has 450 employees. The companies said the deal had been unanimously approved by both boards but still required approval of Abgenix shareholders and regulators. They said they expected the deal to close by the end of the first quarter of 2006.

In a suit filed Tuesday in Federal District Court in Trenton, N.J., Johnson &amp; Johnson said Amgen was bundling sales of its drugs in a way that forces cancer clinics to buy Amgen's Aranesp at the expense of Procrit. A spokeswoman for Amgen, Mary Klem, said, "We believe the allegations are not legitimate and we intend to fight this." Both Aranesp and Procrit are versions of erythropoietin, a protein that bolsters the body's production of red blood cells. Combined sales to American cancer clinics, which use the drugs to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy, are expected to be $2.8 billion this year, the lawsuit said. Amgen sells two other drugs, Neulasta and Neupogen, that increase production of infection-fighting white blood cells and are used to treat a different side effect of chemotherapy. Amgen has about 98 percent of the market for white cell boosters, a virtual monopoly, according to the lawsuit. Johnson &amp; Johnson does not sell a similar product. Johnson &amp; Johnson accused Amgen of giving cancer clinics bigger discounts on Neulasta and Neupogen - drugs they cannot do without - if they buy more Aranesp. Without the discounts, the suit contends, clinics would lose money on Neulasta when reimbursed by Medicare. "Forcing physicians who treat cancer patients to abandon Procrit as the only economically viable way to gain access to another badly needed drug for their patients is not, by any measure, in the public interest," the lawsuit says. The complaint says Procrit's market share in cancer clinics has fallen to 34 percent, from 55 percent in the first quarter of 2004. It asks the court to order Amgen to stop its practices and pay treble damages. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson have been feuding almost ever since Amgen, as a young company in need of cash, licensed Procrit to Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1985. A few years ago, Amgen, now the world's biggest biotechnology company, came out with Aranesp, a new anemia drug that can be given less frequently than Procrit, and began competing with its former partner. Ronald Renaud Jr., an analyst at J. P. Morgan who recommends Amgen stock, said that Johnson &amp; Johnson was "grasping at straws" with the lawsuit. "We maintain that the most significant driver behind Aranesp's success has been the less frequent dosing when compared to Procrit," Mr. Renaud wrote in a note to clients. "Keeping a cancer patient from having to return to the oncologist's office any more than necessary is a powerful incentive to use both Aranesp and Neulasta."

The company also raised its 2005 forecast. Second-quarter net income rose to $1.03 billion, or 82 cents a share, from $748.1 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 23 percent, to $3.17 billion. Sales of Aranesp, used to treat anemia in cancer patients, jumped 36 percent, to $837 million, in the quarter, Amgen said.

Johnson &amp; Johnson said yesterday that Procrit sales fell 3 percent in the second quarter. Amgen increased its forecast for 2005 profit, excluding some items, to as much as $3.20 a share, from an earlier range of $2.80 to $2.90. It also increased its revenue forecast, predicting growth in the "mid-to-high teens." Shares of Amgen rose 2 cents, to close at $70.52.

The lawsuit raised questions about the rights of patients in clinical trials. The patients accused Amgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, of treating them as "mere guinea pigs" and argued that the company had a legal and moral obligation to continue the treatment, which they said had eased their symptoms. But Judge P. Kevin Castel of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled Monday that Amgen was under no contractual obligation to continue supplying the drug. He said that the informed consent forms signed by the patients before participating in the trial explicitly acknowledged Amgen's right to terminate it. While it is not illogical for participants in a trial to assume the company would continue testing the drug, Judge Castel wrote in a 21-page opinion, "that is a far cry from establishing a contract by which Amgen bargained away the freedom to terminate the research trials in its sole discretion." Alan Milstein, the lawyer representing the patients, said he was considering options, including an appeal. Last September, Amgen stopped giving the drug, called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or G.D.N.F., to all clinical trial participants, about four dozen people. The company said the drug had not proved meaningfully better than a placebo and might even be dangerous. But some of the patients, backed by Parkinson's patient advocacy groups, implored Amgen to keep supplying them with the drug, saying that in some cases it had immensely improved their condition, even given them their lives back. Some doctors who treated the patients in the trials took the patients' side, arguing that the drug worked and the safety risks were overblown. But other doctors involved in the trial agreed with Amgen. Two patients, Robert Suthers of Greenlawn, N.Y., and Niwana Martin of Harpers Ferry, W. Va., filed the lawsuit in April. They sought a preliminary injunction that would have required Amgen to supply G.D.N.F. while the legal case proceeded. But Judge Castel denied the preliminary injunction, saying the plaintiffs were not likely to prevail in the case. He wrote that the patients' agreement was not with Amgen but with New York University, which recruited them for the trial and treated them. Such separation of the patients from drug companies is a standard way of trying to keep the companies from interfering in trials, he wrote. "In this case, there is no basis in fact or law to impose a fiduciary duty running from the sponsor of an independent study to participants who it does not select, has not met, and about whom it might not know the details of their medical condition," he wrote. Kristen Suthers, the daughter of Mr. Suthers and an organizer of the patients' efforts to get the drug, said the decision did not seem fair. "Amgen drove this study from beginning to end with a heavy hand and significant involvement," she said by e-mail, "yet they have no responsibility to the participants?" Andrea Rothschild, a spokeswoman for Amgen, said the company was pleased with the decision and continued to believe that withdrawing the treatment was the proper decision, made with patient safety in mind.

In their lawsuit, filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the plaintiffs say Amgen "treated the patients as mere guinea pigs, as material to be discarded," and had violated a legal and moral obligation to continue to supply the drug. A spokeswoman for Amgen said that the company had only started to review the complaint but typically would not comment on litigation. The lawsuit is the latest step in a conflict that has raised questions about the obligations of drug companies to participants in clinical trials. Last year, Amgen said that a clinical trial showed that the drug - glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or G.D.N.F. - was not significantly better than a placebo. It also said that some monkeys given high doses had developed brain damage. So Amgen stopped giving the drug to about four dozen people in the trials. But many of those patients wrote letters imploring Amgen to let them have the drug, insisting that it had greatly improved their condition. Some of the doctors involved in the trial also argued that the drug worked and was safe. But in February, Amgen reiterated its position, saying it would be unethical, would raise false hopes and would hinder long-term development of the product. The two plaintiffs in the clinical trials, Robert Suthers of Greenlawn, N.Y., and Niwana Martin of Harpers Ferry, W.Va., were both treated at New York University. Alan C. Milstein, their lawyer, said that other patients might be added to the suit but that it was more efficient to start with two plaintiffs because the goal was to get the court quickly to order Amgen to provide the drug. Mr. Milstein, who is based in Pennsauken, N.J., represented the family of Jesse Gelsinger, a teenager who died in a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania in 1999. That lawsuit was settled but details remain confidential. The suit against Amgen argues that, in effect, drug companies and participants in their clinical trials enter into a contract. In this drug trial in particular, the lawsuit argues, patients had to undergo surgery so that G.D.N.F. could be delivered directly into their brains from tubes extending underneath the skin to pumps implanted in the abdomen. According to the lawsuit, Mr. Suthers suffered a stroke after his surgery and had to undergo a second brain operation to correctly position a catheter that had come loose. The suit also says the company promised that if the drug were safe and effective, that it would continue to provide it to participants in the trial as long as it was helping them. With the drug, Mr. Suthers has said he was routinely able to walk two miles. Now, since coming off the drug, "he can't walk a block," said his wife, Elaine Suthers. "We don't want millions of dollars," she said. "We want the G.D.N.F. and we want a chance for some degree of normalcy in our life."</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/22/business/worldbusiness/22biotech.html?ref=amgeninc">British Company to Buy U.S. Maker of Anemia Treatment<date>Published: April 22, 2005</date><text>hire Pharmaceuticals Group, a British drug company, agreed to pay $1.6 billion in cash to acquire Transkaryotic Therapies, an American company that has developed its own version of an anemia-fighting protein that is the biotechnology industry's biggest-selling product. The deal, announced yesterday, represents a substantial move into biotechnology by Shire, best known for its Adderall drug for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The transaction was strongly opposed by Michael J. Astrue, Transkaryotic's chief executive. According to people close to the negotiations, Mr. Astrue had argued that the company would be better off on its own, and he resigned rather than carry out the transition to new ownership. Advertisement "Mike didn't want to do the transition," Lydia Villa-Komaroff, the chairwoman of Transkaryotic's board, said in an interview. Dr. Villa-Komaroff, who is the chief operating officer of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, said that the board had "intense discussions" about the merger. The biggest potential product in Transkaryotic's portfolio is Dynepo, the company's version of erythropoietin, an anemia drug sold under the names Epogen and Aranesp by Amgen, and as Procrit and Eprex by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Combined global sales of erythropoietin by these two companies and others exceeded $10 billion last year. Shire agreed to pay $37 a share, a 22 percent premium to Wednesday's closing price for TKT, as Transkaryotic is generally called. TKT said a majority of its board approved the deal, suggesting there might have been opposition beyond Mr. Astrue. But the transaction had the backing of Warburg Pincus, an investment firm that owns 14 percent of TKT and controls two of its seven board seats. Shares of TKT rose $4.77, or nearly 16 percent, to $35.21. Shire's American depositary receipts fell $3.50, or 10 percent, to $31.02. Shire, based in Basingstoke, England, has been looking for new products. The company had $1.4 billion in revenues last year, with about half coming from Adderall. But generic drug manufacturers are challenging Adderall's patents and, if successful, could introduce versions as early as next year. And in February, Canadian regulators suspended sales of Adderall XR, the extended-release version that accounts for the bulk of sales, saying the drug was linked to 20 deaths, 12 of them in children. The Food and Drug Administration in the United States has allowed sales to continue, saying it sees little evidence the deaths were caused by the drug. So far, TKT, based in Cambridge, Mass., has only one drug on the market, a treatment for Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder. Sales were $77 million last year and the company has not been profitable. The drug, Replagal, is sold in Europe and some other countries but is not approved in the United States. TKT has clinical trials under way for drugs aimed at two other rare genetic conditions, Hunter syndrome and Gaucher disease. Although only several thousand people in the world have each of these rare diseases, sales of drugs to treat them can reach hundreds of millions of dollars a year if the price is high enough. But the prize could be Dynepo, TKT's version of erythropoietin, or EPO. TKT has not been able to sell Dynepo in the United States because of Amgen's patents. TKT believed it would not infringe Amgen's patents because it makes its EPO a different way. But courts have so far sided with Amgen in a protracted battle. TKT won a patent fight in Europe, where Amgen's patent protection was weaker. Dynepo is approved in Europe and TKT has been looking for a marketing partner to introduce the drug in early 2006. Shire initially approached TKT last year about being that marketing partner, and the talks broadened into an acquisition, executives of the two companies said yesterday. Shire said annual sales for all versions of EPO in Europe were about $2.3 billion. But Dynepo is a first-generation product. Amgen sells a second-generation product, Aranesp, which requires less frequent injections or infusions. Roche is also working on a new version, called Cera. And several companies hope to market generic versions of EPO in the next few years. TKT's stock price collapsed in late 2002 when it became clear that the F.D.A. had reservations about the clinical trial data for the company's Fabry disease drug. Richard F. Selden, chief executive at the time, resigned in February 2003, to be replaced by Mr. Astrue, the company's former general counsel. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether the company and Dr. Selden misled investors. The investment bank SG Cowen represented TKT in the deal, while Goldman Sachs was Shire's banker.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/21/business/media/21amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Must Withdraw Psoriasis Drug Ad<date>Published: February 21, 2005</date><text>mgen, the world's largest biotechnology company, must stop running a television advertisement for its Enbrel treatment for the skin disease psoriasis, United States regulators said on Friday. The television spot, called "Freedom," fails to specify that the drug is approved for "chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis" rather than milder forms of the condition, and fails to disclose risks, the Food and Drug Administration said in a letter on the agency's Web site. "The TV ad is misleading," Thomas W. Abrams, director of the F.D.A.'s division of drug marketing, wrote in the letter. "The ad overstates the demonstrated effectiveness of Enbrel, inadequately communicates the limitations of the indication and minimizes the serious risks associated with Enbrel therapy." Enbrel, an arthritis treatment from Amgen, won F.D.A. approval for the psoriasis indication last year. The injectable medication has been linked to serious infections, some fatal, according to a bold-print warning on the prescribing label. "We've immediately withdrawn the ad and it's no longer running," an Amgen spokeswoman, Nurha Hindi, said in an interview. The company is reviewing the letter, which it received Friday, and will work with the F.D.A. to resolve any issues, she said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/12/business/12amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Patients in Test Won't Get Drug, Amgen Decides<date>Published: February 12, 2005</date><text>small group of people with Parkinson's disease had been pleading for months with the biotechnology company Amgen: Let them resume taking an experimental drug that the patients said had helped them but which the company said was ineffective and possibly dangerous. Yesterday Amgen gave its answer: no. The company said it would not make the drug available to the four dozen patients who had participated in its clinical trials, even though the Food and Drug Administration had left the door open for it to do so. Company executives said that besides exposing the patients to unnecessary risks, to let them continue treatment would only generate false hopes. It might also ultimately hinder development of improved versions of the drug, Amgen said. "I know this will be received by the patients in a devastating way," Kevin W. Sharer, chief executive of Amgen, said in an interview, describing the verdict as "the hardest decision I've made in my life." But, he added, "we're trying to do the right thing for the most people." Some patients, along with their family members and doctors, reacted swiftly and angrily, as did some patient advocacy groups. "They have every reason in the world to give this medication to the patients, and they're not," said Kristen Suthers, whose father had received the drug and who has been one of the main organizers of the patient protest. "To be able to decide whether people are going to suffer - I just wish that I'd never heard of the company." She said the condition of her father, Robert Suthers of Huntington, N.Y., had improved to the extent that he could walk two miles while on the drug, but now can no longer even bathe himself. The controversy over the drug raises the question of whether drug companies are obligated to continue providing drugs to participants in clinical trials, even after the trials are ended. In this case, to receive the drug the patients had to undergo surgery to have catheters implanted in their brains and pumps in their abdomens. "We think there is kind of a moral pact that one makes with a company in these situations that gives the patients a privilege of having continued access to treatment," said Robin Anthony Elliott, executive director of the Parkinson's Disease Foundation. But Dorothy E. Vawter, associate director of the Minnesota Center for Health Care Ethics, said the question was "not a settled area of research ethics at all and is raising its head more and more all the time." She said an obligation to provide drugs to patients indefinitely after trials end could discourage drug development. Amgen's decision reverberated beyond the patients in the trials because the drug, called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, had the potential to stall or even reverse the progression of the disease rather than just reduce the symptoms, as the currently available Parkinson's drugs do. "As someone with Parkinson's disease who for four years has had GDNF as my big hope, it's absolutely devastating," Tom Isaacs, co-founder of the Cure Parkinson's Trust in England, said of Amgen's decision. Mr. Isaacs walked around the coast of Britain, more than 4,000 miles, to raise money for Parkinson's research, planning, he said, to devote much of that to studies of GDNF. In initial trials in England and Kentucky involving a total of 15 patients who knew they were getting the drug, virtually all experienced reduction of the tremors and rigidity that characterize the disease, and in some cases the improvements were substantial. But a subsequent trial involving 34 people who did not know whether they were getting the drug or a placebo, indicated that the drug did not prove meaningfully better than the placebo. Amgen concluded that the positive results in the earlier trials represented a placebo effect, something that is known to occur in Parkinson's trials. Moreover, it said, it found that some monkeys given high doses of the drug had developed potentially serious brain damage. So last summer the company stopped the trials and ordered all patients taken off the drug. Some doctors involved in the trial, however, have argued that the unsuccessful trial was poorly designed and that the drug worked. They also discounted the findings in monkeys, saying the animals had received a much higher dose than the patients.

Another drug maker, AstraZeneca, reported that its fourth-quarter earnings surged 52 percent as demand for established drugs outweighed problems with several of its new products last year. The company's stock rose on the news. Also yesterday, Amgen, a drug maker and biotechnology giant, reported that its profit rose 26 percent in the fourth quarter. But the company missed Wall Street expectations and also said it expected a slowdown in 2005, partly because of new Medicare reimbursement rules for its cancer drugs. Shares of the company plunged. Advertisement All three companies face potential difficulties in 2005. Despite promising revenues on new products, Bristol-Myers, which is based in New York, continues to struggle with the loss of patent exclusivity on important drugs as it narrows its focus to 10 disease areas. In addition, Bristol-Myers faces a patent challenge to its biggest selling drug, Plavix, a blood thinner. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Bristol-Myers earned $139 million, or 7 cents a share, down from $506 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges like the tax provision, the company earned 39 cents a share, exceeding analysts' estimates. Revenue for the quarter rose 2 percent, to $5.16 billion, from $5.08 billion. For all of 2004, Bristol-Myers earned $1.70 a share after special items. Sales for the year increased 4 percent, to $19.38 billion. The company said it expected to earn $1.35 to $1.45 a share this year, excluding certain items. Bristol-Myers's shares fell 1 cent, to $24.09, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $22.22 to $31.30. AstraZeneca, which is based in London, said it earned $968 million, or 59 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $635 million, or 38 cents a share year earlier. Sales rose 19 percent, to $5.8 billion, in line with analysts' expectations. The results were aided by a 32 percent surge, to $1.1 billion, in the sales of its Nexium ulcer medicine. For the year, AstraZeneca's net profit rose to $3.8 billion, or $2.28 a share, from $3.04 billion, or $1.78 a share. Revenue increased to $21.43 billion from $18.85 billion. Analysts are concerned about the future of AstraZeneca's cholesterol medicine Crestor after a disclosure in November that a prominent scientist at the Food and Drug Administration questioned its safety. The drug is considered central to the company's fortunes. The chief executive, Tom McKillop, said he was optimistic about continued high sales of Nexium and the schizophrenia treatment Seroquel, as well as a "restoration" of market share growth for Crestor. Shares of AstraZeneca rose $1.27, or 3.5 percent, to close at $37.25. Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., reported a fourth-quarter profit of $689 million, or 53 cents a share. That compared with $547 million, or 41 cents a share, for the period a year ago. The company's products include the anti-anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen. Amgen said that excluding expenses related to two acquisitions and other special charges, its earnings would have been $749 million, or 58 cents a share, a 22 percent increase over the fourth quarter last year. On that basis, the earnings missed Wall Street analysts' expectations by 3 cents, according to Thomson Financial. Shares of Amgen fell $1.98, or 3.1 percent, to $61.58.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/15/business/15amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Amgen Adds Warning to Its Anemia Drug<date>Published: January 15, 2005</date><text>ASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Amgen has added a warning to Aranesp, its anemia drug, for kidney dialysis and cancer patients after studies on similar drugs showed higher doses can cause blood clots and death, the company said in a letter released on Friday. Amgen said the new warning stemmed from studies done outside the United States on two other anemia drugs: Eprex, made by the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit Ortho Biotech Products, and NeoRecormon, made by Roche Holding. The studies revealed major complications, including blood clots and death, when doctors used these drugs to try to raise hemoglobin levels beyond what was recommended, the letter said. Advertisement A Food and Drug Administration panel of outside experts last year called for more study of the risks of the anemia drugs, including faster tumor growth and more blood clots. Some researchers had thought elevating hemoglobin might increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation to fight cancer. An Amgen spokeswoman, Trish Hawkins, said that the F.D.A. had asked the company to add the trial information and warning to Aranesp, which the company is also studying for use in improving cancer treatment through increased hemoglobin levels. "At this point, we know we have not observed this in our oncology trials," Ms. Hawkins said of the blood clot problems.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/26/business/26amgen.html?ref=amgeninc">Many See Hope in Parkinson's Drug Pulled From Testing<date>Published: November 26, 2004</date><text>ith his condition deteriorating from Parkinson's disease last year, Steve Kaufman gave up making improvements to his home in Algonquin, Ill. "I couldn't even hold a nail stable," he recalled. Earlier this year, after taking an experimental drug in a clinical trial, Mr. Kaufman built new kitchen cabinets and an outdoor deck. He was so steady he could walk across a narrow piece of lumber like an Olympic gymnast on the balance beam. The drug, however, is no longer available to Mr. Kaufman or other Parkinson's patients in clinical trials. In June, its developer, Amgen, announced that the drug, which is called glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF, had not proved better than a placebo. Two months later, the company said that safety issues had been discovered and it abruptly ordered all patients taken off the drug. Amgen's move has provoked an outcry from patients who say the company is robbing them of their only hope. "It's almost the same thing as a diabetic losing their insulin," said Mr. Kaufman, who is 50 and has had Parkinson's for 10 years. The story of Amgen's drug shows the clash between the faith of patients and the cold logic of science and business. At a time when public debate is focused on whether unsafe drugs like Vioxx are remaining on the market too long, this story shows patients who are more than willing to accept risks to get a drug. Their willingness also raises an ethical question: If a company stops developing a drug for safety or efficacy reasons, is it obligated to continue supplying it to patients from its clinical trials? A complicating factor in the clinical trials is the nature of Parkinson's, a disease that chokes off the supply of dopamine, a signaling chemical, in the brain. Some studies have suggested that mere anticipation of treatment can induce a patient's brain to produce more dopamine, which alleviates the symptoms. The patients not only feel better, they are better - at least for a time. In fact, some of patients in the GDNF trial who improved the most had received a placebo. Patients and their families have written letters to Amgen, imploring the company to continue providing the drug. Some of the most poignant have come from England, where the drug has been tested the longest, since 2001. "To quote a headline that my daughter used in a story she wrote for a national women's magazine - GDNF has given me my dad back," wrote Stephen Waite, who had used the drug for more than three years. In a telephone interview, Mr. Waite, 60, began crying when talking about the loss of the drug. "I would sign a disclaimer, anything, in order to continue," he said. Another family told Amgen how the drug allowed their mother to shop, dance and go on vacation for the first time in three years. "GDNF deserves more time, and so does our mother," they wrote. And Neil Shadwick wrote, "My whole world collapsed around me," when he learned the drug would be stopped. "My first thought was I don't want to be a shaking helpless man at 44." But while Amgen executives say they empathize with the four dozen patients who have participated in the trials, they also say they cannot keep giving them a drug that does not work and might be dangerous. "How can we ethically justify administering this drug?" said Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development. In August, the company's studies found that high doses of the drug damaged some monkey brains. It also found that a few patients had developed antibodies against the drug, posing a potential danger. Kevin Sharer, the chief executive, called the failed trial a "tragedy" and "the single most disappointing" one in his 12 years at the company. Some of the doctors involved in the clinical trial have criticized Amgen, saying the trial failed because it was poorly designed, not because GDNF does not work. "I don't think there's ever been a trial like this where so many investigators were so indignant about the way things were handled," said Michael Hutchinson, an associate professor of neurology at New York University who was involved in the trial.

Wyeth, the maker of Effexor, the top-selling antidepressant, said it made a profit in the quarter, while profit at Amgen fell after an acquisition. Pfizer's net income climbed to $3.34 billion, or 44 cents a share, from $2.24 billion, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 4 percent, to $12.8 billion, from $12.3 billion. Price pressure, patent expirations and competition for some of Pfizer's most profitable products will "temper revenue and income growth in 2005," the chief executive, Hank A. McKinnell, said in a statement. Third-quarter sales of Lipitor rose 11 percent, to $2.74 billion, accounting for 21 percent of total revenue, while Celebrex sales climbed 14 percent, to $797 million. Celebrex is in the same class of drugs as Vioxx, which Merck pulled from the market on Sept. 30 because of studies linking it to heart attacks. Pfizer has said its drug is safe, and yesterday the company began a new Celebrex advertising campaign. Excluding some costs, Pfizer said it earned 55 cents a share in the third quarter. The average estimate of 25 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial was for a profit of 54 cents. Wyeth reported profit of $1.42 billion for the third quarter as sales rose for Effexor; Enbrel, an arthritis drug; and Prevnar, a meningitis vaccine. Net income was $1.06 a share, in contrast to a net loss of $426.4 million, or 32 cents, in the quarter a year ago, when Wyeth set aside $2 billion to help pay for litigation related to its fen-phen diet drugs. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $4.5 billion. Effexor sales gained 38 percent in the quarter, and Robert A. Essner, Wyeth's chief executive, said he expected revenue from the medicine to exceed $3 billion this year. Revenue from prescription drugs rose 13 percent for the quarter. Wyeth benefited from a favorable tax adjustment of $407.6 million, or 30 cents a share. Excluding that gain, the company reported earnings of 76 cents a share, beating the 70-cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company, said profit fell 61 percent after its acquisition of Tularik. Net income fell to $236 million, or 18 cents a share, from $612 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 23 percent, to $2.71 billion, from $2.21 billion. Sales of Aranesp, an anemia drug, rose 39 percent, to $608 million, lifted by new prescriptions and gains against Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Amgen said it would have earned 64 cents a share, excluding some items. On that basis, the company was expected to earn 62 cents, the average estimate of 28 analysts in a Thomson Financial survey. Amgen released its results after the stock markets closed. The shares fell 23 cents, to $56.41, in Nasdaq composite trading. Pfizer shares fell 70 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $28.30 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wyeth was up 5 cents, to $37.23.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E3D9143AF935A25753C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=amgeninc">COMPANY NEWS; AMGEN WINS LONG PATENT BATTLE OVER ANEMIA MEDICINE<date>Published: October 16, 2004</date><text>A federal judge ruled yesterday that Amgen's patents protecting the Epogen anemia medicine were valid.

The drug in development, known as AMG 162, is considered by many analysts to be Amgen's best hope for a hit product, so the results of the trial are expected to be scrutinized by investors as well as doctors. The share price of Amgen, a leading biotechnology company, has declined 11 percent in the last year, in part because investors are concerned that it will not have enough new products to sustain its rapid growth.

The company has begun a final-stage trial that will test whether the drug prevents fractures, a more meaningful gauge than whether it increases bone mineral density. That trial could take two or three years. The latest trial involved 411 postmenopausal women who received either one of several doses of AMG 162, Fosamax or a placebo. AMG 162 increased bone mineral density in the spine and hip by a statistically significant amount after a year compared with the patients' starting condition and with the placebo, according to a company statement and Dr. Michael R. McClung, the principal investigator and founding director of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center in Portland. In most cases, AMG 162 increased bone density about as much as Fosamax, Dr. McClung, who is also an associate professor at Oregon Health and Science University, said in an interview. But at the dose of AMG 162 that Amgen plans to use in the future, the drug increased density in the hip significantly more than Fosamax. "This is not a study that proves that AMG 162 will be more effective than Fosamax," said Dr. McClung, who presented the results yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research in Seattle. "But we wanted to see responses that were at least as good and in the same range as Fosamax." He also said that AMG 162 began to work in days while Fosamax took weeks. Fosamax, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is the most widely prescribed drug treatment for bone thinning. But it and others in a class of drugs called bisphosphonates, like Actonel from Procter &amp; Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis, can irritate the esophagus, causing symptoms of heartburn. And the pills, usually taken once a week, are supposed to be swallowed first thing in the morning, with the patient remaining upright and not eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes afterward. AMG 162, which works through a new mechanism discovered by Amgen, would be given by injection once every six months. In the trial, the side effects of AMG 162 did not differ from those of the placebo, the company said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/04/business/in-drug-research-some-guinea-pigs-are-now-human.html?ref=amgeninc">In Drug Research, Some Guinea Pigs Are Now Human<date>Published: August 04, 2004</date><text>Researchers at the University of Munich repeated the experiment 70 times: a healthy volunteer would receive a chemical injection, then be left alone to ride out an artificially induced panic attack.From the next room, doctors watched the volunteer's restlessness via video camera, measured the quickening pulse and rise in blood pressure, and used an intercom to question the person about his or her feelings of impending doom. The attacks typically lasted 5 to 10 minutes.Each volunteer was put through the same test a few days later, but this time most of them first received an experimental anti-anxiety drug. The drug quelled anxiety well enough in those experiments last year that its developer, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis, gained the confidence to conduct large clinical trials.The company's approach is part of a trend in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug researchers are conducting small, fast, relatively inexpensive tests on people to get a quick gauge of a drug's promise before committing to full-scale clinical trials that may involve hundreds of patients, millions of dollars and many years of study. Often called experimental medicine, the approach is meant to reduce the huge costs of drug development and speed the most promising treatments into the marketplace.In the past, many of the tests might have been done only on animals. That might seem to raise ethical concerns, but the people who regulate and monitor drug experiments say that no problems have risen so far. And scientists and industry executives, while acknowledging the potential for ethical issues, say that experiments on people are more reliable, because animal tests often fail to accurately predict whether a drug will work on people.''Humans are the experimental animals here,'' said Roger Perlmutter, executive vice president for research and development at Amgen, a large biotechnology company that has embraced the new approach.Amgen, for instance, gave different potential arthritis drugs to human volunteers and then used a blood test to gauge the best one to take forward into clinical trials. The results were almost the opposite of what Amgen found when it conducted similar tests in animals.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/13/business/technology-2-engines-of-biotech-on-a-collision-course.html?ref=amgeninc">TECHNOLOGY; 2 Engines of Biotech on a Collision Course<date>Published: July 13, 2004</date><text>Arthur D. Levinson, the chief executive of the biotechnology company Genentech, is a scientist who worked his way up through the research department and says the favorite part of his week is attending the meetings on Wednesdays when experimental drugs are discussed. While he has learned the financial side of Genentech, he concedes that he lacks the love of administrative detail to run a conventional pharmaceuticals giant. ''I'd be an awful head of Big Pharma,'' he said.Compare that with his counterpart at Amgen, Kevin W. Sharer, who was previously a Naval officer on nuclear submarines, a management consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company, and an executive at General Electric and MCI. While Mr. Sharer has learned the biology side of Amgen, he concedes that he can come across as ''a fairly buttoned-up business guy.''One man, even at the top, does not define a company. But in this case, the contrast between scientist and professional manager coincides with investors' diverging views of the two companies that lead the biotechnology industry.''Amgen's culture has been financially driven, market driven and business driven,'' said Laurence Blumberg of Blumberg Capital Management, a biotechnology hedge fund in New York. Genentech, he said, ''has really been an innovator.''The contrast can only become more important as the companies -- which have long toiled in separate parts of the drug market -- now seem headed toward more direct competition, particularly in treatments for cancer and immune disorders.Although Genentech effectively started the biotechnology industry with its founding in 1976, Amgen, founded four years later, has been the field's biggest business success. Its $8.4 billion in revenue last year was 2.5 times that of Genentech, and its net income, at $2.3 billion, was four times that of its rival.Genentech's image as an innovator is helping it catch up, at least in the value investors place on the company. Genentech's stock price has tripled since the beginning of last year, raising its market capitalization to $55 billion -- not too far behind Amgen's $69 billion.Genentech has introduced three drugs in the last year. Chief among them is Avastin, a cancer treatment that analysts project will eventually reach sales of $2 billion a year. A fourth drug, Tarceva, also for cancer, is expected to win approval by next year.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/09/business/studies-find-biotechnology-anemia-drug-shows-promise-treating-several-diseases.html?ref=amgeninc">Studies Find Biotechnology Anemia Drug Shows Promise in Treating Several Diseases<date>Published: July 09, 2004</date><text>Amgen's anemia drug, the best-selling product developed so far by the biotechnology industry, might have broad new uses, recent studies have found.Laboratory and animal studies have shown that in addition to bolstering the body's red blood cells, the drug, EPO, is present in the central nervous system and acts to protect cells and tissues from damage and death. That could make it useful as a treatment for strokes, spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis and many other ailments.Testing in humans is in very early stages. A small study by academic scientists in Germany found that EPO, when given within eight hours of a stroke, helped protect the brain from damage and improve patient recovery. A larger trial is now under way there. Another early-stage trial in Germany is testing EPO as a treatment for schizophrenia, and in the United States, academic scientists are planning trials for AIDS-related dementia and for a nerve disease similar to multiple sclerosis.EPO, short for erythropoietin, is sold by Amgen as Epogen and, in a newer form, as Aranesp. Johnson &amp; Johnson, under license from Amgen, sells it under the names Procrit and Eprex. The versions had combined sales of $8 billion last year.A paper being published in the journal Science today discusses a new development that could pave the way for broader use. Scientists associated with Warren Pharmaceuticals, a small, privately held biotechnology company in Ossining, N.Y., say they have developed a chemically modified version of EPO that does not increase red blood cell levels but, in animals, still protects tissues from damage.Such a modified form could avoid a major risk of using EPO to treat people who are not anemic. The risk is that red blood cell levels might be increased to dangerously high levels, causing the blood to thicken and posing a risk that life-threatening clots would form.Anthony Cerami, the chief executive of Warren and an author of the Science paper, said that with the company's modified EPO, ''we can give tremendous amounts of it'' to animals ''and have no effect on their hemoglobin levels, on their red cell levels.''Most of the work involved in discovering the other roles that EPO plays in the body was done mainly by academic scientists, not by the companies, although the companies might be the ultimate beneficiaries.''They missed the boat on this,'' Dr. Cerami said of Amgen.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/29/business/company-news-amgen-says-parkinson-s-treatment-failed-in-study.html?ref=amgeninc">COMPANY NEWS; AMGEN SAYS PARKINSON'S TREATMENT FAILED IN STUDY<date>Published: June 29, 2004</date><text>Amgen Inc., a biotechnology company, said yesterday that a Parkinson's disease drug it is developing failed to help patients in a study.

The only time I touched biology was in ninth grade, and I didn't do very well.I was working at MCI when I got a fax one day from a headhunter, asking if I knew anybody who wanted to be president of Amgen. I had never heard of Amgen and didn't know what it was. This was 1992. I checked it out and asked some friends, and called back the recruiter and said, ''Yes, I want to be president of Amgen.''It was already a 12-year-old company with 2,000 employees, two successful biotech products, and it was clearly going to be a success.I was ambitious, and I wanted to be a C.E.O.My dad, who is still alive, was a naval aviator and a career naval officer. He flew jets early on and was a squadron commander. It's hard to overstate the psychological impact, as a young boy, of seeing airplanes come out of the sky, knowing that your father is flying one.My mother was a very strong, independent woman who was a real adventurer. She loved travel, the arts, literature. When I was a senior in high school, my mother pulled me out of school to go to the Los Angeles Philharmonic to see Isaac Stern play the violin.I went to the Naval Academy at Annapolis and studied aeronautical engineering on the misconception that it had something to do with flying airplanes. When I failed the flight physical in graduate school because of poor eyesight, I had to decide, at age 23, what to do with my lifelong ambition thwarted.A friend had joined the submarine force, so I decided I'd go see Admiral Hyman G. Rickover about that option.Rickover was famous for grilling people, and he asked me why I hadn't come to see him when I was at Annapolis. I told him that I wanted to fly, but since my eyes didn't work, he was the second choice.It was not the answer Rickover was accustomed to getting. He usually hammered people for failing grades or poor performance, and I had none of those things.After about 45 seconds, he said, ''Get out.''In those days, that was the highest praise you could get from him. It meant you'd been accepted.Later, when I was the chief engineer of the Memphis, which is in a certain class of attack submarines, on its initial sea trials, I encountered Rickover again. Admiral Rickover would ride every ship on its initial sea trials. So there I was in the control room and Rickover was screaming at the top of his lungs, ''Where's the chief engineer?'' He thought the ship wasn't performing properly.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/business/fda-wants-more-study-on-2-drugs-for-anemia.html?ref=amgeninc">F.D.A. Wants More Study on 2 Drugs for Anemia<date>Published: May 05, 2004</date><text>An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that more study would be needed to determine whether Amgen's and Johnson &amp; Johnson's widely used anemia drugs for cancer patients can actually make their cancer worse. But the committee did not discuss placing any restrictions on the use of the drugs or additional warnings on their labels.Johnson &amp; Johnson's Procrit and Amgen's Aranesp are used to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy. The products are among the best-selling drugs in the world, with annual sales of several billion dollars.Concerns about the drugs' safety arose last year after two clinical trials showed that cancer patients taking similar drugs in Europe did not live as long as those in a control group, suggesting that the anemia drugs might make cancer worse. Patients taking the anemia drugs in those trials and in some others also experienced higher levels of life-threatening blood clots, prompting Johnson &amp; Johnson to stop some clinical trials of Procrit last fall.At the advisory panel meeting yesterday in Gaithersburg, Md., executives from the two companies argued that the European studies were flawed. Each company said it had reviewed the records of its clinical trials and found no evidence that the drugs impair survival. They also said the blood clots tended to occur when the drugs were used at levels higher than indicated on the labels.The F.D.A. panel, however, was not that easily dissuaded. ''We have these evolving safety concerns; they cannot be dismissed,'' said Dr. Harvey Luksenburg, a medical reviewer for the agency.Both drugs are genetically engineered versions of erythropoietin, or EPO, a human hormone that spurs production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Anemic patients have low levels of oxygen in their blood, causing fatigue.Some cancer cells, however, have proteins, called receptors, to which EPO can bind, possibly stimulating the cells to grow. Some experts said yesterday that such stimulation did not seem to occur but that more study was needed.Both companies said they had begun trials that could tell whether the anemia drugs worsen cancer or impair survival. The trials were actually begun to see whether the drugs improve cancer survival, on the theory that delivering more oxygen to tumors can improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy or chemotherapy. But the companies said the trials would also be able to detect lower survival rates.Eric Ende, a biotechnology analyst at Merrill Lynch, called the meeting ''benign,'' saying he did not expect any changes to the labels of the drugs until more data was obtained.Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 13 cents, to $54.80, while Amgen stock slid 24 cents, to $57.70.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/01/business/company-news-amgen-wins-approval-to-use-arthritis-drug-for-psoriasis.html?ref=amgeninc">COMPANY NEWS; AMGEN WINS APPROVAL TO USE ARTHRITIS DRUG FOR PSORIASIS<date>Published: May 01, 2004</date><text>Amgen, the world's biggest biotechnology company, won approval yesterday from the Food and Drug Administration to sell its arthritis drug Enbrel as a treatment for the skin disease psoriasis. The medicine was introduced in 1998 for use in rheumatoid arthritis, a crippling joint disease. The F.D.A. approved the drug for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis, said an agency spokeswoman, Lenore Gelb. The decision may help Enbrel sales rise as much as 38 percent, to $1.8 billion this year, from $1.3 billion last year, Amgen has said. The F.D.A. confirmed the approval after the market closed.

Its vast sales have come mainly from two families of drugs that reached the market more than a decade ago, and its stock has been weighed down by concerns that Amgen does not have enough exciting new drugs under development to sustain its rapid growth.Just last week, the company held a five-hour meeting for analysts in New York to describe dozens of products it is developing. While some of the drugs, particularly one for osteoporosis, excited investors, Amgen's stock nonetheless dropped after the presentation, in part because the drugs discussed were generally years from reaching the market.The acquisition of Tularik, based in South San Francisco, Calif., will not immediately ease such concerns because the company is not expected to have a drug on the market before 2006. Even then, its most advanced drug, for liver cancer, is not highly regarded by analysts.Still, the acquisition could help Amgen in several ways, executives and analysts said.Tularik is working on drugs for diseases like cancer, diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis -- all of them areas Amgen is also pursuing. It is developing pills, which can be easier for patients than the injected proteins that have been Amgen's focus.And Amgen, which has headquarters in Southern California, will gain a research center in the San Francisco area, a biotechnology hub and the backyard of its biggest competitor, Genentech. Indeed, Genentech once owned part of Tularik.''We're interested in Tularik for the broader strength of their research talent, not for any particular molecule in their pipeline,'' Roger M. Perlmutter, Amgen's executive vice president for research and development, said in an interview.Amgen bought 21 percent of Tularik last year as the companies started a collaboration to discover cancer drugs. The $1.3 billion now will be for the other 79 percent.It will pay $25 in stock for each Tularik share, a 47 percent premium to Friday's $17 closing price. The announcement sent Tularik's shares soaring to close at $24.53, up $7.53. Amgen rose $1.46, to $59.55, a sign that investors favor the acquisition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/24/business/technology-briefing-biotechnology-amgen-announces-5-drug-development-programs.html?ref=amgeninc">Technology Briefing | Biotechnology: Amgen Announces 5 Drug-Development Programs<date>Published: March 24, 2004</date><text>Amgen, the biotechnology company, which yesterday held its first-ever meeting focused on research and development, said it had five drug-development programs that might each yield medicines with the potential for more than $1 billion in annual sales. The company held the meeting to prove it has medicines, like the AMG 162 compound, to continue sales growth, investors said. AMG 162 is being tested as a treatment for osteoporosis in women after menopause. Amgen, which in the past said little about early research, is trying to convince investors that it has new drugs to increase profit after sales growth slows for its Aranesp and Neulasta cancer medicines. Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said it expected product sales to rise to as much as $11.5 billion in 2005. The chief executive, Kevin Sharer, said that Amgen would post a profit, excluding some costs, of $2.71 to $2.85 a share next year, compared with the $2.83 average estimate of 29 analysts in a Thomson Financial survey. Shares fell $2.28, or 3.8 percent, to $57.83.</text></article></page></root>
