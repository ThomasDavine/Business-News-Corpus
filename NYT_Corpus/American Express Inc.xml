American Express is the latest company to equalize the cost of health insurance benefits for heterosexual employees and employees with same-sex partners. The movement to reimburse gay employees for the extra taxes they must pay has gained momentum in recent weeks: American Express joins Morgan Stanley and Bank of America, which also recently announced that they would adopt the policy. We’ve been keeping close tabs on which companies have decided to equalize the cost of benefits in this chart. As it stands now, a total of seven big financial institutions equalize benefits for workers, trailing only law firms, where, last we counted, 16 firms offered the reimbursement. Four big technology companies and five big consulting firms do the same. Under federal law, employer-provided health benefits for domestic partners are counted as taxable income, if the partner is not considered a dependent. On top of that, the employees cannot use pretax dollars to pay for their premiums — unlike their opposite-sex married counterparts. Since gay unions are not recognized by the federal government, same-sex couples can not avoid the extra costs by getting married. So while many large employers offer health insurance coverage for domestic partners, these employees must pay more to use it. Like many of its competitors, American Express is only reimbursing employees with same-sex partners and their dependents. The policy will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2012, and employees will receive the reimbursements — also known as a “gross up” — every pay period, a company spokesman said. Who are we missing? Will Citi and JPMorgan Chase be next? Please let us know if you learn of any other companies that decide to reimburse their gay and lesbian employees.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/virgin-america-subs-for-continental-in-membership-rewards-program/?ref=americanexpresscompany">Virgin America Subs for Continental in Membership Rewards Program<date>September 14, 2011, 11:41 am</date><text>Hello, Virgin America. Goodbye, Continental. Starting Oct. 5, Virgin America will join American Express’s Membership Rewards program. That means participants will be able to transfer points they have earned by spending with their Amex card into their Virgin America miles account. The airline’s loyalty program, Elevate, offers online-redemption with no blackout dates. The arrival of Virgin at Membership Rewards helps, somewhat, to lessen the blow caused by the loss of Continental Airlines, which is leaving the Amex program at the end of September. American Express announced last year that Continental would exit the program, dashing the hopes of some Membership Rewards members that Continental’s merger with United would finally offer the chance to redeem their Amex points for United miles too. Still, Virgin America is a decent redemption option for travelers aiming to redeem points for trans-continental flights, as the airline’s markets include New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. (It also recently added Dallas and Chicago.) Meanwhile, Membership Rewards participants have until Sept. 30 to transfer their Amex points into their Continental accounts one last time. After Sept. 30, an Amex spokeswoman notes, Membership Rewards participants can still book seats on Continental – and any other airline — and pay with Membership Rewards points when they book through American Express’s travel Web site. The downside is that this option doesn’t allow you to combine your Membership Rewards points with airline miles you have already accumulated by flying on an airline. But, if you’re a Platinum cardholder, you earn a 20 percent Membership Rewards point bonus when you book travel in this way. Does the addition of Virgin America to Membership Rewards help with your travel plans?</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/as-irene-approaches-banks-prepare-for-the-worst/?ref=americanexpresscompany">As Irene Approaches, Banks Prepare for the Worst<date>August 26, 2011, 12:58 pm</date><text>  5:37 p.m. | Updated As Hurricane Irene travels up the East Coast, New York is steeling itself for potential disaster. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for the state on Thursday, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has urged city residents of low-lying areas to evacuate their homes by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Wall Street, too, is entering the bunker. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Interactive Feature: Hurricane Irene Tracking Map Many of New York’s largest investment banks have their headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, and thus fall outside the city’s designated flood zones. Bank of America‘s 1 Bryant Park skyscraper, Citigroup‘s 399 Park Avenue building, Morgan Stanley‘s 1585 Broadway bureau, and JPMorgan Chase‘s 270 Park Avenue offices are all outside the zones. Credit Suisse‘s tower, located a little further south at 11 Madison Avenue, also carries a “no zone” designation. But the headquarters of Goldman Sachs, located at 200 West Street in Battery Park City, is located in Zone A, the low-lying area that the mayor has ordered to be evacuated. So is American Express‘s office in the World Financial Center. Deutsche Bank‘s 60 Wall Street headquarters, several blocks away from Goldman, is in Zone B. A Goldman spokesman declined to detail the bank’s hurricane preparations, but said that the bank had “plans in place to ensure the safety of our people and the ongoing operation of our business.” A Deutsche Bank spokesman said in a statement: “We are monitoring the storm closely and keeping employees informed with regular updates. We have already taken steps to ensure that we can conduct business as usual while maintaining the safety of all our employees, which is of utmost importance.” Some Midtown banks have second offices in high-risk zones. The Tribeca office of Citigroup, located near the Hudson River at 388 Greenwich Street, is in Zone A, as is Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, also in the World Financial Center. Citigroup’s Tribeca office houses its investment bank and trading floor. Merrill Lynch Wealth Management employees and other tenants of the World Financial Center were sent instructions for a “controlled lockdown” on Friday, but a spokeswoman for Brookfield, the building’s manager, said the lockdown protocol had been superseded by Mayor Bloomberg’s evacuation order. Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said that the bank had off-site offices in undisclosed locations available in the case that employees are unable to get to their normal locations. “Citi is committed to providing uninterrupted service to our clients during the storm and seeks to minimize any possible impact,” she said. Goldman Sachs, normally a bastion of conservative fashion, has told employees in some divisions they can dress casually on Monday, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In a memo, the firm instructed employees to “exercise good judgment” when determining proper dress. Some banks have begun booking hotel rooms for critical employees who may not otherwise be able to make it in to Manhattan, and a professional golf tournament sponsored by Barclays, which was scheduled to finish on Sunday, was shortened to 54 holes from 72 holes because of the impending storm. Chase announced that it would keep its 376 New York City branches open until 8 PM on Friday, to give customers ample time to complete banking transactions before the storm. It said the branches would be open until 11 a.m. on Saturday. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is located at 33 Liberty Street, said, “We are monitoring the storm and have contingency plans in place and multiple levels of redundancies to ensure regular operational functioning.” A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, John Nester, said: “We have been communicating throughout the day with markets and securities firms on whether the markets will be open Monday. Discussions will continue Saturday and Sunday as appropriate. The markets will make the decision whether to open in consultation with the S.E.C.” The New York Stock Exchange, which at 11 Wall Street is located in Zone C, is “planning to open on Monday,” a spokesman said, though it has a number of options if the storm makes that impossible, such as routing trades to its electronic market.

Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation’s banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. Here were Berkshire’s top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing: FIRM MARKET VALUE OF STAKE AMOUNT OF SHARES CHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER American Express $7.84 billion 151,610,700 No change Wells Fargo $9.89 billion 352,327,608 + 9,703,683 shares US Bancorp $1.76 billion 69,039,426 No change Source: Bloomberg News/S.E.C. filing Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&amp;T Bank Corporation. Of course, Mr. Buffett’s most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. Still, not all of Mr. Buffett’s Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm’s stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.) Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Buffett Invests $5 Billion in Bank of America To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett undertook a highly unusual move. He stepped in as Salomon’s chairman in 1991 after John Gutfreund was forced to resign following a Treasury securities bidding scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving the firm from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. (He famously delivered the following lines in his testimony before Congress on the scandal: “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”) Mr. Buffett stepped down as Salomon’s chairman after roughly 10 months. Berkshire sold its shares in the firm in 1997, after Salomon was sold to what is now Citigroup. Outside of banks, Mr. Buffett declined to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1993. After LTCM faced collapse in 1998 amid a global financial crisis, its officials approached Mr. Buffett — and he again passed.

The list of cards that have eliminated foreign transaction fees, which tack up to 3 percent onto your purchases, is growing, and using the right card can save you money on your vacation. The latest entry to the field is the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card. The card carries no foreign transaction fees and is offering a bonus of 50,000 rewards points if you spend $3,000 in the first three months. The card has a $95 annual fee, but it’s waived for the first year. The Sapphire card joins Chase’s existing offerings that don’t charge the annoying fees, including its British Airways Visa Signature Card, the Hyatt Card and the Priority Club Select Visa Card. Capital One offers several cards with no foreign exchange fees and no annual fee as well; card comparison site Cardhub.com has a list. Citigroup has eliminated the charges on its ThankYou Premier and ThankYou Prestige cards. And American Express doesn’t charge the fees on its Platinum and Centurion cards. An analysis by Cardhub showed that using credit cards with no currency conversion fees save consumers an average of 7.9 percent when compared to exchange rates offered at banks and 14.7 percent when compared to airport exchange services. Even if you are stuck with a card that charges the fee, you’ll still come out ahead using plastic, the survey found: You’ll save 4.9 percent on average and 11.7 percent, compared to banks and airport currency exchange services, respectively. What card do you use when you travel internationally?</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/23/technology/23locate.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express Teams With Foursquare<date>Published: June 22, 2011</date><text>When the New York start-up Foursquare Labs made its debut in 2009, it quickly began popularizing the idea of “checking in,” or using a cellphone application to tell friends that you are at a particular restaurant, bar or park.Then Facebook and Google borrowed the concept — and even the term check in. Analysts and users alike wondered if those Internet giants would squash Foursquare like a bug. Thus far, it seems, Foursquare is holding its ground. The company said this week that it had hit 10 million registered users, though it would not say how many of those are active. And on Thursday, Foursquare plans to introduce its largest partnership to date: a national deal with American Express to offer discounts to cardholders when they check in on their cellphone at certain shops and restaurants. Foursquare users are accustomed to receiving awards in the form of coupons and digital merit badges. But more substantial deals like those being offered to American Express cardholders may bring Foursquare and other location-based services further into the mainstream. These services have been slower to catch on among people who do not live in dense urban areas like Manhattan, where encounters with friends are often just a cab ride away. In May, the Pew Research Center found that only 4 percent of American adults use such services to share their location. Companies like Foursquare are turning to deals as a way to make their offerings more appealing to those who may not want to meet up after work for a drink but would be interested in getting a deep discount on sneakers. “In 2010, it was all about the check in,” said Noah Elkin, a mobile industry analyst with eMarketer, an advertising and marketing firm. “Now, it’s about checking out.” Although Foursquare will not be receiving any revenue from the American Express deal, it says the promotion will help legitimize the company’s approach and will help attract other, more lucrative partnerships. To start, American Express will offer deals at Sports Authority and the clothing retailer H&amp;M, along with a few restaurants in New York, like Union Square Cafe and the barbecue joint Blue Smoke. For example, shoppers who spend $75 at H&amp;M will receive a $10 credit to their American Express accounts. Those who spend $50 at Sports Authority will get a $20 reward. Edward P. Gilligan, vice chairman of American Express, said the national rollout came after a test run in March at the South by Southwest music and technology conference. On average, those in the program spent 20 percent more than American Express cardholders who did not have access to the special deals, Mr. Gilligan said. “We’ve always done marketing with merchants to make offers to our card members, like send offers through direct mail, put information about sales on the Internet,” he said. “But those response rates tend to be low.” The test version of the Foursquare tie-up brought a “higher response rate than anything else we’re doing,” Mr. Gilligan said. American Express also hopes that by pairing with a start-up that appeals to the hip and technologically skilled, it can appeal to a younger crowd. “We don’t tend to skew under 35,” said Mr. Gilligan. “We hope this will help us stay relevant to younger customers.” He said the company elected to team up with Foursquare instead of Google or Facebook because Foursquare already has a widely accepted loyalty system that rewards heavy users. American Express may work with other companies in the future, Mr. Gilligan said, although he said he was confident that Foursquare would be the company’s focus for awhile. “The whole point is for us to find our customers where they are already active,” he said. Dennis Crowley, the chief executive and one of the founders of Foursquare, attributed its continued momentum to its singular focus on location. “When people think about Facebook, they think about it as a place to send their friends messages or post updates, not necessarily as a place to check in,” he said. “We’re associated with one thing, location, and that really helps.” He also said that the American Express partnership was a sign that Foursquare, which now has roughly $21 million from investors and more than 60 employees, was maturing. “We started out offering coupons for Tasti D-Lite and other smaller deals, and now we’re introducing deals to the millions that use American Express,” he said. Foursquare is growing faster than similar start-ups. Gowalla, another check-in service based in Austin, Tex., has about one million users, while Loopt, a rival mobile location service, has more than five million. Google says its Latitude service has 10 million users who were active in the last 30 days, though that includes people who used it on PCs. Malorie Lucich, a spokeswoman at Facebook, declined to say how its location-based service, called Places, was faring. In the past, the company has said that more than 250 million people were using its mobile application, though it has not offered specifics about the location service. Analysts say the ability of such services to offer shoppers customized deals will become more valuable as the daily deal and coupon market becomes ever more cluttered. “If you look at LivingSocial and Groupon, they put out a lot of offers, but they are random,” said Madeline K. Aufseeser, a senior analyst at the Aite Group, a research and advisory firm focused on the financial services industry. “You might be a man and constantly getting offers from beauty services you don’t want.” Partnerships like the American Express one, she said, will appeal to merchants because the pitches are aimed at those who will actually use them. In addition, businesses that work with Foursquare and American Express will be able to abandon paper coupons or even the need to scan their phone’s screen at a terminal. The rewards will be tallied behind the scenes with each swipe and tap. “There’s a whole new industry evolving around delivering more sophisticated, geographic-based offers,” she said. “It’s only going to get a lot more powerful.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/new-american-express-prepaid-card-is-light-on-fees/?ref=americanexpresscompany">New American Express Prepaid Card Is Light on Fees<date>June 14, 2011, 10:50 am</date><text>Courtesy of American ExpressAmerican Express’ prepaid card. Many prepaid cards are known for charging fees at every turn — fees to activate the card, fees to make a purchase, even fees to call customer service. But American Express is coming out with a reloadable prepaid card on Tuesday that appears to right many of the industry’s wrongs: You can order the reloadable card online at no cost, and there are no hidden fees lurking in the fine print. And even more impressively, you can use the card overseas and you won’t be charged any of the pesky foreign exchange transaction fees that most American Express credit and charge cards usually hit you with. “The prepaid market is synonymous with fees,” said Dan Schulman, president of the company’s enterprise growth group. “If we were going to enter the market, we wanted to be a consumer champion.” Of course, Amex isn’t forgoing profits for the sake of consumers. The company can afford to be competitive because it owns the payment network that process its transactions. So instead of collecting fees from consumers, it makes money on the fees that it collects from retailers every time you swipe your card. Keep in mind that American Express levies higher swipe fees than Visa and MasterCard, so its cards are not as widely accepted for that reason. Starting today, you can order the card online at no cost and load money onto the card through a checking account (but not through a credit card). You can also reload the card online at no cost, as well as set up recurring transactions so that your funds are replenished every week or month, for example. In coming months, customers will also be able to load the cards with money via direct deposit, Mr. Schulman said. You could automatically add, say, $100 per pay check to the card. But it will cost you $4.95 if you want to load the card with cash. It also takes some doing. Here’s how it would work, at least for now: You can order the prepaid card online for free and then buy what’s known as a “Green Dot MoneyPak” at major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid and 7-Eleven. You would pick up the MoneyPak from the prepaid section and take it to the cashier, who would then load the amount you want onto the MoneyPak (you can typically load $25 to $500 at most retailers) and charge you the $4.95 fee. One you have the loaded MoneyPak in hand, you would either go to MoneyPak.com or call 1-800-GreenDot to transfer the money to the Amex prepaid card. American Express doesn’t charge any fees to load the card with a MoneyPak, and it will refund the $4.95 fee on the first MoneyPak you purchase. The prepaid card will be likely available in retail stores later this year for those who don’t want to buy it online. Typically, those retailers charge a nominal fee, also in the neighborhood of $4.95, to provide the cards; Mr. Schulman said he’d like to keep that charge as low as possible. But it’s still too soon to say how much, if anything, it will cost to load the card. “You have a lot of folks who don’t have access to credit or charge cards and they want to have the safety of having the card,” Mr. Schulman said. “They want to be able to make online transactions and they want a budgetary tool.” Some more particulars: The card has no activation or maintenance fees, nor are there any fees to make purchases, balance inquiries, or to replace a card. The funds on the card do not expire, and you can load up to $2,500 on the card. If the car is lost or stolen, the money on the card will be replaced if you report it to the company. The first monthly A.T.M. withdrawal is free, after which you’ll be charged $2 (that doesn’t include any fees charged by the bank or ATM network). Users also have the option to disable ATM access. Some perks: You can add additional users to the card, like a family member or babysitter, for instance. You can also see your transaction history online or receive e-mail or text alerts for low funds or notification when a transaction has occurred. Like a regular Amex card, your purchases are protected against accidental damage or theft for 90 days from the date of purchase, up to $1,000 per occurrence. And though there’s been a recent uptick in credit cards that have stopped charging transaction fees on purchases denominated in currencies other than dollars, most cards still charge them. You’ll avoid those charges on the Amex prepaid card; dollars are converted at the same rate as if you used a regular American Express credit or charge card, but you won’t be charged the 2.7 percent fee that typically accompanies those transactions. Would you use the new prepaid card? If anyone decides to order the card, please let us know what your experience was like in the comment section below.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/american-express-costco-card-to-lower-restaurant-rebate/?ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express Costco Card to Lower Restaurant Rebate<date>June 1, 2011, 11:59 am</date><text>It’s a fact of life for credit card reward chasers — almost inevitably, the most generous cards end up scaling back the goodies sooner or later. A while back, it was the Charles Schwab Visa that stopped paying a 2 percent rebate. And now it’s the Costco True Earnings American Express Card. Starting Aug. 1, the cash rebate will fall to 2 percent from 3 percent for restaurant purchases. Also, people who carry a less-used “Cash Rebate” version of the card will need to spend $7,500 in a year before they graduate to a higher cash-back earning tier that is unique to that card; currently, they need to spend $5,000. These are the only changes that Amex is making. The 3 percent gas rebate will remain on the True Earnings Card for purchases up to $3,000 each year, and there is still no annual fee besides whatever you pay to be a Costco member each year. So why this and why now? Leah Gerstner, a spokeswoman for American Express, said that rewards were expensive and that the company needed to make adjustments given the costs associated with increased regulatory scrutiny. “We still have some of the richest cards in the market,” she added. Which is true. But the gluttons among us will soon be paying just a bit more out of pocket to feed our faces. Meanwhile, any guesses as to which card will see the next devaluation?</text></article><article index="9" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/troubled-employers-and-your-company-charge-card/?ref=americanexpresscompany">Troubled Employers and Your Company Charge Card<date>May 3, 2011, 1:55 pm</date><text>Buried near the end of a lengthy New York magazine profile of voluptuous financier Lynn Tilton was a nugget that caught our eye here at Bucks. The story describes how an employee at Stila Cosmetics, a company that Tilton’s firm, Patriarch Partners, bought in a distress sale 2009, complained to Ms. Tilton that some workers “had found themselves personally saddled with the bill for their corporate AmEx.” (Stila previously was owned by Sun Capital Partners, but ended up in the hands of its lenders after Stila defaulted on a loan, according to an account of the sale in The Wall Street Journal that is posted on Patriarch’s Web site.) That didn’t seem fair — and in fact the scenario appears to conflict with information provided by American Express as to how such situations are usually handled. Molly Faust, a spokeswoman for Amex’s global commercial card business, said she is unfamiliar with the specifics of the Stila situation. But there are two ways that companies can handle corporate Amex accounts. In the first option, companies are liable for card balances, whether or not their workers follow the company’s expense policy. In the second option, employees can be on the hook — but only if they break the rules, like buying personal items on the card. Ms. Faust said both setups are common. In general, she said, whether they work for a company in a distressed sale scenario or not, “corporate card members,” as American Express calls them, aren’t liable for the balance as they have met their responsibilities in managing the account. Those include following their employer’s expense policy, filing timely expense reports and submitting any reimbursements promptly to American Express (in some cases, companies pay the employee, who then uses the funds to pay the Amex balance). American Express generally works with the company and the employee to sort things out. If a situation arises in which the card holder has paid their balance but hasn’t been reimbursed when the company runs into financial woes, “we would work with the card member,” she said. “If they have fulfilled their responsibilities, they are not held liable.” In other words, as long as you didn’t treat your family to dinner at The Palm and charge it to the company plastic, and you have filed your legitimate expenses on time, you’re off the hook. Or you should be, at least. The story attributes the anecdote to Emil Gioliotti, Patriarch’s managing director. He didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking more details of what happened with Stila’s corporate card holders. A spokesman for Patriarch, Steven Goldberg, declined to comment and referred an inquiry to Sun Capital, Stila’s previous owner. A Sun Capital spokeswoman said that no one was available to comment. If nothing else, you may want to be extra careful about saving receipts and filing expense reports quickly if you’re worried about your company’s health. Meanwhile, have any of you ever had trouble getting reimbursed for work expenses, or for money you fronted to a corporate card provider when you worked at a troubled company? If so we’d like to hear about it.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/big-changes-to-american-expresss-blue-cash-card/?ref=americanexpresscompany">Big Changes to American Express's Blue Cash Card<date>April 27, 2011, 8:46 am</date><text>American Express is altering the rewards formula on its popular Blue Cash card, but current users will be grandfathered in under the old program for now. Starting today, there are two cards, the Everyday card, which will have no annual fee, and the Preferred card, which will cost $75 a year. The old card had no annual fee. Holders of the Everyday card will earn 3 percent cash back at grocery stores, 2 percent back at gas stations and department stores and 1 percent back on all other purchases. The old card gave back 5 percent on all gas, grocery and drug stores once you passed $6,500 in total annual spending, which made the card popular among big spenders. The Preferred card adds that $75 annual fee and will give away an industry-leading 6 percent on groceries though just 3 percent on gas and department stores. And the all-other-spending category yields 1 percent from the first dollar you spend, not the 1.25 percent that existing customers earn when they spend beyond $6,500. So what’s going on here and why? Well, few companies make a move in the card industry these days without a spreadsheet-wielding army behind them with models showing that the card issuer will come out ahead when all is said and done. E-Bai Koo, an American Express vice president, wouldn’t comment on its model. That said, the company deserves some credit for not forcing the new scheme on current customers. Giving 5 percent back on fuel purchases left the company vulnerable to volatile gas prices. Plus, it exposed the company to people trying to game the system by using the card as a business card to pay for fuel for a fleet of vehicles. Grocery spending is a little less subject to those sorts of shenanigans, since there is only so much one can eat or stockpile. And Mr. Koo noted that government data shows that people traditionally spend more on groceries than gas. When I heard that changes were afoot, I worried that American Express was moving to the same noxious system as the ones that Discover, Chase and Bank of America use on some cards, where there’s a different cash-back bonus every few months. Once you figure out what it is, there are sometimes caps on how much you can get back and you may have to register to earn the rebate. Mr. Koo said the company learned in its research that people aren’t big fans of that approach, so the company decided to avoid it. And there are no limits on how much cash you can earn each year through the Blue cards. You get the cash back by requesting a credit on your statement; you can do this as long as there is at least $25 available. Merchandise and gift cards are an option, too, in lieu of the rebate. Personally, I find this one tempting. The majority of my household’s groceries come from Fresh Direct, an online grocery service. Our $5,000 or so annual bill would yield $225 each year after the annual fee, which is still more than a 4 percent rebate. Anyone else tempted?</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/small-players-offer-smart-cards-but-not-big-banks/?ref=americanexpresscompany">Small Players Offer Smart Cards, but Not Big Banks<date>April 12, 2011, 6:15 pm</date><text>You may have read in this newspaper about some Americans having problems using their credit or debit cards overseas because the cards rely on older “magnetic stripe” technology. Many countries are switching to more fraud-resistant cards that use tiny chips to conduct transactions. Some vendors in Europe, like those selling tickets or services at unattended kiosks (gas pumps, for instance), can’t process the magnetic stripe cards, which remain the standard for credit and debit cards issued in the United States. So if, like most Americans, you bank at a financial institution in the United States, your card could potentially cause you some problems overseas — unless, that is, you happen to be a member of a small credit union. The State Employees’ Credit Union of Raleigh, N.C., just started offering debit cards with the so-called E.M.V. chips (for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) to members who bank at its 236 branches throughout North Carolina. “We had begun to hear about problems with acceptance from members traveling internationally,” said Leanne Phelps, senior vice president of card services at the credit union. “It was sporadic.” Just a small percentage of the credit union’s debit transactions are international. But after hearing the complaints and realizing that both Canada and Mexico were moving to the chip cards, Ms. Phelps said she became convinced that her institution should make the switch. “We’re sandwiched between those two countries,” she said. Last month, the credit union began switching over the cards used for its “travel” debit accounts — a sort of forced budgeting mechanism marketed to globetrotting members. The accounts have a dedicated debit card and a balance fixed by the user, to avoid overspending while on a vacation. By the end of this year, however, the credit union aims to equip all of its debit cards with the chip technology. Another credit union, the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York, has been offering credit cards with the chips for about a year. So if small credit unions are offering the latest card technology to members, why don’t big banks? The answer to that question is a bit complicated, said Martin Ferenczi, managing director of card systems in the United States for Oberthur Technologies, a large maker of E.M.V. chips. Oberthur entered the American market in 1994, and is still waiting for widespread adoption. “We’ve been very patient,” Mr. Ferenczi said. “The only country not very advanced in this technology is the United States.” To be fair, he noted, one reason the United States has been slow to adopt E.M.V. technology is that there has been less card-related fraud here than in other countries. So banks haven’t felt enough of a financial hit from crime to justify the switch to chip cards, which are more expensive. But that may no longer be the case, as banks come under pressure from coming changes in the structure of swipe fees that banks charge retailers. The paradox here is that the organization that manages the technology standards for the chip cards, EMVCo, is owned in part by American Express, MasterCard and Visa. So why can’t they do something to advance the chips — especially American Express, which markets itself heavily to travelers? Marina Hoffmann Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said the card companies are just one player in the business. The other two are the banks that actually issue the cards to their customers and the retailers, which must adopt readers that can process the new technology. Everyone has to get on board, she said, for the switch to occur. Currently, any cards issued in the United States with E.M.V. chips must also have magnetic stripes, or they aren’t usable in domestic stores. Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance, which promotes the adoption of chip cards, said big banks in the United States had been more focused recently on gaining an edge in mobile payment systems and in so-called contactless cards — another type of card that lets you pay for things by waving the card past a reader. Smaller banks and credit unions, which aren’t likely to get out in front in those areas, may see offering E.M.V.-chip cards as a way to distinguish themselves from the competition, he said. Meantime, Mr. Vanderhoof suggested an alternative for European travelers who don’t want to be inconvenienced. Travelex, which maintains currency exchange outlets at many airports, will issue prepaid, E.M.V.-compliant cards in your choice of euros or pounds. Just load up the card before you board, and you won’t have to worry about having coming up short on your trip. Have you encountered any troubles with your magnetic stripe cards while traveling overseas? Have you asked your bank for a chip-based card?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/for-luxury-car-customers-an-amex-card-that-drives-a-hard-bargain/?ref=americanexpresscompany">For Luxury Car Customers, an AmEx Card That Drives a Hard Bargain<date>January 27, 2011, 12:25 pm</date><text>American Express From our colleagues at Bucks: Negotiating the price of a car can be a painful process, a game of cat and mouse between you and the salesman. Several companies offer programs to negotiate a price before going into the car dealership, including Consumer Reports and USAA, the insurer. On Tuesday, American Express announced that it had added its own auto program for its wealthiest customers. Holders of the Centurion card, more commonly known as the black card, will be able to negotiate the price of a car through the members-only Centurion Web site, and they will have the added benefit of being able to do so without having to reveal any personal information. In addition, on certain cars, they will get added perks. Tesla, for instance, is offering a media upgrade package, and Jaguar has added financial incentives. Beyond offering help in negotiating the price of a car, the Centurion auto program has two other perks. Customers can get access to luxury rentals — a Ferrari for the weekend, for example — as well as driving experiences on Formula 1 racing courses. Desiree Fish, vice president of public affairs for American Express, said the program was an addition to luxury perks it offers Centurion members in fashion, food, wine and travel. She declined to say how many people hold the card. The company is starting the program to tap into what she said was an increase in spending among its wealthiest clients. “The economy is starting to pick up, so there is more of an interest now in people out there spending,” Ms. Fish said. “Auto is something we haven’t done before. We wanted to do something robust.” While holders of the black card were officially told about the program on Tuesday, Ms. Fish said the auto page had previously been public (though buried on the site) to test the technology. “Five cars have been sold already in the last two weeks,” she said. “They’ve found this info on their own, no marketing or promoting.” Apparently, even people buying a Jaguar are looking for a deal.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25amex.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Revenue Grows 13% at American Express<date>Published: January 24, 2011</date><text>The American Express Company, the credit card lender and payment network, said Monday that its fourth-quarter revenue grew 13 percent from the period a year earlier, as consumer spending increased and the company earned more from fees.The company said that it had $7.3 billion of total revenue net of interest expense in the quarter, compared with $6.5 billion a year earlier. American Express narrowly missed analysts’ expectations last week when it said it had earned $1.1 billion, or 88 cents a share, for the quarter. It also said it was cutting 550 customer service jobs. The company said the increase in revenue resulted from an accounting change as well as increased spending on American Express cards. The chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in the earnings statement that customers increased their spending on their cards by 15 percent in the quarter. The company also benefited from fewer losses on soured loans. “Unemployment levels and housing remain a concern, but other aspects of the economy continue to show signs of improvement,” he said. American Express, which lends directly to consumers but also competes with Visa and MasterCard to process credit card transactions, has recovered from the financial crisis more fully than many other consumer lenders. The company’s shares closed down less than 1 percent at $45.79 on Monday, and fell about 1.1 percent in after-hours trading.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/business/20amex.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express to Cut Jobs and Close Customer Service Centers<date>Published: January 19, 2011</date><text>American Express said on Wednesday that it would close customer service centers and cut 550 jobs as it helps more people on the Internet, a move that will cost the company $74 million after taxes.The company, a credit card lender and payment processing network, will move another 3,000 jobs to different locations as part of its reorganization, it said. The restructuring charge will reduce fourth-quarter profit by 6 cents a share. American Express, which was scheduled to report its quarterly earnings Monday, said it earned $1.1 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the quarter. Excluding the charge, the company’s 94-cent profit missed analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. American Express shares fell 2.44 percent to close at $45.24. The earnings miss was an unpleasant surprise to some investors, considering positive trends on spending volume and credit, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill, Michael Taiano, said. The chief executive of American Express, Kenneth I. Chenault, cited “record levels” of customer spending on their credit cards, and said in the earnings release that credit losses also continued to shrink. Mr. Taiano said American Express unsettled investors by reporting earnings on Wednesday but making them wait until Monday for a full explanation. “The problem with doing something like this is you give the bottom line number without all the details, and people start to speculate,” he said. Even with the charges, American Express profit will rise by nearly half from the $716 million, or 60 cents a share, reported a year ago. Declining loan losses let the company reduce the amount of money it sets aside as provisions, bolstering profit. American Express will close a customer service center in Greensboro, N.C., and send the jobs to three other locations in the United States. The company will relocate some jobs in Madrid to Britain and Argentina. It will move service support for its Japanese card business to Japan from Australia. American Express said more customers were handling routine matters through the Internet and with mobile devices, reducing the number of telephone calls to its service centers. Staffing levels fell largely through attrition, or not filling vacant jobs after employees left, the company said. The moves should generate additional charges of $60 million to $80 million this year, related to real estate closings and employee compensation. It plans to finish the process by the end of the year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/opinion/07zelizer.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">The Best Present Money Can Buy<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>Princeton, N.J. NOW that the holidays are over, many disappointed gift-recipients are heading to the mall to return their useless, unattractive or thoughtless presents. Next year, why not spare them the trouble, and give cash instead? It makes economic sense — many economists see cash as the most efficient gift, because it allows recipients to choose exactly what they want. But this horrifies traditionalists, who see giving cash for Christmas as the ultimate commodification of a sacred ritual. Money is acceptable for charitable donations or bonuses, but certainly not for friends or family. It turns out that both the economic realists who give money as presents and the traditionalists have history on their side, because this is a debate that began back in the early 20th century. As the consumer society expanded and Americans began giving more Christmas presents to more people, money emerged as an acceptable gift. Christmas money, according to a 1912 issue of Ladies’ Home Journal, “supplies dearly cherished wishes, adds small luxuries, prevents worriment and gives opportunities for helpfulness as no other gift does.” But how was a recipient to know that a dollar was a gift dollar? That something made of the same legal tender used to buy the daily newspaper, tip waiters and bribe politicians was in fact a gift expressing personal affection? The challenges of giving money were captured by this 1920s vaudeville act: HE It’s bad form for a person to leave the price mark on a gift, isn’t it? SHE Yes, and I knew a woman who was so absent-minded that when she gave a $50 bill for a Christmas gift, she tried to rub the price mark off of it. ... She was giving the $50 bill to her married daughter, and didn’t want her to know how much it was worth. HE And what did her married daughter do with the $50 bill, when she got it? SHE She took the money, and paid the grocer what she owed him. HE And what did her mother do? SHE Her mother cried, and said, although she loved to give a Christmas present, there wasn’t much fun in paying her son-in-law’s grocery bill. The key to the problem, early 20th-century gift-givers found, was to camouflage money inside a traditional gift. This took effort and it had nothing to do with efficiency, but it enabled people to elevate the gift of cash. In the December 1909 Ladies’ Home Journal, for instance, the writer Lou Eleanor Colby said she had found a way to “disguise the money so that it would not seem just like a commercial transaction.” She explained how she had incorporated $10 for her mother into artwork. She inserted dollar bills into two posters; one showed five sad bills not knowing where to go, and the other depicted the happy ending: “five little dollars speeding joyfully” toward her mother’s purse. Housewives hid gold coins in cookies and boxes of candies; dollar bills could decorate belt-buckles or picture frames. Women boasted when the recipient failed to realize that the actual present was money. Men also disguised the money they gave to their wives as gifts, to distinguish it from their allowances. If you give her a check, The Ladies’ Home Journal advised, “put it in an embroidered purse, or a leather sewing basket or a jewel box which will be a little gift in itself.” The better the disguise, the more successful the gift. Then, in 1910, American Express began advertising money orders as an “acceptable Christmas gift.” Western Union improved on the idea by creating distinctive telegrams for sending money for special occasions, while greeting card companies started selling decorative money holders for birthdays and holidays. After 1905, department stores even designed a new currency: gift certificates. Also called merchandise coupons or gift bonds, these were for a specific sum of money to be spent either on a designated type of merchandise — gloves and shoes were popular items — or, as today, on anything at all at a particular store. We can’t all be as clever as Lou Eleanor Colby, but buying a gift card that restricts what the money can be used for is just another way of distinguishing gift money from regular money, and a way for givers to demonstrate their intimate knowledge of what the recipient likes and cares about. Nostalgic traditionalists and hard-nosed realists both get it wrong. For over a century, Americans have been demonstrating remarkable ingenuity in turning money into meaningful personal gifts. Let’s keep it up. Next year, perhaps take a lesson from the pages of The Ladies’ Home Journal and hide cash in a gift of your own creation. Viviana A. Zelizer, a professor of sociology at Princeton, is the author of âEconomic Lives: How Culture Shapes the Economy.â</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/sports/basketball/20sponsor.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express Returns as an Official N.B.A. Sponsor<date>Published: December 19, 2010</date><text>After a five-year absence, American Express will announce on Monday that it has again become the official charge card of the N.B.A.The deal, which is for three years, will also include USA Basketball, the W.N.B.A. and the N.B.A. Development League. As with its sponsorships in golf and tennis, American Express will give its cardholders exclusive access to game tickets and to events like the N.B.A. draft and musical performances during All-Star Game weekend, as well as opportunities to meet players and coaches. “We’ll provide access to largely hard-to-get tickets,” said Courtney Kelso, the vice president for global media and sponsorship marketing at American Express. Kelso said that a significant jump in requests from cardholders for tickets prompted American Express to seek a sponsorship with the league. American Express will advertise on NBA TV. The company is considering a separate N.B.A.-themed marketing campaign. When American Express was an N.B.A. sponsor from 1995 to 2005, the company ran popular ad campaigns, including one that featured Don Nelson using his charge card to buy German dictionaries so he could learn to speak the language with Dirk Nowitzki. American Express will expand its existing deals with the Boston Celtics, the Knicks, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Washington Wizards. Earlier this year, American Express was upstaged by Chase, which signed a long-term deal with Madison Square Garden, where American Express has long been a sponsor. American Express is the fourth major sponsorship for the N.B.A. this year. The league has also made deals with Bacardi, State Farm and BBVA, the Spanish financial giant, which signed a four-year agreement worth more than $100 million. Mark Tatum, the executive vice president for global marketing partnerships at the N.B.A, said, “The resurgence of the Knicks, the Heat, the Spurs, the Lakers, the Celtics: there are very exciting story lines and people want to be associated with the N.B.A. right now.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EFDE1330F935A25751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">ARTS, BRIEFLY; American Express Gift For Ellis Island Group<date>Published: December 16, 2010</date><text>On the brink of extinction last spring, the nonprofit organization charged with restoring Ellis Island will benefit from a $100,000 gift from American Express, the credit card company is to announce on Thursday.

India has customer support centers, research laboratories and low-cost lawyers.And Sri Lanka’s contribution to global outsourcing? Accountants — thousands of them, standing ready to crunch the world’s numbers. As this tiny island nation staggers back from a bloody, decades-long civil war, one of its brightest business prospects was born from a surprising side effect of that conflict. Many Sri Lankans, for various reasons, studied accounting in such numbers during the war that this nation of about 20 million people now has an estimated 10,000 certified accountants. An additional 30,000 students are currently enrolled in accounting programs, according to the Sri Lankan Institute of Chartered Accountants. While that ratio is lower than in developed economies like the United States, it is much greater than in Sri Lanka’s neighboring outsourcing giant, India. Offices in Sri Lanka are doing financial work for some of the world’s biggest companies, including the international bank HSBC and the insurer Aviva. And it is not simply payroll and bookkeeping. The outsourced work includes derivatives pricing and risk management for money managers and hedge funds, stock research for investment banks and underwriting for insurance companies. Many developing countries have “one particular competency that they do better than anyone else,” said Duminda Ariyasinghe, an executive director at Sri Lanka’s Board of Investment. “Financial accounting is that door opener for us.” With widespread use of English and a literacy rate of over 90 percent, along with rock-bottom wages, Sri Lanka hopes to transform its postwar economy from a sleepy tea and textiles island into a tiny, high-end outsourcing powerhouse. Already there are thousands of other Sri Lankans working in more common outsourcing fields, like information technology and software development. About 50,000 people in Sri Lanka are now employed in one form of outsourcing or another, according to Slasscom, an outsourcing trade group, and that figure is growing by 20 percent a year. But accounting is Sri Lanka’s specialty. During the war, Sri Lankan certified accountants would often use their skills as a springboard out of the country. That is why there are now Sri Lankans sprinkled among executive suites around the world, including the vice president of global business services at American Express and a financial controller at Standard Chartered Bank in the United Arab Emirates. Now, though, the government and business community hope the country’s young financial whizzes will have reason to stay home instead. Sri Lanka’s government, headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, expects revenue from so-called knowledge-based outsourcing — which includes accounting — to triple to $1 billion in revenue by 2015. The stark wage differences between Sri Lanka and America, or even Sri Lanka and India, are a big part of the country’s drawing card. In the United States, the median annual wage for accountants and auditors in May 2008 was $59,430, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lankan workers in the accounting profession receive an average annual pay package of $5,900, according to a 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Wages in Sri Lanka for financial outsourcing are about one-third less than in neighboring India, and hiring educated employees is easier in Sri Lanka, according to executives who do business in both countries. “Skilled talent is accessible,” said Dushan Soza, managing director of the Sri Lanka office of WNS Global Services, an outsourcing company with about 350 people in the country. Because Sri Lanka’s accountants are still a relatively untapped asset on the global market, Mr. Soza said, hiring is easy and turnover is minimal. In the Indian city Mumbai, companies like his would have to go far out of the city to hire because of the level of competition, he said, but here in Colombo “two miles from my office is my hiring range.” Many international executives also quietly admit that Colombo’s colonial architecture, excellent seafood restaurants and proximity to miles of sandy beaches make it a more alluring business travel destination than India’s outsourcing centers. Sri Lanka’s accounting specialty is rooted in the country’s history of colonialism and conflict. State-financed universities here have traditionally not had enough places for qualified students, and they were often closed intermittently during the war. So students who could afford to attended private schools instead — in many cases accounting schools with British origins that date to Sri Lanka’s independence from Britain in 1948. Over time, becoming a qualified accountant has become something well-educated, business-minded people in Sri Lanka do in addition to getting a degree in, say, physics or business management.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/22cards.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">The Mundane Credit Card Gets a Modern Makeover<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>The simple credit card is about to get a makeover.Next month, Citibank will begin testing a card that has two buttons and tiny lights that allow users to choose at the register whether they want to pay with rewards points or credit, at most any merchant they please. Other card issuers are testing more newfangled cards, including some that can double as credit and debit cards, and cards with fraud protections baked right into the plastic. One, for instance, shows a portion of the account number only after the cardholder enters a PIN. The microscopic engine powering the plastic will help breathe new life into a 1950s-era technology — the black magnetic stripe found on the back of the 1.8 billion credit and debit cards circulating in the United States. Much of the world has already moved to using more advanced cards, like the ones in Europe that require a PIN and use a chip instead of a magnetic strip. Even with the innovations, no one knows how long plastic cards will reign. They may eventually be rendered obsolete by technologies that will transform consumers’ cellphones into virtual wallets, and a large number of companies, including Visa, MasterCard and Apple, are developing these. But several card analysts say it will probably take a while before any one technology standard becomes available across all phones and merchants. In the meantime, banks are hedging their bets. Citi’s cards — known as 2G, for second generation — are no thicker and just as flexible as conventional plastic, but they contain a battery with a four-year life, an embedded chip and, of course, the buttons, which took nearly a year and hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop. “It’s a big deal,” said Megan Bramlette, director of research for the Auriemma Consulting Group, a payments industry consultant in New York. “If once a month a consumer can fill up their gas tank for free, and they don’t have to do anything except push a button before they swipe their card, that’s cool. And that is something that I think will resonate with consumers.” Dynamics Inc., the company that developed the minicomputers-in-a-card, said that it had more cards in the works and that its bank partners would introduce its electronic cards on their own schedules. Citi’s cards will be tested by a select group of cardholders beginning in November, though some Citi employees have been testing the cards since May. The pilot program will expand as Citi incorporates user feedback. The bank plans to make the cards available on a broader scale in mid to late 2011. The 2G card will be offered on two of Citi’s existing rewards cards, including the Citi Dividend Platinum Select MasterCard, whose holders earn 1 percent cash back on all purchases and 2 percent on categories that change seasonally, as well as the Citi PremierPass Elite, whose holders generally earn one point for every dollar spent and mile flown. To pay with points, users press the request-rewards button before swiping the card; the button marked regular credit allows a straight credit transaction. Pressing the buttons changes the data imprinted on the magnetic stripe, so it still works like conventional plastic and can be swiped through existing card terminals nationwide. At least for now, cardholders need to know how many points they have, and if they don’t have enough, the transaction will be processed using credit. “We’ve developed a proprietary technology that will allow Citi to do the conversion when the transaction comes through,” said Terry O’Neil, executive vice president of Citi Cards. “All they need to do is push that request-rewards button and we take care of everything else for them. They leave the store with the merchandise they selected.” The cards are going to be most valuable to bigger spenders. The average cardholder spends about $6,300 a year, according to The Nilson Report, and, on a typical rewards card, users may earn one point for each dollar spent. At one penny a point, that translates into about $63 in annual rewards. Still, that is enough for a free cup or two of coffee each month. Citi may yet change its rewards equation or decide that redeeming points at certain locations will yield better returns. “What we want is to get feedback directly from the customers, which will influence how we will roll the cards out,” Mr. O’Neil said. “We want to dig a little deeper on what the right redemption model is.” American Express recently made its Membership Rewards points redeemable at Amazon.com, though they are not worth much: one point is equal to seven-tenths of penny that can be spent at the online retailer. “Creating greater flexibility on how you redeem rewards points has been percolating in the industry for two or three years now,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. “The novelty of being first to market is a plus for Citi. But I anticipate that other issuers will have the technology as well.” The technology that makes the new Citi card possible was created by Jeffrey D. Mullen, the 32-year-old chief executive of Dynamics, an electrical engineer and former patent lawyer who started the company in 2007 while he was working on his master’s degree in business at Carnegie Mellon. Months after he graduated, he secured $5.7 million in venture capital financing from Adams Capital Management. (Citi initially declined to issue him one of the electronic cards he had created, because he had used his entire credit line to start the company. He ultimately received one.) “We are just scratching the surface with what these cards can do with these initial products,” said Mr. Mullen, whose innovation won business plan competitions, as well as $1 million in free advertising at a recent technology conference. “We are trying to be the innovation arm of an industry that has never had one. With this card, which is the baby-step card, you need to acclimate the consumer.” Another Dynamics card would allow cardholders to have multiple accounts on one card, like a corporate and personal card. The company introduced another card this week, which he said would reduce fraud associated with “skimming,” when thieves steal your account number using a small scanner, but not your physical card. All the cards, which are being produced by laptop and cellphone manufacturers, were tested by robots to make sure they would hold up for thousands of swipes. They can also withstand the washing machine. Clearly, they cost more to develop than conventional plastic; Mr. Mullen declined to provide specifics. Citi said it had not yet determined whether customers would be required to pay for the cards once officially introduced. “The U.S. is the last bastion of the magnetic-stripe technology and shows no near-term desire to switch to chip technology,” said Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report. “So what Dynamics is doing is extending the life of the mag stripe by adding a number of features that you find on chip cards.”</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/business/22amex.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Profit Climbs 71% at American Express<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>The American Express Company said on Thursday that its third-quarter profit jumped 71 percent as cardholders spent more and the company wrote off fewer unpaid bills.The company’s net income rose to $1.08 billion, or 90 cents a share, from $632 million, or 53 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue jumped 17 percent, to $7.03 billion, from $6.02 billion last year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, expected profit of 86 cents a share, on revenue of $6.8 billion. Spending on American Express cards rose 14 percent in the quarter, the company said. The largest increases came from business cards, for which the company made changes to various programs. Revenue from its American cards rose 23 percent, to $3.66 billion. International card revenue edged up 1 percent, to $1.17 billion. While Amex customers are typically more affluent than the overall population, the chairman, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement that spending remained below levels reached before the recession “as card members continued to manage their finances carefully and pay down outstanding debt.” That trimmed profit because customers paid less interest on their lower balances, Mr. Chenault said, but it helped to improve the company’s risk profile. During the quarter, American Express’ write-off rate dropped below 5 percent of balances for the first time since early 2008. It is the lowest in the industry. Lower write-downs and delinquencies allowed the company to slash its provision for loan losses, or money set aside to cover loans that it does not expect to collect, by 68 percent, to $373 million, from $1.18 billion a year ago. The company said its move to consolidate securitized loans — those sold to investors — in the first quarter also helped increase profit in the period. Shares of American Express dipped 1 percent in after-hours trading, after the earnings were released. The stock closed the regular trading session up 54 cents at $40.27.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/05card.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">U.S. Proposes Settlement With MasterCard and Visa<date>Published: October 4, 2010</date><text>Consumers may see more discounts for using cash instead of a credit card under a tentative deal announced Monday by the Justice Department and the credit card companies Visa and MasterCard.The proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, came after a two-year investigation into rules imposed by Visa, MasterCard and American Express that often prohibit merchants from steering customers toward cash, checks or other payment types that avoid transaction fees. “We want to put more money in consumers’ pockets, and by eliminating credit card companies’ anticompetitive rules, we will accomplish that,” the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said at a news conference. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Visa, MasterCard and American Express on Monday. But while the government had already worked out a settlement with Visa and MasterCard, American Express said it would fight the claim. Seven states participated in the lawsuit. Every time a consumer uses a prepaid card, debit card or credit card to make a purchase, the card network charges the merchant a swipe fee, usually a penny or two for each dollar spent. The size of the swipe fee varies depending on the risk of nonpayment and the reward points tied to the card. Therefore, fees are generally lower for debit cards that take money directly from a bank account and higher for credit charges in which the consumer promises to pay later. The fees are even higher when the credit card being used is linked to a rich rewards program. Last year, those fees, which are divided between payment networks and the banks that issue their cards, cost merchants $35 billion, the Justice Department said. “The companies put merchants and consumers in a no-win situation: accept our card, pay our fees and don’t even think about trying to get a discount,” Mr. Holder said. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, merchants could offer consumers an immediate discount or rebate for using a particular type of payment, a particular credit card network (Visa versus American Express), or a low-cost card within that network (a Visa debit card rather than a Visa credit card). That may give merchants an incentive to steer consumers toward paying with cash or with no-frills credit cards without rewards programs because the swipe fees for those options are lower. The settlement also allows merchants to post the cost of using different types of payments. The settlement, however, does not allow merchants to levy a surcharge on credit and debit payments beyond the cost of the transaction, as some merchants had sought. Still, the deal was a victory for the nation’s merchants, which have long battled the payment networks over what they say are monopolistic practices. The two sides have been fighting in court for more than a decade. Merchants had already scored a major victory against the credit card networks earlier this year. As part of a major overhaul of financial regulation, Congress passed legislation that is expected to limit the swipe fees that Visa and MasterCard can charge merchants for each debit card transaction. “The tectonic plates underpinning this cartel are beginning to shift,” said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Retail Federation. “It’s not just merchants complaining. It’s Congress who is looking at it. The Fed is looking at it. The state attorney generals are looking at it. And there are private lawsuits.” “People are beginning to realize this is unacceptable behavior,” he said. Visa and MasterCard played down the significance of the settlement, and some analysts seemed to agree. “We feel that many merchants may find it impractical to implement discounting by card type, and that V/MA earn network fees regardless of product type, so that a direct impact from the rule change will likely be minimal,” Jason Kupferberg, an analyst with UBS Investment Research, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of both companies fell on Monday. Visa shares dropped 8 cents, to $73.24, while MasterCard declined $2.14, to $222.64. American Express vowed to fight the lawsuit, saying the settlement deal gave an unfair advantage to Visa and MasterCard. Edward P. Gilligan, the vice chairman of American Express, said the company had spent billions to build an affluent customer base and to differentiate itself from Visa and MasterCard. He said it would be unfair for merchants to take advantage of the investment by American Express and then steer customers to another network. Shares of American Express dropped 6.5 percent, or $2.73, on Monday, to $39.05. But Mr. Holder maintained that merchant rules of American Express were the most restrictive. In addition, American Express has the highest fees of any credit card company, he said. “Because of American Express’ current rules, some consumers will continue to pay higher prices,” he said. “That is unacceptable.” The changes resulting from the settlement could become visible to cardholders of Visa and MasterCard almost immediately, Mr. Holder said. “If you use a preferred, lower-cost credit card, an airline could offer you more miles or a merchant could provide you with a rebate,” he said. Mr. Duncan, of the National Retail Federation, said he could envision retailers offering free shipping on large-ticket purchases if a consumer used a less expensive type of card. “It will be as different as merchants are creative, which is how the market is supposed to work,” he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E0D81E3CF93BA2575AC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">BUCKS; Using Points At Amazon<date>Published: September 18, 2010</date><text>Here's some more Membership Rewards points news. American Express recently announced that its cardholders could now shop with their Membership Reward points at Amazon.com. Cardholders should keep in mind, however, that the points won't go far there. According to an American Express spokeswoman, the exchange ratio is 1,000 membership points equals $7, or each point equals 7/10 of a penny that can be spent at Amazon.com. In contrast, when cardholders purchase gift cards from other retailers through the Membership Rewards site, one point generally equals at least one penny on the gift card, if not more. In fact, $50 gift cards for Zappos.com, which is owned by Amazon.com, can be purchased for 5,000 points. (There's a chart with some of the gift card redemption rates below.) When asked about the disparity, a spokesman for Amazon.com directed us to American Express. American Express, meanwhile, seemed to attribute the exchange ratio difference to the different models of redemption -- in this case, directly shopping on Amazon.com vs. getting a gift card to spend at Zappos.com. ''Our point conversion rates vary across different types of redemption options and partners,'' said Joshua Berwitz, vice president of Membership Rewards, in a statement sent to us by an American Express spokeswoman. ''For example, there are different costs associated with cash redemption options than other types of rewards.'' Why would being able to shop directly at Amazon.com cost cardholders more than buying a gift card? Our theory is that consumers get a better deal on gift cards because retailers know that consumers often spend more than the face amount and that a certain percentage of people will never redeem the cards. By contrast, we figure that Amazon expects that all the Membership Rewards points will be used once the transaction has begun. Here's a look at how some exchange ratios compare. RetailerExchange RatioHow it Works Amazon.com1,000 points equals $7 Cardholders can use points to pay for all or part of their purchases on Amazon.com, including for tax and shipping. Gap1,000 points equals $10 Gift Card Saks Fifth Avenue5,000 points equals $50 Gift Card Zappos.com5,000 points equals $50 Gift Card Barnes &amp; Noble2,500 points equals $25 Gift Card Home Depot2,500 points equals $25 Gift Card Victoria's Secret2,500 points equals $25 Gift Card American Express gift card5,000 points equals $25 Gift Card Dell5,000 points equals $50 Gift Card When we asked American Express whether this theory was correct, the spokeswoman, Martha Cid, of an outside public relations firm, said that she couldn't speak for retailers but that ''conversion rates differ by partner and costs associated with offering the reward and the value of those rewards.'' When we pressed on whether it was the retailer that sets the rate or American Express, American Express said it would not disclose the details or terms of its contracts. Aaron Magness, senior director of brand marketing and business development for Zappos.com, meanwhile, wrote in an e-mail, in response to our inquiry, that ''since Zappos is run independently from Amazon, we don't have any insight into their contract negotiations or relationships.'' He added that ''the Zappos.com gift cards are in line with the same point model as other retailers in the Membership Rewards program.'' By the way, Amazon.com doesn't offer the lowest exchange rate for direct redemptions. At Ticketmaster.com, for instance, where cardholders can use points directly at checkout, one point is worth half a penny. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/membership-rewards-will-end-relationship-with-continental/?ref=americanexpresscompany">Membership Rewards Will End Relationship with Continental<date>September 15, 2010, 11:46 am</date><text>Updated 12:25 p.m. to add comment from Chase and additional information from Amex. American Express announced this morning that it would no longer allow its charge card customers to redeem their Membership Rewards points for frequent flier miles in Continental’s OnePass program come Sept. 30, 2011. Why would the company do such a thing? Well, it’s almost certainly not Amex’s doing. Instead, it has to do with the fallout from the coming merger of Continental and United. For decades now, American Express charge card customers have hoped for a simple, permanent way to turn their points into miles on American or United Airlines. Once Continental and United announced their merger, United customers realized that they might finally be able to pull off this transfer. First, they could move a bunch of Membership Rewards points into a Continental OnePass account. Then, once the merger was finalized and OnePass and United’s Mileage Plus programs were combined, the customers would have successfully turned Membership Rewards points into Mileage Plus miles (or whatever the frequent flier program of the combined airline will be called). This creates the possibility of a lot of increased liability for miles for the combined airline, which isn’t a good thing under any circumstance. But the party that was probably most instrumental in this move was Chase, which issues credit cards that earn both United and Continental miles. If you’re overseeing Chase’s card business, you don’t want customers of either airline to be able to also earn miles via an American Express card. And since you at Chase probably spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year buying miles from the two airlines, you can effectively tell them to end the relationship with American Express, or else. Is that what happened here? No, said Gail Hurdis, a Chase spokeswoman. “Our cards are clearly differentiated and the value they offer the Continental traveler is unmatched in the marketplace,” she said in an e-mail message. Whatever it is that went on behind the scenes, kudos to American Express for giving a year’s warning on this (or to Continental, or whoever insisted on the early notice). Amex is also trying to hang on to some Continental and other airline fans with a new benefit for Platinum and Centurion (a k a, “Black Card”) customers. Starting Dec. 1, you can register your favored airline with Amex and it will waive up to $200 in fees (like those for baggage checking, in-flight food purchases, airport club day passes and flight changes) with that airline each year.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/business/04shares.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Some C.E.O.’s Strike Gold in Stock Options<date>Published: April 3, 2010</date><text>WERE they smart, or just lucky?As the stock market dived in late 2008 and early 2009, chief executives of the biggest American companies received their annual grants of stock and options, and the timing couldn’t have been better. The subsequent rally has benefited nearly all investors, but for a select group of C.E.O.’s who were fortunate enough to get options, it has created a windfall. And while much of the attention has focused on the pay for executives at banks, a sector that enjoyed a back-from-the-dead performance last year, many of the biggest winners from options were C.E.O.’s at nonfinancial companies. Some executives on the top rungs of corporate America, including Alan Mulally of Ford Motor, Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical, have seen the value of their 2009 options packages double, triple and quadruple — and, in Mr. Mulally’s case, jump nearly 10 times in value, to more than $50 million. In most cases, they can’t cash in now: options typically take three to four years to fully vest. But the gains have set off renewed criticism that C.E.O. compensation is out of control, especially in a year plagued by the recession and high unemployment. “You’re going to see big numbers and people are going to squawk about it, as they should,” said Charles M. Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “There was concern at the time about unjustified returns, and that’s what happened. They clearly took advantage of the timing.” Not so fast, say other pay experts, who argue that the first quarter, and occasionally the fourth quarter, are typically the time when stock and option grants are made, regardless of how the stock market is performing. “They had no way to know the market would begin to recover in March,” said Carol Bowie, head of the governance institute at the RiskMetrics Group, a financial analytics company. “The fact of the matter is that many, many companies grant awards at the beginning of the year. It turned out to be an opportune time, but it’s not necessarily untoward.” Nevertheless, the outsize gains from stock and options last year are likely to fuel what’s already a fierce debate about executive pay levels. What’s more, companies like Ford, Starbucks, Dow, Whirlpool and American Express were making deep job cuts even as they showered options on their chief executives. “It reinforces the view that the rules of the game are rigged and that no matter what these guys do, they always come out ahead,” said Sarah Anderson, who tracks executive pay at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal research group in Washington. “In a time of national crisis, it wasn’t appropriate to be giving out boatloads of new stock options.” For all the criticism of the options windfall, it’s worth noting that some pay experts have argued for years that chief executives should receive more options and stock, rather than cash, in order to link their pay to long-term corporate performance. But in a twist, the options packages have proved incredibly lucrative in the short term. The gains, Mr. Elson said, weren’t based on corporate performance but simply reflect the broad market rebound. AMONG 200 C.E.O.’s of companies tracked by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm that analyzed data for The New York Times, the biggest beneficiary of an options grant and subsequent stock market rally was Mr. Mulally at Ford. On March 11, 2009, two days after the Dow Jones industrial average hit a 12-year low of 6,547, Mr. Mulally received options to buy five million shares of Ford at $1.96, which the company estimated would be worth just over $5 million, using a complicated formula to predict their eventual value. The company usually grants options in March. A year later, the market is up more than 60 percent, but Ford shares are worth nearly 10 times what they were then, making Mr. Mulally’s options worth an estimated $53.3 million, according to Equilar. Mr. Mulally was eligible to receive the first batch on March 27 — worth more than $17 million — and is set to receive the rest within two years. Defenders of Mr. Mulally argue that Ford was the only one of the Big Three automakers not to file for bankruptcy last year; it actually earned a profit for the full year. But critics say an award of that size is still inappropriate, especially given the huge job cuts at Ford over the last few years. “The sector is going through hard times,” Ms. Anderson said. “For workers, it’s demoralizing to see that kind of money going into executives’ pockets when jobs are being cut.” A spokesman for Ford, Mark Truby, said Mr. Mulally’s options award was based on Ford’s long-term performance. “The ultimate value of these options will depend on how Ford’s stock performs over the next two years,” he said. Mr. Mulally, he added, took a 30 percent cut in salary in 2009 and 2010, and did not receive a cash bonus for 2008 and 2009. “The vast majority of his compensation is at risk and tied directly to the performance of the company and the stock,” Mr. Truby said. A corporate comeback and great timing also drove gains of the second-biggest options winner among the executives in the survey: Mr. Schultz of Starbucks.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EEDD113FF932A25751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">Top Pay List For Bankers: Fresh Names<date>Published: February 11, 2010</date><text>The list of the biggest earners in finance usually reads like a Who's Who of Wall Street. But these days, it reads more like a Who's That? It turns out that some of the highest-paid financial executives in America work far from the canyons of Lower Manhattan, at companies that have largely avoided the outcry over the return of hefty paydays on Wall Street. Topping the list is John G. Stumpf, head of Wells Fargo, the bank based in San Francisco, according to an analysis of 2009 compensation in the industry. Mr. Stumpf was paid a personal best of $18.7 million in cash and stock for 2009 -- up 64 percent from 2007, just before the financial crisis struck. Mr. Stumpf is making twice as much as Lloyd C. Blankfein, his counterpart at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Blankfein -- who for many Americans has come to symbolize this new period of Wall Street riches -- was paid $9.7 million for 2009, less than some expected. It is a stunning reversal in the old pecking order of pay. Big names on Wall Street like Mr. Blankfein usually take home far more than staid bankers like Mr. Stumpf, whose bank's biggest business is making home mortgages and loans to corporations. But since the bailout, the rules of banker pay are bending. Some of the industry's biggest names are being paid less than relative unknowns. Chief executives, who are usually at the top of the pay heap, are taking home roughly the same amounts as executives who work for them -- and sometimes less. Mr. Stumpf and other executives have moved up the pay ladder partly because the likes of Mr. Blankfein have moved down. And for all the focus on what top executives earn, what is most startling is how many six-, seven- and eight-figure sums are being awarded to Wall Street bankers and traders whose pay often is unnoticed -- if it is disclosed at all. How much senior executives earn, in cash and stock, is made public in corporate filings. This year, the results are surprising, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. Leaders in the pay sweepstakes include the heads of the credit card giants Visa, Mastercard Worldwide, Capital One Financial and American Express. Joseph W. Saunders, who runs Visa, was paid about $15.5 million, a figure that vastly eclipses the compensation for top executives at Bank of America and Citigroup. Ajay Banga, the president of MasterCard Worldwide; Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of the giant money management company BlackRock; and Richard B. Handler, the boss at the Jefferies Group, a midsize investment bank that is virtually unknown outside financial circles, were each paid about $13 million. Executives at certain discount brokerages, insurance companies and regional banks were close behind. The big money, as ever, is in Wall Street trading. But pay for employees with few executive responsibilities is typically exempted from disclosure requirements. Brokers and asset managers also land windfalls that are often undisclosed. ''There are probably thousands of people that are in the Millionaire Club -- or even the Ten Millionaire Club -- that have gotten no heat,'' said Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant. To be sure, a handful of prominent companies dominate the well-paid list. Senior managers from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs occupy many of the top spots. Few of those executives are boldface names, however. While Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, appears to be the second-highest-paid banker, at $17.6 million, one of his subordinates collected nearly as much: Ina R. Drew, JPMorgan's chief investment officer. Ms. Drew, whose correct calls on interest rates helped the bank earn several billion dollars of profit, was paid about $13 million. Despite the spotlight on Mr. Blankfein's pay at Goldman, little was said about how much Gordon Nixon of Royal Bank of Canada received. His paycheck was roughly the same amount as Mr. Blankfein's, $9.7 million, though he is hardly a household name. The Equilar analysis provides an early peek at 2009 pay and is not a comprehensive review. For consistency, any stock or options that were subject to performance hurdles were valued at the target levels; in practice, many executives receive larger payouts for surpassing the company's financial goals. Wells Fargo posted strong results, even as it struggled to contend with rising mortgage and commercial real estate losses and accepted a bailout from the government in 2008.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/17/business/17gret.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Credit Cards and Reluctant Regulators<date>Published: January 16, 2010</date><text>ANYONE wondering how consumer rights might be faring in the Washington debate over financial regulatory reform has a lot to consider theses days. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Weekend Business Podcast: Gretchen Morgenson on new credit card fees Related Times Topics: Gretchen Morgenson Add to Portfolio Alliance Data Systems Corporation American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » For example, the Federal Reserve Board published its final rules on credit card practices last week, requiring new disclosures and banning some abusive practices that have been immensely lucrative for the banking industry. Among the regulations going into effect next month are these: Credit card issuers can’t jack up interest rates for the ensuing 12 months after an account is opened  and if your rate does go up after that, it will apply only to new charges, not an existing balance. Credit card issuers are concerned, of course, that these rules will crimp their profits. So some companies are devising creative ways to generate new revenue. An example is Alliance Data Systems, a big issuer of private-label credit cards like those that specialty stores offer. It has decided to levy a $1 monthly surcharge to customers who choose to receive account statements by mail. Proof, yet again, that if you close the door, they will come in through the window. And if you close the window, they blow through the door. The $1 statement fee from Alliance certainly seems to flout the spirit of both the Fed’s regulations and the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. But because it is labeled a statement fee, it does not appear to violate the letter of the law, which barred credit card issuers from levying separate fees when a consumer submitted a payment, whether “by mail, electronic transfer, telephone authorization, or other means, unless such payment involves an expedited service by a service representative of the creditor.” Asked about the practice, a spokeswoman for Alliance Data Systems said the company is “a credible, responsible public company that prides itself on upholding sound, ethical business practices, and adhering to the Credit Card Act is no exception.” William Ryan, an analyst at Portales Partners in New York, said the $1 statement fee wasn’t a surprise, given Alliance’s business model. “A disproportionate part of Alliance Data Systems’ yield comes from penalty fees,” he said, “so by default they would be more proportionately impacted by the Credit Card Act than an American Express that caters to higher-end customers.” Mr. Ryan estimates that the company’s $4 billion in assets generate $400 million a year in penalty fees. If half of that vanished as a result of the Credit Card Act, the company’s per-share earnings could drop by $2.25. Mr. Ryan estimates that Alliance earned $3.02 a share in 2009. TO be sure, Alliance is not the only company working to mitigate the effects of new credit card restrictions. And that makes it all the more imperative that such attempts by card issuers be met with an aggressive regulatory response. That, however, would be a lot to ask, given that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is tasked with enforcing the new rules at most card issuers. This institution not only failed in its oversight of risky practices at Citigroup, to cite just one case  it more recently objected to one of the sound credit card rules the Fed is putting into effect. “The O.C.C. to the end fought the rules and tried to get huge exceptions, carrying water again for the large banks they were regulating,” said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America. “Now they have to enforce this law that they disagreed with.” Mr. Plunkett recalled that John C. Dugan, the head of the comptroller’s office, sent a letter to the Fed about a year ago recommending that it carve out of the credit card rules some of the same items opposed by the banks. One major issue that the comptroller’s office argued against was the ban on retroactive interest rate increases; it argued that banks should be allowed to raise rates more quickly on potentially risky consumers. Bob Garsson, a spokesman for the comptroller’s office, said: “We felt the restrictions could have a perverse effect over time of making credit more expensive to more people if banks have a more limited ability to reprice based on changes to the consumer’s risk profile.” The option recommended by the comptroller’s office would have required advance notice to consumers and would have given them the chance to opt out, Mr. Garsson said. He said the agency viewed that as a reasonable compromise. Happily, the Fed ignored this argument. I asked the comptroller’s office if the new rules meant that it would hire additional examiners for enforcement purposes. Mr. Garsson said the agency’s ranks were adequately staffed. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 17, 2010, on page BU1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/12/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/12cards.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">The Lure of Store Credit Cards, and the Hook<date>Published: December 11, 2009</date><text>You may be tempted this season to give in to the plea from that persistent sales clerk at one of the big retailers  “Are you sure you don’t want to save 15 percent today?”  and open up a couple of store-brand credit cards. After all, a 15 percent discount, or no interest payments for 18 months, sounds enticing when you are buying gifts by the armful. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Minh Uong/The New York Times Multimedia Graphic Retail Weaknesses Related Enlarge This Image Damian Dovarganes/Associated Press Co-branded cards from a retailer and a credit card company may have lower interest rates than some private-label retailer cards. Enlarge This Image Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Rules set to take effect in February require consumers to list more information on card applications, like income and assets. But before you start filling out the application, there are some things you need to know. If you carry a balance on store-brand cards, known in the industry as private-label cards, or if you miss a payment on your no-interest purchase, you can end up wiping out those initial savings, and then some. And when you open a new credit card, your credit score can suffer, too. As one expert put it, if you strip away the store discounts and brand names that come with these cards, many are essentially the same products marketed to subprime borrowers, or individuals with tarnished or fairly new credit histories. Would you really choose a card with an interest rate of say, 25 percent, or about 9 percentage points higher on average than many other credit cards? “You are typically not getting the card because it has a lower interest rate or the financing is attractive,” said John Grund, a partner at First Annapolis, an advisory firm focused on the payments industry. “The first-purchase discount or, in the case of big-ticket items, promotional financing, is attractive to consumers. Then, it’s a function of ongoing benefits.” Congress was aware of the lure of easy credit, so the credit card legislation it passed this year asked regulators to come up with a way to evaluate consumers’ ability to pay their credit card bills before they get the cards. Indeed, the Federal Reserve’s proposed new rules, set to take effect in February, require consumers to list more information on their card applications, like their income and assets. But while that sounds like the new rules will make it tougher to get that store credit card, don’t bet on it. Retailers are not required to verify that information, and they have told the Fed that the quick check of credit scores they now do is adequate. Besides, they said, customers standing at the checkout may not be comfortable giving clerks sensitive information like a pay stub. Chi Chi Wu, a staff lawyer at the National Consumer Law Center, said the proposed rules did not go far enough. “The Fed explicitly cited the fact that it didn’t want to hinder retailers from being able to instantly open credit card accounts at point of sale as the reason for not requiring verification,” she said. “We think that is not a good reason, since the current financial crisis was caused in part by the failure of lenders to ensure consumers could afford the loans they are given.” In all the bustle of holiday shopping, the retailers will be counting on you to focus on all the benefits of these cards  and the benefits can be valuable, if you know how to use them. But you should also be considering the card’s terms along with the possible effect on your credit score. If you are looking to refinance your home, buy a new one or take out an auto loan, you may need every last point to buoy your score. “If it costs you 5 or 10 points and it drops your score to 790, it’s a nonissue,” John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at Credit.com, said. “But if takes your score from 700 to 690, that is a problem.” There are several reasons opening one or more cards may drag down your credit score. First, the credit-scoring companies do not look fondly on new applications for credit. Inquiries stay on your credit report for two years, though they only count toward your score for the first 12 months. Once you get the new card, the new account itself also weighs on your credit standing for several months, in part because it reduces the average age of your credit history, which accounts for about 15 percent of your score. Of course, if you have a pristine credit history and thousands of dollars in available credit on general-purpose cards (the type issued by MasterCard, Visa or American Express), you don’t have to be overly concerned about opening a store-only card, which tends to carry much lower credit lines. You are also more likely to qualify for what is known as a co-branded card, where a retailer like Toys “R” Us partners with a bank that issues a MasterCard, which can be used anywhere and carries somewhat lower interest rates. “If I am someone who has the optimum mix of six or seven cards, it’s probably not terribly material as opposed to someone who is new to credit or who has a lower score,” said Shon Dellinger, vice president of myFico.com, which provides consumer information and credit products. “But if you’re shopping around and open up four cards to save 20 percent on each, that’s really not the right mind-set.” In fact, people with less-than-perfect credit can be more harmed by opening a private-label card and carrying a balance than if they opened a general-purpose card. That’s because the credit limits are typically much lower  say, around $500  than those of a traditional credit card. “So what happens is even modest purchases, a suit or some boots, can cause that card to be highly utilized because of the fact that it has a low limit,” Mr. Ulzheimer said. “The purchase might be negligible on a regular MasterCard or Visa.” And your so-called credit utilization rate factors into your credit standing. When computing your FICO score, Fair Isaac, the company that developed the score, considers how maxed out each of your individual cards is, as well as your total amount of debt  and how that compares with your total available credit. There are other reasons to read the fine print before getting these cards. Some retailers offer promotions where you do not pay interest for a certain period, as long as you pay off the balance by the time the promotional period ends. But if you do not pay off the balance, you will owe interest on your average balance during the promotional period  but interest will accrue starting on the date you bought the item. So if you bought a $1,000 television and you have paid off $800 by the end of the promotional period, you will still owe interest on your average balance, dating back to the day you bought the TV. Sears and Best Buy are now running no-interest promotions. But if you participate in one of these plans, you need to pay attention to the date the promotion ends. At Sears, promotions begin on the date you make your purchase, said Chris Brathwaite, a Sears spokesman. That means if you bought the TV on Dec. 12, 2009, the bill must be paid off by the same date a year later  even if your statement happens to arrive on the 14th of each month, Mr. Brathwaite said. Since most store cards have higher rates than most general-purpose cards, you do not want to fall behind. And if you do, you can do major damage to your credit score. Those with a FICO score of 780  the scale ranges from 300 to 850  who are 30 days or more overdue can lose 90 to 100 points from their scores, Mr. Dellinger said. “Only get credit if you need it, and if you do get it, make sure you aren’t overextending yourself so you can do some of the basics like paying your bills on time,” he added.

Watch the documentary that was broadcast Nov. 24 here: pbs.org/frontline/creditcards Multimedia Graphic The Australian Credit Card Model Related The Card Game: U.S. Looks to Australia on Credit Card Fees (November 25, 2009) More Articles in This Series American Express has a different version. With nine of this city’s most fashionable restaurants and 40 bars, Merivale draws Sydney’s biggest spenders, who often want to pay with corporate or personal credit cards to earn perks like frequent-flier miles and other rewards. But many are unaware that each swipe requires Merivale to pay banks or credit card companies a fee  one that the restaurant and other retailers had long argued was too high. Thanks to changes in credit card rules imposed by Australia’s central bank, by last year the merchant fees that Merivale pays Visa and MasterCard per transaction had been slashed by more than half, to 0.74 percent of each transaction. But American Express, which is not subject to the regulations because its credit card transactions initially did not go through a bank, was still charging 2.81 percent early last year, said Brett Sergeant, Merivale’s general manager. Credit card fees were a big expense for the chain, equal to a tenth of its annual profit target, he added. When American Express refused to lower its fee, Merivale responded by charging diners who paid with that card an extra 2.75 percent of their total bill, while letting users of Visa and MasterCard escape the surcharge. A handful of clients complained, but most customers simply reached into their wallet and paid with a Visa or MasterCard instead, Mr. Sergeant said. American Express disagreed, saying its corporate customers in particular were unhappy about the restaurant’s surcharge policy. American Express started steering its cardholders to rival establishments that had not imposed surcharges. But early this year, American Express sharply reduced the percentage that it charges Merivale restaurants and bars, and Merivale dropped its surcharge on American Express transactions. To undo damage from the dispute, American Express began promoting the chain to its members with incentives like triple points at Merivale’s venues and a free bottle of Champagne for large groups. From American Express’s perspective, the decision to reduce its fees for Merivale was not capitulation, but part of a broader cut in fees it charges restaurants. Merivale received an even deeper cut in fees because it opened more venues and qualified for a bigger volume discount. Mr. Sergeant said that the surcharge had forced American Express to bargain. “There is a lot of pushback from operators” of restaurants, he said. “And AmEx is becoming more flexible.” More Articles in Your Money » A version of this article appeared in print on November 25, 2009, on page B8 of the New York edition.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EEDB133DF93AA25752C1A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">AmEx to Buy Online Payments Firm<date>Published: November 19, 2009</date><text>The American Express Company said on Wednesday that it would buy Revolution Money, a provider of Internet-based payment services started by Stephen M.

Johnson. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A campaign from NYC &amp; Company promotes shopping, dining out and cultural pursuits in 15 neighborhoods. Now, the pendulum seems to be veering toward marketing that is focused locally. It is particularly true as new technologies like local search make it easier to concentrate on the grass roots in a hyperlocal way. An example of the trend is a campaign being introduced for the Christmas shopping season by NYC &amp; Company, the city’s tourism organization. The intent of the campaign, created internally by NYC &amp; Company, is made clear by its theme: “NYC extreme local.” How extremely local are the promotions being advertised? They last 24 days; cover 15 neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan; involve two sponsors, American Express and AT&amp;T; and include more than 650 stores, shops, restaurants, cultural attractions and other places where residents of and visitors to New York City can spend time  and money.  Ah, money. The campaign is another example of the efforts being made to persuade nervous consumers to open their wallets during the important holiday shopping period. There are indications that retail sales may not be as dire as had been feared, among them a statement on Tuesday by Home Depot that it was seeing “some positive signs of stabilization.” Still, the concerns over high unemployment are leading many retailers to make unusual pump-priming moves. For instance, Wal-Mart Stores announced, also on Tuesday, that it would cut prices this weekend on some items to levels similar to the specials typically offered on the day after Thanksgiving. “It’s been a tough year,” said Jane Reiss, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at NYC &amp; Company, so “we know it’s going to be tough” to woo shoppers, diners and sightseers for the next five weeks. That is why the goal is to offer “something that’s a little special at holiday time,” she added, in the form of the campaign, which she described as the first for Christmas of its scope and scale.  The campaign includes print and outdoor advertising, ads online, social media like Facebook and Twitter and content on a microsite, or special Web site (nycgo.com). There will also be an offer from American Express to visit a Web site (amexnetwork.com/extremelocal) and register an American Express card; if that card is used at three or more participating businesses between Nov. 27 and Dec. 20 to make at least $300 in purchases, the card holder will receive a $50 credit from American Express on a forthcoming statement. The campaign “really dovetailed nicely with some of the things we were thinking about in this economic climate as we approach Christmas and the holiday season,” said Lisa Skiptunis, vice president of client management for merchant services in the Americas at American Express in New York. Although American Express has taken part in other promotions with NYC &amp; Company like the annual Restaurant Weeks each summer and winter, “I don’t think we’ve done anything like this close to the holidays,” she added. And the “extreme local” campaign covers more than twice as many businesses that accept American Express cards than a typical Restaurant Week promotion. American Express is devoting more time and attention to localized campaigns, some of which can be found on a Web site (amexnetwork.com/travel). There are deals for cardholders in markets like Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, offering discounts on hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and other attractions. For AT&amp;T, the partnership with NYC &amp; Company represents its first such locally focused campaign, said Chris Schembri, vice president for media services at AT&amp;T in Dallas. “What I’m trying to do right now,” he said, “is figure out how to crack the code” on similar campaigns in major markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles, so AT&amp;T could demonstrate the benefits of its localized interactive products like yellowpages.com and yp.com online as well as YPmobile (m.yp.com) on mobile devices and a Yellow Pages application for the iPhone. AT&amp;T is also bringing to the “NYC extreme local” campaign elements of a national campaign it is sponsoring to help promote the coming film from Summit Entertainment, “The Twilight Saga: New Moon.” The media spending for the campaign by NYC &amp; Company is valued at $2 million. That is an estimate because it includes donated and discounted media like the free space on bus shelters that the organization receives as part of the city’s agreement with Cemusa, the outdoor-advertising company. “This will be a robust program,” Ms. Reiss said, “because we wanted it to be felt at a crowded time, when there is a lot of retail advertising out there.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 18, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/business/23amex.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Strong Profit at American Express<date>Published: October 22, 2009</date><text>The American Express Company posted stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday as it trimmed costs, a decline in consumer spending stabilized, and bad loans eased.

The company’s decision, which takes effect immediately, goes further than legislation Congress enacted in the spring that would limit, but not eliminate, monthly fees on gift cards. Alpesh Chokshi, president of American Express’s Global Prepaid unit, said gift cards were popular, but consumers often complained about the monthly fee that ate away at their balance. There were no monthly fees in the first year, but on the 13th month, American Express began charging $2 a month. Mr. Chokshi said eliminating the monthly fee was now possible because the gift card business had enough scale to remain profitable without the fees. The company will continue to make money from the purchase charge, which ranges from $2.95 to $6.95, as well as from its share of transaction fees each time the card is swiped. Linda Sherry, director of national priorities for Consumer Action, said the decision was a big deal to cardholders who don’t want to spend their gift cards right away. “At least you know when you buy one of these things and wrap it up and give it to somebody, you are giving them $50 and not something less than that,” she said. Gift cards began as a plastic replacement for paper gift certificates and were originally embraced by retailers like Blockbuster, Starbucks and Barnes &amp; Noble. In those instances, the cards could be used only at a specific retailer. The major credit card networks, like American Express and Visa, now offer gift cards that can be used at any retailer that accepts their credit and debit cards. Mr. Chokshi said American Express began selling gift cards five years ago, and it now sells more than $1 billion worth of cards a year. Congress required changes to gift card fees in the credit card reform bill, which sought to limit the most onerous interest rates and fees on credit cards. As part of the measure, Congress prohibited inactivity fees or monthly service charges on gift cards for the first year after purchase. “Consumers no longer need to worry about their gift card losing value if they don’t use it quickly,” Mr. Chokshi said. He declined to say how much American Express had made from charging monthly fees.

The bill, after all, contains relief from penalty fees and certain interest rate spikes.

For months now, the card companies have been threatening to cut rewards programs sharply to make up for revenue lost because of the new restrictions. My guess, however, is that this talk is just so much saber-rattling. Card companies want to make money, and big spenders help them do it, even if those cardholders do not go into debt. First, let’s lay out the things we know will change because of the new legislation. The bill is chock-full of new rules, which will take effect at various points in the year after President Obama signs the final legislation. ¶There are new restrictions on when card companies can increase the interest rate on balances you’ve already run up. The bill says that banks generally must wait until you’re 60 days late in making the minimum payment before applying a penalty interest rate to your existing debt. While an earlier bill in the House of Representatives suggested less strict rules, House members have agreed to adopt the Senate version and intend to vote on it on Wednesday. On Tuesday, senators voted 90-5 in favor of the measure. ¶Card companies will have to give 45 days’ notice before raising their interest rates. There’s also a notice requirement for any significant change to a card’s terms, which may keep companies from surprising customers who have been saving their loyalty points for years with huge alterations in rewards programs. ¶Banks must send out your bill no later than 21 days before the due date. They cannot send it with, say, 14 days to go, hoping that you won’t get a check to the bank in time to avoid a late fee. ¶If the card company gets your payment by 5 p.m. on the due date, it’s on time, according to the new rules. No more of this early morning deadline nonsense, which led to late fees for payments that arrived with the afternoon mail. Also, no more late fees if the due date is a Sunday or holiday and your payment doesn’t arrive until a day later. ¶Let’s say you’re paying different interest rates on the debt on a single card  one for a cash advance, another for a balance transfer and a third for new purchases. Now, when you make a payment over the minimum balance, banks will have to apply it to the highest-interest debt first. I bet you can guess how some banks used to handle this sort of situation. ¶Banks will need your permission before allowing you the “privilege” of spending more than your credit limit and paying a fat $39 fee for that privilege. The card companies should be ashamed that they needed a law to make this “opt in” requirement a reality. ¶If you’re a student, it will become harder to get a credit card. No one under 21 can have a card unless a parent, legal guardian or spouse is the primary cardholder. Students with their own income can submit proof and ask for an exception to the co-signer requirement. The senators, in an apparent endorsement of helicopter parenting, also require written permission from the parent, guardian or spousal co-signer for any increase in a card’s credit line. You can read all the gory details through links to the Senate bill. ¶Hate gift cards? Me, too. There will be some helpful new rules regarding those absurd dormancy fees, which punish people who let the cards sit around before using them. Under the Senate’s rule, retailers and others that issue Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover gift cards or certificates will have to print explicit dormancy fee information on the card. Sellers of the cards will also have to inform the buyer of the fee. That’s a smart twist, since the gift giver can then become aware of the noxious nature of the fee  and elect to give cash or some other gift. The bill also bans expiration dates on gift cards and certificates any sooner than five years after the card’s original issue date. And the retailer or card issuer will have to print the terms of any expiration date in capital letters in at least 10-point type. Call it the fine print rule. It will be fascinating to see which retailer or card issuer has the nerve, after having free use of your money for five years, to tell you it will lose the money altogether if you don’t use up their gift card. I dare them to try. So will credit card companies kill reward programs or drastically scale most of them back? Of course not. “If you strip away the reward component of a credit card, it’s essentially a commodity,” said Rick Ferguson, editorial director at the loyalty marketing company LoyaltyOne. “The reward is what gives it its personality. It works from a branding perspective as well as a mechanism to influence customer behavior and consolidate spending on a particular card.” That last part is crucial. People who spend a ton generate fees galore from merchants, and that money helps the card company stay in business. So you may soon see card companies giving away more goodies or lowering annual fees for people who hit certain spending thresholds each year. American Express already does this on a number of cards. Also, keep in mind that you may have more control over what the card companies do to you than you may think. If you don’t like the new fees and other things that banks will soon be testing as they grapple with their new economic reality, then make some noise. Send a note to me at rlieber@nytimes.com, so I can write about the latest foolishness  or consumer-friendly twist. At the very least, all of our complaints to the higher-ups at the banks may help persuade the companies to head in another direction. “Work your way up the chain,” said Dennis C. Moroney, research director for bank cards at TowerGroup, a MasterCard-owned financial services consultant. After all, it may cost less to appease you than it would to replace you.

It said the cuts would occur across a variety of businesses, saving $175 million. The company also plans to cut spending by $500 million on marketing and business development and $125 million on consulting and other services, travel and overhead. American Express was one of 19 banking companies to undergo government “stress tests” to gauge their ability to weather a deep recession. After the tests, American Express was told it did not need more capital, but the company has been hurt by rising credit card defaults, as more cardholders lose their jobs. “We continue to be very cautious about the economic outlook,” the chief executive, Kenneth I.

The banks have made it difficult for Congressional Democrats and the White House to give stretched homeowners a stronger hand in negotiating lower monthly payments on mortgages and to prevent credit card companies from imposing higher fees and interest rates. Having won some early skirmishes by teaming with Republican allies, the banks now appear to have the upper hand and may wind up killing -- or at least substantially diluting -- both pro-consumer measures. To turn the tide, Democrats are calling in their big gun -- President Obama -- to pressure the executives at the largest credit card lenders. In coming weeks, officials say, the administration intends to make a major push on consumer finance issues, possibly including tough new lending standards for homeowners seeking mortgages. Mr. Obama is set to meet at the White House on Thursday with executives from American Express, Bank of America, Capital One Financial, Citigroup, Discover Financial Services, JPMorgan Chase and others to discuss what officials say are abusive credit card fees and practices. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama made an issue of what he considered excessive credit card fees, but he has been largely silent on the matter since his arrival in Washington. As a candidate, he also favored legislation to make it easier for troubled homeowners to use bankruptcy court to ease the terms of their mortgages, a proposal he again endorsed last month. Despite the president's support and strong Democratic majorities in Congress, both proposals are in jeopardy because of lobbying by banks and their trade groups, particularly in the Senate. On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee is expected to approve credit card legislation proposed by senior Democrats that would reduce many of the fees and limit the ability of the companies to charge penalties. The legislation puts into law most of the credit card restrictions adopted last year by the Federal Reserve, although the industry strongly opposes the bill because it says it believes a law would be harder to overturn than a regulation. But the bill, sponsored by Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Financial Services Committee, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A tougher counterpart to the House bill was adopted on a narrow, party-line vote in the Senate banking committee three weeks ago. It has yet to find any Republican support, which would be necessary for it to survive. The banking industry has also succeeded in working closely with Republicans to water down and then block a measure that would give bankruptcy judges greater authority to modify mortgages, including reducing principal payments. Senate Republican leaders say they have the support of all 41 of their members -- enough to kill the provision by making it impossible to get the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate. Senate Democrats, hoping to resolve the impasse, have opened negotiations in recent days, but not with their Republican counterparts. Instead, in an effort to divide the industry, the Democrats, led by Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, have been in talks with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, along with a group of credit unions. The lawmakers' hope is that those institutions would exert pressure on Republican lawmakers and reluctant Democratic moderates. Even if those negotiations are successful, the Democratic lawmakers are still likely to water down the bankruptcy bill further in the industry's favor. Before the negotiations, Citigroup had been the only major bank to support the bankruptcy measure, often referred to as ''cram-down'' legislation because it would give judges the authority to dictate terms to lenders and investors who own mortgages bundled into securities.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/business/17meetings.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">As the Recession Waxes, Business Meetings Wane<date>Published: February 16, 2009</date><text>Call it the case of the incredible shrinking  even disappearing  meeting.

And attendance is expected to be down by about 5 percent at those meetings that are still being held, the survey found. While anecdotal reports indicate that few industries have been spared, a large number of the canceled events appear to be in industries hit hardest by the recession: banking, mortgage lending, the credit cards, home construction and renovation. Reasons behind the cancellations vary. In some cases, image  not wanting to appear to be spending lavishly in a recession  is the impetus. “We’ve received notices of cancellation along with a check for the full amount,” said Steven Rudner, a hotel industry lawyer. “Nobody wants to be perceived as the next A.I.G.” But more often a professional event is canceled because the number of prospective attendees has shrunk as companies lay off employees and cut travel and professional education budgets for remaining workers. Paul Kedrosky, a senior fellow at the Kauffman Foundation, said he was asked to be co-chairman of a three-day conference about finance and technology in New York City that was to have been held earlier this month. The conference has been postponed indefinitely. While the previous year’s conference had drawn 550 participants and positive feedback, Mr. Kedrosky said, the volatility among financial firms had decimated the event’s target audience. “A huge chunk of them have lost their jobs, are worried about losing their jobs or are under very tight financial constraints,” he said. One conference planner, who did not wish to be identified because of continuing hotel negotiations, canceled a two-day seminar a month before it was scheduled to take place when only 16 delegates had registered. The event had drawn an average of 125 people in years past. The organization refunded registration fees for the handful who had signed up, and also offered a credit toward a future event to offset the expense of canceling their flights. Some event organizers, desperate for delegates, are going so far as to waive registration fees or to offer free hotel rooms to lure budget-minded business travelers. Canceling an event is not cheap. Costs can run into six figures, starting with the hotel’s cancellation fees and including any planned entertainment and functions planned outside the hotel. Holding a conference with a drastically reduced head count is not much better, though. Typical contracts include clauses that require the host to compensate the hotel for the difference between the number of guest rooms held for the group and those actually filled. As a rule, hotels would rather have fewer guests than receive a cancellation check, because conferences usually generate revenue from purchases like minibar snacks or fitness center passes. In flush times, hotels would probably have been able to rebook the rooms. But in the third week of January, the average occupancy rate of hotels in the United States was 47.3 percent, according to research firm STR Global, down nearly 8 percent from the same period last year. This means hotel rooms are likely to remain vacant if a meeting is canceled. Convention centers are expected to be less affected than hotels because their space is booked several years in advance. But the drop in meetings will probably lead to a decline in hotel tax revenue for local governments. For now, the approximate half-year lag between when those taxes are collected and when municipalities receive them is insulating cities that depend on tourism dollars, but the downturn could start to pinch by the third quarter of 2009. Even when companies do sign on to attend or exhibit at an event, they are often sending only one or two employees where they once sent a phalanx of workers. Pinny Gniwisch, founder and head of marketing for the online jewelry retailer Ice.com, decided not to take another employee with him to an Internet retail conference in Orlando, Fla., earlier this month because he expected turnout to be lighter than usual. “Initially, we thought having one person there from a networking perspective might not be able to cover all the bases, but seeing that a lot of people probably won’t be there, the necessity for two people there is gone,” he said. Professional speakers have also been hurt in the meeting downturn. “I would say the majority of companies we’ve dealt with in the past have either lowered their budgets or canceled their meetings,” said Barry Maher, a motivational speaker who says his business has been affected. When a client cancels, Mr. Maher and others in his field are doubly hurt, because they depend on their presentations to bring in new bookings. Mr. Maher says he has been booking smaller, less lucrative gatherings to increase his exposure. And underwhelming attendance has a discernible impact on an event, said Thom Singer, another professional speaker. In November, Mr. Singer said he spoke at an accounting industry conference that drew fewer than one-third of the expected 150 delegates. “I think the attendees kind of felt like it was second-rate because it was so small,” he said. “You definitely felt disappointment. The vibe was not as strong.” But several frequent business travelers said there was a silver lining to sparsely attended conferences and conventions. They can speak directly with educators and experts, which would not be possible with a large crowd, and fellow participants tend to be corporate decision makers rather than underlings. Mr. Gniwisch of Ice.com agreed. “That’s the only reason I didn’t cancel,” he said. “When it’s more intimate, people feel more comfortable. For deal making, people connect a lot better that way.” More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/31/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/31money.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express Kept a (Very) Watchful Eye on Charges<date>Published: January 30, 2009</date><text>You probably know that credit card companies have been scrutinizing every charge on your account in recent years, searching for purchases that thieves may have made. Turns out, though, that some of the companies have been suspicious of your own spending, too. Skip to next paragraph Your Money GuidesCredit and Debit Cards » Related Credit Card Companies Go to War Against Losses Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times American Express, based in Manhattan, says it kept no list of shops that would hurt ones credit. In recent months, American Express has gone far beyond simply checking your credit score and making sure you pay on time. The company has been looking at home prices in your area, the type of mortgage lender you’re using and whether small-business card customers work in an industry under siege. It has also been looking at how you spend your money, searching for patterns or similarities to other customers who have trouble paying their bills. In some instances, if it didn’t like what it was seeing, the company has cut customer credit lines. It laid out this logic in letters that infuriated many of the cardholders who received them. “Other customers who have used their card at establishments where you recently shopped,” one of those letters said, “have a poor repayment history with American Express.” It sure sounded as if American Express had developed a blacklist of merchants patronized by troubled cardholders. But late this week, American Express told me that wasn’t the case. The company said it had also decided to stop using what it has called “spending patterns” as a criteria in its credit line reductions. “The letters were wrong to imply we were looking at specific merchants,” said Susan Korchak, a company spokeswoman. The company uses hundreds of data points in making its decisions, she said, adding that the main factor in determining credit lines “has always been and still is the overall level of debt, relative to the card member’s financial resources.” The company will still have plenty of other data to judge your creditworthiness, though. American Express executives have spoken candidly to investors and analysts about its deep dives into your data. A spokesman for Citigroup says that it is using some mortgage data to help it make credit decisions, but it is not using specific store data or looking at types of merchandise purchased. A spokeswoman for Capital One said that geography was one of many factors it considered and that it, too, did not make decisions based on where people shop. Bank of America and Chase declined to comment on precisely how their underwriting works, though it’s safe to assume that they and other companies are looking at more data more carefully than they ever have before. In the grave new world of the ever-worsening economy, lenders of all sorts are grasping for any sort of information that may shield them from ruin. In recent investor presentations, American Express executives have noted how much better the company’s data-mining capabilities are than they were during the last two downturns. As technological advances give banks better tools and exponentially more information on who their customers are and what they do all day, they no longer have to wait long to tweak their formulas. “We have clients changing risk policies daily, depending on what they see in the marketplace,” said Dennis Dixon, the president of Zoot, a technology company in Four Corners, Mont., that helps banks and others make credit decisions. The question, then, is how much of the data they can use before spooking their customers. Kevin D. Johnson, a 29-year-old Atlanta resident who runs a marketing and communications firm, received a letter from American Express last October saying that his credit limit was being lowered. One reason was that other customers who had used their cards at places where he had shopped were late in paying their bills. The company couldn’t  or wouldn’t  tell him which charges had met with its disapproval. Frustrated, he told his story to the local newspaper and on “Good Morning America.” He also began documenting his experience on newcreditrules.com, where he posted the names of all the merchants he patronized, in the hope that other American Express customers would cross-check his list with theirs and solve the mystery. When I queried the company this week, before it changed its policy, I noted that if it wouldn’t tell people which establishments were suspect, people would have no choice but to guess. The truly paranoid, presumably, would stop using American Express cards altogether. But American Express couldn’t possibly go public with such a list. If it did, the merchants on the list, who generally pay the company a lot of money to accept its cards, would have a fit and hurl their Amex terminals into the nearest body of water. 1 2 Next Page » What reason has your card company given for changing your credit terms?

To the benefit of American Express, the Federal Reserve is using an increasingly liberal standard to decide which businesses can obtain banking licenses and gain access to government lending. Investment banks, thrifts and even GMAC, the troubled auto lender, have come knocking. In the latest twist, the Fed says that AmEx, the credit card and travel giant, can call itself a bank. American taxpayers may come to regret it. The move looks good for American Express. True, it has to put up with more oversight from the Fed. But in return, it can tap the central bank's pantheon of lending facilities, where AmEx can hand over securities backed by its credit card receivables as collateral for inexpensive loans. That's important, since the market for such securities screeched to a halt in October, making it harder for credit card companies to finance their businesses. The Fed also waived its usual 30-day waiting period to approve the application, which gives AmEx the option to apply for a capital injection from the Treasury's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program before the Friday deadline. But for taxpayers, the Fed's move looks risky. The central bank has already strayed outside its strict regulatory mandate with its $150 billion rescue of the American International Group, the insurer. Losses in A.I.G.'s huge finance business made the rescue seem necessary. The merits of extending support to a credit card company, which poses no systemic risk but has been reporting steady deterioration in its credit portfolio for more than a year, are less clear. The move may also embolden other types of financial institutions to seek the Fed's shelter. Granted, the contraction of consumer credit is squeezing the American economy. So the Fed's move may be worthwhile if it helps to maintain lending by AmEx. That's not a sure thing. Banks have been sitting on the money given to them by the Treasury, or used it for acquisitions. If the Fed allows AmEx and others to do the same, while still exposing taxpayers to consumer credit, the danger posed by its mission creep will be clear. Credit Crisis Ironies The credit squeeze is surely no laughing matter. But it is starting to look like someone's version of a twisted joke. The sorrows of bank failures and job cuts just took turns that even Hollywood's best minds would struggle to manufacture. Take Franklin Bank, a failing Houston-based bank with $3.7 billion of deposits and 46 branches that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized on Friday. The government facilitated its purchase by a competitor, the aptly named Prosperity Bank. In one sense, Franklin was no big deal. It was small and ranked No. 19 on the list of collapsed banks in the current housing downturn. But Franklin mattered in another way. It was started less than a decade ago by its chairman, Lewis Ranieri. For those with a historical bent -- or a copy of ''Liar's Poker'' on the shelf -- this is significant. Mr. Ranieri, for all intents and purposes, is the godfather of the mortgage bond market. In the late 1970s, Mr. Ranieri ran the trading desk at Salomon Brothers that created the securitization business, which begat the asset-backed market, which gave birth to the collateralized debt obligation, which ushered in today's financial turmoil. So it is a tad ironic that the bank that he built was felled by the housing crisis. Back on Wall Street, there was another stranger-than-fiction story. Goldman Sachs -- the temple of investment banking -- let go of roughly 10 percent of its staff of 33,000. This might not seem to be a big deal either. The whole industry sheds jobs in fallow periods. But among Goldman's casualties was William Tanona. Unlike Mr. Ranieri, he probably won't make the financial history books. Yet his departure may be more telling than the demise of Mr. Ranieri's banking business in Texas. That's because Mr. Tanona was a research analyst specializing in investment banks. The message: Goldman no longer deems it worthwhile to cover the industry it leads. Irony often ties tragedy with farce. The stories of Mr. Ranieri and Mr. Tanona certainly fit the bill -- it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature Eight Weeks of Financial Turmoil Related Times Topics: Credit Crisis  The Essentials Add to Portfolio American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » Federal Reserve banking regulators said they approved its application because of the “unusual and exigent circumstances” roiling financial markets and the company’s interest in tapping up to $3.8 billion in government money. As a full-fledged bank, American Express would gain greater access to the Treasury Department’s bailout plan for banks, a move that might allow it to lend more freely and perhaps acquire a larger deposit-taking institution. American Express customers are unlikely to notice the changes. But Monday’s announcement may also represent the end of financial companies operating a single line of business and depending on the capital markets for financing. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley recently transformed themselves from investment banks to bank holding companies after being battered by the markets. Big lenders like GMAC, the finance company partly owned by General Motors, and General Electric’s financial subsidiary have similarly been considering becoming banks. American Express executives have publicly maintained they did not need to become a bank holding company, although they also never completely ruled out that option. But when their financing costs soared as the commercial paper markets froze , the company increasingly recognized it needed to diversify its sources of financing. The company applied for banking holding company status about two or three weeks ago, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. Federal Reserve regulators sped up American Express’s request because of the market turbulence and the company’s desire to apply for the government investment program, which had a Nov. 14 deadline. Typically, the process can take 45 days or more; American Express got its license in about half that time. American Express had already operated a commercial bank and a savings bank supervised by federal regulators. But the bulk of its assets were not in those institutions. As a bank holding company, these assets are now under federal supervision, a move that expands the amount of financing it can request from the government. That means the bank could qualify for up to $3.6 billion of the Treasury Department’s money, instead of just a small portion. “Given the continued volatility in the financial markets, we want to be best positioned to take advantage of the various programs the federal government has introduced or may introduce,” said Kenneth I. Chenault, the chairman and chief executive of American Express. “We will continue to build a larger deposit base to broaden our funding sources.” His announcement came as American Express reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit and said it would slash 10 percent of its work force as it prepared to write off a larger pool of credit card loans. American Express wrote off about 5.9 percent of these loans in the third quarter.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times American Express, which is based in the World Financial Center in Manhattan, says it will suspend raises for managers next year. Add to Portfolio American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » Amex said it expected the move to save $1.8 billion in 2009, when it anticipates a wave of new losses and a decline in the growth of consumer credit card spending. “Card-member spending in such an environment is likely to be very slow. Loan growth will be restrained and some of that will reflect the steps we’re taking to lower credit risk” as the economy weakens, the chairman and chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a conference call earlier this month. “To prepare for this difficult environment, we are moving ahead with plans” to reorganize the business. American Express said Thursday that the reductions would occur across business units, markets and staff groups, primarily focusing on management and other positions that do not interact directly with customers. As part of the overhaul, American Express could take an after-tax charge of as much as $290 million in the fourth quarter. “The charge is primarily associated with severance and other costs related to the elimination of approximately 7,000 jobs or about 10 percent of the company’s worldwide work force,” American Express said. In addition, a hiring freeze has been imposed, and the company said that it was suspending management-level raises next year. The company also plans to reduce investments in technology, marketing and business development. American Express, which recently reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter profit, is the latest company to report job cuts in the financial sector, which has been rapidly contracting. Moody’s Economy.com, a research firm, raised its projection of job losses in financial services by two-thirds this month, to 100,000 from 60,000, which, it said, would thrust the New York region into recession before the end of the year. American Express, one of the nation’s biggest credit card lenders, traditionally catered to wealthier consumers, courting them with a valuable rewards program and a prestigious brand. But as competition intensified and the company began teaming with bank issuers, analysts said it began extending credit more liberally. The strategy helped power its growth, but has now left the company more vulnerable to a recession. American Express said that it wrote off about 5.9 percent of its credit card loans in the third quarter, and that the rate would increase over at least next two quarters. In September, the rate was about 6.1 percent. Executives said on the conference call earlier this month that the rapid acceleration was a result of the large number of small businesses that make up its customer base and the large concentrations of affluent cardholders who live in Florida and California, where home prices have plummeted. Beyond higher losses, American Express faces tremendous pressure on its profits. Its financing costs have increased considerably amid the turmoil in the capital markets. Loan growth has slowed, as the company has tightened its lending standards and pulled in credit lines for customers who live in the weakest housing markets, work in troubled industries or even shop in the same stores as other risky borrowers. And executives are bracing for a slowdown in consumer spending.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » The company said its net income was $815 million, or 70 cents a share, in the July to September period. That is down from $1.07 billion, or 90 cents a share, in the same period last year. The profit was better than expected, however. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average had predicted earnings of 59 cents a share, excluding one-time items. American Express’s income from continuing operations was 74 cents a share. Shares rose $1.60 , or 6.6 percent, to $25.95 in after-hours trading, after rising $1.02, or 4.4 percent, to $24.35 during the regular session. The card company took a $1.36 billion provision for loan losses, 51 percent higher than its provision in the third quarter a year ago. Its loan-loss rates nearly doubled to 5.9 percent from 3.0 percent a year ago on a managed basis, which includes card loans that are securitized. “We saw clear signs earlier this year of a weakening environment and the recent volatility in the financial markets has reinforced our view that consumer and business sentiment is likely to deteriorate further, translating into weaker economies around the globe well into 2009,” the chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement. “Card member spending is likely to remain soft,” Mr. Chenault said. “Loan growth will be restrained, in part because of the steps we are taking to reduce credit risks, and credit indicators are likely to reflect the continued downturn in the economy and throughout the housing sector.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 21, 2008, on page B4 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21citi.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Citigroup: Above the Fray?<date>Published: September 20, 2008</date><text>YOU’RE one of the largest commercial banks in the United States.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Citigroups Complicated Future Add to Portfolio Citigroup Incorporated Morgan Stanley Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) Freddie Mac American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » You’re Citigroup, and on paper, you look perfectly suited to withstand these tumultuous times. As the stocks of once-high-flying brokerages firm gyrated wildly last week and some smaller banks struggled to survive, Citigroup even found itself named as a potential suitor. “We were a pillar of strength in the markets,” said Citigroup’s C.E.O., Vikram S. Pandit, in an interview late Friday afternoon. Sitting calmly in his quiet office after one of the most chaotic weeks of trading in Wall Street history, Mr. Pandit said that his bank had some funds flow in from competitors’ coffers. “That’s a great place to be,” he says, smiling. Of course, even Citi’s stock was whipsawed last week as fears about a financial collapse appeared to overwhelm even the mightiest of Wall Street’s titans. And Citi’s fortunes also may be buttressed by a huge government bailout plan unveiled on Friday. Regulators plan to create a taxpayer-financed depository for withering mortgage securities  and Citi holds billions of dollars of such stuff. Until the government works out all the details, it’s unclear how much Citi stands to gain. The biggest unknown is the price that the government will pay for the assets. If it’s below the price that Citi has assigned them, the bank could face further losses. Mr. Pandit said he did not know exactly how the fund would work or what impact it might have on Citi’s holdings. But he expressed confidence that the proposed bailout could go a long way toward restoring confidence among investors and eventually free up banks to make new loans. “That’s going to be good for housing prices as consumers are able to get mortgages again,” he said. While the proposed bailout and the newly buoyant market raise Citi’s prospects, the large bank  which has been inundated with an unusual array of managerial and financial debacles in recent years  still isn’t out of the woods. If consumers continue to be hammered by the economy, the bank may have to add to the billions it has set aside to cover potential losses in credit-card, home-equity and auto loans. And Citigroup’s large international base (two-thirds of its deposits are outside the United States) could expose it to further hits as economies in Europe and emerging markets slow. Other problems that Citi’s executives must tackle are homegrown. A decade has passed since Citigroup was formed after the landmark $70 billion merger between Citicorp and the insurance company Travelers, shattering the Depression-era law that hemmed in the size and power of America’s banks. Yet Citigroup is still struggling to make all the parts perform. While Mr. Pandit is scrambling to put out fires, he also must find a way to integrate the dozens of companies that his predecessors acquired over the years. Even during the good times, Citi underperformed its peers. And since the credit crisis struck last year, the bank’s market value has plunged more than $125 billion. It is on track to have four consecutive quarters of multibillion-dollar losses. Since taking over the banking giant late last year, Mr. Pandit has made many moves to shore up the company’s finances. In recent months, Citi has raised $50 billion in capital, cut the dividend by almost half, slashed expenses and headcount, and put underperforming businesses up for sale. He is also trying to refine the bank’s strategy and has brought in new heads for several important divisions. Until recently, however, Citigroup hasn’t been given much credit for its new steps. “What’s not clear to people from the outside is that we’ve done a lot to clean up the business,” said Mr. Pandit. Indeed, a handful of analysts give Mr. Pandit kudos for addressing many of Citi’s longstanding problems and argue its diverse business lines position it well if markets stabilize. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 21, 2008, on page BU1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/business/economy/19econ.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Pain Spreads as Credit Vise Grows Tighter<date>Published: September 18, 2008</date><text>The latest outgrowth of the housing crisis, the breakdown on Wall Street, threatens to gradually corrode economic activity on Main Street, mainly by disabling the credit on which so many everyday transactions depend  but also by frightening people.

Harley-Davidson is now issuing bonds at slightly higher rates. Multimedia Graphic Tougher Standards Interactive Graphic The Finance Crisis Add to Portfolio American Express Company Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc Go to your Portfolio » The New York Times Lenders of all types had already been raising the bar for borrowers, turning away all but the best customers. This week, they became even less willing to part with their money, further crimping budgets and family spending. An economy propelled by easy credit for more than a decade is fraying as credit disappears. American Express, to take one striking example, is reducing the maximum credit limit for half of its tens of millions of cardholders. The credit shock is in some ways reminiscent of the 1973 oil embargo, which “came into people’s lives right away,” said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, the public opinion pollster. Then, Americans were forced to line up for gasoline and turn down their thermostats in winter. Though less visible, the credit squeeze, if it persists, will force businesses and consumers to cut spending more than they already have. “We have moved into a decline in consumer spending, which normally happens only in a major recession,” said Ethan Harris, chief domestic economist at Lehman Brothers. He calls the experience “a slow-motion recession in which economic growth will be near zero for an extended period of time.” Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of American economic activity and has been slowing as the value of homes falls. Although the economy is not yet in a formal recession, consumer spending in June and July grew only because consumers paid more for the same goods. After factoring in higher prices, they actually bought less. Borrowers are finding that the nation’s lenders are tightening up in numerous ways. American Express is hardly alone. After several banks said they would not lend the asking price, a tractor-trailer dealer in North Carolina had to cut the $20,000 he was seeking for a second-hand tractor to $14,000. And a commercial real estate agent, trying to raise $4 million by refinancing an apartment building, got only half that amount from the Bank of Smithtown on Long Island, even though the building was appraised for $10 million. “With marginal lenders in trouble, we have more people than ever coming to us for loans,” said Brad Rock, chairman of the Smithtown bank. “So all of a sudden, we can be much pickier in deciding what loans to make and how much to lend.” Being pickier means that an American Express cardholder whose maximum has been reduced to $1,000 from $1,200 has that much less to spend on clothing or meals out, purchases that lift the economy. At $14,000 for a used tractor, a trucker, caught in the same squeeze as the dealer, would lack a sufficient down payment for a new tractor, which costs more than $100,000. Indeed, many truckers in this situation find themselves looking for other work, even as job seekers across the nation outnumber job openings by more than 2 to 1, the biggest mismatch since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. And the commercial real estate agent is shy $2 million that would have been invested in a new venture to generate economic growth. Mr. Rock, also chairman of the American Bankers Association, with 8,400 affiliates, does not see a problem in this turn of events. “Now people are going to actually have to have a job to get a loan and they are going to have to make installment payments that are already higher per dollar borrowed than they used to be,” he said, arguing that the debt-fueled prosperity of the bubble years was unsustainable. But there is not, for the moment, an adequate replacement. Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist, ticks off the alternatives and discounts them. Exports could carry some of the load, but the surge in the first half of the year is fading as European and Asian economies weaken. Here at home, capital spending by business on new buildings and equipment could provide a lift, but that, too, is beginning to fade as corporate profits  and demand  weaken. Just Wednesday, FedEx announced that profits had shrunk in the latest quarter as freight traffic declined. Home construction is off the table, of course, as a means of lifting the economy. That leaves government, which could inject money into the economy through aid to the states or infrastructure spending or another round of tax rebates. The administration has suggested a program, akin to Resolution Trust Corporation’s role in the savings and loan crisis, that could help rescue the housing market. The program would buy distressed-assets and then dispose of them overtime. In a news conference Friday morning, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said he would discuss the plan to create the government-sponsored vehicle with members of Congress this weekend and expected them to pass legislation next week. Meanwhile, the barriers to borrowing go up. By late summer, a majority of the nation’s lenders had tightened standards for every type of credit, the Federal Reserve’s bank surveys show. Home equity lines of credit have been canceled or reduced as home prices have fallen. Credit card companies are imposing higher delinquency fees, stepping up collection efforts and checking on repayment histories. “More and more, they don’t give the card if you don’t have a good credit record,” Mr. Harris, of Lehman Brothers, said. Michael O’Neill, an American Express vice president, agrees. He adds that the company is offering fewer new cards than in the past in Florida, California and parts of the Southwest, all areas where home prices have fallen the most. And quietly, American Express is skinning back credit limits. The company is always reviewing its millions of accounts, normally increasing the limit on three out of four, and decreasing the fourth. Since July, “the tilt is 50-50,” Mr. O’Neill said. The North Carolina truck dealer originally listed a 2001 Freightliner for $20,000 on truckertotrucker.com, an online marketplace for tractors and trailers, and this week, he dropped the price to $14,000 because of the growing resistance from bankers, said James McCormack, who operates the site. “The banks were giving loans for the full value of these trucks and the value was falling, and the truckers found themselves owing more than the trucks were worth,” Mr. McCormack said. “They found themselves forced to keep driving or let the banks repossess, and many have elected repossession.” Debt traps and loan famines, in one form or another, can prove costly to companies. Harley-Davidson, for example, which finances purchases of its motorcycles, is issuing bonds and notes at slightly higher rates to support its financing arm. Restaurants in the casual-dining sector are in a severe slump, according to industry analysts, and will most likely come under further pressure. The pancake house IHOP bought Applebee’s last year with a strategy of selling off company-owned stores to franchisees. Now known as DineEquity, the company may have problems finding prospective franchisees who can obtain financing, industry analysts said. The winners so far are the Brad Rocks of America, the bankers who have emerged unscathed, their capital intact and with enough retained earnings to support lending, on their terms. A residential mortgage from Bank of Smithtown requires 20 percent down and clear evidence of adequate income to repay the loan, as well as a good record of paying down debt. Bank of Smithtown specializes in small businesses  the stationery stores, pizza parlors and pharmacies of eastern Long Island with annual revenue of $2 million or less, regularly in need of bridge loans, for example. During the credit boom, Mr. Rock said, many of these business owners went to lenders who required, as he put it, nothing more than a tax ID number to qualify for a loan. “Now many of these lenders are gone,” Mr. Rock said, “and the small-business borrowers are coming to us, and we are doing good old-fashioned underwriting, and the result is that fewer people are getting loans.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on September 19, 2008, on page A1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/business/07count.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Credit Crisis Puts a Dent in Card Offers<date>Published: September 6, 2008</date><text>Has your mailbox been a little less crowded lately? Credit card issuers are scaling back on their direct-mail offers, according to Synovate, a marketing research firm. It expects the decline to continue through the end of the year, as the credit crisis reverberates. Skip to next paragraph Offers reached their highest point in 2005, as a result of the strong housing market. Consumers, swimming in equity, were only too happy to sign up for new cards, perhaps to buy big-ticket items for their homes. Industry shakeouts affect card offers in the other direction. For example, a dip in volume occurred in 2006, following Bank of America’s purchase of another big card issuer, MBNA. The biggest mailer of card offers is now Chase, followed by American Express and Bank of America. The industry may be pulling back now, but don’t expect that to continue indefinitely. Direct mail is still the No. 1 way to attract new customers. Look at this time as something of a respite from irritation  or temptation.

Skip to next paragraph Matthew Staver/Bloomberg News The chairman, Kenneth I. Chenault, at the Allen &amp; Company conference in Idaho. Related American Express Earnings Release Add to Portfolio American Express Company Go to your Portfolio » Profit from continuing operations in the three-month period that ended June 30 was $655 million, or 56 cents a share, down from year-ago earnings of just over $1 billion, or 86 cents a share. That 37 percent decline came despite a healthy gain in postinterest revenue, which was $7.5 billion, up from $6.9 billion a year ago. American Express stock plummeted on the news. It fell more than 3 percent, to $40.90 a share, during the trading day but plunged 11 percent, to $36.40 a share, in after-hours trading. The explanation for the disappointing results was simple and stark: more people are defaulting on their credit card loans. “Credit indicators deteriorated beyond our expectations,” the chairman and chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said. The economic environment confronting the company had weakened significantly since January and grew sharply worse in June, Mr. Chenault continued. Moreover, he warned that the company expected that loan write-offs would continue to climb for the rest of the year, requiring it to set aside more money to cover those potential losses. Recognizing the worsening state of consumer finances, the company added $600 million to its credit reserves for domestic lending. It also cut its estimate of the fair market value of its stake in credit card loans that have been packaged and sold as asset-backed securities, trimming $136 million from prior estimates. Mr. Chenault offered a bleak assessment of the current situation, saying that the fallout from a weaker domestic economy “accelerated during June, with consumer confidence dropping, unemployment rates moving sharply higher and home prices declining at the fastest rate in decades.” But the addition to the company’s lending reserves  which slashed the quarterly domestic credit-card profit to just $21 million from $580 million a year ago  also leaves the company with the strongest cushion for loan defaults it has had in the last three years, he said. Total loan-loss reserves are now $1.9 billion, up from $977 million a year ago. Mr. Chenault had warned late last month that the company would not meet previous earnings estimates because its credit card business was deteriorating more than expected. The extent of that deterioration is significant. Applying industry standards, the company reported that its net loan write-off rate was 5.3 percent in the quarter, up from 4.3 percent in the first three months of the year  and steeply higher than the 2.9 percent of a year ago. Those numbers reflect the impact of packaging those loans for sale as asset-backed securities. Eliminating that adjustment, as generally accepted accounting rules require, the quarterly rate was 7.1 percent, up from 5.5 percent in the previous quarter and 3.7 percent a year ago.

But if corporate travel companies have their way, executives will soon be consulting new social networking sites and an endless stream of strangers for the secrets of the road. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jack Smith for The New York Times Cindy Estis Green, center, a travel marketing consultant, with Lauren Donoho, left, and Andrea Cunningham of the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego, meeting with managers of the hotels parent, KSL Resorts. Word of mouse is the latest trend in online travel planning, and a variety of corporate travel companies are setting up networking sites in hopes of becoming the Facebook of corporate travel. Both Expedia and American Express Business Travel are announcing their new offerings this month. The Internet travel site Orbitz had one of the first networking sites, but it, too, is trying to increase participation by sending out e-mail messages to members to promote its Traveler Update. Cindy Estis Green, author of “Travel Marketers’ Guide to Social Media and Social Networks,” said she thought the surge of interest in social networking was mainly because of the time savings it represents. “Some people ask me, ‘Who has time for this? Aren’t we busy?’ ” she said. “But when you need information about a job or a trip to China, it opens up tools that weren’t available to put a message out. Somebody will come back to you. It’s a utility and it saves you time.” Social networking tools aimed specifically at business travelers are “in the very, very early stages” of development, said Jean-Pierre Remy, president of Egencia, the new name of Expedia Corporate Travel. He said that while the needs of leisure travelers and first-time business travelers are often the same, frequent business travelers heading to the same places on each trip have different needs. For such folks, “it’s about how to repeat the trip and be more efficient in planning and booking,” Mr. Remy said. Egencia, the fifth-largest corporate travel company in the world, counts Starbucks and Washington Mutual among its clients. The company is more closely integrating the best of Expedia’s noncorporate travel planning assets, which include SeatGuru, a Web site that describes the best and worst of airline seating, TripAdvisor’s City Guides and a host of hotel reviews from a variety of sources. So a travel planner setting up a business trip for an executive would be able to see the location of an assigned seat, without separately visiting SeatGuru, and see the recommended hotels at the destination, because the City Guide would pop up. In February, American Express Business Travel said it would partner with a corporate booking firm, Sabre Travel Networks, which has been developing its own social networking platform called Cubeless. The idea is to help clients share their travel knowledge with each other and potentially save them time and money. American Express also said it was creating a social community for corporate travel bookers, but declined to give further details pending an official announcement later this month. Tom Russell, group vice president for brand marketing at Orbitz Worldwide in the Americas, said the idea for his company’s Traveler Update “came from insights that the customers trust strangers more than they trust the authority.” Orbitz says it has about 500 customers traveling through Chicago O’Hare airport at any time. The company hopes these people will help to create a central repository of information about travel conditions. For instance, one anonymous poster reported on June 19 that heavy thunderstorms were delaying flights by one hour at Dallas-Fort Worth airport. So far the effort is in its early stages, and Orbitz has supplemented customer-generated content with comments from officials from the Transportation Security Administration and four former air traffic controllers, who also contribute by alerting customers to real-time weather delays, among other things. Ms. Estis Green, who is also a travel marketing consultant, singled out KLM Royal Dutch Airlines as having one of the most comprehensive social networking sites, Clubchina.klm.com. Members can see things like who will be traveling on which days. Another site, skylounge.com, is aimed specifically at connecting business travelers with similar interests and seeks to improve the somewhat random networking opportunities at some of the world’s major trade shows. Skylounge, an independent business travel site, was started in February with 4,500 profiles. One Skylounge member, Ivo Sluijter, is a director at Energex, an online energy trading company based in Geneva. He travels for business every two weeks and says the site has helped him get more out of trade shows. “I meet many people at conferences, but then I forget, since it’s often a handshake or a 10-minute conversation.” Being part of Skylounge helps, he said. “I can see who’s there and prepare product information,” adding that if important clients are not attending a particular event, he will know not to waste his time. While social networking tools for business use are in their infancy, better known mass-market players, like Facebook, can hook travelers into the whereabouts of hundreds of friends and associates and also offer clues about travel conditions. Each time users log in, they are asked to update their profiles by responding to the question, “What are you doing right now?” The responses, which sometimes include lines like, “Delayed at La Guardia,” are sent out as part of a constant news feed when friends log in. Likewise, Twitter, another social networking site best described as a micro blog, has members sharing what they are doing at any precise moment in a single sentence. Knowing that someone is stuck on a highway or in a security line can be helpful if you are headed to the same place. Mr. Remy of Egencia says he is skeptical that individuals are as generous with their time and information as some social networking fans suggest. That is why his company decided to stick with its customized offering of core services. “If you look at the corporate travel side of social networking and user-generated content, no one has proven yet all the value of these tools,” he said. “We strongly believe you shouldn’t try to change the way travelers behave.” More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/business/06metrics.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Cashing In on Obama and McCain<date>Published: July 6, 2008</date><text>JOHN McCAIN and Barack Obama are not the only winners to emerge from the long presidential primary season. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Graphic Winners in a Long Presidential Campaign The two presumptive nominees, along with the many candidates who bowed out along the way, spent more than $900 million through the end of May, about $470 million more than was spent on primaries in 2000, when both major parties last had competitive primary battles. Nearly half of the current spending has been paid to just a few dozen companies. Before November, hundreds of additional millions will be paid to the lucky few businesses that have contracts with the winning candidates for campaign necessities like media consulting, airplane charters, direct mail and telemarketing. And as campaign schedules become more crowded, companies that coordinate rallies and events, and those that make signs and bumper stickers, will also rake in dollars. Even companies that do not cater to the political arena can reap great rewards, according to spending records each candidate has filed with the Federal Election Commission. Bank of America and American Express together received about $7 million in credit card and banking fees from the Obama campaign alone. Verizon was paid more than $4 million by all the candidates combined to put phones into the hands of their employees. To be sure, some of the companies that received the highest payments passed the money on to other vendors. The Obama campaign, for example, paid $85 million to GMMB, a media consulting firm. But $69 million of that was used to buy advertising time, which means that much of the money paid to GMMB ended up at local television and radio stations. Some experts say they think that as campaign spending rises, the candidates benefit much less than the companies. “The total amount of money doesn’t matter, especially since you start to see diminishing returns,” said Ray C. Fair, an economist at Yale who studies economic influences on presidential elections. “What matters is the difference in spending between the two parties.” With Mr. Obama opting out of public financing and expecting to raise upward of $300 million between now and November, it looks like he may be able to far outspend Mr. McCain, who has pledged to accept public financing and is limited to spending $85 million in the general election. Of course, the candidates are not alone in the political spendfest. The Republican and Democratic National Committees and groups that are created specifically to influence elections, like 527’s, will spend tens of millions of dollars in the general election. It’s feast or famine. Businesses expand rapidly to meet the demands of a voracious campaign, then downsize just as fast when a campaign abruptly ends. Tigereye Designs, of Greenville, Ohio, which provides the Obama campaign with most of its buttons, banners and yard signs, quintupled its staff since the campaign season began. It has made more than one million bumper stickers for Democratic candidates this year. “It’s like having a whale wash up on the beach,” said Justin Hemminger, the political program director at Tigereye. “You want to shovel food in the whale as fast as possible before the tide turns. We’re all out there with shovels.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E5DB1431F935A15755C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">MasterCard Will Pay $1.8 Billion To a Rival<date>Published: June 26, 2008</date><text>MasterCard Worldwide agreed on Wednesday to pay $1.8 billion to its credit card rival American Express to settle claims related to a 2004 antitrust lawsuit. Seven months ago, Visa paid more than $2.1 billion to American Express to put similar claims behind it as it raced ahead with plans for an initial public offering in March. MasterCard, which went public two years ago, had been under pressure to resolve the suit because uncertainty surrounding the litigation was one of the few clouds hanging over its rapidly rising stock. The agreement brings the total that American Express has collected to more than $4 billion, one of the richest settlements in corporate history. With losses rising and the economy in a slump, American Express can use the cash. ''Business conditions continue to weaken in the U.S., and so far this month we have seen credit indicators deteriorate beyond our expectations,'' the chairman and chief executive of American Express, Kenneth I. Chenault, said. He said the settlement would provide a multiyear source of funds that would ''lessen the impact of this weakening economic cycle and, when conditions improve, give us the ability to step up investments in the business.'' Investors sent American Express shares down as they absorbed the news that even its customers, who tend to have strong credit histories, are falling behind on their payments. Its shares fell $1.16, or 2.8 percent, to close at $40.94. Shares of MasterCard, which processes payments but does not directly lend customers money, rose $9.42, or 3.4 percent, to $289.79. MasterCard's chief executive, Robert W. Selander, said in a separate statement that the settlement eliminated ''the uncertainty, time commitment, and expense of a prolonged court case'' and kept the company's balance sheet intact. The Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that Visa and MasterCard violated antitrust rules by barring their member banks from offering credit cards that could be used on rival payment networks. American Express and Discover Financial quickly filed suit, seeking billions of dollars in damages based on the revenue they thought that they had lost. The settlement is likely to put pressure on both Visa and MasterCard to strike similar deals with Discover Financial. Discover is seeking as much as $6 billion from the two companies, according to court filings that were unsealed this month. Analysts expect any settlement with the card companies to be far lower than the $4 billion collected by American Express because Discover's user fees are much lower than those of American Express and the partnerships that it arranged with outside card issuers are less lucrative. Leslie Sutton, a Discover spokeswoman, said it remained ''confident in the strength of our claims against Visa and MasterCard.'' Shares of Discover fell 71 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $14.33. The industry has changed since the antitrust ruling. Bank of America and Citigroup, two of the largest credit card issuers, have signed a deal to offer their customers American Express-branded cards, and HSBC and General Electric's financial service arms have reached agreements with Discover. The talks between American Express and MasterCard had gone on for years, and negotiations picked up steam after the Visa settlement was announced in November. In April, Kenneth R. Feinberg, who headed the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and served as a mediator in the Visa-American Express case, was brought in, but it still took several additional months to arrive at a settlement. ''Everybody was conscious that the number we were talking about could well be a record settlement,'' said David Boies, of the law firm Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, who led the negotiations for American Express. ''When you are in that range, it sometimes takes longer.'' Under the terms of the deal, MasterCard will make quarterly payments to American Express for three years. It will book an after-tax charge of approximately $1 billion for the settlement costs in the second quarter. In November, Visa agreed to pay American Express $945 million, followed by quarterly payments of about $70 million until the full amount was paid. Together, the Visa and Master Card payouts will bring American Express about $880 million a year for the next three years. statement</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/business/21credit.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Banks Trimming Limits for Many on Credit Cards<date>Published: June 21, 2008</date><text>The easy money that led Americans to depend on credit cards to pay their bills is starting to dry up. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Less Money to Borrow Add to Portfolio American Express Company Visa Inc Mastercard International Inc Go to your Portfolio » After fostering the explosive growth of consumer debt in recent years, financial companies are reducing the credit limits on cards held by millions of Americans, often without warning. Banks that issue cards like Visa and MasterCard, as well as the American Express Company, are cutting the limits for customers who have run up big debts, live in areas that have been hit hard by the housing crisis or work for themselves in troubled industries. The reductions come as consumers, squeezed by a slack economy, a weak housing market and rising unemployment, are falling behind on monthly credit card payments in growing numbers. Credit card lenders are also culling their accounts ahead of new rules that are intended to benefit consumers but could limit the profits on customers deemed bigger risks. Many Americans have come to rely on credit cards to cover everyday expenses like groceries, gasoline and medical bills, in addition to big-ticket items and luxuries. While consumer spending, the nation’s economic engine, has been surprisingly resilient of late, a more sweeping reduction in credit card limits could pose serious challenges for hard-pressed consumers and, in turn, the broader economy. Many are already feeling pinched. Pamela Pfitzer, a family therapist with a stable six-figure income, was stunned when she went to a garden center near her home outside Sacramento in early April and tried to buy about $30 worth of flowers with her American Express card. Her transaction was denied, she says, even though she insists she had rarely missed a payment and had just made one for $1,000. After inadvertently hitting her credit limit a few months ago and then falling behind on a mortgage payment, Ms. Pfitzer said her limit was lowered by American Express to $900 from $2,300. The flowers pushed her over the new cap. Then last month it happened again, she says, when she tried to buy office furniture with her Wells Fargo Visa card. Although she had just made a payment of about $700, Ms. Pfitzer found out that her credit limit had been lowered to $2,000 from $2,800. “In all the years I have had credit cards, I have never had this happen before,” Ms. Pfitzer said. “Now it has happened twice in the last few months.” Banks and mortgage companies are required by law to notify customers within three days of changing the limits on a home equity line of credit, and many have been aggressively lowering them. But credit card lenders have 30 days to notify their customers, and often do so only after taking action. Such moves can cause a consumer’s credit score to drop, forcing the person to pay higher interest rates and making it harder to obtain new loans. Even so, disclaimers in the fine print of credit card applications typically stipulate that the issuer can cancel or alter credit limits at any time, regardless of a customer’s payment or credit history. Washington Mutual cut back the total credit lines available to its cardholders by nearly 10 percent in the first quarter of the year, according to an analysis of bank regulatory data. HSBC Holdings, Target and Wells Fargo each trimmed their credit card lines by about 3 percent. Among those four lenders, that amounts to a reduction of about $15 billion in three months. Over all, the amount of available credit for the industry appears to be about flat, with the three biggest issuers  Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup  slightly increasing their overall credit lines. But even they are trying to rein in risky individual accounts. Big banks face intense pressure on their balance sheets as they bring on billions of dollars worth of complex mortgage-related investments and other loans they are struggling to sell. Meanwhile, they are bracing for a surge in credit card losses as the job market and economy falter. Consumers are reaching deeper into their pockets to pay for groceries and gas. Last year, as many as half of all those who took out home equity loans used the money to help pay down their credit card debt, according to J. D. Power research. But home equity is no longer an easy source of financing. Month after month, cardholders keep falling behind on their bills. “This downturn is the perfect storm where the consumer is getting squeezed from all levels,” said Michael Taiano, a credit card industry analyst at Sandler O’Neill. He projects that credit card loss rates for lenders, now around 5.7 percent, could go as high as 10 percent in next 18 months. That would be higher than the peak levels reached after the 2001 technology bust. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/20/business/20memo.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Memo Pad<date>Published: May 20, 2008</date><text>SINGAPORE AIRLINES AND IPOD Passengers on Singapore Airlines new all-business-class flights between Newark and Singapore can now connect personal audio and video on iPods and iPhones to the airline’s high-end KrisWorld in-flight entertainment system, which Singapore said was a first.

BUSINESS TRAVEL GROWING Despite rising fares and gloomy projections, business travel increased in the first quarter in almost all areas, says Ovation Travel Group, a big travel management company whose major clients are in the businesses of law, finance, consulting, entertainment, technology and other areas. Air travel spending was up 11 percent, reflecting higher fares, but the number of individual tickets purchased also rose by 5 percent. Hotel spending was up 21 percent, reflecting higher rates. But the number of room nights purchased was also up by 18 percent, Ovation said. The only area in which spending dropped was car rentals, down 5 percent, though the number of car rental days was up 10 percent. HEAVY METAL So-called heavy metal jets are driving the current boom in the business jet industry, Rolls-Royce said yesterday. Of 39,000 business jets expected to be delivered in the next 20 years, 40 percent will be in the medium-cabin and large-cabin size, representing 75 percent of the value of the orders. VIRGIN AMERICA SALE Virgin America has begun a short-term fare sale (sample roundtrip fare: $358 Los Angeles to New York). But tickets must be booked by Friday for travel from May 28 to June 25. Virgin America also recently said it was seeking approval to add Chicago O’Hare to its route network, raising it to eight cities. BY THE NUMBERS Scheduled domestic flights this summer will average about 192,000 a week, down 1.4 percent from last summer. The figure reflects cuts by the network airlines offset by a 2.8 percent average weekly growth in low-cost airlines’ flights, according to American Express’s Executive Travel SkyGuide. It all adds up to “more-crowded planes and higher costs for consumers during this busy travel season,” said Janet Libert, the editor of the electronic flight directory.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Plum is the hue of choice among several marketers, including American Express, which recently introduced a Plum Card for small business. Above, an ad for the Plum Card. Examples of how plum may become the new black for advertisers and media companies include a new Plum Card from American Express, coupon inserts in Sunday newspapers under the RedPlum name and plum-colored labels for products like Penta water. There is also Plum TV, a channel available in resort communities; PlumChoice Online, a PC services company; and even books by Janet Evanovich featuring a character called Stephanie Plum. The titles include “Plum Lovin’ ” and “Plum Lucky” and, coming in January, according to Dori Weintraub of St. Martin’s Press, which publishes Ms. Evanovich, “Plum Spooky.” Trend watchers suggest several reasons so many marketers seem to be going plum loco. One recurring thought is that the success of technology brands like Apple and BlackBerry is giving fruit a good name, hence the proliferation of plums as well as brands like Pinkberry and Red Mango, which are both frozen yogurts. Plum and purple colors also “evoke royalty, sophistication,” said Tom Julian, president at the Tom Julian Group in New York, a brand consultancy. Those shades can appeal to “the emotional side of one’s passions and interests,” he added, “the individual desire for zest and to be distinct.” Mr. Julian traces the growing appeal of plum to fall 2005, when “the ‘luxe’ factor emerged in the designer market” and richer hues came into favor.  Plum TV was introduced a year earlier, in Nantucket, Mass., by Chris Glowacki and Tom Scott, and has since been expanded to upscale communities including Aspen, Colo., and the Hamptons. “There’s a positive connotation to the name: a plum job, a plum moment; it’s something that’s sweet and natural,” said Richard Kirshenbaum, the co-chairman at Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners. He agreed last week to become the host of “Creative Lunch,” a talk show that Plum TV is to introduce in the summer. Mr. Scott, who also helped found Nantucket Nectars, received one of the first Plum Cards when American Express introduced them last September. The card is part of the American Express Open line of products aimed at small businesses. “The plum job, the plum assignment  it’s something you strive for,” said Diego Scotti, vice president for global advertising at the American Express Company in New York. “We wanted to make the card feel aspirational, special.” “When we were looking at the color of the plastic” during the planning stages, “we wanted something classy and sophisticated,” Mr. Scotti said, and the choice was a shade “we called burgundy.” But the company did not want to call it burgundy when marketing it, he added, for fear of confusion with wine brands. So instead plum is joining the ranks of Amex colors that also include black, blue, gold, green and platinum. In December, three months after the Plum Card came out, Valassis Communications, which distributes cents-off coupons and other value offers for marketers, brought out RedPlum. The brand is in newspapers, online (redplum.com), in the mail, in stores and in circulars delivered to home and apartment doors. “Consumers know our products, but didn’t have any recognition of our business-to-business name” of Valassis, said Suzie Brown, chief marketing officer at the company’s Los Angeles office. “We wanted to create an umbrella name with superior consumer awareness,” she added, that would “break away from the functional names in our space, which are all very literal: ‘Coupons,’ ‘Savings’ or ‘Deal.’ ” The word plum stemmed from discussions among Valassis executives, Ms. Brown said, who “like to talk about ‘sweeten the deal,’ ‘sweeten your life’ or ‘juicy deal.’ ” “In many societies, plums are given as rewards or as gifts,” she added. “I like to think about biting into a big, juicy plum.”  The most recent arrival to the plum party is the Penta Water Company, which is reintroducing its Penta brand with plum-colored labels and packaging. “Plum says calm; plum says clean; plum says health,” said Bill Sickert, chief executive at Penta Water in Carlsbad, Calif. “Other products in the water category are blue, clear, red,” he added. “This color came out as a consistent representation of vitality, a pure product.” That several companies are all biting into the same name at the same time does not seem to concern them. Ms. Brown said she was “delighted” to be introducing RedPlum as American Express brings out the Plum Card because “American Express has a much bigger budget for building consumer awareness.” And Mr. Glowacki of Plum TV said his company was flattered by the Plum Card’s arrival. “I don’t think there’s any threat of confusion,” he said. “I hope it’s as good for them as it is for us.” In fact, Mr. Scotti of American Express said, the introduction of the Plum Card was successful: an initial release of 10,000 cards was all gone, he said, “and we’re already in our second release.” Of course, not everyone agrees that plum is paramount. The Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation sent out e-mail messages on Thursday to shoppers that proclaimed, “What’s hot now: Think pink.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/technology/personaltech/03basics.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Souping Up a Cellphone for Maximum Multitasking<date>Published: April 3, 2008</date><text>WHAT is the one item you never leave home without? Sure, the American Express folks have you conditioned to think about their product, but the more likely answer is your cellphone. Now, what is the one device you need with you for connecting to vast amounts of information, displaying it, processing it and conveying it to others. You would probably say a computer. But that cellphone you are carrying might be able to do much of that as well. You can probably be almost as productive with that hand-held device as you are with a laptop weighing 10 times as much, if you know how to tweak your phone. And it does not have to be an iPhone or the latest smartphone to do these tricks. Most recent phones can use these services. One of the biggest time wasters has to be managing your voice mail. The iPhone offers a “visual voice mail” feature so you can pick and choose which messages to listen to and easily pause or fast-forward through a message to save time. Two other services, GotVoice (www.gotvoice.com) and CallWave (www.callwave.com), offer similar features that can save time and even help you manage voice mail when you are not at your phone. For $10 a month, GotVoice’s Premium service will monitor voice mail on up to three different phone numbers. The service takes the messages and saves them in the popular MP3 standard audio format. Once a message is retrieved and saved, GotVoice will send you an e-mail message along with the MP3 file that you can listen to, pause, rewind and more. Of course, unless you have a full-featured smartphone, you will most likely want to play the audio file from a computer. If you do not have a smartphone, you can take advantage of GotVoice’s voice-mail-to-text transcription service, which is included in the premium account. Up to 40 of your voice mail messages a month will be transcribed and sent directly to your handset as a text message. CallWave offers similar services for $15. Its transcribed voice mail can be read as an e-mail message as well as a text message. Both services offer Web portals to help you manage, search and archive messages. GotVoice works in reverse, too: you can broadcast a voice mail message to a group of contacts right through the service; no need to call each friend if dinner reservations fall though and everyone must meet across town. Along those lines, maybe you want to send a message to yourself. Could a voice mail service actually serve as a to-do list or provide reminders? Jott could come in handy. A free service, Jott (www.jott.com) uses your phone as a voice-dictation machine. Once you set up an account, you simply call (866) JOTT-123 on your hand-held device to connect. After the call goes through, you will be prompted for whom you wish to “jott.” You reply with the word myself and wait for the recording tone. Now you can speak “Buy birthday present for Johnny before Aug. 5,” or whatever task reminder you need. Upon hanging up, Jott will transcribe the task and shoot it off in a e-mail message to the address you provided for yourself during setup. The beauty of this service is that you can assign a speed-dial number to Jott’s service for a one-button call any time you need to send yourself a reminder. The approach can be used while driving or in other situations where text messaging or typing on a small device are less than ideal. The uses for Jott as a productivity tool do not stop with reminders to yourself while on the go. You can dictate a message to other individuals or whole groups. You can even post an entry to your blog. A new service called ChaCha (www.chacha.com), which was demonstrated at the CTIA wireless industry show in Las Vegas this week, allows you to do Internet searches by asking a question over the cellphone. You dial (800) 2CHACHA or (800) 224-2242, pose the question and an answer is returned by text message. One of the best features of smartphones is the accessibility to maps. Even if you do not have a Global Positioning System in the phone, that phone probably has a number of free and pay-for-service options to help you find your way. Most of the cellular carriers offer some type of location service that costs about $10 a month on average. Verizon Wireless offers VZ Navigator while AT&amp;T is a partner with TeleNav and of course, the Apple iPhone includes Google Maps along with a new location service that uses a combination of cellular towers and wireless hotspots to estimate your current position. Hitting the Google Maps for Mobile Webpage (www.google.com/gmm) on most newer cellphones supporting Java or J2ME will get you the same map information as the iPhone and other smartphones have. Even better: pressing the zero key on your phone can show your location right on the map if your phone is new enough to provide Google the local cellular tower information. Like many other Google services, the My Location feature is still being tested and the newer your phone is, the more likely it is you will get your location. If you do not have a supported device, but could still use directions, Google can provide them free. Since most every phone these days supports text messaging, you text message your directions request to Google, which is 466453 on the keypad. In the message, enter your starting location and ending location; you can use a ZIP code if you do not know your exact location. Once your request is received, Google will return step-by-step directions to your destination free. Bear in mind that a long list of directions may result in multiple text messages since each message is limited to 160 characters. You will also want to be careful about how often you use the service unless you have an unlimited text message plan with your carrier. Of course, this method requires the use of that pesky little keypad, which can be annoying. What if we used the function the cellphone was designed for? You can call a service called Dial Directions (www.dialdirections.com). You dial the word directions, which works out to 347-328-4667. You will have to pay for the long-distance call if your wireless plan does not cover it, but the service itself is free. Once you are connected, you will be prompted for information to an address, an intersection, certain businesses or an event. During the prompts, Dial Directions will speak back what it heard you say so that you can make corrections. Once the service has the starting location and the destination it will send text messages to your phone with the directions or a Web link. The camera in your phone can also be turned into a productivity tool. Consider signing up for an account at scanR (www.scanr.com) to make use of your Java-based, S60, Palm OS or BlackBerry handset. You simply use your phone and scanR’s application to take a picture of any document, whiteboard, business card or other legible text. The photo is sent from your phone to the scanR service where it is turned into a readable Adobe PDF document and sent to you through an e-mail message. The basic service is free, but only if you limit yourself to five uploads a month (and you will have a scanR logo on your documents). Unlimited uploads and no logo cost $3 a month or $30 a year. While scanR might appeal more to businesspeople, it can be quite handy to capture written directions, shopping lists or any other textual information. It is not a perfect substitute for lugging around your entire office, but it, like the other services, is considerably lighter.

Sells a Corporate Credit Unit to American Express<date>Published: March 28, 2008</date><text>American Express said Thursday that it would acquire Corporate Payment Services, a commercial credit card and corporate purchasing business, from General Electric for $1.1 billion. The acquisition is American Express’s latest effort to bulk up its corporate payments business, seen as a relatively stable earnings generator and less prone to recession than consumer credit card lending. American Express said in January that customer spending slowed in December, a trend it expected would continue. The company also said it was building reserves as expected credit losses rise. Corporate Payment Services has more than 300 large clients, which tend to pay off their balances in full at the end of each month. The largest customer is G.E., which agreed to become a client of American Express for several years. G.E. is selling the business as a step to prepare for the company’s planned exit from the private-label credit card business, a spokesman said. G.E. executives said in December that they intended to possibly sell off $30 billion to $50 billion of assets related to that business. Corporate Payment Services, part of the G.E. Money unit of G.E., handled more than $14 billion in purchases worldwide last year, and extended $1.1 billion in loans. The company has about 350 employees, based largely in Salt Lake City. Separately, Santander of Spain said Thursday that it was selling its Italian corporate banking arm, Interbanca, to General Electric in exchange for consumer finance units in a deal worth 1 billion euros (roughly $1.6 billion). Santander said it would acquire G.E. Money’s units in Germany, Finland and Austria as well as its card and auto-financing businesses in Britain. Santander picked up Interbanca in a three-way bid for ABN Amro last year.

The Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the maker of Kleenex tissues, is joining forces with Meetup for an initiative sponsored by the company’s baby brands, like Huggies and Pull-Ups. The effort, aimed at mothers of young children, represents Meetup’s first foray into sponsorship. The site is known as a facilitator of offline meetings of computer users who share interests like politics or parenthood. Kimberly-Clark is one of two marketers that have signed sponsorship agreements with Meetup, on undisclosed financial terms. The other is the American Express Company, whose Open division is collaborating on an initiative aimed at entrepreneurs and owners of small businesses. The sponsorships are indicative of the increasing interest on Madison Avenue in a wide variety of online tactics that include social networking, blogs, virtual worlds, community Web sites, social media and word-of-mouth marketing. All are part of what is known as Web 2.0, the efforts to encourage two-way conversations between brands and consumers rather than the traditional top-down method of corporations talking at  or down to  potential customers. “Brands can network like people network,” said Kirk Cheyfitz, chief executive at Story Worldwide in New York, an agency that has worked for marketers like A&amp;E Networks, Nestlé, Toyota Motor and Unilever. There is, however, a danger for advertisers who turn up on a Web site like meetup.com or at the meetings that Meetup helps people arrange. If consumers perceive that Web 2.0 activities are being overly commercialized, they will decry the involvement of the marketers and mark down the value of the efforts to a big fat 0. Kimberly-Clark executives say they are aware of those risks. “We started with feedback from Meetup members and organizers as to whether they would want a sponsor and what they would find of value from a sponsor,” said Brad Santeler, director for media and relationship marketing at the Neenah, Wis., office of Kimberly-Clark. “It’s very transparent,” he added. “We asked them what they wanted, and we’re providing that.” For instance, Kimberly-Clark is paying the monthly fees that organizers of affinity groups usually pay to Meetup.  Likewise, at American Express, said Marcy Shinder, vice president for brand strategy and marketing at the Open division in New York, “we don’t impose” anything on the Meetup members. Rather, she added, “we generate something together that’s meaningful to them.” “This group is honest,” Ms. Shinder said of entrepreneurs. “They’ll tell you what they think.” And so far, she added, the feedback from the 30 Meetup organizers with whom the company is working has been encouraging. In its foray into Meetup, Ms. Shinder said, the Open division is using as a template its “authentic relationships” with other organizations like Count Me In for Women’s Economic Independence, which helps female entrepreneurs. Open is a founding sponsor of an online program called Make Mine a Million-Dollar Business (makemineamillion.org), introduced by Count Me In, which offers money, mentors and marketing assistance to fledgling firms run by women. Meetup has more than 37,000 groups with more than five million regular users, said Dominic Preuss, vice president for marketplace at Meetup in New York, and helps arrange about 80,000 physical get-togethers each month. “If the organizers of groups feel ‘sold to,’ it would not be in our interest” to make deals with marketers, Mr. Preuss said. “It’s not just about throwing money at them,” he added. “They have to see value in the sponsorship.” “With any new program, there are things that work and things that don’t work,” Mr. Preuss said. What seems to work best so far, he added, are “offers that are specific to groups, targeted and customized, that increase the value of their meet-ups.” For example, Kimberly-Clark is offering expectant mothers a “Huggies Baby Countdown” widget, which calculates how much longer their pregnancies will last based on their due dates. The widget can be downloaded from more than 20 Web sites like Facebook, Freewebs, iGoogle and MySpace. “It’s about creating opportunities for consumers who want to engage with our brands and giving them the tools to do that,” Mr. Santeler of Kimberly-Clark said. His colleague, Kate Johnson, consumer relationship marketing manager, praised the Meetup sponsorship as a way for Kimberly-Clark to influence “that over-the-fence decision” made after one neighbor tells another about a product she likes  or dislikes. “When you have one mom talking to another, it’s powerful,” Ms. Johnson said. “So we’re offering them information and tools and activities; we’re not in their face with advertising.” Similarly, said Ms. Shinder at American Express Open, the deal with Meetup would provide “access and support.” The access is to experts who can help with tasks like developing business plans and managing cash flow, she added, and the support is for “Meetup organizers on how to put together great events.” “If you look at entrepreneurs, they’ve been doing social networking before it had a name,” Ms. Shinder said. “We’ve learned that you reach them where they are.”  The American Express Open sponsorship is scheduled to continue with the 30 Meetup groups through the end of the year, Ms. Shinder said, at which time “we’ll see how we can scale it out even more broadly.” “Before we take it from 30 to 500,” she added, “we want to make the model as strong as possible.” The Kimberly-Clark sponsorship is a six-month pilot program with 100 Meetup groups, Mr. Santeler said, and is planned to run through June. Both companies also have extensive online presences. American Express Open has a Web site called openforum.com. Kimberly-Clark Web sites include huggiesbabynetwork.com, happyhealthypregnancy.com and huggieshappybaby.com. Kimberly-Clark intends to devote about 35 percent of its overall marketing spending this year to nontraditional media like the Internet, said a spokesman, Joey Mooring, compared with about 25 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2004.

But many plan on spending more for on-the-road productivity tools like laptops and mobile phones and other wireless devices. Two-thirds of the companies said they expected to be in a better position on negotiating prices with suppliers, and more than half said they needed to put more effort into monitoring “employee compliance to expense policies,” American Express said.

IN GUANGZHOU, THE RITZ The luxury hotel company Ritz-Carlton has opened a new property in Guangzhou, its fourth in mainland China. Formerly called Canton, Guangzhou is China’s third biggest city and the location of a growing number of multinational corporations. Like most five-star hotel brands, Ritz-Carlton has been aggressively expanding in China, and plans new hotels in the next two years in Sanya, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao. AIRLINE DELAYS UP Airline delays rose again in January, to 27.6 percent of all flights, compared with 26.9 percent in January 2007, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics said. The delay rate in January, a slow travel month, was lower than in December, when 35.7 percent of flights arrived late. Baggage handling continued to improve, however. In January 2008, reports of delayed, damaged or lost bags were 7.37 per 1,000 passengers, an improvement over the 8.19 per 1,000 passengers in January 2007, and the 9.01 rate in December 2007. MORE PLANES FOR CONTINENTAL Continental Airlines added 27 aircraft to its orders at Boeing: 8 new 777s and 19 new Next-Generation 737s. With the new orders, Continental has commitments to buy 111 new Boeing aircraft  25 of the 787 model, the 8 new 777s, and 78 of the 737s  for delivery over the next six years. Continental already flies 20 777s globally. It said it would use the new 777s for long-haul international routes, like the Newark-to-Shanghai flights scheduled to start in 2009. The airline said it also needed wide-body planes that can fly international routes for the start of its service to London Heathrow next month.

Here are snapshots from the report compiled by Karlyn Bowman, using results from a survey conducted by the Gallup Organization in August. When asked what they wear to work most days, about 6 percent said ''formal business clothes''; 52 percent said ''casual business''; 25 percent said ''casual street clothes, such as jeans''; and 15 percent said they wore a uniform. About 67 percent of men said they never wore a tie at work. And 20 percent said they did so ''occasionally.'' The ''hours worked in a typical week (mean): 43.6.'' When asked how much time their colleagues waste during the day, the mean number reported was 90 minutes. When asked how much time they waste, respondents said one hour. About 8 percent said their commute took two hours or more, while 28 percent said it took them 30 minutes or less. The most common response, at 36 percent, was 30 to 59 minutes. About 85 percent of respondents said they usually drove to work. Only 4 percent said they took mass transit, while just 3 percent said they walked. On the question of what was their personal best time of day, 55 percent said mornings, 15 percent said afternoons, 20 percent said evenings, and 6 percent said late nights. Presumably the other 4 percent are cranky all the time. FUN WITH OSCAR Here, courtesy of Clayton Neuman in Fast Company, are a few tidbits to ponder, should the broadcast of ''Hollywood's greatest night'' lag on Sunday: ABC paid an estimated $50 million to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the right to broadcast this year's Oscars. There is a 200 percent increase in weekly box-office revenue for a film that receives a nomination for either best picture or best actor. A best actress nomination, however, increases revenues by only 150 percent. The estimated cost to produce the 40 statuettes for this year is $16,000. PENNY UNWISE Quick! Which costs more? A house that is listed at $450,000 or one on the market for $451,435? According to a paper done for the Cornell University business school, and cited by The Atlantic, many people will say the precise price ($451,435) is less expensive, even though it is not. The explanation, according to the magazine, is that ''because we tend to use precise numbers for small amounts and round numbers (lots of zeros) for large ones, sellers can make buyers perceive a price is smaller than it is by replacing zeros with other digits.'' The authors examined 27,000 real estate transactions in New York and Florida and found the Florida homes with listing prices that ended in three zeros sold for 0.73 percent less than comparable properties. (The effect ''was slightly less pronounced'' in New York.) It doesn't sound like much, but it amounts to more than $3,000 on a $450,000 sale. CALLING ALL GUYS ''Do you consider yourself very happy? Very successful? Are you sure? If so, count yourself among rare company,'' Best Life writes. Of the 1,026 men ages 30 to 54 surveyed by the magazine, in conjunction with American Express, just 10 percent said they were both ''very happy and very successful.'' So, does that mean that the other 90 percent are unhappy failures? ''Not quite,'' the magazine concludes. ''It simply means the majority of us are still striving for gains in career, relationships and family (81 percent in the poll cop to doing just that).'' FINAL TAKE We end with a depressing number. Citing research by the National Endowment for the Arts, Reader's Digest writes, ''38 percent of employers consider high school graduates deficient as readers.'' PAUL B.

Patients, unable to find care elsewhere, flowed in from every corner of the country. And if one of them was fortunate enough to find a bed here, she often had to share it. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Under the Red Umbrella Graphic Who Finances the Global Fund? CNBC: Is "Red" Charity Falling Short? Enlarge This Image Riccardo Gangale for The New York Times At the Treatment and Research AIDS Center in Kigali, doctors now have more time for patients, in part because of Red money. Today, a dozen patients, mostly women, sit in neat waiting rooms, laughing and talking as children play around them. Doctors greet one another as they make their rounds, and take all the time they need to explain the complicated schedule H.I.V. drugs require. According to the center’s managing director, Dr. Anita Asiimwe, doctors spend less time on crises and more time researching how to slow H.I.V. transmission in this tiny African nation, still recovering from a genocide in 1994. Dr. Asiimwe thanks an unlikely benefactor for all these improvements: the American shopper. Just over a year ago, the rock star Bono started Red, a campaign that combined consumerism and altruism. Since then, consumers have generated more than $22 million to fight H.I.V. and AIDS in Rwanda by buying iPods, T-shirts, watches, cologne and most recently  as anyone who watched the Super Bowl knows  laptops, with all of them branded “(Product)RED.” According to Rwandan officials, Red contributions have built 33 testing and treatment centers, supplied medicine for more than 6,000 women to keep them from transmitting H.I.V. to their babies, and financed counseling and testing for thousands more patients. Yet detractors say Red has fallen short. They criticize a lack of transparency at the company and its partners over how much they make from Red products, and whether they spend more money on Africa or advertising. “Look at all the promotions they’ve put out,” said Inger L. Stole, a communications professor at the University of Illinois. “The ads seem to be more about promoting the companies and how good they are than the issue of AIDS.” In the Super Bowl ad Sunday, which promoted Dell’s recent Red debut, a man buys a Red laptop and finds himself cheered in the street by strangers and kissed by a beautiful woman. At the end of the commercial, three screens flash in rapid succession: “Buy Dell. Join (RED). Save Lives.” In its March 2007 issue, Advertising Age magazine reported that Red companies had collectively spent as much as $100 million in advertising and raised only $18 million. Officials of the campaign said then that the companies had spent $50 million on advertising and that the amount raised was $25 million. Advertising Age stood by its article. The Red campaign itself does not advertise, said Susan Smith Ellis, the chief executive. Instead, companies pay Red a licensing fee to label one or more of their products “(RED).” Then, they pay a portion of sales from those products to the Global Fund, a public-private charity set up six years ago to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in Africa. The fund sends the money to three countries  Rwanda, Ghana and Swaziland  to help women and children infected with H.I.V. and to educate those who are uninfected in how to stay that way. The percentage of profit that goes to the fund depends on the item and the company. For instance, 1 percent of all spending on American Express’s Red cards goes to the fund, as do 50 percent of net profits from the sale of Gap Red items and $8.50 from each sale of a Motorola Red Motorazr. In return, the companies can market themselves as socially conscious and, ideally, increase sales. (Neither Red nor the companies would disclose revenue or total contributions by company or product.) According to a 2006 poll by Cone Inc., a marketing agency in Boston, 89 percent of Americans between 13 and 25 would switch from one brand to another associated with a “good cause,” if products and prices were comparable. Over all, more than $59 million has been contributed by Red and its corporate partners to the Global Fund. Red-financed projects have helped put more than 30,000 people on antiretroviral treatment and provided more than 300,000 H.I.V.-positive pregnant women with counseling and treatment, according to data from Red and the fund. Red and its donors have contributed nearly all the corporate money that has gone to the fund, which had $2.4 billion in 2007. This made Red the 15th-largest donor  more than Russia has given so far, and more than China, Saudi Arabia and Switzerland have pledged. Officials at Gap and Hallmark Cards say the two companies financed African H.I.V. programs even before joining Red. All told, Red’s contributions make up less than 2 percent of the Global Fund’s total. And the money from Red does not increase funding for the Global Fund programs it is directed to; instead, it allows the fund to shift money to other programs. Red’s contributions also do not necessarily go to the countries hardest hit by H.I.V. and AIDS; they go only to programs with proven success records. Christoph Benn, an official at the Global Fund, said Red contributions allowed the fund to divert money to programs in 136 other countries and to increase its visibility. 1 2 Next Page » Ron Nixon reported from Rwanda last year and added updated information from New York.

Net income for the company declined to $831 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $922 million, or 75 cents, in the period a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations was 71 cents a share. That matched the average forecast by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue rose 10 percent, to $7.36 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $7.78 billion. The company released its results after markets closed. Shares of American Express fell 2.9 percent in after-hours electronic trading, dropping $1.39, to $46.01. They had ended regular trading up $1.96, or 4.3 percent, at $47.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. Results included a $438 million charge, or $274 million after taxes, to increase loss reserves as consumer credit quality, especially in California and Florida, showed signs of weakness. American Express had announced plans for a charge on Jan. 10, worrying investors who had thought its wealthier cardholders might be less likely to experience financial pressure as the economy slowed. Lower consumer spending could result in lower card fees. “We are not immune from further deterioration in the economic and credit environment,” the chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement. “We believe our focus on the premium sector should help us to weather the current conditions better than many competitors.” Mr. Chenault said his outlook for 2008 remained “cautious,” with slower earnings growth. For all of 2007, profit rose 8 percent, to $4.01 billion. On Jan. 23, Capital One Financial, another large card issuer, said fourth-quarter profit fell 42 percent.

The company will take a $275 million fourth-quarter charge as more cardholders fail to repay their debts, the company, based in New York, said in a statement. Its stock fell 7 percent in extended trading. Credit card companies have been increasing their estimates of bad loans as a weakening economy makes it harder for consumers to pay their debts. American Express said its first-quarter 2008 earnings from continuing operations would be less than the 90 cents a share in the period in 2007, missing the 93-cent average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Another credit card company, The Capital One Financial Corporation, said that its 2007 earnings would fall short of its previous expectations because of increased loan delinquencies and additional legal reserves. The company said in a statement that it expected a t fourth-quarter profit of 60 cents a share and full-year earnings of about $3.97 a share, below its forecast of “about $5 per share.” The company said it was taking a $1.9 billion provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter, including about $1.3 billion in charge-offs.

But those powerful psychic forces compete with the other urge of the holiday season  to give to charities, whether out of guilt or benevolence. Thank goodness, then, that there’s a way to do both. It’s called embedded giving, and it means that you never have to choose between that expensive watch and making a worthy donation. Skip to next paragraph The Board Blog Additional commentary, background information and other items by Times editorial writers. Go to The Board » Here’s how it works: purchase a product and a portion of the price, the marketers say, will go to such a cause. Take the Montblanc TimeWalker Chronograph Automatic, which ads say champions an organization that protects Santa Monica Bay in California. The magazine ad  featuring a tanned Nicolas Cage  reassures potential buyers: “Helping Others Gives Success True Meaning.” How could anyone argue with that? This is not an entirely new idea. American Express encouraged use of its charge card two decades ago by promising to donate a penny from every purchase toward the restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. It raised $1.7 million. Patriotism sells. So does the environment, education, the arts and curing cancer. But people who feed their philanthropic urges by shopping should beware. This kind of fund-raising is largely unregulated, and the few state laws that exist are mostly unenforced. There’s often no telling where the money goes. As The Times recently reported, several charities named in a holiday catalog from the upscale New York retailer Barneys  including the World Wildlife Fund  found out they were listed only when a reporter contacted them. In a sensible stab at accountability, Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, introduced a bill last week that would require better notification to charities and their consent in any marketing. Buyers would have to be told how much of the item’s price actually goes to the charity. Rooting out philanthropic hawkers is going to be tough, especially in the age of Internet retailing. A host of profit-seeking sites have sprung up online, with names like benevolink.com (slogan: I Shop. Therefore I Give.) and charitymall.com, offering to satisfy the giving spirit. For now, the old-fashioned, direct, tried and true route to charity seems best.

For the cash savvy, the program is a potential windfall, allowing users to rack up rewards points that qualify them for free trips and other perks. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jennifer S. Altman for the New York Times Its easy, its automatic and its convenient, Steven Altman said of paying rent by credit card. He and his wife, Lisa Schneider, and their son Joseph live in the Tribeca Green building in Manhattan. But, financial experts say, those who are already in credit trouble should generally steer clear. They worry that cash-short homeowners, squeezed by falling house prices, rising interest rates and a general credit tightening, could use their credit cards as a short-term fix to avoid losing their house  and this could ultimately push the homeowner into even deeper credit problems. Both American Express and Visa offer programs allowing people to pay their mortgage or rent using a credit card. American Express first started offering the initiative in 2003, when it teamed up with a residential developer, Related Companies, to allow tenants to pay rent at 16 of its rental buildings in New York and San Francisco. At the time, housing was booming and landlords were jockeying for ways to lure people away from homeownership and into rental properties. David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related Companies, said the program had been hugely successful. Rents in Manhattan are among the highest in the country and when youre paying $4,000 or $5,000 in rent for an apartment, its nice to get something back through the credit card rewards programs, he said. American Express has since extended the program to about 200 cities in 35 states. In May 2007, American Express expanded the concept to mortgages. It formed partnerships with American Home Mortgage (which has since filed for bankruptcy protection) and IndyMac Bank to allow cardholders to make their mortgage payments with credit cards if they closed a mortgage with one of the two partners. Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for American Express, emphasized that the program caters to people with strong credit and payment histories and does not include subprime mortgages. She said efforts were under way to seek more banks to participate in the program. Visa started offering similar rental and mortgage payment programs this year. Steven Altman, who is 38, enrolled in Visas program at his Manhattan rental building, Tribeca Green, in February. I signed up for it as soon as they offered it, said Mr. Altman, who has lived in the building since 2005. Its easy, its automatic and its convenient. Mr. Altman, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, said the program suited him because he always paid his rent on time and always paid off his credit card in full. If you pay your rent on time, you might as well do it this way and get the points, said Mr. Altman, who estimated that his monthly rent would accumulate enough points to qualify for several free airline tickets a year. Youre just writing the check to a different place. Mr. Altman said he would definitely sign up for the mortgage option if he purchased a home. Who doesnt love points? he asked. For homeowners with no liquidity problems, the credit card program is similar to an interest-free loan, said Nessa Feddis, a lawyer with the American Bankers Association. Basically, youre paying your mortgage with your credit card on one date, and then you dont have to actually have to pay it off until a couple of weeks later. The program could also be a short-term solution for homeowners and renters facing temporary money problems because of an illness or unexpected expense, Ms. Feddis said. Its useful in an emergency. But, said Paul Miller, managing director at the FBR Group, those who are not making a payment out of their income will probably default on the loan at some point. If you need a credit card to make a house payment, youre a very distressed borrower and most likely youre going to run into trouble. Anthony L. Ebers, IndyMacs chief operating officer, emphasized that his bank offered the mortgage credit card program only to people with high credit scores and solid track records for paying their rent or mortgage on time. Since teaming up with American Express, he said, about 50 people have signed up for the program and none have defaulted on their payments. But Mr. Ebers said he continued to monitor the program closely. He said his company planned to meet with American Express on April 2, 2008, to assess the pilot program. Although the credit card mortgage programs try to weed out people with poor credit records, they do not eliminate them entirely. You can always do a cash advance on your credit card and pay a mortgage that way, said Vicki Vidal, senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association. A lender cant control that. Statistics in Britain show that homeowners have already been tapping their cards. A British poll released in October indicated that more than a million households had used a credit card to make a monthly mortgage or rental payment in the last 12 months. The poll, conducted by British marketing research firm YouGov for Roof magazine, indicated that 6 percent of all households had used credit cards, with the highest percentage, 7.5 percent, among young people, age 18 to 24. In the United States, outstanding balances on credit cards rose 6 percent on average in the second quarter, which is double the quarterly average increase from 2002 to 2006, said Dennis Moroney, senior analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services research and advisory firm. This indicates people are either using their credit cards more often or they are using the cards for bigger expenses like mortgages and rents, he said. Mr. Moroney estimated that the average household currently holds six or seven credit cards. Theres an enormous amount of credit cards out there that are held, but are not necessarily used right now, he said. Consumers may start to take advantage of that, he added. Christopher J. Spoth, assistant director of supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that it is important for credit card companies to monitor credit card balances and rescore people regularly. There are a lot of people walking around with 16 credit cards in their wallet, he said. Thats clearly a potential risk and why credit card providers need to monitor that. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/27/business/media/27adco.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">In-Store Wi-Fi Is Free, but Not Commercial-Free<date>Published: November 27, 2007</date><text>PEOPLE who like to use their laptops, iPhones and other devices in public are always so delighted when they stumble on a wireless hot spot in an unexpected place. Will they be pleased enough to look at ads before getting their broadband fix? AnchorFree, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that is two and a half years old, has introduced a service that lets merchants of any size  from a large bookstore chain to a mom-and-pop restaurant  offer free advertising-supported Wi-Fi to customers on the store premises. People who are shopping or eating in an AnchorFree location will see banner ads on their screens or short video spots or both before their browsing session. Among the major companies that have signed up to advertise are American Express, Circuit City, Clorox, Ford, Kaiser Permanente, McDonald’s, Toyota and Major League Baseball. Mark Smith, executive vice president for marketing and strategy at AnchorFree, said that advertisers could tailor their ads to reach people at specific locations in the network. For example, an ad for a Lexus might be shown to customers staying at a four-star hotel, but not to guests at an airport motel. “Advertisers could target airport travelers versus vehicle travelers, for instance,” he said. Considering the growing number of hand-held devices that offer Web browsing, Mr. Smith said he viewed the Wi-Fi network as an untapped market of virtual billboards. Controlling this valuable bit of real estate, he said, gives companies “the ability for them to have their own branded relationship” with people “while they are their point of consumption.”  Until recently, the two most widespread options people had for using wireless broadband at public hot spots have been either paying a subscription fee to their cellphone carrier or paying a daily or hourly rate to the retailer that is host of the site. AnchorFree is one of a handful of companies offering an alternative business model, one in which the advertiser pays but the retailer and the Web surfer do not. Businesses that traditionally offer Wi-Fi to customers  hotels, for example  can sign up with AnchorFree at no cost and collect a share of up to 50 percent of the advertising revenue. For small businesses, which might not be able to afford Wi-Fi service, AnchorFree will supply the necessary router and other technology at no cost. The retailer can then promote its free wireless service, which could prove to be a competitive advantage. Some hotels, for instance, charge guests $10 to $15 a night for Wi-Fi access. Mr. Smith said that AnchorFree’s technology created a “persistent messaging frame” by pushing down the Web page on a device’s screen and inserting a space for a banner ad. The space is independent of the Web pages being viewed and does not change based on where the user is surfing. AnchorFree offers several options to retailers and advertisers. With the open network option, a retailer agrees to run any ad from the AnchorFree rotation, and in the closed network option a company with multiple locations (like a bookstore chain or hotel) can run its own advertising or other messages within that network. Brad Agens, senior vice president for advertising sales at Gorilla Nation, a company that connects online advertisers to more than 500 Web sites, said that AnchorFree was the first network it was representing. He said that companies seeking to buy ad space online were “looking beyond the portals and the large, branded destinations, the ESPNs, the MTVs.”  AnchorFree is not the only company to offer an advertising network for mobile broadband. JiWire, based in San Francisco, has a similar system, though a different technological approach. Analysts in the wireless industry say they expect that this sector will evolve and mature along with the growth of wireless Internet use. “The real key is whether advertisers will embrace this model and drive online advertising revenue toward Wi-Fi hot spots,” said Berge Ayvazian, chief strategy officer with the Yankee Group, a technology research and consulting group. He said it was too early to evaluate whether wireless advertising would emerge as a distinct and robust market, separate from the more established realm of online advertising. “New economic models around advertising are disruptive,” Mr. Ayvazian said. “If companies like AnchorFree can add a new layer of innovation around free broadband access, they can be disruptive again and take market share.” More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E1D8163DF93BA35752C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">Visa Agrees To Pay Amex $2.1 Billion To Settle Suit<date>Published: November 8, 2007</date><text>Visa has agreed to pay $2.1 billion to its credit card rival American Express to settle damages relating to a 2004 antitrust lawsuit. The settlement, believed to be the largest amount ever paid to resolve an antitrust matter, was announced yesterday. It comes nearly three years after the Supreme Court ruled that Visa and MasterCard had violated antitrust rules by barring their member banks from offering their customers credit cards that could be used on rival payment networks. American Express and Discover Financial quickly filed suit, seeking billions of dollars in damages based on the revenue they believed they had lost. The settlement is likely to put pressure on Visa to strike a similar deal with Discover Financial. It also will turn the heat up on Visa's longtime rival MasterCard, which is the target of similar lawsuits by both American Express and Discover. The settlement, by resolving the financial uncertainties posed by the lawsuit, is expected to pave the way for Visa's initial public offering as early as this spring. The agreement will be financed by Visa's member banks. The industry has changed significantly in the wake of the antitrust ruling. Bank of America and Citigroup, two of the largest three credit card issuers, signed a deal to offer their own customers American Express-branded cards, and HSBC and General Electric's financial service arms reached agreements with Discover. And with the American credit card market largely saturated, debit cards and payments using mobile phones are the areas that are most ripe for growth. The agreement resolves American Express's claims against Visa's members, including some of the industry's biggest issuers, like JPMorgan Chase, Capital One, Washington Mutual and Wells Fargo. Visa will pay American Express $945 million now and an additional payment by the end of next March, its statement said. It will then pay American Express $70 million each quarter until the full settlement is paid. That payment is expected to be made largely with the proceeds of Visa's I.P.O., which will reduce the liabilities of each of its individual members. It will also significantly reduce the gains they might realize from the offering, however. Visa's new structure as a publicly traded company is expected to insulate shareholders from exposure to legal claims in several major cases. Those liabilities will be passed along to its member banks instead. But Visa still has to resolve its case with Discover, which has similarly high stakes. The $2.1 billion settlement with American Express will establish a benchmark, but it is not clear if the damages in the Discover case will be higher or lower. While Discover's own customers tend to charge less on their cards, holders of Discover cards issued through other banks spend significantly more. Discover's user fees may be lower than those of American Express, its more prestigious rival, however. Leslie Sutton, a Discover spokeswoman, declined to comment on any pending litigation. The lawsuit could put MasterCard on the hook for over a billion dollars in damages to both American Express and Discover. Sharon Gamsin, a MasterCard spokeswoman, said the company was ''confident in our legal position and believe we have a strong defense.'' Yesterday, MasterCard shares rose 8 cents, to $199.48. Discover shares fell 98 cents, to $17.26. American Express shares closed yesterday at $55.37, down $3.20. American Express said it would recognize $1.3 billion from the settlement in the fourth quarter. But in light of the windfall, it planned to incur charges for several expenses, including investments in its rewards and marketing programs, philanthropic activities and the cost of the litigation. The battle between Visa and American Express intensified in the last five months when Kenneth R. Feinberg, who headed the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, was brought in as a mediator. Lawyers reached agreement last Thursday, and the boards of both companies approved the settlement this week.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B01E5D6103BF935A35752C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">Memo Pad<date>Published: November 6, 2007</date><text>THE WORST YEAR Domestic airline performance through September of this year ranked as the worst for any comparable period in at least 12 years, the Transportation Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported yesterday.

One is a brash risk-taker who bootstrapped his way from an Alabama cotton farm to one of Wall Street's largest brokerage firms. The other made his mark as a consensus builder who leveraged ties to one of America's most powerful families to eventually lead the world's largest media company. E. Stanley O'Neal, 56, at Merrill Lynch and Richard D. Parsons, 59, at Time Warner, have nevertheless inhabited the public imagination as two executives who helped rewrite history by breaking down cultural barriers and rising to lead Fortune 500 companies. But Mr. O'Neal retired under pressure this week after an unauthorized merger approach to a rival bank and an $8.4 billion write-down that resulted in an overall loss of $2.3 billion for the quarter. And Mr. Parsons has announced that he planned to retire by March at the latest. He has been under pressure to turn the reins over to Time Warner's president, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, whom analysts say is likely to accelerate a shake-up by spinning off business units like AOL and Time Warner Cable. Along with ruminations on their legacies, their situations have led to a debate over whether their accomplishments have helped break down barriers facing a younger generation of black executives angling for the corner office. Industry observers and civil rights leaders say Mr. O'Neal's ouster has shed much-needed light on the dearth of African-Americans in so-called C-level positions in corporations, while underscoring the extent to which executive suites and boardrooms remain white male bastions. The subject of race has proven to be delicate for African-American executives, many of whom prefer to view themselves as -- at least publicly -- an ''an executive who happens to be black.'' They have earned the right through hard work, they say, to be judged on their merits. ''We have demonstrated that we can not only run companies and in many cases, run them quite well,'' says Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, a nonprofit civil rights organization. ''There is an abundance of African-American talent out there. My hope is that they will get their chance to rise up and pick up the mantle.'' The chief executive of StarCom, Renatta McCann, said, ''The victories of leaders like Stanley O'Neal and Richard Parsons are both symbolic and transformational.'' That said, she added. ''we have yet to reach a tipping point where the pipeline organically regenerates. We have to achieve momentum and velocity, and it has to achieve scale to make it sustainable.'' To be sure, African-American chief executives preside over several large companies, including American Express (Kenneth I. Chenault), Aetna (Ronald A. Williams), Darden Restaurants (Clarence Otis Jr.), Sears (Aylwin B. Lewis) and Symantec (John W. Thompson). Several African-Americans also run or hold senior roles in major subsidiaries of Fortune 500 companies like General Electric (Lloyd G. Trotter), McDonald's (Don Thompson), the Boeing Company (James A. Bell) and Xerox (Ursula Burns). While some critics this week raised questions of race in Mr. O'Neal's ouster, analysts and those with knowledge of Merrill's actions, say that was not the case. Mr. O'Neal was judged, they said, by the same standards of others in his position -- the company's performance and his relationship to the board. Mr. O'Neal could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Merrill, Jason H. Wright, said: ''During the years Stan was here, as an organization we very much embraced a meritocracy and inclusiveness that has translated into a more diverse work force that we're proud of. The board has been very engaged in those initiatives and has no intention of changing, regardless of who is C.E.O.'' Alfred Edmond Jr., editor in chief of Black Enterprise magazine, said, ''One of the biggest lessons is that being C.E.O. doesn't make you bulletproof.'' ''First we had to learn what it takes to get into that top spot,'' Mr. Edmond said, ''and now we're learning what it's like to live in it.''</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E02E3DA1F38F930A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=americanexpresscompany">American Express Has Higher Profits<date>Published: October 23, 2007</date><text>American Express, the credit card and travel services company, said yesterday that third-quarter earnings rose 10 percent, helped by increased spending among its consumer and corporate clients.

HOBBY Restoring her 100-year-old house When Dad was transferred to California, we sold our house in New Jersey and all my toys. You remember that when youre 5. At the last minute my mother said she didnt want to go. My father said that was fine, that hed quit and start his own business. He started a local messenger service. Then he expanded to long-haul tractor trailers, delivering items such as food products. When I was 14, I worked part time as an assistant to an orthodontist. I told him I had to quit because I needed to spend more time on schoolwork. I was signed up for advanced placement classes. He said: Why bother? Youre never going to amount to anything. I remember it like it was yesterday, but I wasnt going to let it stop me. (It was more about him than me, although sometimes I have fantasized Im on the cover of a major magazine and I mail it to him.) I was the first of my three siblings to go away to college. I went to Georgetown. For me, to be on my own was a huge decision for my family. I finished the semester and didnt go back. I just wasnt ready. I went home, attended a local college, Fairleigh Dickinson University, and worked as a bank teller. I returned to Georgetown the next year ready to weather the storms and did well. Watching my dad, I learned the importance of not disappointing a customer. Several times Id hear the phone ring in the middle of the night, then the front door opening and closing. Once he left to rescue a driver whose trailer was wedged under an overpass. He found him and let some air out of the tires. Another time, he drove to Vermont to help fix a truck that had broken down. Dad was also eternally optimistic. There was always some drama going on. An account would drop him, or someone didnt pay a bill, or an employee would walk out. But my fathers attitude was that he would get through it no matter what. Ive been at American Express for 17 years. I was promoted to head the Open division, which provides credit cards and financing to small businesses. When I left my first management position, the sales support team I supervised gave me a bunch of red pens as a parting gift. It was symbolic of how prolific I had been with my comments on whatever they wrote. I realized I had been busy telling them how to do their job instead of helping them visualize the destination and choose the path. I thought my way was the right way, but you learn more if you listen to others. I also learned perseverance from watching my father. When I was in the merchant division at American Express, we were trying to establish partnerships with large companies. Costco had eluded us for some time. Many of my colleagues said it would never happen. But we thought that if we could convince Costco to partner with us it could transform us, and other companies would notice and follow suit. I started collecting converts, one by one. I converted one person at Costco, too, and soon there was a nucleus of supporters there as well. We spent three years winning that account. Now theyre one of our largest partners. Were the exclusive card at the warehouse and the preferred card for the Web site. Im focused on encouraging women. One of our clients runs a trade show promotion business. She was doing reasonably well when she decided to enter a contest we helped create for female small-business owners. Contestants who make the final round give a three-minute pitch, and the winners get coaching and a loan. When this woman won, her business took off and hit a million dollars in annual revenue.

Brazil had been on my radar for a while, but once I decided to go recently, it was a very last-minute trip. Skip to next paragraph Long Island Pulse Nada Marjanovich is the publisher of Long Island Pulse. I have been flying most of my life, even as a child. And I fly quite a bit for business. I consider myself a very seasoned, savvy traveler. Nothing much can shake my confidence. I used frequent-flier miles for a round-trip ticket to Brazil. My first stop was to be Salvador de Bahia, the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia. I made special note of the potential for confusion between the country of El Salvador and Salvador de Bahia in Brazil. I took a lot of time to clarify my destination with the travel agent. I wanted to make absolutely sure that my final stop was going to be the country called Brazil, not the country of El Salvador. I was scheduled to leave on a Wednesday afternoon. I started packing my luggage on a Sunday night. And I made the unusual decision, at least for me, to look at my passport. Much to my dismay, my passport had expired. After a few quick Google searches, I found a New York City agency that could renew my passport in 24 hours. So that Monday morning, I trekked into the city and made my way to the agency. They took my picture, application and fees and told me everything was going to be just fine. On Tuesday morning at 9:10 I gave the agency a call. Somehow I knew the gods of flight were not going to be with me. I was right. My passport was rejected. I had worn a scarf in my hair and the passport people rejected the picture because some of my hair wasnt showing. At this point, I was starting to get the sinking feeling that I should cancel my trip. Meanwhile, I had some important last-minute meetings. I asked the agency people if I could send them a digital photo that I already had. They obliged. But at 2:15 p.m. that day, I got a call telling me that picture wouldnt work because my body was turned and passport photos require a straight-on portrait. I started screaming into the phone, begging them to please make it work. About 25 minutes later, I got a call saying that my documents were ready. I raced into the city from Port Jefferson in Long Island. Its normally a two-hour ride, but I did manage to make it into New York a few minutes before the agency closed for the day. I got my documents but still had this sinking feeling that this trip was not going to go well. On Wednesday, I got to the airport in plenty of time. I got my boarding pass and somehow even managed to get my favorite exit aisle seat. But just as I was starting to get comfortable, the pilot got on the public address system with this: Good afternoon. Welcome aboard. On todays flight to El Salvador we will be cruising ... . At that point, there was nothing I could do. The fates had won. When we landed in El Salvador, I grabbed the first ground agent I saw and started to plead my case. The official didnt seem too worried. In fact, he seemed to take it as a matter of course, telling me to relax. Apparently, he is confronted with issues like mine about once a day. It seems that many travelers to Brazil wind up in El Salvador. Who knew? Eventually, I did make it to Brazil. I was only a day late. I figured at that point that the fates were done with me. I was wrong. I was in Brazil, but my luggage was nowhere to be found. It took the airline six days to locate my bags. And when they finally arrived, most of my clothes were gone. The toiletries were a mess. And my bags were broken. Despite everything, I had an incredible time. I had a toothbrush. I had a bathing suit. I had a credit card. I was in Brazil. I may have lost every battle with the fates, but I did win the war. And that is the best revenge. By Nada Marjanovich, as told to Joan Raymond.

The Federal Reserve and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department  known as FinCen  said their orders were part of an action coordinated with the Justice Department. The payments to be made by the American Express entities under these actions total $65 million, according to a joint release issued by the Fed and FinCen. Federal authorities accused American Express Bank International of Miami and the American Express Travel Related Services Company of Salt Lake City of violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Both entities  without admitting any wrongdoing  consented to the penalties, the two agencies said in their release. We have cooperated fully with the government and understand the need for absolute vigilance in our efforts to protect against money laundering, said an American Express spokeswoman, Susan Atran. We have already made substantial efforts to augment and strengthen our compliance programs and will continue to do so. We are firmly committed to the agreements we have reached and to conducting our business with the highest standards of integrity, compliance and control. The Fed determined that American Express Bank International had significant breakdowns in carrying out compliance activities under the Bank Secrecy Act. It said the company failed to create an adequate anti-money-laundering program as well as procedures to monitor compliance. Banks and other financial institutions are required to have anti-money-laundering programs in place. Those programs are important to government efforts to catch terrorist financiers, drug lords and other criminals. Financial companies are also responsible for reporting suspicious financial transactions to the government. FinCen, among other things, determined that American Express Travel Related Services failed to file a significant number of suspicious activity reports in accordance with the Bank Secrecy Act.

Books. Pencils. An occasional field trip. And they talked about a fact of life: generous people would be glad to give money to buy supplies, but not necessarily to write a check that would vanish into the maw of the school system.Mr. Best, then 25 and a social studies teacher in the Bronx, set up DonorsChoose.org. He got his colleagues to post wish lists of small projects — one needed a set of dolls for a lesson on teenage pregnancy — and he corralled students to help him match donors with causes. It was like an online dating service, or a wedding registry, except one for pencils and SAT review guides. Yesterday, Mr. Best, in jeans and sneakers, walked across a loft on 36th Street in the garment district. The room was filled with people ordering supplies for schools, checking out requests, sending thank-yous: the mechanics of getting a job done. Once serving just the Bronx, where Mr. Best taught at the city’s Wings Academy, the DonorsChoose network now takes requests from eight states and four cities. Come September, the Web site will be open to every public school teacher in the country. So far, it has matched $13 million in donations to 28,000 school projects; 22,000 more are lined up. Most are from schools serving the poor. This weekend, Mr. Best and his colleagues will be watching another Web site, not their own. American Express is running a contest for its customers to select a good cause that will receive $1 million to $5 million. DonorsChoose is one of the final five, along with a forestry program, solar and wind energy projects, a national parks restoration effort and support for clean drinking water in poor countries. (More details are at membersproject.com.) The contest is built on the “American Idol” model, Desiree Fish, a spokeswoman for American Express, said yesterday. “It’s part of a marketing campaign.” That part has worked: The promotion, which included commercials with Martin Scorsese and Ellen DeGeneres, has brought attention to American Express. And it helps explain why some people will pay money to watch dogs fight: The public loves its gladiatorial battles. As the American Express contest enters its final weekend, the top two vote-getters are the water purification proposal and Mr. Best’s project. Winner takes all. Which means that American schoolchildren who need books so they can learn to read are fighting it out with African children who need clean water so they don’t die from diarrhea. At the same time that Mr. Best was starting DonorsChoose seven years ago, Greg Allgood, a public health specialist, was trying to market Pur, a water-purification product made by Procter &amp; Gamble. It was to be used in the homes of people in poor countries. The product was so cheap to make that the company had to sell vast quantities to make its profit margin acceptable. It did not sell enough. This was not a new deodorant failing: About as many people die from bad water as from H.I.V. or malaria, and most of them are under age 5. Mr. Allgood persuaded his bosses at Procter &amp; Gamble that they should continue to make the product and sell it at cost. “It was, and is, a not-for-profit effort,” he said, the first in the history of the company. He formed a group in the World Health Organization (who.int/household_water) that promotes home water treatment. He worked on water purification after the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean, in Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake, in Kenya after recent floods. After Mr. Allgood entered the American Express contest — he proposed support for nonprofit projects involved in water purification — commentary at the American Express Web site suggested that his entry is part of a stealth Procter &amp; Gamble marketing scheme. The company is just starting to sell Pur in the United States. If the water project wins, Mr. Allgood said, not a penny will go to Procter &amp; Gamble, but to Unicef, which does use Pur now, but will conduct a competitive process to choose among four methods of successful home water purification. And if the school charity wins, Mr. Best said, the voters can choose which classroom projects to fund. American Express, it seems, wins either way.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/business/31memo.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Memo Pad<date>Published: July 31, 2007</date><text>NORTHWEST CANCELLATIONS MOUNT Northwest Airlines is again canceling large numbers of flights as the end of a month nears. The airline canceled 526 flights from Friday through Sunday (out of a total 4,187). Yesterday alone, Northwest canceled 117 flights as of 6 p.m. In a memo to Northwest employees on Friday, the chief executive officer, Douglas M. Steenland, blamed pilot absenteeism for the mounting delays. Northwest canceled more than 1,000 flights in the last week of June. Northwest then thinned the July schedule in anticipation of staffing challenges, Mr. Steenland told employees. The Northwest branch of the Air Line Pilots Association said in late June that Northwest was unfairly blaming pilots for problems caused primarily by insufficient staff in a system with no slack. Northwest crews have been routinely reaching their maximum monthly limits on work hours near the end of a month. The pilots union said that cutbacks had left about 400 pilots on furlough. In his memo last week, Mr. Steenland said that all furloughed pilots wishing to return to Northwest have been notified of their dates to report for retraining. BUSINESS JET BOOM Deliveries of business jets rose 14.7 percent, to 475 aircraft, in the first six months of this year compared with the period in 2006, the General Aircraft Aviation Manufacturers Association says. The largest of the production business jets continued selling well. Airbus delivered five of its Airbus Corporate Jets, and Boeing delivered three Boeing Business Jets. The jets cost $45 million to $50 million each. DEMAND FOR SUMMER AIR TRAVEL Worldwide airline passenger traffic rose 6.3 percent in the first six months of 2007 compared with the period last year, the International Air Transport Association said. Strong passenger demand means record numbers of people will travel in August, said Giovanni Bisignani, the chief executive officer of the airline trade group. HOTELS RATED BY SEGMENT The highest-rated hotels in guest satisfaction, according to an annual survey of guest responses gathered for the hotel industry by J. D. Power &amp; Associates, were these: Ritz-Carlton (luxury segment); Embassy Suites (upscale segment); Hilton Garden Inn (midscale, full-service segment); Drury Inn &amp; Suites (midscale, limited service segment); Microtel Inns &amp; Suites (economy segment); and Homewood Suites (extended-stay segment). The survey is based on responses from 47,634 guests who stayed in domestic hotels from June 2006 to June 2007. Guest satisfaction is defined by room quality, reservations process, the check-in and check-out experience, hotel services and amenities, and prices. ET CETERA The annual convention of the National Business Travel Association in Boston last week drew more than 6,200 people, breaking last years record of 5,500. ... Reflecting surging business travel demand in Asia, American Express said it acquired a full equity stake in Farrington American Express Travel Services of Hong Kong.

Link in Amex Contest Raises Questions of Fairness<date>Published: July 28, 2007</date><text>One of the five finalists in a contest to select an idea that will win up to $5 million from the American Express Corporation is an effort to bring safe drinking water to children in poverty stricken countries. Called the Children’s Safe Drinking Water project, it leads the pack with more than 11,000 votes as of Friday evening, according to the Web site for the contest, called the Members Project. But some card members have raised questions about the project after learning that the idea came from a Procter &amp; Gamble employee who oversees a company program with the same name and similar goals. “I think it’s actually more than odd that, when you look at this project, you don’t see P.&amp; G.,” one card member wrote on the contest’s Web site, www.membersproject.com. “I think that’s by design.” Another card member wrote: “It is my honest and completely personal opinion that it is absurd that this project is part of the ‘Members Project.’ The project was posted by a Procter &amp; Gamble employee, and it is a project that involves distributing Procter &amp; Gamble products, which is tantamount to a huge advertising campaign for the company.” In fact, the project in the contest does not call for the use of Procter &amp; Gamble products. A spokeswoman for American Express, Desiree Fish, stressed that the project’s only connection to P.&amp; G. was through the card member who proposed the idea, Gregory S. Allgood. Ms. Fish said Mr. Allgood, who is the director of Procter &amp; Gamble’s Children’s Safe Drinking Water program, had submitted his idea under that name. “No money will go to Procter &amp; Gamble,” Ms. Fish said. Rather, if the project wins the contest, Unicef would receive the money and use it to support clean water efforts. “American Express took card members’ ideas that were submitted and paired them with an organization of our choosing to help bring an idea to life,” Ms. Fish said. Although Unicef and P.&amp; G. have an alliance, a spokeswoman for Unicef, Lisa Szarkowski, said any money from the contest would be allocated through competitive bidding. American Express started the contest in May and received more than 7,000 submissions from cardholders, Ms. Fish said. More than 30,000 cardholders have voted on the five finalists  linked to the nonprofit groups American Forests, the American Solar Energy Society, DonorsChoose.org and the National Parks Foundation  and the winner will be announced Aug. 7. Mr. Allgood said he was distraught over the questions his entry had raised and had considered whether to change the name on his entry or even withdraw it. As of Friday evening, he had decided to stay in the contest. “The whole reason I’m doing this is to save kids’ lives,” he said, “and I don’t want to do anything that would interfere with that mission.” He said Procter &amp; Gamble employees were aware of his entry through his blog. In addition, the company, which has more than 100,000 employees, made note of the entry in its internal newsletter. The nonprofit groups linked with the four other finalists in the contest expressed envy at the potential reach Mr. Allgood’s idea has thanks to his corporate affiliation. “It feels like David and Goliath because not only is it a competition of ideas, but when you take into consideration that Unicef is a $300 million-plus entity combined with P.&amp; G.  how do you compete with that?” asked Neal Lurie, the marketing director at the American Solar Energy Society. The organization, which has been paired with an idea to bring small solar- and wind-powered generators to homes, has revenue of about $1.6 million, making it the smallest of the nonprofits among the final five. Charles Best, chief executive of DonorsChoose, a nonprofit organization that raises money online to buy supplies and underwrite projects proposed by teachers, used the same metaphor to describe his feelings. “We’re up against a real Goliath, but we’re totally energized,” Mr. Best said.

Skip to next paragraph Alex Eben Meyer Tool Kit Resources for entrepreneurs, small business owners and their employees to help make smarter decisions and keep up with the stuff they need to know. Paul B. Brown's Columns » But the odds are even if you have one it is (a) too long, and (b) not properly focused. That is the takeaway message from an article in Inc. magazine. Paradoxically, for an article on a topic about how to focus, the magazine piece  done as a screenplay for no apparent reason  rambles. But it does make four solid points. ¶The pitch must be focused on what you can do for a customer, not on how wonderful your firm is. ¶It needs to be internalized companywide. Every employee needs to give the same explanation when asked by a prospective prospect what it is your firm does. ¶The message needs to be painfully clear. The potential customer must be able to get it immediately. And ¶Short. Aim for 15 seconds (or less.) WHAT DO THEY THINK? You can conduct extensive, expense market research into what your customers think. And Gail Goodman, chief executive of Constant Contact, which offers e-mail marketing and survey products, will be happy to help you, if that is the route you want to go. But Ms. Goodman believes you can get a pretty good initial handle on how they feel about you by asking these seven simple questions: 1. How would you rate your overall satisfaction with us?

You probably want to check out the site, if for no other reason than your employees probably are. VIVE LA DIFFÉRENCE! Among business owners, more women (90 percent) than men (84 percent) use the Internet for work. Women who run their own companies (66 percent) are more optimistic about the economy in coming months than their male counterparts (59 percent) and fewer women (65 percent vs. 73 percent) say they make sacrifices in their personal life in order to run a business. Heres our favorite question from the survey, conducted by the American Express Small Business Monitor, which talked to a nationally representative sample of 626 small-business owners and managers of companies with fewer than 100 employees. When asked whether being an entrepreneur contributes to a happy relationship with their significant other, some 85 percent of women said yes, compared with 77 percent of male small-business owners. LAST CALL You are not alone. That is the takeaway message from an article in Money magazine. Some 672,000 small businesses were created in 2005, the latest figures available from the Small Business Administration, and more on the way. In a Yahoo Small Business and Harris Interactive Poll of adult Americans, two-thirds of respondents said they had considered starting their own business someday, according to the article. Nearly 40 of them said that someday would be within the next five years. Of course, just because you start a business does not mean it will succeed.

American Express, the card and travel service company based in New York, also said it had increased the amount of money it has reserved for loan losses, as have many other financial services companies, to brace for a continuing deterioration in credit quality. Net income rose to $1.06 billion in the second quarter, or 88 cents a share, from $945 million, or 76 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Income from continuing operations also totaled 88 cents a share in the latest period, up from 78 cents a share a year ago. The results were helped by a surge in overseas profit, and a $65 million tax benefit related to the treatment of income from card fees in previous years. Total revenue rose to $7.13 billion, from $6.54 billion a year ago. The company’s results beat Wall Street forecasts. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial projected earnings of 86 cents a share on $7.49 billion of revenue. But in after-hours trading, the company’s shares fell about 1 percent. The stock, which closed up 15 cents at $64.66 yesterday, reached an all-time high of $65.89 on Thursday. In the second quarter, the company raised its provisions for losses in its United States card business by 85 percent, to $640 million, and its total loss provisions by 36 percent to $993 million. The percent of credit card loans written off on an annualized basis rose to 4.1 percent in the second quarter from 3.8 percent a year earlier.

When it comes to advertising on the mobile Web, though, they are treading carefully. On the one hand, executives and analysts said, online retailers are right to be cautious. After all, few consumers are buying items through their mobile devices. But at least some online retailers say they have found enticing success from early marketing efforts, as long as those initiatives are aimed at simply keeping themselves on the radar of customers as opposed to trying to prompt an immediate purchase or a visit to the companys Web site. Take Moosejaw Mountaineering, for example, an outdoor goods retailer based in Madison Heights, Mich. Earlier this year, Moosejaw began sending out text messages to more than 1,000 of its customers who had signed up to receive them. The campaign caught on quickly, with recipients often sending messages back to the retailer and receiving loyalty program points as a reward. A recent message sent to customers, for instance, conveyed the news that someone had told Robert Wolfe, one of Moosejaws founders, that he looked like Ben Stiller. It then asked customers whether that was a good thing and promised points in the companys rewards program for those who answered correctly (meaning yes). Sixty-six percent of the customers who received the message voted. Mr. Wolfe said he tested a text messaging campaign two years ago with his customers (largely college students and recent graduates), but messages were too costly to send and receive, so he abandoned the idea. Now, with cellphone service carriers offering unlimited texting plans, he thinks the time is right to try again. With our customer base, we have to be first to market with this type of stuff, he said. The content of the messages was, Mr. Wolfe said, in keeping with the companys mission to have as much fun as possible with our customers. The next contest will ask customers which Kelly they prefer, the one from Beverly Hills 90210 or the one from Saved by the Bell. We try to be as dumb as you can possibly be, he said. Mr. Wolfe said the campaign is helping sales, although he declined to say how much. In future versions of the texting campaign, he said, the company would take a page from past marketing initiatives and include coupon codes for those who reply. The logic of that approach, he said, may be lost on more mainstream e-commerce executives. We sent out a mailer once that said text us back for a coupon code to get a free Moosejaw T-shirt with any order, Mr. Wolfe said. A real Internet business person would say its a mistake to do that, because the customer has to receive the e-mail, get on the phone and text us, then wait for the reply to get the code, then go back to the computer to put in their order. We couldve just sent out a coupon code in an e-mail, Mr. Wolfe continued. But texting is cool enough that we were willing to risk some friction, knowing the upside was that people would talk about it in their dorm rooms. Mr. Wolfe said he would consider buying graphical advertisements for mobile Internet devices, but with the exception of iPhones, he said, screens are not sufficient to render ads effectively. Of the roughly 230 million Americans with cellphones, about half have used them to send or receive text messages, while only about 32 million use them to browse the Web, according to Greg Sterling, an analyst with the Internet consultancy Sterling Market Intelligence. Thirty two million is still a significant number, he said, but text is where most of the volume is. While e-commerce companies take their time exploring mobile advertising, some of the biggest offline marketers, like Visa, American Express and Coca-Cola, have been more aggressive. That is partly because online merchants typically pursue different goals with their marketing dollars than, say, consumer goods manufacturers, who chiefly want people to remember their brands when they shop at the supermarket. Online merchants, by contrast, try to generate purchases or Web site visits with their ads. The fact that big brand marketers are actually ahead of e-commerce companies in this respect is a big switch, said Thomas Burgess, chief executive of Third Screen Media, a mobile advertising technology company that is a subsidiary of AOLs Advertising.com. Its been the opposite of the early days of the Internet, he said. Only now, when were two and a half years into the real buying, are we seeing e-commerce companies come and say, This can drive traffic to our sites.  Online retailers with less technologically aware customers than those of , say, Moosejaw have ignored even text messaging as a marketing tool. William Strauss, chief executive of Provide Commerce, the parent company of, among others, the online flower seller ProFlowers, said he might consider a texting campaign like that used by Moosejaw if customers opted to receive the messages. But Id rather advertise in a more traditional place, where people drive by billboards or see it on the Internet, Mr. Strauss said. On a mobile phone, its on my ear, not in front of my eyes. Mr. Strauss said the iPhone could change that because of how well the devices screen displays Internet pages. All bets are off in terms of what behaviors the iPhone might create, he said. Its something well watch very closely. Whether it is from e-commerce companies or traditional marketers, consumers should expect more ads on their cellphones in the coming year, industry executives said. Membership in the Mobile Marketing Association, an industry trade group, has nearly doubled in the past year, to about 500 companies. And businesses like Third Screen and others have helped build the business infrastructure necessary to help marketers, publishers and cellphone carriers negotiate and mount advertising campaigns. This is going to ramp up much faster than the Internet did, said Mr. Sterling, of Sterling Market Intelligence. It took 10 years and the proliferation of broadband for marketers to do things online that were predicted early on. This will take half the time or less. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/16/business/media/16crow.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">For Sheryl Crow, a Broad Menu of Product Endorsements<date>Published: July 16, 2007</date><text>Between her busy touring schedule and the newborn son she adopted in May  not to mention her work battling global warming, among other things  the musician Sheryl Crow still manages to fit in a good deal of reading, if her product endorsements are to be believed. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image The singer Sheryl Crow embraces a copy of Self magazine in an endorsement. She has also appeared in ads for The Wall Street Journal, American Express and Revlon. Since February, Ms. Crow has appeared in advertisements for The Wall Street Journal, a juxtaposition that seemed somewhat dissonant given the singers trademark song lyrics (like all I want to do is have some fun and gonna tell everyone to lighten up). More recently  and, perhaps, believably  Ms. Crow appeared in a spot for Self magazine, published by Condé Nast. The new ad, which started appearing in trade publications like Advertising Age and Automotive News last month, describes Ms. Crow as a Singer, survivor, reader, and shows her sitting in a garden, her legs crossed yoga-style and her arms wrapped around a copy of Self. Ms. Crow was selected because she is representative of the magazines editorial direction, Richard D. Beckman, president of the Condé Nast Media Group and chief marketing officer of Condé Nast, wrote in an e-mail message. While The Journals ads are meant to attract new readers, Mr. Beckman made the distinction that the Condé Nast ads are aimed more at potential advertisers. While Ms. Crow may have grown up reading her grandmothers subscription copies of The Wall Street Journal, according to Dow Jones, there is reason to believe that she occasionally manages to skim Self as well: she appeared on the cover of the magazines March 2007 issue and attended an climate change fund-raiser that Self sponsored in December. Ms. Crow already fills much of her time with commercial endorsements. She currently appears in a commercial directed by Martin Scorsese for American Express, as well as a Revlon campaign that began during this years Super Bowl broadcast and followed her  and her hair color  on tour. Last year, she showed up with a milk moustache as part of the Got Milk? campaign. (A representative for Ms. Crow said she was on vacation and unavailable for comment.) While there seems to be little danger of confusion between credit cards and hair dye, Ms. Crows presence in simultaneous campaigns for two print properties is unusual. Robert Christie, a spokesman for Dow Jones, did not seem bothered. Its two very different sets of readers, he said, adding that Ms. Crows presence in the papers campaign had helped to really show readers that its not just 50-year-old white men that read The Journal. In our world, shes so unique, he said.

The change is embodied by a rhetorical question, “Are you a cardmember?”  Amex-speak for “cardholder”  which is answered with demonstrations of what American Express believes are the benefits of its charge cards. It is unusual for American Express to switch campaign themes so quickly. For instance, according to a chronology provided by the company, “Do you know me?” ran from 1974 to 1987; “Membership has its privileges” appeared from 1987 to 1996, with a brief interruption; and “Do more” ran from 1996 to 2004. The new inquisitive theme will be the centerpiece of a multimedia campaign with a budget estimated at $400 million to $500 million. The creator is the longtime American Express agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. The strategy is to convince consumers that there are meaningful advantages to carrying the green, gold, platinum and other colorful charge cards  even if it means paying fees not assessed for the rival credit cards like Capital One, Discover, MasterCard and Visa. The new campaign offers “more of a call to action,” said John Hayes, chief marketing officer at the American Express Company in New York. For example, the first television commercial shows the snowboarder Shaun White going online again and again to book flights at the last minute, using the points he has accrued with his American Express card. The reason for his frenetic travel is a skein of snowstorms that he follows from Utah to Canada to Japan to Norway. “Pay with points on any airline,” the spot declares. “Just click and fly.” Mr. White will also be featured on the American Express Web site (americanexpress.com). “I need to be able to travel where I want, when I want,” he will proclaim there. The specificity is in sharp contrast to the ethereal tenor of the “My life” campaign. Those ads featured celebrities like Robert De Niro, Ellen DeGeneres, the director M. Night Shyamalan and the surfer Laird Hamilton discussing their philosophies of living; Ms. DeGeneres also performed humorous skits with animals. The “My life” campaign “really wasn’t working,” said Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys, a research company in New York that studies brand and customer loyalty. In 1997, the American Express brand was first in the category of charge and credit cards in the Brand Keys customer loyalty index, Mr. Passikoff said, but fell in the 2007 survey to fifth, trailing (in order) Discover, Capital One, Visa and MasterCard. American Express “still has brand resonance,” Mr. Passikoff said, “but it has not been engaging consumer loyalty.” “Entertainment is not the same as engagement,” he added. “People looked at the Ellen DeGeneres commercials and said, ‘This is the funniest thing, so clever.’ And then they pulled out their Visa card.” Needless to say, executives at American Express take issue with that analysis. They provided data showing that the number of consumer cards in force last year, both in the United States and worldwide, increased from 2005, as did spending. “We do believe this brand is defined by the people who use and carry the card,” said Diego Scotti, global head of marketing at American Express, and the “My life” campaign “worked well in getting people to say, ‘I want to be part of this group,’ ” referring to the celebrities. “Now, we want to go into more depth about what you get out of membership,” Mr. Scotti said. “What has changed is the stories they tell will be connected to product, in an authentic way.” Mr. Hayes said that the “My life” campaign “has done a great job redefining the notion of membership” as well as reminding consumers that “American Express is a company, not just about transactions, but about relationships.” “We want now to include more and more prospects,” Mr. Hayes said, referring to potential cardholders, “and take ‘My life. My card’ to a broader audience.” That makes sense because credit card issuers, particularly MasterCard and Visa, are stepping up offers of rewards and perquisites. For example, a campaign for the Visa Signature credit card, aimed at upper-income consumers, promises it “takes you places regular rewards cards can’t, like a finish-line suite at Churchill Downs.” The arms race over rewards is intensifying because “high spenders are very profitable” for issuers of credit and charge cards, said Scott Henry, engagement manager at Fischer Jordan in New York, a consulting company. “We’re seeing rewards programs as the primary differentiator between issuers,” Mr. Henry said, which means that if “Visa is chasing after the more premium market, they have to add more perks like American Express has”  or vice versa. For some time, the marketing battle was centered on what Mr. Henry called “the earn rates and burn rates,” that is, how easy (or hard) it is to earn rewards and how easy (or hard) it is to redeem them. More recently, “experiential rewards are definitely something that are differentiating the rewards programs,” he added, referring to less-tangible perks like being taken backstage at a concert to meet the band or being assured of great seats for a hit Broadway show. The last time American Express replaced an ad theme so quickly was 15 years ago, in a change omitted from the chronology provided by the company. In November 1991, American Express replaced Ogilvy with a New York agency known as Chiat/Day/Mojo and dropped “Membership has its privileges” in favor of a theme that sounded as if James Bond had written it: “The card. The American Express card.” Eleven months later, Chiat/Day/Mojo was dismissed, the account was returned to Ogilvy and “Membership has its privileges” resumed its run.

Average one-way international fares continued a four-year climb, to $1,707, and average international daily hotel rates rose for the fifth consecutive year, to $230. Average daily car rental rates crept up again, to $69. Corporate pressure on business travelers to comply with booking policies held down the rate of increases, said Mike Streit, vice president of American Express Business Travel Advisory Services. The average air fare rates were calculated from hundreds of domestic and international routes negotiated for corporate clients by American Express, from discount coach to first class. The average rate for car rentals includes fuel, taxes and other charges. Among domestic hotels, average nightly rates rose most sharply in the cheapest niche, the budget category, to $179 in the fourth quarter of 2006 from $150 in the comparable 2005 quarter. PREMIUM TRAFFIC DEMAND GROWS Worldwide first-class and business-class traffic continues to grow and was up 7.5 percent in January over January 2006, according to the International Air Transport Association. Europe-Asia traffic was up 13.4 percent, North Pacific traffic was up 9.1 percent and trans-Atlantic traffic rose 6.9 percent. SLUMP IN VISITORS FROM OVERSEAS Travel to the United States by overseas leisure and business travelers has declined 17 percent over all since 2001, says the Discover America Partnership, citing Commerce Department figures. The reason is a continuing negative perception of the immigration and customs entry process, said Geoff Freeman, executive director of the group, which represents leaders in the travel industry and other businesses. While visitors to the United States over all nearly returned to pre-9/11 levels in 2006, the increase was accounted for by increased visits from Canada and Mexico. In six of the top eight overseas markets, the number of travelers coming to America remained below pre-9/11 levels, the group said. REGISTERED TRAVELER TIERS? Jacksonville International Airport in Florida says it is working with Vigilant Solutions to create a new version of the Registered Traveler program. Rather than merely offering expedited passage through security, Jacksonville’s program would sell memberships at three levels: Silver ($149), offering access to the expedited security lane; Gold, adding automated billing for parking and a preferred parking-lane exit ($249); and Platinum ($349), adding access to a lounge and business center the airport says it hopes to open this year. The Registered Traveler program is operated only by Verified Identity Pass Inc., which has been opening lanes under its Clear brand at airports nationally, charging $99.95 a year. Vigilant Security, one of several potential rivals, has not yet received federal certification to operate a Registered Traveler program. FREQUENT-FLIER INNOVATION Qatar Airways won first place for the most innovative frequent-flier program in an annual survey sponsored by Airline Information, a consulting company. Qatar was cited for self-service kiosks that quickly enroll members in its Privilege Club program and print membership cards. NEW MIDWEST NONSTOP Midwest Airlines is adding a daily nonstop flight using 50-seat regional jets between Milwaukee and Raleigh/Durham, N.C., starting June 1. Raleigh/Durham, a governmental, high-technology and higher-education hub, is “an important center for business travelers,” said Scott R. Dickson, Midwest’s marketing chief. The service, on Midwest Connect, will be the only nonstop on that route.

A computer technical support consultant in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Davidson had earned gold status with US Airways frequent flier program, a level that provided perks like frequent upgrades to first class. There is something magical about being able to fly around the country, she said, especially when one can enjoy shorter lines and a more comfortable flight than most other fliers. But the magic may be gone. Earlier this year, as she prepared to resume her work several months after her daughter was born, she learned that her travel hiatus had a come with a cost: her elite status with the airline had expired. My first thought is the lines, she said, imagining life as a newly demoted flier. I really grew to loathe the crowds at the airport, and the elite check-in counters and security lanes are just about the only way to bypass them. Airlines like to dole out benefits, like wider seats and access to first-class airport lounges, to their repeat customers as a way to reward loyalty and bestow exclusive status. But fliers have to renew their status every year. If they fail to keep pace, their privileges will disappear  even if the lull is temporary. Such situations are on the rise, said Randy Petersen, who tracks loyalty programs on his Web site, webflyer.com. He estimated that tens of thousands of very frequent fliers each year must take a break from their schedules to attend to their own health or family concerns like caring for an ailing parent. Although the program rules are usually clearly spelled out, travelers who have spent years cementing their loyalty to a particular company may find it galling to be told, in effect, that their past patronage is worthless. It can certainly seem like a lack of sensitivity on the airlines part, said Hal Brierley, president of Brierley &amp; Partners, a loyalty-plan consulting firm based in Dallas. Losing the special treatment may make you, subconsciously at least, want to travel on that company less. The airlines say they are just sticking to longstanding policy, which limits special treatment to those who earn their miles the old-fashioned way: by flying within a specified period of time. Kent Landers, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said that if the airline granted too many exceptions to the rules it might create resentment. Our customers have told us that they work hard for their status and that they want to be fairly recognized, he said. But that has not stopped some fliers from trying to appeal their expulsion from the road warrior elite. Ron Hackler of northern Florida, for example, thought he had a compelling reason for his brief respite from flying: in the last half of 2006 he was posted to Iraq on assignment for his job with a military contractor. His gold status with Deltas Sky Miles program was demoted to silver  a change that means a lower priority for upgrades. Back from Iraq, he sent Delta a request for reinstatement of his previous status, along with documentation of his work in Iraq. The airline eventually responded by restoring his status to gold  and Mr. Hackler said he expected to reach platinum this year because of more international travel. It makes a big difference when you are doing these kinds of trips, he said. (Mr. Landers of Delta said the airline tried to work with fliers who had lost their status because of military work.) A loss of V.I.P. status may seem a minor setback, but the consequences can be felt in many ways. Several fliers pointed out that shorter security lines and roomier seats in first class could provide a significant boost in productivity. Mr. Brierley, who has worked on several loyalty programs for airline clients, said a leave of absence plan allowing fliers to opt out for a year might be a good idea. United allows travelers to apply to regain lost premium status through a fast-track program, which costs $299 and requires that they fly 6,250 miles within 90 days of resuming membership. For those who are not sure they will make the cut, United offers one-year access for $299 to seats in its Economy Plus rows, a perk automatically extended to elite members. Mr. Brierley said that what airlines really cared about was ensuring that fliers would not bolt to the competition. Keep in mind that the point of these annual renewal requirements is to create an opportunity cost for being disloyal, he said. For one flier, however, loyalty went further than the airline. H. Scott Matthews, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said he lost his top status with US Airways, a level the airline calls chairmans preferred, when he took time off to care for his father, who passed away last year. Mr. Matthews said he wrote to the airline to explain why his travel had paused and noted that his father had worked for US Airways for 43 years. The airline ultimately agreed to give him gold-level perks, two notches below the top. I have mixed feelings about their response, but I guess its better than nothing, he said. In such situations, some travelers employ the negotiating skills that got them ahead in their careers. Gary Dollinger, president of an Illinois technology consultancy, said that he had been dropped from the platinum club at Northwest Airlines when he cut back temporarily on flying to open his new business. He pleaded his case to an executive with the airlines WorldPerks program, and was granted a partial reprieve in the form of silver status. But he persisted and worked out an arrangement that would let him regain his perks if he proved his road warrior mettle, a challenge he took seriously: he booked himself a globe-trotting trip, and after 34,000 miles and 15 stops at airports from Amsterdam to Vancouver, he was back in full standing. It was actually a lot of fun, he said. But for many fliers, the outcome is not so positive. For Paul Quick, a doctor in San Francisco, the final blow came when he lost his premier status on United after the airline canceled what would have been his last two qualifying flights for the year, because of a snowstorm that shut down the carriers Denver hub. Protests went unheeded, he said, adding: I am switching to another airline. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/business/25citi.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Citigroup Expected to Name a New Financial Chief<date>Published: February 25, 2007</date><text>Citigroup, one of the worlds largest banks, is expected to name Gary L. Crittenden as its new chief financial officer in a move that aims to appease frustrated investors and end weeks of top management turmoil. Mr. Crittenden, a 53-year-old executive who has been American Express financial chief for the last six years, could be named shortly, according to two people briefed on the search. He will replace Sallie L. Krawcheck, who was in that job for the past two years but was moved out in a recent management shuffle. Mr. Crittenden, a strong financial operator at American Express, is seen as someone who can potentially win Wall Streets support for an ambitious integration strategy that Charles O. Prince III, Citigroups chairman and chief executive, has set in motion. So far, it has yielded few results. With a team of young and unproven managers at Citigroup, Mr. Crittenden now becomes the leading candidate to replace Mr. Prince at the helm of the global bank. For Mr. Prince, the selection of a new chief financial officer is a pivotal one. If it jumpstarts progress, Mr. Prince may be able to reverse the companys severe underperformance and turn the barrage of public criticism against him into a wave of support. If it does not, he could find himself quickly out of a job. Mr. Prince is under pressure from investors to improve the companys sluggish stock price at a time when many of its rivals, especially in investment banking, have reported banner years. Citigroups rising expenses have drawn serious concerns, and its revenues have slowed along with the rest of the American consumer economy. Investors have been critical of how Mr. Prince has executed his strategy, and Mr. Crittenden, a longtime chief financial officer, can draw on his experiences at several companies, in addition to American Express. At American Express, Mr. Crittenden was responsible for overseeing the books of a global financial services company with a market capitalization of $70 billion. While best known for its credit cards, American Express is a major player in corporate travel and international banking services. As chief financial officer, Mr. Crittenden helped orchestrate a strategy built on internal growth, not acquisitions, and oversaw the 2005 spin-off of Ameriprise Financial, its financial advisory unit. Now he will have even bigger challenges at Citigroup, which is pursuing a similar internal growth strategy on a larger scale. With a $264 billion market value, the bank operates in more than 100 countries, with businesses ranging from investment and retail banking to mortgages and credit cards. Mr. Crittenden has likened the chief financial position to that of an air traffic controller. But he has also served in a number of jobs in the retail industry, where he oversaw strategy and operations. He has also led several corporate restructuring efforts. A graduate of Brigham Young University and a Harvard M.B.A., Mr. Crittenden began his career as a Bain &amp; Company management consultant. In 1990, he left to join Filenes Basement, a Boston-based retailer, as a senior executive, overseeing its operations. Six years later, he moved to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, eventually becoming its finance chief. At Monsanto, he served in a similar job. In 2000, he joined American Express. At Citigroup, Mr. Prince has made several recent changes to his management team. In a shakeup in January, he ousted Todd S. Thomson, 45, the head of Citigroups global wealth management group, in part for flying Maria Bartiromo, the CNBC anchor, on the corporate jet, one of several times he allegedly abused his executive privileges. Ms. Krawcheck, 42, was moved into that slot in the wake of mounting criticism from Wall Street and reports that she was unhappy in the chief financial job. In December, Robert A. Druskin was named the companys chief operating officer, to oversee the banks far-flung financial operations. With the company under fire from investors, Mr. Druskin is also leading a campaign to rein in expenses. Mr. Prince publicly announced that Citigroup had begun the search for a chief financial officer in mid-January and hired Prince Goldsmith, a boutique executive search firm specializing in the financial services industry, to conduct the search. At the end of January, Mr. Prince vowed to name a successor in 45 days. A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment; Mr. Crittenden could not be reached.

The company reported a profit of $922 million, or 75 cents a share, for the quarter, compared with $745 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 13 percent, to $7.21 billion from $6.38 billion. The quarterly results cap a transformative year for American Express, which in 2005 spun off its Ameriprise Financial unit to focus on its card and travel businesses. The chairman and chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, has focused this year on striking deals with banks to issue American Express cards, and on capturing more business from high-spending consumers. The results follow the same growth seen at American Express’s biggest rivals. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, Citigroup, the Capital One Financial Corporation, and Morgan Stanley all reported their card divisions had stronger profit during the fourth quarter. Part of this was a result of new bankruptcy laws that make it harder for consumers to avoid paying debt. The company, which typically has a lower instance of defaults because its customers tend to be more affluent, set aside $277 million for losses from its credit-card unit, a 4 percent decline from a year earlier. This helped drive profit significantly higher than the year-ago period. The year-ago results included American Express’s banking business in Brazil, which it sold in the second quarter. Excluding that business and other discontinued operations, the company reported fourth-quarter profit rose to $925 million, or 76 cents a share, from $751 million, or 60 cents a share. This matched Wall Street projections for earnings of 76 cents a share, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. The company, however, missed analysts’ expectations for revenue of $7.33 billion. American Express said it added 1.5 million cards during the latest quarter. Profit at its core card business rose 29 percent to $535 million in the fourth quarter. However, international card services dipped 1 percent to $231 million.

Neither was the man with the beat-up crossword puzzle book a few spots behind her in line. Individually, they grilled the smiling, uniformed women at the desk in front of them. ''What's in there?'' they asked. ''Who's allowed?'' No one expects a respite from the madness at the Mall at Short Hills in December, least of all harried mothers and aimless husbands. But one exists, as the skeptics who represented both breeds of mallgoers found recently. The American Express Members Lounge, a 3,400-square-foot habitat for the exhausted, the thirsty and the computer-addicted, is best thought of as an extension of the private airport lounge. For now, Short Hills is the only place shoppers can experience it: opened Nov. 17 and closing Jan. 14, it is the credit card company's first foray into customer-coddling outside of trade shows. ''This is a test, our way of demonstrating why it's important to keep that card in your wallet,'' said Ralph Andretta, senior vice president and general manager of membership rewards for American Express. Appointed with leather sofas, linen-wrapped lamps, coffee machines, snack baskets and stacks of magazines, the 100-seat lounge has the feel of a sophisticated hotel lobby. Once admitted via the swipe of a card or the filling out of an application, members or would-be members discover a former stationery store that has been renovated with an eye toward Zen-like serenity and service. The perks include a station for charging cellphones and iPods; a bank of four iMac computers; a coat check; and a clean, spacious private bathroom. But according to Adam Gerbman, the manager, the feature most appreciated, at least by some visitors, is a counter in a walled-off back room. ''Guys really like the gift wrapping,'' he said. The limit is two items -- complimentary, as with all the lounge's services -- but shoppers have been known to get creative. ''We've had guys come in with Toys 'R' Us bags, Lord &amp; Taylor bags, and those stores aren't even in the mall. They'll also come in more than once a day.'' Mall employees like Myles Goldberg of West Orange, who plays the piano at Nordstrom and was one of 2,400 to stop in on a recent Saturday, are repeat visitors. ''It's very gracious,'' he said, crumpling a cookie wrapper before heading back to work. ''I'm impressed with it, and I've sent a lot of people here. But I don't see how they can continue with it. It's got to be a tremendous expense.'' A company spokeswoman would not disclose the cost of operating the lounge. If the lounge reopens after mid-January, something Mr. Andretta said American Express was considering, keeping card-wielding shoppers in the mall longer could offset the cost. ''I love it -- I wish they'd make it a permanent thing,'' said Robert Leon of Basking Ridge, who sat briefly with a Yorkshire terrier under his arm while his wife and toddler son helped themselves to graham crackers and a Brioni coffee. ''If they keep it, I'll do more shopping. It takes the edge off.''

New statistics from the Bureau of Transportation show that 19.64 percent of flights departed late this year through the end of September. That’s the worst record in memory, and the only figure even close to it was registered in 2000, when 19.24 percent departed late in the first nine months. And according to the latest Air Travel Consumer Report by the Transportation Department, domestic airlines lost or mishandled 8.08 bags per 1,000 passengers in August, compared with 6.4 per 1,000 passengers in August of last year. EUROPEAN UPTICK Travel to Europe picked up again in September after slowing in August because of disruptions after the police in London announced that they had uncovered a terrorist bomb plot. Air travel by United States citizens to Europe was up 3.1 percent in September from September 2005. In August, typically a heavier travel month, air travel to Europe was up only 1.7 compared with the previous August, according to the Donald N. Martin Company. In all, air travel by United States citizens to Europe was up 4.6 percent, to 8.9 million passengers, through the end of August, according to Commerce Department data. Martin also said a record 12.13 million passports were issued in the 2006 fiscal year ended Sept. 30. A big reason for the robust demand is that as of Jan. 8, United States citizens returning from trips to Canada, Mexico and 27 Caribbean nations will be required for the first time to present a passport at customs. EOS PLANS EXPANSION Eos Airlines said it acquired institutional financing to allow it to expand its fleet of 757 aircraft and add routes next year. Eos began operating late last year between Kennedy International Airport and Stansted Airport in London. The 757s feature only 48 business-class seats and the fares are significantly lower than the business-class fares on most other airlines on that route. New routes being considered by Eos are to Paris and Zurich, as well as potential new city pairs for service to and from London. ET CETERA The Air Transport Association estimates that two million passengers a day will travel over the 12-day Thanksgiving holiday period, up 3 percent over that period last year ... You can continue to get free Wi-Fi service at Continental’s Presidents Club at Logan Airport in Boston. Logan, which offers its own Wi-Fi service throughout the airport, had contended that Continental’s free service violated a lease provision, but the Federal Communications Commission last week ruled in Continental’s favor ... Corporations in China spent $7.41 billion on air travel in 2005, American Express Business Travel says. China is now the fourth-largest business-travel market in the world, American Express said. (By comparison, corporations in the United States spent about $40.29 billion on air travel in 2005.)

As airlines fill more seats and raise fares and hotels in business centers continue raising already high rates, companies are being advised by American Express Business Travel to tighten travel policies. That means less flexibility in choice for business travelers, as corporate managers emphasize channeling spending to the volume discount deals negotiated with airlines and hotel chains. Compliance to policy and tighter controls are necessary, said Mike Streit, a vice president at the American Express subsidiary. Published domestic coach air fares are expected to rise 3 to 5 percent next year, American Express said. Domestic hotel rates will rise about 3 to 6 percent for midrange rooms and 4 to 8 percent for upper-range accommodations, but watch out for big cities. Average room rates in New York, which are already at record highs, could go up as much as 18 percent because of surging demand and sluggish growth in supply. GET SOME SLEEP Companies mistakenly glorify the idea of the intrepid business traveler who lives out of a suitcase in multiple time zones, according to Charles A. Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, in an interview in the October edition of The Harvard Business Review called Sleep Deficit: The Performance Killer. Rather than celebrating exhaustion, Dr. Czeisler recommends that companies institute more sensible policies to encourage employees to get enough sleep. A companys sleep policy should not permit anyone, under any circumstance, to take an overnight flight and then drive to a business meeting somewhere, he said. NEVER MIND A deluge of small fare increases on thousands of routes ended over the weekend with most airlines retreating. On Thursday, according to the air fare consultant Terry Trippler, United Airlines increased more than 35,000 domestic fares, followed by American, Delta, Continental and Northwest. But late Saturday afternoon, literally one minute after Northwest matched the higher fares, United withdrew all its fare increases. The others retreated on Sunday. Was it because US Airways didnt go along? Mr. Trippler asked. Was it by the time Northwest decided to match, United had already decided to rescind? Whatever the reason, it failed. ET CETERA US Airways said it was hiring 200 baggage handlers and 60 supervisors to try to fix its poor baggage service at Philadelphia International Airport.

Skip to next paragraph Related RFID Payment Card Vulnerabilities Technical Report (pdf) Dima Gavrysh/Associated Press Tom Heydt-Benjamin tapped an envelope against a black plastic box connected to his computer. Within moments, the screen showed a garbled string of characters that included this: fu/kevine, along with some numbers. Mr. Heydt-Benjamin then ripped open the envelope. Inside was a credit card, fresh from the issuing bank. The card bore the name of Kevin E. Fu, a computer science professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who was standing nearby. The card number and expiration date matched those numbers on the screen. The demonstration revealed potential security and privacy holes in a new generation of credit cards  cards whose data is relayed by radio waves without need of a signature or physical swiping through a machine. Tens of millions of the cards have been issued, and equipment for their use is showing up at a growing number of locations, including CVS pharmacies, McDonalds restaurants and many movie theaters. The card companies have implied through their marketing that the data is encrypted to make sure that a digital eavesdropper cannot get any intelligible information. American Express has said its cards incorporate 128-bit encryption, and J. P. Morgan Chase has said that its cards, which it calls Blink, use the highest level of encryption allowed by the U.S. government. But in tests on 20 cards from Visa, MasterCard and American Express, the researchers here found that the cardholders name and other data was being transmitted without encryption and in plain text. They could skim and store the information from a card with a device the size of a couple of paperback books, which they cobbled together from readily available computer and radio components for $150. They say they could probably make another one even smaller and cheaper: about the size of a pack of gum for less than $50. And because the cards can be read even through a wallet or an item of clothing, the security of the information, the researchers say, is startlingly weak. Would you be comfortable wearing your name, your credit card number and your card expiration date on your T-shirt? Mr. Heydt-Benjamin, a graduate student, asked. Companies that make and issue the cards argue that what looks shocking in the lab could not lead to widespread abuse in the real world, and that additional data protection and antifraud measures in the payment system protect consumers from end to end. This is an interesting technical exercise, said Brian Triplett, senior vice president for emerging-product development for Visa, but as a real threat to a consumer  that threat really doesnt exist. The finding comes at a time of strong suspicion among privacy advocates and consumer groups about the security of the underlying technology, called radio frequency identification, or RFID. Though the systems are designed to allow a card to be read only in close proximity, researchers have found that they can extend the distance. The actual distance is still a matter of debate, but the claims range from several inches to many feet. And even the shortest distance could allow a would-be card skimmer to mill about in a crowded place and pull data from the wallets of passersby, or to collect data from envelopes sitting in mailboxes. No ones going to look at me funny if I walk down the street and put a flier in everybodys mailbox, Mr. Heydt-Benjamin said. The experiment was conducted by researchers here working with RSA Labs, a part of EMC, an information management and storage company. The resulting paper, which has been submitted to a computer security conference, is the first fruit of a new consortium of industry and academic researchers financed by the National Science Foundation to study RFID. Security experts who were not involved in the research have praised the paper, and said that they were startled by the findings. Aviel D. Rubin, a professor of computer security at Johns Hopkins University, said, There is a certain amount of privacy that consumers expect, and I believe that credit card companies have crossed the line. The companies, however, argue that testing just 20 cards does not provide an accurate picture of the card market, which generally uses higher security standards than the cards that were tested. Its a small sample, said Art Kranzley, an executive with MasterCard. This is almost akin to somebody standing up in the theater and yelling, Fire! because somebody lit a cigarette. Chips like those used by the credit card companies can encrypt the data they send, but that can slow down transactions and make building and maintaining the payment networks more expensive. Other systems, including the Speedpass keychain device offered by Exxon Mobil, encrypt the transmission  though Exxon came under fire for using encryption that experts said was weak. Though information on the cards may be transmitted in plain text, the company representatives argued, the process of making purchases with the cards involves verification procedures based on powerful encryption that make each transaction unique. Most cards, they said, actually transmit a dummy number that does not match the number embossed on the card, and that number can be used only in connection with the verification token, or a small bit of code, that is encrypted before being sent. Its basically useless information, said David Bonalle, vice president and general manager for advanced payments at American Express. You cant steal that data and just play it back and expect that transaction to work. While the researchers found that these claims were true for some of the cards they tested, other cards gave up the actual credit card number and did not use a token or change data from one transaction to another. They also took data in from some cards and transmitted it to a card-reader in the lab and tricked it into accepting the transaction. Mr. Heydt-Benjamin, in fact, was able to purchase electronic equipment online using a number skimmed from a card he ordered for himself and which was sealed in an envelope. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/business/10memo.html?ref=americanexpresscompany">Memo Pad<date>Published: October 10, 2006</date><text>AIRLINES REACT TO A380 DELAYS Airlines that have ordered the long-overdue Airbus A380 superjumbo jet are complaining that the latest delivery delays, confirmed recently by Airbus, are causing major problems with plans to add long-haul capacity in markets with surging demand. Among them is Singapore Airlines, which is expected to be the first carrier to fly the A380. We were supposed to inaugurate the A380 into service in June, so were already experiencing lower capacity growth, said James Boyd, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines, which planned to put its first A380 into service in December after the earlier delays. Airlines have been told that the A380, already long overdue, could be delayed as much as a year more because of in-cabin wiring and other assembly problems. To augment its long-haul capacity, Singapore, which has ordered 10 A380s, expects to take delivery of six long-range Boeing 777-300ER aircraft by the end of this year. Singapore is also preparing to announce upgrades in its first- and business-class cabins next month. Airbus has 159 orders for the A380, which can be configured to hold 450 to 853 passengers. The top A380 customer is Emirates, which had originally expected to begin using the first of the 45 A380s next month and now says its plans for the A380 are up in the air. Emirates is said to be considering seeking compensation from Airbus for the continuing delays. GROWTH IN TRANS-ATLANTIC FLIGHTS Airlines around the world scheduled more than 25,000 flights in September between North America and Western Europe, according to OAG, the airline flight-schedule guide. Thats 1,400 more flights than in October 2005. Some domestic airlines have been reducing capacity on domestic flights to add seats on the lucrative trans-Atlantic routes.

Buy a Cellphone<date>Published: October 4, 2006</date><text>Correction Appended Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Products from Converse, Gap, Motorola and Armani will be sold under the Red brand. Promoters want the companies to make money. A NEW line of products from companies like Gap, Armani Exchange and Motorola aims to raise money to help fight AIDS in Africa. Those companies, along with Converse and American Express, created the new products, which bear the brand name Red and are to begin appearing in stores this month. The companies are committed to selling the products for at least five years, and plan to donate part of their profits to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. If the Red products sell the way the companies other products do, the fund stands to gain hundreds of millions of dollars annually  enough to provide AIDS medications to hundreds of thousands of Africans each year. The campaign was created by the musician Bono and Bobby Shriver, a California politician and member of the Kennedy family. Both are leading advocates for the Global Fund. The fund, which will collect and distribute money from Red in Africa, says the hundreds of millions of dollars each year given by world governments is not enough to provide medications to all of the people who need them. The retailers who have partnered with Red are not the first to participate in cause-related marketing. Companies paid $1.11 billion last year to charities that lent the use of their names to sell products, according to IEG Inc., a sponsorship consultant firm. But the Red marketing plan has the potential to create a profitable fund-raising model for the retail industry, which in the past has sold mainly trinkets that helped burnish the company image rather than increase the bottom line.Red is one of the first major efforts to tap more Americans to contribute to fighting AIDS a continent away. And they can do so simply, just by switching their cellphone or buying some of the clothing thats part of the Red line, Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman who has made fighting AIDS a center of his own philanthropy, said in an e-mail message. Mr. Gates said he was at first skeptical that the group would be able to persuade large retailers to participate. I wasnt sure they would get enough companies on board to make Red a viable entity, and whether it could generate enough revenue for the global fund to make it worthwhile, he said. I was pleasantly surprised on both counts. The Red retailers are embracing a brand that is not their own, a move retailers are usually loath to do, and Red products will sit at the heart of the companies collections rather than in small baskets on check-out counters. The Global Fund and Red say they intend for the retailers to pocket a profit on Red products. Gap in the beginning couldnt understand how they were going to make money, Mr. Shriver said. They wanted to do a T-shirt and give us all the money. But, we want them to make money. We dont want anyone to be thinking, Im not making money on this thing, because then we failed. We want people buying houses in the Hamptons based on this because, if that happens, this thing is sustainable. Red products have been in stores in Britain since February, and the share of profits that has gone to the fund passed the $10 million mark last month, said Richard Feachem, the executive director of the Global Fund. That is twice what the fund received from companies and individuals from 2002 to 2006, he said. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been the largest nongovernmental donor to the fund, pledging $650 million. I could go with my begging bowl every year to a major corporation and say give me some money, and they might give me a one-off contribution, but it wouldnt be large and it wouldnt be sustainable, Dr. Feachem said. Red is intrinsically sustainable because Red is good for the companies. With the $10 million it has earned so far from Red, the fund is financing testing and treatment of HIV-positive women and children in Rwanda and is taking care of orphans in Swaziland whose parents died of AIDS, Dr. Feachem said. HIV infection has exploded in developing countries in the past decade. The fund plans to dedicate money from Red solely to help people in Africa, which has the worlds highest percentage of HIV-positive adults, according to Dr. Feachem. But there are also substantial AIDS problems in other countries like China and India, which has the highest number of people infected with HIV, Dr. Feachem added. The cost of AIDS medications has fallen in recent years in part because of negotiations with several pharmaceutical companies, led by former President Bill Clinton. Today, medical care for one person costs about $1,000 a year, and there are about five million people in Africa who need treatment, Dr. Feachem said. That puts the bill to treat them all at $5 billion a year. The fund has received $5.7 billion over the last four years, and an additional $4.3 billion, mostly from governments, has been promised. The United States contributes about $600 million a year. Income from Red will not close the budget gap, but its money will certainly help, said Tommy G. Thompson, the former secretary of health and human services and current honorary chairman of the Global Fund. The reason the private sectors got to be involved is theres just not enough money coming in from the government, Mr. Thompson said. This is a huge thing and the demand and the need is so great that we just dont have enough money coming in from the governments to do it. The retailers selling Red items have gone to great lengths to link the products to Africa. Gap has produced several of its Red items at its factory in Lesotho. American Express carries writing on its red-color card, now available only in Britain, that says: This card is designed to help eliminate AIDS in Africa. Motorola is manufacturing some of its Red phones in Nigeria. Converse, too, has incorporated African themes into its Red line. One of the companys shoes is made of Mali mud cloth, a traditional woven cotton fabric that is painted with dyes made of mud and bark, said David Maddocks, the chief marketing officer at Converse, which is owned by Nike. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: Oct. 5, 2006 Because of an editing error, the Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about companies donating money from a line of new products to help fight AIDS in Africa, misstated the cellphone that Motorola is offering as part of the promotion.

But they also said it was difficult to keep pace with those who seek to exploit children on the Web and called for broad collaboration among those in the financial services industry and law enforcement authorities around the world. Child pornography is a global problem in need of a coordinated response, said Mark MacCarthy, a senior vice president for public policy for Visa U.S.A. Mr. MacCarthy said that by working together with other financial services companies, the industry could enhance our efforts to identify Web sites and pinpoint merchants that are trafficking in this illicit activity, cut them off from use of our network and provide assistance to law enforcement to put them in jail and shut them down for good. The way forward lies in collective action, he said. Mr. MacCarthy and other executives testified at a hearing of the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The hearing was the sixth this year convened by the subcommittee to examine the growth of child pornography online. Others who spoke to the committee included Ernie Allen, the president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, who led an investigation that in 2004 dismantled an Internet child pornography service stretching from Eastern Europe to Mount Laurel, N.J. Mr. Allen described tactics adopted in recent months to combat child pornography Web sites, including the creation of the Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography, a group of major financial institutions and Internet companies. The coalition will seek to follow the money, Mr. Allen said, in an effort to eradicate such business by 2008. MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Bank of America, Citibank, PayPal, Yahoo and AOL, among others, have joined the coalition. We have changed our process for monitoring the Internet, said Arne L. Christenson, a senior vice president for federal government affairs at American Express. In the past our search for child pornography sites took place as part of our broader efforts to enforce our Internet pornography policy, and there was not always a clear differentiation between the two in our review and reporting. Among purveyors of child pornography, Mr. Christenson said, there is a growing trend toward steering visitors of these sites to various alternative payment methods. Mr. Christie said one of those methods involved granting access to Web sites in return for explicit photographs of children. That phenomenon is something that we are very concerned about, Mr. Christie said.
