Buffett, take note. It is not just a few wealthy individuals paying unusually low taxes to the federal government. Corporate America is not far behind.A comprehensive study released on Thursday found that 280 of the biggest publicly traded American companies faced federal income tax bills equal to 18.5 percent of their profits during the last three years — little more than half the official corporate rate of 35 percent and lower than their competitors in many industrialized countries. Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, has said that the tax code is unfair, allowing him to pay just 17 percent in federal taxes last year, about half the percentage his secretary paid. The corporate study, prepared by the left-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, examined the regulatory filings of the companies to compute each year’s current federal taxes. Some of the companies disputed the findings, saying that the study understated their tax payments by omitting deferred taxes that they may pay in future years. Using information from the companies’ own corporate filings, however, the study concluded that a quarter of the 280 corporations owed less than 10 percent of profits in federal income taxes and 30 companies had no federal tax liability for the entire three-year period. The report is being released as corporations are pushing for a cut in their official tax rate, saying the current system puts American companies at a disadvantage with competitors abroad and encourages them to shift jobs and investments overseas. The Congressional supercommittee charged with cutting the budget deficit is also considering proposals to revamp the tax system, simplifying the corporate structure and possibly lowering corporate rates. The study said that the shelters and loopholes in the current tax system rewarded companies that aggressively avoided taxes at the expense of those that did not. A quarter of the companies in the study had a federal tax bill of 35 percent of their profits, while a similar number had an effective rate of less than 10 percent. “Companies that are paying their fair share ought to demand that the tax-dodging companies pay their fair share too,” said Robert S. McIntyre, the author of study. “So should the public, which is subsidizing them in terms of increased federal debt.” The report is based on data gleaned from the companies’ regulatory filings, which can be different from their corporate tax returns. Even in a year when a company claims an overall tax benefit, it may pay some cash taxes while accumulating credits that can be redeemed in future years. But because most corporations do not release their tax returns, these corporate regulatory filings offer the best publicly available gauge of what companies pay and what strategies they use to reduce their tax bills. Among the companies that the study said escaped a liability for all three years were Boeing and Ryder System, whose chief financial officer, Art A. Garcia, said the company had benefited from the additional depreciation intended to stimulate the economy. Boeing officials said they, too, had paid  some federal taxes, but would not say how much. They said they had lowered their rate by taking advantage of tax breaks intended to encourage hiring. Chaz Bickers, a company spokesman, said Boeing hired 9,000 American workers this year Also on the list was General Electric, which has come under close scrutiny since The New York Times reported earlier this year that the company had recorded $5.1 billion in American profits in 2010, but claimed a federal income tax benefit of $3.2 billion in its regulatory filing. “The report is inaccurate and distorted,” said Kenneth Juarez, a G.E. spokesman. He said G.E. paid “billions of dollars in taxes in the United States over the last decade,” but would not say what part was federal income taxes. The company that recorded the biggest reduction in taxes was Wells Fargo Bank, which is a large holding of Mr. Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway. The banking company reported a total of $49 billion in profits in 2008 through 2010, yet received a tax benefit of $651 million. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said much of the tax savings came from write-offs obtained after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, which incurred big losses during the financial crisis. American corporations are paying a smaller share of taxes than in previous decades. They paid a total of $191 billion in federal income taxes in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service said, representing about 1.3 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. That is down from about 6 percent during the 1950s (although some of the decline is because a smaller percentage of businesses now file as corporations).   Despite the decline in corporate tax rates since then, business advocates say the nation needs to lower its top rate further to encourage hiring and investment. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the United States system was not competitive because it taxed income earned around the world, instead of just in this country. “There are still Bolsheviks who recognize that we need to bring the rates down,” he said. But the Citizens for Tax Justice study found that two-thirds of  the American companies with significant profits overseas actually paid more in taxes to foreign governments than they did in the United States. Rather than lowering the corporate rate more, the study said, the federal government should end the subsidies and shelters that favor companies that game the system.  “Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and school — things that are really important for economic development here in the United States," the report said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 4, 2011 An article on Thursday about a report from the Citizens for Tax Justice on the relatively small federal income tax payments by many large American corporations misspelled, in some editions, the surname of a General Electric spokesman who disputed the studyâs findings about that company.

A new report from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research finds that only a little more than half of consumers who try to do so are successful. The other half meet with frustration and a quarter abandon the process, Javelin’s report says. The finding doesn’t bode well for banks, especially larger ones, that are facing a great deal of consumer backlash of late, especially over the growth in user fees. Most people apply for accounts online because they expect it to be faster and more convenient (and possibly cheaper, for online-only accounts) than doing it over the phone or visiting a branch, says Mark Schwanhausser, a senior financial services analyst with Javelin. (There may also be, Bucks suspects, a risk for smaller banks and credit unions hoping to win new accounts on the coming “Bank Transfer Day” on Nov. 5. If their online account-opening process isn’t smooth, some prospective new customers could give up in frustration.) As part of the research for the report, a team of Javelin “secret shoppers” tried out the online application process for various types of accounts at 10 major banks, as well as five other institutions including credit unions and online banks, and found convenience sorely lacking in some cases. Some banks boasting of online applications actually direct customers to download paper application forms for submission. At ING Direct and Wells Fargo, the report found, some online applications are restricted to existing customers. In the case of Wells Fargo, for instance, existing customers were allowed to apply online for a credit card, but newcomers were directed to apply at a branch. At Citibank, an application for a home-equity line of credit led to a “cycle of frustrating links” that forced the user to call a bank representative on the phone for help. (Citibank corrected the navigation problem shortly after the interaction, the report notes.) In another case, Bank of America seemed overly aggressive in following up on an online application. A Javelin researcher began an online application for a mortgage at Bank of America, providing contact information as an initial step, but abandoned the process before completion. Within a minute, a bank sales representative called on the telephone. While that might make sense from the bank’s perspective, Mr. Schwanhausser said, it could unnerve some applicants. “If you’re trying to be anonymous in shopping habits, it could be jarring or even somewhat creepy,” he said. Have you opened an account online recently? What was your experience?</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDE1E38F93BA25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks Start To Make More Loans<date>Published: October 18, 2011</date><text>Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot. Loan growth is still modest. And it remains heavily weighted toward the strongest corporate and consumer borrowers. But after several quarters of having their loan balances plunge or flatten out, several of the nation's biggest banks are reporting increases. On Monday, Citigroup officials said the bank recorded loan growth, compared with a year ago, in almost every one of its businesses during the third quarter, and in almost every corner of the globe. Wells Fargo executives said new loan commitments to small businesses were up 8 percent, while lending to bigger companies has been growing for 14 months in a row. Across the industry, analysts expect credit card loan balances will start increasing before the end of the year. ''The narrative that banks aren't lending is incorrect,'' Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said in an interview. ''Lending is strong, and based on what we're seeing,'' he added, it will ''continue to grow.'' Still, the stocks of both banks, and the sector as a whole, dropped on Monday as the sluggish economy and revenue figures pointed to broad drags on the banks, including low returns on making loans and exposure to the European debt crisis. But the new lending numbers suggest that while the economy remains extremely fragile, the confidence of consumers and businesses may be more resilient than many experts had believed. ''It hasn't really strengthened, but it looks like the recovery is still here,'' Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chairman and chief executive, said after heralding his bank's lending data last week. There are myriad explanations behind the uptick in loan growth, including more customers taking advantage of ultra-low interest rates and borrowers in need of cash drawing on their credit lines. Others believe the downbeat headlines in recent weeks have been overblown. If the confidence clouds hanging over Europe and the United States were removed, the lending figures would be even stronger, analysts and bankers say. Housing remains the banking industry's Achilles' heel. Mortgage and home equity loans have fallen more than 6.2 percent since their peak in late 2007 and early 2008, according to weekly data from the Federal Reserve. Most banks have ratcheted up the underwriting criteria so that fewer new borrowers qualify for a loan, especially in the housing markets along the coasts that were hit hard by the recession. As existing loans end, they are less likely to replace them with a new one. But there has been a modest increase in lending elsewhere. Over all, corporate lending has rebounded 7.2 percent after bottoming out in October 2010. Consumer lending, with the exception of housing-related loans, turned positive during the second quarter and has been gradually increasing since then, the data show. All told, total loan balances are near where they stood in mid-2007. ''The banks want to lend,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. After all, he said, more than 70 percent of their income is tied to that activity. And the Federal Reserve survey of loan officers shows that banks have been gradually relaxing their underwriting requirements. Others, however, say the banks are still clinging to their purse strings. For a broader recovery, they will need to make loans more available to more consumer borrowers with blemished credit histories and a broader array of small businesses, the critics say. ''I don't think the lending window is open near enough to what you need to see to get the economy growing, businesses expanding, and to bring the unemployment rate down,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, a forecasting firm. So far, the revival in lending has not been strong enough to significantly move the revenue needle for the nation's biggest banks, either. The poor performance of their Wall Street-related businesses and the elimination of once-lucrative overdraft and credit card penalty fees have weighed on their results. Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed's decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/wells-fargo-earnings-rise-21-to-4-1-billion/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Earnings Rise 21%, to $4.1 Billion<date>October 17, 2011, 8:09 am</date><text>Chris Keane/ReutersWorkers removed the last Wachovia sign outside a Wells Fargo bank center in Charlotte, N.C. 5:18 p.m. | Updated with closing stock price. Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest consumer lender, reported Monday that its third-quarter earnings rose 21 percent, even as a drop in revenue indicated a disappointing sign for the San Francisco-based bank. The bank turned a $4.1 billion profit in the third quarter, or 72 cents a share, bolstered by gains in its lending and deposit division and its lack of exposure to the volatile investment banking business. That compared with a profit of $3.3 billion, or 60 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The figures, also aided by an $800 million release in reserves amid easing loan losses, fell just below the analysts’ consensus estimate of 73 cents a share. The bottom line improvement was somewhat overshadowed by the lack of top-line growth. The bank’s revenue fell to $19.6 billion, from $20.9 billion, reflecting the banking industry’s broader struggles generating growth as the economic recovery stalls and the markets wildly fluctuate. Investors frowned on the report, sending the bank’s shares down more than 8 percent to close at $24.42, a loss of $2.25. “The economic recovery has been more sluggish and uneven than anyone anticipated,” the bank’s chairman and chief executive, John Stumpf, said in a statement. “We can’t change the economic environment, yet we have worked hard to control the variables we can – making our products and services more relevant to individuals and businesses, focusing on the customer, making as many loans as possible and growing new relationships – as well as fostering longtime ones.” The strong profit numbers at Wells Fargo bucked the generally grim outlook facing the industry, as big banks struggle to shed the legacy of the mortgage crisis and cope with poor investment banking figures. JPMorgan Chase last week kicked off bank earnings season by reporting a 4 percent drop in profit. Bank of America, which will announce its earnings on Tuesday, has racked up billions of dollars in losses over the last few quarters. And some analysts expect Goldman Sachs, once appearing immune from the industry’s woes, to report a quarterly loss, only the second since the company went public 12 years ago. While competitors have struggled, Wells Fargo has remained relatively healthy. Profit has grown quarter after quarter. Following the takeover of the Wachovia Corporation at the height of the financial crisis, it established a network of retail branches along both coasts. Still, Wells is not immune from the industry’s turmoil. The bank reported disappointing revenue numbers across its operation. The community banking division, which includes Wells Fargo’s branches and mortgage business, experienced a 7 percent drop in revenue, while revenue declined slightly in the bank’s retail brokerage unit. While it is no secret the banking industry is struggling, investment banking results have been especially hard hit. Trading revenue, in particular, is hurting from the unnerving volatility in the markets. Wells Fargo does not break out its investment banking results, but the wholesale banking unit, which includes the sales and trading business along with the corporate lending division, had a 4 percent decline in revenue. The bank attributed the drop to weak fixed-income sales and trading. But it could have been worse. Wells Fargo features a far smaller investment bank than most of its big rivals, so it is less exposed to the difficult market conditions that, for instance, caused JPMorgan’s third-quarter investment banking profit to tumble 20 percent. “Investment banking is a boom and bust business, and right now it’s bust,” said Brian Foran, a senior analyst at Nomura Securities International. He noted that it “helps” banks like Wells that are not deeply entrenched in the business. Wells Fargo’s biggest unit by far is its community-banking arm, which reported a 7 percent drop in revenue, as mortgage banking income slowed and the bank battled the choppy markets. But earnings at the unit leapt 20 percent compared with the third quarter of 2010. Unlike competitors that had a heavy hand in the mortgage business during the toxic subprime boom, Wells Fargo enforced tougher standards for borrowers and only revved up its lending following the 2008 takeover of Wachovia. Wells Fargo has since quietly emerged from the mortgage mess as one of the nation’s largest and strongest lenders. On Monday, the bank reported that its overall loan portfolio jumped to $760 billion, up $8.2 billion from the prior quarter. The bank’s deposits soared, too, up 8 percent from a year ago to nearly $837 billion. The bank also saw an improvement in credit quality, as nonperforming assets declined $7.6 billion from the prior year and net loan charge-offs dropped $1.5 billion. It also recorded the $800 million release in reserves, a nod to the improving loan portfolio. “There are winners and losers in the mortgage market right now,” Mr. Foran said. “Wells has won this equation.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/banks-start-to-make-more-loans/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks Start to Make More Loans<date>October 17, 2011, 9:58 pm</date><text>Despite all the bleak economic news, a funny thing has been happening in the financial industry over the last few months: the banks have quietly turned on the lending spigot.

Meanwhile, the rise in new loan volume has not been enough to offset the lower profit margins on new loans as a result of the Fed’s decision to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2013. On Monday, Citigroup reported that its core revenue fell 8 percent, even as it squeezed out a $3.8 billion profit with some favorable accounting. It booked a $1.9 billion paper gain since the cost of retiring its debt had, theoretically, declined because of concerns over its financial condition. It also delivered about $1.4 billion to its bottom line, using money it had previously set aside to cover credit card and other loan losses. Together, those moves accounted for 67 percent of its pretax earnings. Wells Fargo also reported a 6 percent drop in revenue, as several major divisions, like its vast mortgage operations and its investment banking businesses, reported a decline from last year. But the bank still managed a record $4.1 billion profit, thanks in part to a sharp reduction in charge-offs and the release of $800 million in loan loss reserves. But buried in the numbers of both big banks were signs that loan growth was modestly improving. Citigroup pointed to healthy demand in emerging markets, which have only recently started to feel the impact of the global slowdown. In Asia, for example, corporate loans grew 22 percent, while card lending increased by about 4 percent, excluding the impact of the exchange rate. Citi’s Latin American operations showed similar resilience, while even the North American business showed a slight increase in lending, with the exception of mortgages. Much of it is not “forced lending” as borrowers tap credit lines because they are in desperate need of money to pay their bills, Citi executives said. Small-business customers are “drawing them down because they have real needs and we are extending additional commitments,” said John C. Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer. “Absent the continued uncertainty, you would likely have loans growing and the economy growing at a faster rate.” Executives at Wells Fargo, whose giant lending operations are largely focused on consumer and corporate borrowers in the United States, said that “customer sentiment is good” even though some of the economic data worsened during the third quarter. “It’s not just energy or commercial real estate; it’s really across the board,” said Mr. Sloan, the chief financial officer at Wells Fargo. Some of the growth was due to foreign lenders ceding some ground to Wells and other large American banks, rather than an overall increase in demand. The uptick in Wells Fargo’s commercial lending business was aided, in part, by a $1.1 billion commercial real estate portfolio it bought from the Bank of Ireland. Even its mortgage business, which reported more than a 50 percent jump in home loan applications, owed some of the lending growth to consumers refinancing existing loans — not people obtaining new ones. On Thursday, Mr. Dimon was keen to highlight JPMorgan’s lending numbers in an otherwise sobering quarter. Lending to small businesses with less than $50 million in revenue was up 70 percent through this year compared with the same period in 2010, while lending to middle-market customers was up 18 percent. “These are pretty powerful numbers,” Mr. Dimon said on a conference call with journalists. “We look at loan growth translating to jobs.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/jpmorgan-profit-falls-4-to-4-26-billion/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">JPMorgan Profit Falls 4%, to $4.26 Billion<date>October 13, 2011, 7:26 am</date><text>8:57 p.m. | Updated Despite a paper gain that helped lift earnings by nearly $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company reported on Thursday that profit fell 4 percent in the third quarter amid lingering mortgage troubles and weak investment banking results. Both its consumer and Wall Street businesses were hit hard by the still-anemic recovery in the United States. The bank made $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $4.4 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the period a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ consensus estimate of 96 cents a share. Shares of JPMorgan fell almost 5 percent on Thursday to $31.60. Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s chairman and chief executive, said that his bank had seen surprisingly few signs that consumers and businesses were retrenching. In fact, he pointed to a modest increase in credit card loans and a much sharper uptick in loan growth to small and midsize corporations as evidence the broader economy was doing much better than many had feared. In addition, loan losses appear to be stabilizing. “It hasn’t really strengthened, but the recovery is still here,” Mr. Dimon said in a conference call with journalists on Thursday. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release In one sign of confidence, the bank bought back more than $4.4 billion of shares and warrants during the third quarter. The paper accounting gain came from a $1.9 billion benefit tied to the increase in the perceived riskiness of its debt, as credit spreads on its bonds roughly doubled in the quarter. That helped offset $1 billion the bank set aside in pretax funds to cover potential legal claims largely stemming from problems in its mortgage division. The bank also took a $542 million pretax loss in its private equity unit. Revenue remained under pressure, falling to $24.4 billion, or 11 percent, from the second quarter, amid a slowdown in stock and debt offerings that had propped up the bank’s results in the past. Difficult trading conditions, slimmer profit margins on lending, and the elimination of overdraft and other penalty fees all weighed on top-line growth. One thing that has not changed, however, is banker compensation. This year, workers at JPMorgan’s investment bank are on track to be paid, on average, about $389,000 per employee, up 4 percent from $369,000 per employee in 2010. Over all, the bank’s employees are poised to make about the same amount as they did in 2010 — an average of about $118,000 in salary, bonus, and other compensation. Star bankers and traders stand to reap millions. As a diversified bank and the first to report earnings, JPMorgan is seen as an indicator for the financial industry. It was among the first banks to prompt analysts to start cutting earnings estimates when it warned in early September of a sharp fall-off in its Wall Street businesses. The other big banks will report earnings next week; Citigroup and Wells Fargo are to release their results on Monday morning, and Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs follow later in the week. All are expected to report a similar slowdown in their investment banking businesses, with some analysts forecasting that Goldman Sachs will report its second quarterly loss as a public company. Investors are so concerned about the banks’ prospect for growth that they fled the sector during the quarter. Bank stocks are down more than 30 percent since January. Stagnant loan growth, higher capital requirements, and the reduction of once-lucrative debit card swipe fees are expected to take a big bite out of profits. What’s more, investors are increasingly nervous about the exposure of American banks to their counterparts in Europe, which have vast holdings of bonds backed by Greece and other nations with weak economies. The choppy markets weighed heavily on its JPMorgan’s investment bank’s results. Profits dropped 20 percent from the prior quarter, to $1.6 billion. Over all, trading revenue was down sharply from a year ago, when market conditions were much better. The bank’s large fixed-income and commodities operations fell 14 percent from the second quarter, while equities fell 15 percent, excluding the accounting gains taken on its debt. Investment banking fees fell 31 percent, as corporations shelved plans for acquisitions as well as stock and bonds deals, given all the uncertainty swirling in the markets. Those figures were roughly in line with guidance provided Wall Street in mid-September. Mr. Dimon said JPMorgan expected to eliminate around 1,000 jobs, largely through attrition. “We are building an investment bank for the long run but we always trim our sails,” he said. Chase Home Lending, the bank’s mortgage division, continues to bleed money. Losses have improved slightly, to around $900 million this quarter, but show few signs of letting up anytime soon. “We don’t expect a lot of improvement going forward in housing numbers,” Mr. Dimon said during the conference call. “It’s hard not to be cautious.” On top of that, Chase faces billions of dollars in potential legal claims stemming from the federal government and private investors seeking to recoup losses on mortgage bonds backed by loans that quickly went sour. It might also have to pony up several billion dollars more as part of a settlement with federal and state regulators for its role in the mortgage servicing and foreclosure mess. Banking analysts say the mortgage problems could cost the bank up to $9 billion. The bank’s other major businesses fared a bit better, despite the looming concerns about the job and housing markets. Chase Card Services, its credit card lending arm, posted an $849 million profit, down 8 percent from last year. Chase’s large commercial banking unit booked a $571 million profit, amid an 18 percent uptick in lending to middle-market corporations. JPMorgan’s asset management unit posted a $385 million profit despite facing the same drop in trading-related activity as the investment bank.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/business/big-temptations-for-wells-fargo.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Big Temptations for Wells Fargo<date>Published: October 10, 2011</date><text>Will Wells Fargo get hooked on Wall Street? The bank, based in California and led by John G. Stumpf, mostly has resisted the siren call to put down stakes in Lower Manhattan. But Wells Fargo kept Wachovia’s fledgling investment bank when it bought its struggling rival three years ago, and the company is still hiring. A couple of senior M.&amp; A. bankers joined just last week. But getting much bigger would come at a price.It’s easy to see the allure. With $1.2 trillion in assets, Wells is the fourth-largest American bank but the only one still lacking a sizable Wall Street presence. The extra options for raising capital for clients, beyond just lending, give its peers a competitive advantage. The ability to underwrite stocks and bonds and to offer strategic advice would level the playing field and increase fee income. But building a decent-size operation takes time and money. The other option is to buy. On paper, Morgan Stanley appears to be a good fit. It would bring a top-notch investment bank and, if it can avoid antitrust issues, create the country’s largest brokerage. Trimming 15 percent of the combined brokerage costs would be worth about $22 billion to shareholders, once taxed, discounted and capitalized. That is about three-quarters of Morgan Stanley’s currently deflated market value. Integrating the two cultures would be hard enough. But there is another problem, if Wells opted to expand in investment banking. The bigger the unit gets, the more it would need a good trading operation. The greater the presence a bank can have in the flow of daily buying and selling, the theory goes, the better it can price deals and place the paper. That introduces new risk and means bulking up on inventory, which in turn eats up capital. And with more clients doing more business around the world, Wells might also need more international reach. Combined, that could make it a systemically important bank, requiring an extra amount of capital that would increase the cost of doing business. For now, Wells seems content to limit its investment banking presence. But until Wachovia came along, executives from Wells dismissed owning any business east of the Mississippi, claiming it might as well be in China. And as others have discovered, Wall Street is a tantalizing temptation before it becomes a debilitating addiction. The Bill for Dexia Belgium’s cost to bail out Dexia could be higher than meets the eye. After a weekend of frantic negotiations, Brussels is to pay 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion) to take the Belgian assets of Dexia, the vanquished lender, into public ownership. If that was it, the direct costs to the state would be only 1 percent of its gross domestic product. It might seem that Belgium is getting a bargain. Dexia Bank Belgium’s book value was 7.9 billion euros in June. But local accounting rules allow Dexia to avoid marking so-called available-for-sale assets to market. Including these losses, the bank’s book value in June was 5.7 billion euros. Given the recent market turmoil, the current mark-to-market value could be less than the Belgian government is paying. Then there is the question of whether the remainder of Dexia, in which Belgium still holds a 5.7 percent stake, has enough capital. The plan is to sell some operations. After the anticipated disposals, it would still have 60 billion euros of risk-weighted assets. These would require at least 6 billion euros of capital to create a 10 percent core Tier 1 buffer against losses. Part of this will depend on whether Dexia can sell assets above book value. But a lot will depend on whether Belgium is allowed to keep sweeping available-for-sale losses under the rug. The new Basel rules say no, but there is always the possibility of a workaround. If, at the end of the process, there is a capital hole, it’s unclear how Belgium and France would plug it. But, imagine for the sake of argument, Brussels faces another 3 billion euro bill. Finally, Belgium is liable for guaranteeing 60.5 percent of Dexia’s financing for 10 years, or 54 billion euros in total. Add it up and the total cost to Belgian taxpayers, in a real disaster, could be 17 percent of gross domestic product, on top of last year’s 96 percent. It is no wonder that Moody’s is weighing whether to downgrade the country’s sovereign debt, and that Belgian 10-year debt yields have jumped to 4.1 percent from 3.6 percent in a week.

The bank, based in California and led by John G. Stumpf, mostly has resisted the siren call to put down stakes in Lower Manhattan. But Wells Fargo kept Wachovia’s fledgling investment bank when it bought its struggling rival three years ago, and the company is still hiring.

Bank of America probably has bigger problems than any of its competitors. So it stands to reason that it would make a bolder move. After all, it is dealing with a pile of troubled mortgages, legal fallout from the sales of bonds made from those loans and questions about how it serviced its home mortgages. Still, the scale of its changes mean that most debit card shoppers who do not have Bank of America mortgages or more than $20,000 in account balances will need to pay that $5 monthly fee. It is a tax on pretty much every customer without a healthy salary or investment income, plus those who want to keep their savings elsewhere for whatever reason. Bank of America and Wells Fargo are hardly alone here, since other big banks have toughened the rules for people who want to keep free checking, or have killed off rewards programs to save money. And we probably haven’t heard the last of the new rules either. All of these moves together, however, raise a simple and rather obvious question: Why is anyone still doing business with banks like these? Just after noon on Friday, Elvita Dominique, who lives in Harlem, was trying to answer that question for herself. She had just left a Bank of America branch on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan having made an appointment with a bank employee who could help her review her options. “I want to know if they are going to make exceptions,” she said. (Later in the day, the branch employee said no.) She had already heard that Citibank did not plan to add monthly debit card fees, so she will investigate that possibility. She is also considering joining a credit union. Bank of America’s move is part of a broader effort to overhaul its checking account lineup. As of sometime early next year, it will have four basic accounts, only one of which will waive the $5 monthly fee for debit card users who want to use the card for purchases. A.T.M. use will not incur the monthly fee, but charging recurring bills like gym memberships or mobile phone plans to your debit card will. Only Bank of America customers with more than $20,000 in combined checking, savings and certificate of deposit accounts or a bank mortgage (of any size) will be able to avoid both the debit card fee and any other monthly fee for falling below a required minimum balance level. Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust customers will also get a waiver, as will unemployed people who use certain government-issued Bank of America cards that have benefit money loaded onto them. While the bank will not say what percentage of its checking account customers it expects (or hopes) will be paying new fees, $20,000 is a much higher bar to clear than the direct deposit requirement or the $1,500 to $10,000 minimum balances that the bank currently places on many checking account customers who wish to avoid fees. As a result, plenty of customers will be looking at their options. What would cause people who count on debit cards to help them live within their means to stick around despite the $5 a month fee? The first factor is the perceived pain involved with switching. And it is a pain, though not as much as you may think. It shouldn’t take much more than 90 minutes to reboot direct deposit of your paycheck and move all the automated payments from one account to another. There may be a few hiccups over the next couple of months, but they shouldn’t take more than a few minutes each to fix. Try to leave some money behind in the old account for a few months just in case it takes billers a few cycles to make the switch. Much depends, then, on how much you value that 90 minutes, versus the $60 in savings you might achieve in Year 1 with your new financial institution. Then you need to weigh the value of your time against the good feeling that would come from rewarding a checking account provider that wasn’t so fee-happy. A.T.M. convenience is another factor that limits switching. Consumers who haven’t looked at an online-only institution in awhile will be pleasantly surprised by the developments here. Some of them have tapped into nationwide networks of fee-free machines that are bigger than any one bank’s collection of locations. Others let you use any A.T.M. you want and reimburse you for most or all of the fees you pay to withdraw money. Banks like ING Direct, Ally, Charles Schwab and USAA are all worth a look here. They may well pay better interest too, though it won’t amount to very much these days. There could be plenty of people who have no problem with an extra $5 a month. Claudia Smith, who lives in Fayetteville, Ark., said she wasn’t worried about the new fee, even though she used her debit card extensively. “It’s well worth $5 a month to not have to carry a checkbook,” she said. 1 2 Next Page »The news on Thursday that Bank of America is imposing a $5 monthly fee on people who have the nerve to use their debit card to buy things probably should not have come as much of a shock.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/business/banks-to-make-customers-pay-debit-card-fee.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks to Make Customers Pay Debit Card Fee<date>Published: September 29, 2011</date><text>Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases. It was just one of several new charges expected to hit consumers as new regulations crimp banks’ profits.Wells Fargo and Chase are testing $3 monthly debit card fees. Regions Financial, based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to start charging a $4 fee next month, while SunTrust, another regional powerhouse, is charging a $5 fee. The round of new charges stems from a rule, which takes effect on Saturday, that limits the fees that banks can levy on merchants every time a consumer uses a debit card to make a purchase. The rule, known as the Durbin amendment, after its sponsor Senator Richard J. Durbin, is a crucial part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Until now, the fees have been 44 cents a transaction, on average. The Federal Reserve in June agreed to cut the fees to a maximum of about 24 cents. While the fee amounts to pennies per swipe, it rapidly adds up across millions of transactions. The new limit is expected to cost the banks about $6.6 billion in revenue a year, beginning in 2012, according to Javelin Strategy and Research. That comes on top of another loss, of $5.6 billion, from new rules restricting overdraft fees, which went into effect in July 2010. And even though retailer groups had argued that lower fees were important to keep prices in check, consumers were not likely to see substantial savings. In fact, they are simply going to end up paying from a different pot of money. Or as Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, put it after passage last year of the Dodd-Frank Act, “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Chase is now charging customers for a paper statement. It also, like many other banks, scrapped its debit card rewards program. And customers that Chase inherited from Washington Mutual no longer enjoy free checking accounts. The bank is also exploring a number of other fee increases, including for online banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bank of America’s debit fee is steeper than most of its competitors’, reflecting the broader challenges the bank is facing after the financial crisis. The bank has introduced an online-only account that charges customers for doing business at a local branch. It also plans to apply its new debit card fees to anyone who uses the card to make recurring payments like gym fees or cable bills. Citibank is one of the few that said it would not introduce a charge for debit card use. “We have talked to customers and they have made it abundantly clear that ‘if you charge me to use my debit card, I would find that very irritating,’ ” said Stephen Troutner, head of Citi’s banking products. Still, the bank has made it more difficult to qualify for free checking, among other moves. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo estimated that the Durbin rules would cost the bank $250 million in revenue every quarter. It hopes to make up half that gap with a variety of new products and customer fees, including the monthly debit card fee of $3. The change is part of a “pilot program” the bank will begin on Oct. 14 in five states across the country, including Washington and Georgia. As of Saturday, the bank will discontinue its debit card rewards program. Meanwhile, HSBC said that it recently increased an A.T.M. fee — to $2.50 from $2 — for certain customers when they used a competitor’s A.T.M. It also recently introduced a debit transaction fee of 35 cents, though the first eight transactions are free. And at TDBank, customers will now have to pay $2 for using A.T.M.’s outside their network. “Durbin essentially moves the cost of debit away from merchants, and now it’s more focused on consumers,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin. “There are all sort of things happening where banks are saying, where can we put fees in place for our service to generate revenue or how can we reduce our costs?” Over the last few years, consumers have increasingly shifted their spending to debit cards from credit cards, in large part to curb their spending. But some analysts predicted that the new fees could prompt consumers to return to credit cards — a more lucrative alternative for the banks. Consumers have already begun to react to the changes. Patrick Shields, 48, said he had decided to leave Citibank, where he has held a small-business account for his residential window cleaning business since 1986. He was contemplating opening a personal checking account, but realized he could do better at a credit union. “At the credit union, they opened it free of charges, which Citi could not and would not do,” said Mr. Shields, who noted that a personal checking account would have cost more than the one he uses for his New York business. “Now I have both accounts covered, and I am fee-free.” The so-called Durbin rule quickly emerged as one of the thorniest provisions of Dodd-Frank, touching off a long and furious fight in Washington. Wall Street dispatched an army of lobbyists to tame the rule, ultimately yielding mixed results. In June, the Senate defeated a measure that would have delayed the new rule. But just three weeks later, the Federal Reserve decided to cap the fees at 21 to 24 cents for each debit card transaction, a much lighter blow than once expected. In a statement on Thursday, Senator Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said that small businesses would benefit from the new limits. “Swipe fee regulation will still allow banks to cover the actual costs of debit transactions but will rein in the banks’ excessive profit-taking.” Ann Carrns contributed reporting.Bank of America, the nation’s biggest bank, said on Thursday that it planned to start charging customers a $5 monthly fee when they used their debit cards for purchases.

Moody’s had put the banks on notice for a possible downgrade on June 2. While Moody’s said it “believes that the government is likely to continue to provide some level of support to systemically important financial institutions,” the agency added that the government “is also more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled.” Under the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform passed by Congress in 2010, financial institutions must file a so-called living will that lays out steps for an orderly liquidation in the event of a financial collapse. The goal is to avoid future government bailouts, as well as the kind of turmoil unleashed by Lehman’s unexpected bankruptcy. “Now, having moved beyond the depths of the crisis, Moody’s believes there is an increased possibility that the government might allow a large financial institution to fail, taking the view that the contagion could be limited,” the firm said in a statement. Even so, Moody’s said it doubted whether a global financial institution could be liquidated “without a disruption of the marketplace and the broader economy.” The ratings agency cut Bank of America’s long-term senior debt to Baa1, three levels above junk. For Citigroup, Moody’s cut its ratings on short-term debt to Prime 2 from Prime 1, while affirming its A3 long-term rating. Moody’s lowered its rating on Wells Fargo’s senior debt to A2 from A1. Its Prime-1 short-term rating was affirmed. Of the three institutions, Bank of America has the lowest credit rating. Shares of all three big banks fell sharply after the downgrade, but Bank of America dropped the most, falling 7.5 percent to $6.38 a share. Although big banks enjoyed higher credit ratings before the financial crisis, Wednesday’s move was not unexpected, and analysts played down its significance. Although it could slightly raise borrowing costs over the long term, banks are not expected to have to pay significantly more to finance their operations in the near term. “It’s not a good headline, but it shouldn’t have much impact,” said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays Capital, adding that even the federal government’s loss of its AAA rating this summer had not raised its borrowing costs. In addition to seeing the government as less likely to support Bank of America, if needed, Moody’s said that the company “remains exposed to potentially significant risks related to both the residential mortgage and home equity loans on its balance sheet, as well as to mortgages previously sold to investors.” Investors are seeking to force Bank of America to pay billions of dollars for its alleged misdeeds during the height of the housing boom, especially the bubble-related excesses at Countrywide Financial, the subprime giant Bank of America acquired in 2008. Bank of America has reached settlements with some investors, but other holders of mortgage-backed securities assembled by Bank of America, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, another subsidiary, are suing to recover multibillion-dollar losses. Moody’s was careful to note that its action did not reflect a weakening of Bank of America’s “intrinsic credit quality.”Moody’s cut its credit ratings Wednesday on three large banks — Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo — underscoring the challenges the sector still faces three years after the onset of the financial crisis.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/06/dunkin-donuts-parent-gets-mixed-reviews/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Dunkin' Donuts Parent Gets Mixed Reviews<date>September 6, 2011, 11:03 am</date><text>Mario Tama/Getty ImagesNigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands, celebrated the stock offering outside the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York. Wall Street no longer runs on Dunkin.’ Shares of the Dunkin’ Brands Group slid 5 percent Tuesday morning, as equity analysts issued a mixed bag of reports. The doughnut and coffee purveyor, which went public less than two months ago in a highly anticipated public offering, did not get a resounding vote of confidence from its underwriters — many of which initiated coverage on the stock with a “neutral” or negative rating. Goldman Sachs, one of its top underwriters, slapped a “sell” rating on Dunkin’ and a $23 price target, citing a “full” valuation. In its note, issued early Tuesday, Goldman praised the company’s margins and international opportunities but warned that its earnings per share growth will probably not rise fast enough to support the stock’s momentum. “We see the potential for underlying Dunkin U.S. comps to decelerate and disappoint in the back half of 2011 and 2012,”  the firm noted. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A number of banks — which had to wait several weeks after Dunkin’s offering before issuing reports — took a similarly cautious stance. Three of its underwriters, Barclays Capital, Wells Fargo Securities, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, issued “neutral” or “equal weight” ratings on Dunkin’. Barclays, which set Dunkin’s price target at $27, said the “strengths of its global portfolio make a compelling long-term investment.” But it added that the valuation is a “primary concern” since it is trading at a premium to its restaurant peers. Other potential hurdles include the company’s plans to expand on the West Coast and its ability to turn around its Baskin-Robbins chain, according to Barclays. The skepticism evident in Tuesday’s research notes stands in stark contrast to the enthusiasm for Dunkin’s shares in late July. During the company’s public offering, international and domestic investors flocked to the banks for a piece of Dunkin’. Orders amounted to more than 20 times the size of the eventual offering, according to one person with knowledge of the matter. Shares of Dunkin’, which have traded as high as $31.94, are still about 35 percent above the company’s offering price. Historically, underwriters have not been shy to heap praise on the companies they have shepherded to the public markets. In the wake of LinkedIn’s debut, the company’s underwriters, JPMorgan Chase, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, all stamped bullish ratings on the stock with rosy outlooks, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch calling LinkedIn a “$10 billion long-term revenue opportunity.” Still, there was some love for Dunkin’ on Tuesday. At least four of its underwriters, J.P.Morgan, Stifel Nicolaus Weisel, Williams Capital Group, and William Blair &amp; Company, issued positive ratings on the stock. Its lead underwriter, J.P. Morgan, delivered an “overweight” rating, assuring investors that “longevity and low-risk growth should sustain premium multiple.” It set its price target at $30.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/buffett-adds-another-bank-to-his-investment-portfolio/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Buffett Adds Another Bank to His Portfolio<date>August 25, 2011, 12:15 pm</date><text>Pankaj Nangia/Bloomberg NewsWarren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation’s banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. Here were Berkshire’s top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing: FIRM MARKET VALUE OF STAKE AMOUNT OF SHARES CHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER American Express $7.84 billion 151,610,700 No change Wells Fargo $9.89 billion 352,327,608 + 9,703,683 shares US Bancorp $1.76 billion 69,039,426 No change Source: Bloomberg News/S.E.C. filing Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&amp;T Bank Corporation. Of course, Mr. Buffett’s most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. Still, not all of Mr. Buffett’s Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm’s stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.) Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares.

He stepped in as Salomon’s chairman in 1991 after John Gutfreund was forced to resign following a Treasury securities bidding scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving the firm from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. (He famously delivered the following lines in his testimony before Congress on the scandal: “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”) Mr. Buffett stepped down as Salomon’s chairman after roughly 10 months. Berkshire sold its shares in the firm in 1997, after Salomon was sold to what is now Citigroup. Outside of banks, Mr. Buffett declined to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1993.

But now some banks are taking steps that make the cards less attractive, by charging monthly fees for their use with some checking accounts. The moves follow the heated debate over limiting the “swipe” fees that banks charge retailers for processing debt transactions. Banks say they have to make up that lost interchange-fee income from somewhere — for example, by eliminating debit card rewards programs, and by adding fees on customers for shopping with debit cards. Wells Fargo, for instance, is notifying customers this month that beginning in October, the bank will test a debit card “activity fee” of $3 a month when a customer makes a purchase or payment with a debit card linked to a personal or business checking account. (ATM transactions won’t trigger the fee.) The test will affect accounts opened in five states: Oregon, New Mexico, Nevada, Georgia and Washington. The bank said the accounts will continue to carry perks including “card personalization,” which lets you put a photo of, say, your dog on your card. (Gee, thanks.) “This is one of those ways we are looking at recouping lost revenue,” said a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Lisa Westermann, in an e-mail. SunTrust Bank recently implemented a $5-a-month fee for debit card purchases for holders of its basic Everyday Checking account and will add the fee to its student checking account next spring. In any given month, if the customer uses the debit card to make a purchase — either using a signature or a PIN — the bank will charge a single $5 fee. The fee doesn’t apply to use of the card for ATM transactions. “As I’m sure you’re aware, a debit card usage fee is a growing trend due to changes in the environment in which our industry operates,” Hugh Suhr, a SunTrust spokesman, said in an e-mail. Regions Bank, meanwhile, now charges a $4 monthly fee for debit card purchases for holders of its basic LifeGreen Checking account and its student checking account, according to the bank’s Web site. (The fee doesn’t apply to ATM transactions and is waived if you don’t make any purchases with the card.) JPMorgan Chase is testing a $3 monthly fee for a debit card with a basic checking account in northern Wisconsin. (Customers there have three other accounts to choose from that provide a debit card with no fee, according to a bank spokesman.) Would you cut back on use of your debit card, if your bank charges you a fee for shopping with it?</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/wells-fargo-brings-aboard-citadels-investment-banking-unit/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Brings Citadel's Investment Banking Unit Aboard<date>August 15, 2011, 10:12 am</date><text>Wells Fargo announced on Monday an agreement to hire 25 investment bankers from Citadel, whose founder, Kenneth C. Griffin, recently decided to sell the unit after a failed attempt to transform the hedge fund into an investment bank in the wake of the financial crisis. Wells Fargo said in a statement that in addition to hiring the bankers, it would acquire administrative staff members and current banking business from Citadel Securities. Brian Maier, Citadel’s banking head, will join Wells Fargo Securities as a vice chairman of client coverage. Mr. Maier, a longtime banker with stints at Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs, joined Citadel in 2009 as head of industry groups and later became head of the unit. “These new additions complement our existing team, bringing added depth to specific industry sectors and increased advisory and capital markets product expertise where we have been looking to expand,” said Robert A. Engel, co-head of investment banking and capital markets at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a statement. “They bring strong client relationships, highly seasoned execution experience and a compatible culture that fits with our growing business.” Citadel’s unit is the latest addition by Wells Fargo as it works to bolster the investment banking practice it inherited in its acquisition of Wachovia. Citadel founded its unit in late 2008 in an effort to capitalize on the weakness of investment banks as a result of the financial crisis. The firm hired senior bankers from Wall Street for the practice, but from early on the effort was plagued by high-level departures. In 2009, the investment banks came roaring back to profitability, which also stymied business opportunities for the Citadel unit. In addition to Mr. Maier, former Citadel executives Stephen Gerson, Aviv Laurence, Paul Pepe and Stavros Tsibiridis will join the investment bank practice at Wells Fargo, the statement said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/aarp-files-another-reverse-mortgage-suit/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">AARP Files Another Reverse Mortgage Suit<date>August 4, 2011, 3:50 pm</date><text>In recent months, AARP Foundation Litigation has prodded the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to reverse a rule change that had made it harder for some surviving spouses of reverse mortgage holders to stay in their homes. Now, the foundation is turning to the financial institutions that own and service the mortgages. This week, the foundation, along with the law firms Mehri &amp; Skalet and Kerr &amp; Wagstaffe, filed a class action suit against both Wells Fargo and Fannie Mae on behalf of reverse mortgage holders and their heirs. The dispute is over what should be a simple question: Should heirs to a home that has an outstanding reverse mortgage pay the lender the remaining balance on the loan to clear the debt? Or should they merely write a check or get a new mortgage for the (often much smaller, nowadays) market value if they want to keep the home? It’s yet another dispute born of the collapse in housing prices in some areas of the country, though it has a few twists because of the unique rules of reverse mortgages. Reverse mortgages allow you to take equity out of your home without having to make monthly payments back to the bank, as you would with a home equity loan. How much you get depends on your age (you have to be at least 62) and the equity you have in your home in the first place, among other things. AARP argues that upon death of a reverse mortgage borrower, say a single person, heirs are supposed to have a choice between paying off the loan, paying 95 percent of the home’s fair market value or giving the home to the lender in order to satisfy the loan. But Wells Fargo, acting as a servicer for Fannie Mae, told one of AARP’s named plaintiffs that he had no choice but to pay the full amount of the loan, even though the home was worth much less than that at the time he inherited it. The root of the confusion about who owes what in these circumstances may lie in differing interpretations of the breadth of the HUD rule that AARP beat back a couple of months ago. It’s hard to say for sure though; a Fannie Mae spokeswoman declined my request to comment on the suit, citing the company’s policy of not talking about pending litigation. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said that company was still reviewing the complaint and could not comment by the time this post went up. Whatever your view of the law, however, an AARP lawyer, Jean Constantine-Davis, says that logic would suggest letting the heir buy the home at the fair market value. Given that most heirs couldn’t get a new standard mortgage from a bank for the actual reverse mortgage balance if that balance was more than the home’s actual market value, why wouldn’t Fannie Mae sell the home to the heir for fair market value? The alternative is to go through the trouble of foreclosing on it, listing it for sale and then selling it for that same fair market value to someone else. In fact, Ms. Constantine-Davis notes, the heirs may pay more than fair market value, given their sentimental attachment to the family home. Ms. Constantine-Davis’s point is a pretty good one, and she said she was unable to get Fannie Mae to respond to her and the other lawyers’ inquiries. So now we have another lawsuit.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/once-unthinkable-breakup-of-big-banks-now-seems-feasible/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Once Unthinkable, Breakup of Big Banks Now Seems Feasible<date>July 27, 2011, 3:48 pm</date><text>Bebeto Matthews/Associated PressJohn A.

Big bank stocks have been persistently weak, making breakups that seemed politically impossible no longer unthinkable. Bank of America’s recent quarterly earnings were so weak that investors and commentators wondered whether the bank should sell off Merrill Lynch, the investment bank for which it foolishly overpaid at the height of the crisis. Bank of America trades at half of its book value (the stated value of its assets minus its liabilities), an indication that investors view its asset quality and prospects just a notch below abominable, as Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News pointed out last week. The Trade View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink For Bank of America, the question is whether it will have to raise capital. Selling shares at such depressed prices would be costly. Regulators won’t push for it. They just gave stress tests to the biggest banks, and merely restricted the bank from paying out a dividend. The logical solution is that Bank of America shed business lines in a bid to improve its prospects in the eyes of Wall Street. Citigroup’s stock, revenue and earnings have lagged for a decade. “Look, if you can’t compete in the major leagues for over a decade, it’s time to go back to the minors,” said the always outspoken Mike Mayo, an analyst with CLSA. His chronicle of ruffling bank management feathers, “Exile on Wall Street” (Wiley), will be published in the fall. JPMorgan Chase is as well managed as any gargantuan bank can be. But if you look at its businesses, it’s hard to see any area where it is clearly the best, something even its own executives concede. Not in credit cards, where the premier name is American Express. Not in money management, where you might offer up T. Rowe Price. Investment banking — Goldman Sachs (the last quarter notwithstanding). Back-office transactions, State Street. Yet even JPMorgan is merely trading at book value. Put another way, the market regards the value that JPMorgan provides as a financial services conglomerate as zilch. How well do all of JPMorgan’s divisions work together? In presentations to investors, JPMorgan executives show how much revenue they gain from existing clients. But these measures are hardly unbiased. Executives have an incentive to defend their empires. Who is to say that a certain division of JPMorgan wouldn’t have won that business anyway? And nobody measures how much a bank loses through conflicts of interest. Even in the face of investor pressure, there are forces that would hold bank breakups back. Mainly pay. “The biggest motivation for not breaking up is that top managers would earn less,” Mr. Mayo said. “That is part of the breakdown in the owner/manager relationship. That’s a breakdown in capitalism.” Institutional investors — the major owners of the banks — are passive and conflicted. They don’t like to go public with complaints. They have extensive business ties with the banks. The few hedge fund activist investors who aren’t cowed would most likely balk at taking on such an enormous target. Also, there are reasons to think that smaller banks wouldn’t necessarily make the system safer. A wave of small bank failures can have systemic effects, as was the case in the Great Depression. Focused companies like Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns failed in the recent crisis, worsening it. Making a nuanced argument, John Hempton, a blogger, investor and former regulator in Australia, says that it’s better for shareholders — and societies — to have large banks with lots of market power. That makes them more profitable and leads them to take less risk, making them safer and more enticing for investors. Another oft-trotted-out argument against breakups: The United States needs global banks to service its giant, multinational corporations and to preserve our position in world markets. Color me unconvinced. When a giant corporation wants to do a major bond offering or a big company goes public, the banks, despite their size, don’t want to shoulder all the risk themselves, preferring to share the responsibility. If the stocks continue to lag for quarters upon years, these arguments will seem less convincing, while institutional reluctance will begin to erode. Investors don’t care about size, they care about performance. It’s undeniable that smaller banks are easier to manage. And they are easier for regulators to unwind — and therefore less terrifying to trading partners — when they fail. One of the most remarkable aspects of the debate about overhauling the financial system after the great crisis was the absence of serious contemplation of breaking up the largest banks. It’s not a perfect solution. Banks responding to investor pressure would react haphazardly. But it’s a good start.

The bank was Wells Fargo, which was also fined $85 million and ordered to compensate customers it had unfairly — indeed, illegally — taken advantage of during the subprime bubble.What made the news surprising, of course, was that the Federal Reserve has rarely, if ever, taken action against a bank for making predatory loans. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, didn’t believe in regulation and turned a blind eye to subprime abuses. His successor, Ben Bernanke, is not the ideologue that Greenspan is, but, as an institution, the Fed prefers to coddle banks rather than punish them. That the Fed would crack down on Wells Fargo would seem to suggest a long-overdue awakening. Yet, for anyone still hoping for justice in the wake of the financial crisis, the news was hardly encouraging. First, the Fed did not force Wells Fargo to admit guilt — and even let the company issue a press release blaming its wrongdoing on a “relatively small group.” The $85 million fine was a joke; in just the last quarter, Wells Fargo’s revenues exceeded $20 billion. And compensating borrowers isn’t going to hurt much either. By my calculation, it won’t top $200 million. Most upsetting of all, the settlement raises the question that just won’t go away: Why can’t the federal government prosecute financial wrongdoers? I realize that the Federal Reserve can’t bring a criminal case (and, to be fair, there are statutory limits on how big a fine it can levy). But the Justice Department certainly can. Yet ever since it lost an early case against two Bear Stearns fund managers in 2009, it has gone after only the smallest of small fry: individual borrowers, brokers and appraisers who lack the means to do much more than plead guilty. In March, for instance, I wrote about the sad case of Charlie Engle, the ultra-marathoner, who was convicted of lying on a liar loan — that is, exaggerating his income on a subprime mortgage application — even though the evidence against him was thin. Prosecuted by Neil H. MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Engle was sentenced to 21 months in prison. Now compare Engle’s alleged crime to the case the Federal Reserve brought against Wells Fargo Financial, which, until it was shut down last summer, was the subprime subsidiary of Wells Fargo, based in Des Moines. There were several allegations, but the one that caught my eye was that Wells employees “falsified income information on mortgage applications.” In other words, they lied on liar loans! The only difference is that the lying was done by a group of Wells Fargo brokers rather than by some poor sap like Charlie Engle. What’s more, this practice appears to have been quite widespread — “fostered,” as the Fed puts it, “by Wells Fargo Financial’s incentive compensation and sales quota programs.” Matthew R. Lee, the executive director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move and Fair Finance Watch, spent years bringing Wells’ subprime abuses to the attention of the Federal Reserve. “The way the compensation was designed ensured that abuses would take place,” he says. “It was a predatory system.” These are exactly the kind of loans — built on illegal practices — that gave us the financial crisis. Brokers working for subprime mortgage companies routinely doctored incomes to hand out subprime loans they knew the borrowers could never repay — and then, after taking their fat fees, shoveled the loans to Wall Street, which bundled them into subprime securities. This was the kindling that lit the inferno of September 2008. So again, I ask: Why is there no criminal investigation into what went on at Wells Fargo Financial? The person I called for answers was the press secretary to Nicholas A. Klinefeldt, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Iowa, which includes Des Moines. A glance at Klinefeldt’s 2011 press releases suggests that he takes the MacBride approach to mortgage fraud: only the little guy has anything to fear. Needless to say, his press secretary knew nothing about the Wells Fargo case and even questioned whether the Southern District of Iowa had jurisdiction. The next day, he referred me to a Justice Department spokeswoman. I wrote her an e-mail laying out my question as plainly as I could: “I am trying to understand why the mortgage brokers who work at a major bank are getting a pass when they have lied on liar loans,” I said. That was Friday. On Monday, at 8:30 p.m., a half-hour from press time, the Justice Department sent me a statement claiming that in 2010 “the number of defendants in mortgage fraud cases more than doubled” from 2009. Not one of those defendants ever worked for Wells Fargo Financial.

Wells Fargo, the nation’s biggest consumer bank, said profit rose 29 percent in the second quarter from the period a year earlier as loan losses eased significantly. The bank reported record second-quarter earnings of $3.9 billion, or 70 cents a share, beating the 69-cents-a-share consensus estimate of analysts. That compared with a profit of $3.1 billion, or 55 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release Wells Fargo’s earnings benefited from the reversal of about $1 billion that the bank had previously set aside to cover loan losses. That helped offset a 5 percent drop in revenue, which fell to $20.4 billion, as new regulations curbed overdraft charges and its big home lending business slowed. New mortgage originations dropped nearly a quarter to $64 billion from $84 billion in the first quarter. Wells Fargo’s investment bank is far smaller than most of its big rivals, which meant that the difficult market conditions that affected competitors like Citigroup and Bank of America did not hurt as much. Still, meager loan growth, the rising cost of servicing troubled mortgages and the effect of new financial rules have weighed on its results. Richard Patterson for The New York TimesJohn Stumpf, chief of Wells Fargo. “While the economic recovery continues to be slower than expected, there are signs that businesses are investing for growth,” the bank chairman and chief executive, John Stumpf, said in a statement. “Our business fundamentals were strong with increased revenues, loans and deposits, lower operating costs, improved credit quality and higher capital levels.” San Francisco-based Wells Fargo quietly emerged from the financial crisis as one of the nation’s strongest banks. With its takeover of the Wachovia Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., in the fall of 2008, it established a network of retail branches along both coasts. But its go-slow approach to converting its computer systems and store signage meant that the New York metropolitan area did not change over until this spring, and the integration of its operations in Washington and the Carolinas, the last of its major markets, won’t occur for another few months. Despite its strong performance over the last few years, many analysts remain cautious. At a time when its rivals are betting on faster-growing areas overseas, some worry about Wells Fargo is too entrenched in the United States, where the housing and job markets remain weak. Still, the bank’s share price has outpaced the industry, rising about 3 percent over the last year when most bank stocks were down. The stock was up about 42 cents, or 1.6 percent, to around $27 in morning trading. And bank officials suggested the second quarter once again showed the power of its expanded franchise to offset a sluggish domestic economy. Although total revenues declined from a year ago, several businesses — including corporate banking, commercial real estate, and retirement services — saw double-digit increases from the first three months of the year. “We are pleased with increased revenue in the quarter, reflecting the stability in loan balances and overall strength of our diversified sources of fee income,” said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer. And unlike competitors like Citigroup, Wells kept its operating expenses in check. Tuesday’s results showed that Wells Fargo’s operating expenses were $12.5 billion, down $258 million from the first quarter, despite setting aside more money for foreclosure-related matters and litigation. The bank added another $242 million to its reserve to buy back loans from troubled securities that it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other private investors. Over the prior two quarters, it set aside about $713 million. Wells Fargo, which already had one of the biggest real estate portfolios of any bank, took on with its Wachovia acquisition more than $219 billion worth of commercial real estate and corporate loans, and a big book of risky mortgages. But tighter underwriting standards during the boom, and aggressive management of the problems that followed, have enabled Wells to fare better than many of its peers. Bank of America announced a $20 billion hit to second-quarter earnings to accelerate the clean-up its mortgage troubles, while Chase has announced a series of multi-billion charges tied to its home lending business to bolster its litigation and loss reserves and improve its loan servicing practices. Citigroup, which has a much smaller business, has set aside about $1 billion to cover loan repurchases and expects only a modest uptick in servicing costs. Overall, Wells Fargo said that loan losses were easing. As a result, bank officials said they released another $1 billion from loan loss reserves after seeing six straight quarters of improvement. Bank officials expect to keep drawing down reserves in the coming quarters. “Absent significant deterioration in the economy, we expect future reserve releases,” said Mike Loughlin, the bank’s chief risk officer.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/business/second-lien-loans-may-prompt-new-losses-for-banks.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Second-Lien Loans May Prompt New Losses for Banks<date>Published: July 16, 2011</date><text>HAVE you heard the good news? Big banks are making more money than we thought. On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase said it earned $5.4 billion during the second quarter. On Friday, Citigroup said it earned $3.3 billion. Despite such happy tidings, many banks face a daunting challenge, and one federal regulators want to know more about: the potential costs associated with home loans that banks made during the great credit mania. Still to be dealt with are potentially large legal bills — and settlements — related to accusations that many banks acted improperly, first in bundling all those loans into mortgage securities, and later in foreclosing on homeowners. Under pressure from the Securities and Exchange Commission, banks have been estimating the potential damage in their financial filings. Last October, the S.E.C. warned them to be scrupulous in detailing risks associated with demands that they buy back soured loans or securities, as well as about possible defects in securitizations and foreclosures. But while the S.E.C. has been pressing banks to make comprehensive disclosures about these potential pitfalls, regulators have been quiet on another worry for investors: how banks are valuing their vast holdings of home equity lines of credit, also known as second liens. Privately, however, the S.E.C. has been pushing banks hard on this issue, according to Meredith Cross, the director of the commission’s corporation finance unit. As regulators review banks’ annual reports, they are asking tough questions about how institutions are valuing their second liens. Ms. Cross expects banks to provide more details about these loans in quarterly reports due next month. The numbers are significant. Banks held $624 billion of such loans in the first quarter, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data show. Millions of these loans are deeply troubled. According to CoreLogic, a real estate data concern, almost 11 million of the nation’s mortgaged properties — nearly 23 percent of the total — were underwater at the end of March. Some 4.5 million of those properties carried home equity loans, according to CoreLogic. The average amount of negative equity shouldered by borrowers across the nation was $65,000. WHEN first mortgages run into trouble, second liens are at greater peril, even if homeowners manage to keep up with their payments. That is because in a foreclosure, first mortgages are supposed to be paid off before second mortgages. It is not clear that is happening, however. Banks like the big four — JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — not only hold home equity lines but also service first mortgages held by others on the same properties. Some analysts worry that servicers are able to protect their own holdings of second-lien loans while foreclosing on the first liens. “The big four are pretending that the second liens are still money good because many are still performing,” said Christopher Whalen, editor of the Institutional Risk Analyst, a research publication. By performing, he means that borrowers are still making payments, if only the minimum. Many home equity lines require only the payment of interest for the first 10 years. Banks have written off about $500 billion in assets since 2008, Mr. Whalen said. Most of those assets were related to housing, but write-downs on second liens have been pretty sparse so far at the big banks. As of the first quarter of this year, Bank of America carried $136 billion of second liens on its books. During 2010, it wrote down $6.8 billion. Wells Fargo held $108 billion in such loans in the first quarter; it wrote down $4.7 billion last year. JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to second liens stood at $60 billion at the end of the second quarter. The bank charged off $1.3 billion in the first half of 2011 and $3.44 billion in 2010, said Joseph M. Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank. As for how Morgan values these assets, he said that since 2010 the bank has routinely reserved for the higher probability of defaults on them, assuming an average loss rate of 60 percent on high-risk second liens. Citibank’s home equity lines of credit totaled $46 billion last March; $6.2 billion belonged to borrowers with credit scores below 660 — that is, risky — and consisted of loan amounts that were greater than the values of the underlying properties. Spokeswomen for Wells Fargo and Citigroup declined to comment. Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, says the bank considers whether first mortgages are distressed when valuing home equity loans. If the second liens are performing, the bank doesn’t book a full loss on them. But if foreclosure seems inevitable on a first mortgage, the bank books a 100 percent loss on the second lien, he said. But Mr. Whalen suspects some values are too high. The trouble in the housing market does not appear to be reflected fully on bank balance sheets yet. . “If home prices do not stabilize, much less recover, then banks are likely to feel pressure to begin wholesale write-downs of first and second liens,” Mr. Whalen said. “There is probably as much loss prospectively facing the banking industry as a whole on residential real estate exposures as have already been charged off.” DENIAL in the banking industry — known in the trade as “extend and pretend” — is a powerful thing.

But on Thursday, robust gains in almost all of JPMorgan Chase’s main businesses offered some hope that the industry’s prospects are not as bad as feared. Over all, the bank said second-quarter revenue climbed 7 percent to $27.4 billion — a strong showing amid a stagnant consumer economy and some of the most challenging trading conditions of the last few years. That helped JPMorgan handily beat analysts’ consensus estimates with a profit of $5.4 billion, or $1.27 a share. Still, it was not enough to lift beaten-down bank stocks. Shares of Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo fell slightly on Thursday. The solid revenue figures fly in the face of the dismal projections by many Wall Street analysts, who have been warning that banking is quickly returning to a boring, low-growth business. The figures also take some of the air out of the financial industry’s arguments that new regulations are depressing revenue and stifling the fragile economic recovery. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release JPMorgan Names Co-Head of North America Investment Banking Even the chairman and chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has raised concerns about the cost of the new rules, acknowledged that his bank would be able to make up a big part of the missing revenue. “JPMorgan will be just fine,” he said on Thursday on a conference call with reporters. Bank officials said the revenue levels largely reflected a modest increase in lending and an uptick in fee income that could be sustained in the months ahead. For example, JPMorgan’s investment bank had a sharp increase in underwriting fees for debt and equity, as well as a big increase in deal advisory income that helped offset weaker trading results. Its Chase retail banking unit benefited from more profitable home lending and an increase in fee income from checking accounts, debit cards and the sale of investment products. That helped it absorb charges totaling almost $1 billion to cover mortgage losses, and an additional $2.3 billion in charges tied to rising legal and foreclosure costs. Revenue in its corporate banking, asset management and treasury services units also grew. Only the bank’s big credit card business, Chase Card Services, had a decline in revenue from a year ago. It fell 7 percent as a result of legislation that eliminated lucrative penalty fees and its decision to shed a risky credit card portfolio it had acquired with Washington Mutual. The rest of the banking industry has been bracing for lower top-line growth. Besides the impact of the new financial regulations, the weak job and housing markets have curtailed lending. Ultra-low interest rates are putting pressure on profit margins. And Wall Street trading revenue, which helped prop up the banks’ results in wake of the 2008 financial crisis, also has slowed. All told, revenue for the banking industry is expected to fall more than 5 percent, to about $186 billion in the second quarter, according to Trepp, a financial research firm. That would put it near 2005 levels. Second-quarter profits, however, are likely to be far more robust than a year ago — about $30.6 billion industrywide, up 41 percent. The reason is that many banks stand to benefit from the reversal of funds they had previously set aside to cover losses or legal claims. That windfall can help pad bank bottom lines, even if there is little top-line growth. In JPMorgan’s case, a $1 billion benefit from the reversal in credit card loan loss reserves contributed to about 12 percent of its second-quarter, pretax earnings. For the entire industry in the first quarter, about $12.6 billion, or roughly 43 percent of profits, came from the release of reserves. Analysts expect to see similar trends in the second quarter. Citigroup, which will report on Friday, is expected to show revenue falling about 9 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters. Net income, the analysts project, will rise about 9 percent amid lower losses on credit card and corporate loans. At Goldman Sachs, which will report on Tuesday, revenue is expected to fall about 3.5 percent from a year ago, according to analysts’ consensus estimates. Profit could rise sharply from the second quarter of 2010, when the bank took a big charges to cover the British tax on bonuses and resolve allegations by federal securities regulators that it had misled investors on a complex mortgage deal. Revenue at Bank of America, which also will report on Tuesday, was expected to drop about 15 percent, largely because of $20 billion worth of charges tied to the cleanup of its mortgage troubles, which it announced in late June. As a result, the bank warned that it would lose $8.6 billion to $9.1 billion. Some analysts suggest that JPMorgan’s strong results could be the exception rather than the rule. Much depends on how banks fare in the most unpredictable of businesses — trading. “For those who own these stocks, it was a pleasant beginning to the earnings season,” said Frederick Cannon, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. “But one point doesn’t make a line.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/business/wells-fargo-to-settle-loans-suit.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo to Settle Loans Suit<date>Published: July 7, 2011</date><text>Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $125 million to settle a lawsuit over the sale of mortgage pass-through certificates.Holders of mortgage pass-through certificates are entitled to income payments from pools of mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities. A group of pension funds brought a proposed class-action lawsuit against Wells Fargo and several underwriters in 2009, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of loans in the pools. The lawsuit originally was aimed at Wells Fargo-sponsored offerings from 2005 through 2007 worth over $67.5 billion, court papers show. A federal judge in San Jose, Calif., narrowed some of the claims against Wells Fargo last year, and dismissed claims against underwriters including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and UBS. The proposed $125 million settlement with Wells Fargo, filed on Wednesday, must be approved by the court. A Wells Fargo spokesman, Ancel Martinez, said on Thursday that the settlement did not constitute an admission of liability or of the violation of any law.

For reasons that escape me, I’ve found that bankers are often reluctant to tell small-business owners precisely what they expect from borrowers, so I couldn’t resist contributing a few questions. Hoping it might be useful to all small-business owners, I asked for specific guidelines that relate to the minimum requirements the bankers look for when considering a loan. I referred to the well known “Five Cs” of credit: character, cash flow, collateral, capital, and conditions. Basically, I asked the bankers to pretend that there were no public relations people or lawyers in the room and just tell us what they really want from us. For example, how do they define good character? Is it O.K. if you’ve been married four times? What if you don’t go to your son’s baseball games? Somehow, the bankers managed not to answer any of my questions — although they did mention that it was a good idea to clean up your credit report. Gee, thanks! I can’t tell you that I understand the downside of giving owners some real insight into what banks are looking for. Maybe the bankers don’t want to take a chance on scaring anyone away, but it seems to me it could save us all a lot of time. And judging from the comments, I’m not sure they did themselves any favors. Because I think this is important information, I asked my own banker if he could shed some light on how his bank evaluates loans. He is Matt Sloan, from American Chartered Bank, a mid-sized bank that specializes in small-business lending and has locations around Chicago. Here are his thoughts: Deciding whether to provide credit to a business can definitely be as much art as science, but there are some material factors to consider: 1. How much equity or net worth does the business have on its balance sheet? This is extremely important as we need to know what happens if the company has a rainy day or if our economy goes through another recession. Does the business have enough capital to survive if it loses a major client? On the same note, what is the overall leverage (debt to equity) of the company? Less than four to one? That’s fair. Three to one? That’s good. Two to one? Excellent. If a business makes $100,000 and the owners pull out $200,000 in distributions, then the company actually lost $100,000 from our perspective. (Believe me, we see this happen.) 2. What type of collateral is supporting the loan? I don’t see many banks providing unsecured loans in today’s climate so there have to be enough “eligible” receivables (90 days and under), “clean” inventory (sellable), equipment and/or recently appraised real estate to cover the loan amount. 3. Cash Flow. The years 2008 and 2009 were rough for many businesses, so if you were able to survive and rebound in 2010, more power to you. We analyze the past three years to understand trends, but we completely understand how difficult the economy has been. So, if a company has turned the corner and can show that its cash flow can support its debt payments at a multiple of 1.2 or 1.3 (meaning that it is taking in at least 20 percent more than the debt payment), the it is a good banking candidate. 4. Character. Do I want a new client who doesn’t return phone calls and doesn’t treat me or my team with respect? No. I want to work with solid, ethical people who are looking to build long lasting relationships. End of story. It’s better for both sides. 5. Conditions are a tricky topic because a good company can perform well in a bad economy (and vice versa). So, let’s leave that one alone. I hope this clears up some of the confusion surrounding the crazy banking environment we live in. Thank you, Matt. I will add one more thing. I found American Chartered Bank through my accountant. He knows which banks are lending, what they are like to work with and what they are looking for. And he has a relationship with the banks that the banks don’t want to mess up. If your accountant can’t help you, and you need to borrow money, it might be time to consider finding a new accountant. If you are looking to borrow money, you probably need an accountant who does more than your tax return.

Ergen, chairman of Dish Network and EchoStar, has been on a takeover spree this year, making more than $2 billion in acquisitions. Charles W. Ergen, the founder of Dish Network and EchoStar, is one step closer to building out his broadband spectrum empire. On Tuesday, the satellite operator TerreStar canceled its bankruptcy auction and declared Dish Network the winning bidder. In a court document, the company said it had not received any bids superior to Dish Network’s $1.375 billion offer. The court still needs to approve Dish Network’s bid at a hearing scheduled for July 7. Any objections to the sale must be submitted by July 5. “They have submitted what we believe to be the highest and best bid,” said Arik Preis, a lawyer for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, the law firm representing TerreStar. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Playing It Close in Wireless The addition of TerreStar will be a major coup for Mr. Ergen, who has been on a shopping spree since the start of this year. Through his companies, he has purchased DBSD North America, another bankrupt satellite operator; Blockbuster; and Hughes Communications, a satellite Internet company. Both TerreStar and DBSD own valuable sections of broadband spectrum, which could help Mr. Ergen build out communications products and services. “While this transaction is not yet complete, the news tonight brings Charlie one step closer to acquiring the ‘building blocks’ he needs to pursue a business model that is likely to create long-term value and relevance,” Marci Ryvicker, an analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a research report on Tuesday. “Combining the Terrestar spectrum (20MHz of the 2.0GHz band) with DBSD spectrum (contiguous 20MHz of the 2.0GHz band) could generate an incremental asset value of $4-5 billion,” she added, reiterating her outperform rating on Dish Network. Reuters had earlier reported news of the lack of bidders for TerreStar.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/18/your-money/mortgages/18reverse.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Biggest Banks in Reverse Mortgages Exit Business<date>Published: June 17, 2011</date><text>The nation’s two biggest providers of reverse mortgages are no longer offering the loans, as the economics of the business have come under pressure.Wells Fargo, the largest provider, said on Thursday that it was leaving the business, following the departure in February of Bank of America, the second-largest lender. With the two biggest players gone — together, they accounted for 43 percent of the business, according to Reverse Market Insight — prospective borrowers may find it more difficult to access the mortgages. Reverse mortgages allow people age 62 and older to tap what may be their biggest asset, their home equity, without having to make any payments. Instead, the bank pays the borrowers, though they continue to be responsible for paying property taxes and homeowner’s insurance. But the loans have increasingly become a riskier proposition. Banks are not allowed to assess borrowers’ ability to keep up with all their payments, and more borrowers do not have the wherewithal to stay current on their homeowners’ insurance and property taxes, both of which have risen in many parts of the country. At the same time, borrowers have been taking the maximum amount of money available, often using it to pay off any remaining money owed on the home. Yet home prices continue to slide. “We are on new ground here,” said Franklin Codel, head of national consumer lending at Wells Fargo. “With house prices falling, you reach a crossover point where they owe more than the house is worth and it creates risk for us as mortgage servicers and for HUD.” He was referring to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, whose Federal Housing Administration arm insures the vast majority of these loans through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. As a result, banks are seeing a rise in what are known as technical defaults, when homeowners fall behind on their taxes or homeowner’s insurance, both of which are required to avoid foreclosure. According to Reverse Market Insight, about 4 to 5 percent of active reverse mortgages, or 25,000 to 30,000 borrowers, are in default on at least one of those items. Bank of America, meanwhile, said that declining home values made fewer people eligible for reverse mortgages. So it decided to redeploy at least half of those working on the mortgages to its loan modification division, which has been criticized for failing to help enough homeowners on the brink of foreclosure. For Wells Fargo, however, the inability to assess borrowers’ financial health was the biggest factor for exiting the business. Anyone over the age of 62 with enough home equity can take out a reverse mortgage, regardless of their other income. The amount of money received is determined by the borrower’s age, the amount of equity in the home and prevailing interest rates. “We are not allowed, as an originator, to decline anyone,” added Mr. Codel of Wells Fargo. We “worked closely with HUD to find an alternative solution and we were unable to find one with them, which led to this outcome.” Reverse mortgage borrowers are required to pay premiums for mortgage insurance, which protects the lender if the homes are ultimately sold for less than the mortgage value, since the government is required to pay the difference to the lender. The premium rates were increased last October to account for declining home values (though one sizable upfront mortgage premium was eliminated to make the loans more attractive to certain borrowers). But lenders are responsible for making tax and insurance payments on behalf of delinquent borrowers until they submit an insurance claim to HUD, at which point the agency would be responsible since it provided the insurance against default. In January, HUD sent a letter to lenders and reverse mortgage counselors that provided guidance on how to report delinquent loans to the agency, and what steps the lenders could take to get borrowers back on track, like establishing a realistic repayment plan that could be completed in two years or less, or getting a HUD-approved mortgage counselor involved to help come up with a solution. If one cannot be reached, the lenders must begin foreclosure proceedings. Both Wells Fargo and Bank of America have said they have not foreclosed on any borrowers to date. The National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association, the industry group, said it has been working with HUD to come up with procedures that would allow lenders to assess a prospective borrower’s income and expenses, or at least require homeowners to set aside money to pay for taxes and insurance. A spokeswoman for HUD said the guidance is still being drafted. As it stands now, borrowers are required to see a HUD-approved lender before they can apply for a reverse mortgage. As part of that process, consumers are educated on the nuts and bolts of how the loans work and what their responsibilities are, including that they need to be able to continue to pay taxes, insurance and keep the property in good repair. “We don’t tell consumers what decision to make, but we do try to give them the tools to make a decision,” said Sue Hunt, director of reverse mortgage counseling at CredAbility, a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency. She added that their sessions last about an hour and 15 minutes, on average. The counselors also look at the consumer’s budget to see if it is sustainable with the mortgage, as well as what circumstances might arise that could throw the borrower off track. “Outside factors are affecting people who thought five or six years ago that they were in pretty good shape,” she added. “The world has changed a bit around them.” In days past, the borrower would get the reverse mortgage, and equity would continue to build, experts said, which would provide borrowers with more options — like refinancing — should they fall on hard times. Declining home values have changed that calculus for both bankers and consumers. Borrowers have not been able to pull out as much money. At the same time, the government has also tightened its withdrawal limits. There were a total of more than 50,000 reverse mortgages, totaling $12.66 billion, made industrywide since last October, according to HUD. Both Wells Fargo and Bank of America will continue to service their existing reverse mortgages. And the reverse mortgage association has said it will work with its members to ensure that senior citizens who need the loans can get them, though some experts said that less competition could increase certain fees. “There is a certain amount of the business done by Wells and Bank of America that happens because of their bank branches, brand names and large sales forces,” said John K. Lunde, president of Reverse Market Insight. “We would expect something more than half of their volume to be absorbed by the rest of the industry, with something less than half not happening.” Wells Fargo, which said that reverse mortgages represented 2.2 percent of its retail mortgage business, employs about 1,000 reverse mortgage workers. They are being given a chance to find other positions at the bank. Bank of America said that about half of its 600 workers have been reassigned within the bank. MetLife, the third-largest provider of reverse mortgages, declined to comment on its business.The nation’s two biggest providers of reverse mortgages are no longer offering the loans, as the economics of the business have come under pressure.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/did-wells-fargo-answer-your-lending-questions/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Did Wells Fargo Answer Your Lending Questions?<date>June 15, 2011, 7:00 am</date><text>Peter DaSilva for The New York TimesMarc Bernstein and Douglas Case, Wells Fargo’s two top executives for small-business lending. Two weeks ago, in tandem with our conversation with two Wells Fargo small-business lending officers, Marc Bernstein and Doug Case, we invited You’re The Boss readers to submit questions for the executives. Today, we present their responses. We selected the questions from the comments posted by readers. We only forwarded clear questions specifically about small-business lending (and not questions about, say, deposits or complaints about customer service), and we edited them for clarity or space. In some cases, readers posted comments that suggested interesting questions, so we formulated those and sent them to the Wells Fargo executives as well. Their answers have also been edited for space. Did they answer the questions to your satisfaction? Tell us what you think, using the comment form below. Q. Reader 7themick is very pessimistic about economic recovery and small business: “The rush to lend to this segment may result in a relapse of portfolio quality, only this time there would be no TARP because the government is out of money.” Does he have a point? If, as some economists are now predicting, we’re heading into a double-dip recession, should that mean less lending, rather than more? MR. BERNSTEIN: Yes, the economic recovery is slow, but we are lending, and more so than a year ago. We don’t foresee any substantial changes to our current lending criteria even if the economy were to weaken in the near future. But lending could be reduced if, because of the weak environment, small-business owners become more cautious about borrowing to grow their business or to make other investments or if a slower economy reduces revenues and profits for some small businesses, which also reduces their ability to support additional borrowing. Q. From Shylock: “Smaller businesses, especially those under $1 million in annual sales, are what most people I know consider ‘small business.’ What is Wells Fargo doing specifically for these smallest businesses? It seems pretty easy to show an increase in small business lending the larger you make the threshold for ‘small.’ Will you provide more detailed information on your lending to businesses under $5 million, under $1 million, and start-ups?” For more specificity, The Agenda suggests percentage changes and total loan dollars for 2009, 2010, and the first quarter of 2011 (compared to the same time last year). MR. BERNSTEIN: We take great pride in our long history of being a leading lender to America’s smallest businesses. Our industry leadership in small business is why the World Bank Group has invited Wells Fargo to work with banks in developing countries around the world. We’ve worked with banks in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and elsewhere to help bankers reach out and increase lending to the smallest businesses in their countries. There are various reports that measure banks’ lending volumes. The most relevant to your question about business size would be the federal government’s Community Reinvestment Act data. C.R.A. uses the dollar amount of the loan to determine whether it is a small business loan. For eight consecutive years, Wells Fargo is America’s No. 1 small-business lender for loans less than $100,000. In 2009 (the most recent C.R.A. data published by the government) we extended more than 630,000 loans with originations of $100,000 or less. The average loan size was about $30,000. While we do provide many start-ups with credit cards, we do not generally lend larger sums to brand new businesses. Studies show that about half of new start-ups close in their first three years, and it’s difficult to predict up front which businesses will succeed and which will fail. So we require a business to be a minimum of at least two years old before we’ll consider providing a large line of credit or loan, although we do sometimes make exceptions for customers with a strong, long-standing consumer relationship with Wells Fargo. Q. NathanielB writes that “my recent experiences with the Main Office Commercial Loan Vice President was fraught with delays, procrastinations, and an eventual response that the designated location was declared to be within a ‘no loan’ area and we had spent over three months negotiating this loan.” Does Wells Fargo really have “no loan areas,” and if so, what defines this territory? And if not — since I think no-loan areas are illegal — what do you suppose that banker might have said for this prospective borrower to construe the rejection as red-lining? MR. BERNSTEIN: We’re committed to doing what is right for our customers and upholding sound underwriting practices. Wells Fargo will only approve an application when we believe the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. We do not have “no loan areas.” Q. JRG, who seems to have experience in large-bank lending, writes about credit scoring: “Loan scoring is based on complex models that desire a certain return outcome based on assumed risk factors and loan pricing. Likely included in these models are other big picture factors such as industry and geography. A borrower can have good individual credit characteristics but if you are a general contractor in Las Vegas you could get declined for a new loan or asked to leave the bank only because the bank has too much contractor exposure in Las Vegas and want to bring that exposure down. This concept is called ‘portfolio management’ and is similar to managing concentration risk in an investment portfolio.” In our conversation you acknowledged the role such big-picture factors play in credit scoring, but is our commenter right that they could knock someone with otherwise good credit out of the running for a loan? Does Wells Fargo use credit scoring not (or not just) for determining an individual borrower’s likelihood of default but for managing the risk and return across the portfolio? Is there, in your view, a difference between the two? MR. BERNSTEIN: When considering an application for credit, we do take into account the challenges facing a given industry and the nature of the economy of a particular region. Continuing with the example in the question, contractors in Las Vegas were indeed having a very difficult time after the housing bubble collapsed – and, before granting a loan to a contractor in Las Vegas, we would want to have reason to believe that the business would be able to repay the loan to offset those very obvious risks. “Concentration risk” is a legitimate concern for lenders; however, Wells Fargo has a diversified portfolio of small-business loans in all 50 states and across hundreds of industries. In the 16 years I’ve managed our lending business for loans under $100,000, we’ve never once declined a small business loan application out of a concern that we have too many loans already in that area or that industry. Q. Reader beaconps asks, “With all this performance data, does Wells Fargo counsel any of their small business customers? Many start businesses with a skill but that skill is not business finance.” I’ll add to that: What sort of counseling does Wells Fargo make available? Is it ever mandatory? MR. CASE: Providing financial education and advice is at the center of our work at Wells Fargo. We know many business owners don’t start with a strong understanding of business finance. Our bankers can help business owners understand cash flow and credit so the owners can focus on running their businesses. We recently launched a comprehensive resource center called the Business Insight Resource Center, offering a video library covering topics from taxes and retirement to cash flow and understanding credit. The site also houses hundreds of articles and several webcasts that address a wide range of topics related to running a business. Q. Rick A recounts trying to get a $7,000 loan from Wachovia a few years ago to buy two computers for his business. “I am a sole proprietor, and in spite of having pumped several million dollars through my Wachovia checking account in the last 15 years, I was told to use my high-interest credit card.” Despite your stated commitment to loans under $100,000, is there a minimum threshold for a loan necessary to justify your bankers’ time and resources? Are standards for credit-worthiness lower, or higher, when it comes to small-dollar loans? MR. BERNSTEIN: I can’t speak to the experience you had at Wachovia several years back but what I can say is that Wells Fargo welcomes the opportunity to help you with your financial service needs, including potentially credit. Since your business finances are private and confidential, we would welcome the opportunity to connect offline so we can see what we can do to help. There’s no minimum size for us, and we do a lot of very small loans. Q. Finally, a question from a You’re The Boss colleague, Jay Goltz: “I would like you to do everyone a great service. How about a look behind the curtain? Most people do not know what a bank is looking for when they consider a loan, or they do know but they don’t know the specifics. For instance, The “Five C’s” of credit are pretty well known — character, cash flow, collateral, capital, and conditions. What are the minimal requirements you are looking for? Let’s say someone wants to borrow $100,000. The cash flow, collateral and capital are somewhat objective. That is the easier part. What about character? Does a previous bankruptcy count against them? Credit score? Doesn’t go to their kid’s baseball games? Married four times? What about conditions? From my experience, many people trying to borrow money are not even close to qualified, but they don’t know it. If you answer these questions I believe that many people will have a better idea of where they stand. Perhaps they can work toward improving their situation, or at least stop wasting time. When you answer, can you please, just for a moment, pretend that there are no lawyers or P.R. people to answer to. I’m sure everyone will appreciate it.” MR. CASE: The Five C’s help us develop a profile of the applicant. There is no specific weighting — the focus is on your ability to repay the loan. If you have derogatories on your application, such as a 60-day payment delinquency, these may hurt your chances of obtaining credit. In this case, you’ll want to work on cleaning up your credit report — both business and personal. There’s no magical formula for capital, but a substantial personal stake will help show that you’ll do everything you can to make the business successful and repay the loan. You could add a sixth “C” to this list: customer. If you have an existing relationship with us, it allows us to access more information on your character and ability to manage your financial situation. For example, establishing a deposit account with us can be an excellent way to show your cash flow firsthand.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/business/economy/06bank.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Bank Stocks Take a Beating, and It May Not Be Over<date>Published: June 5, 2011</date><text>Michael Scanlon is tempted by bank stocks, truly he is.They are cheap — selling at near their lows for the year, and trading at well below the valuation of other large companies. But Mr. Scanlon, who helps oversee $7.5 billion for the John Hancock family of mutual funds in Boston and specializes in financial companies, is not about to give in and buy more shares. “It’s just not going to be a smooth ride,” he said. “You wake up every day and there’s a new headline and a new concern.” Bank stocks took another tumble late last week after Moody’s, the credit rating firm, warned it might downgrade the debt of giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo as the government eases back on support for the sector. Even as the market absorbed that news, reports that Goldman Sachs had been subpoenaed in an investigation by the Manhattan district attorney further unnerved investors, and sent that giant investment’s bank’s shares sinking. Pessimism about the sector was reinforced by weaker-than-expected economic data, including a bleak reading on unemployment on Friday. What’s more, well-known hedge fund investors like John A. Paulson and David Tepper have been quietly selling the big positions in the sector they had earlier amassed, a sign the smart money has already begun to bail. Mr. Tepper, in particular, had made huge profits by scooping up beaten-down bank stocks when they bottomed out in late 2008 and early 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis and riding their subsequent recovery. But in the first quarter of 2011, he sold off about a third of his positions in Citigroup and Bank of America. For Mr. Tepper, the timing was impeccable. Since the beginning of April, the KBW Bank Index has dropped 8 percent, compared with a much more modest 2 percent decline in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. Last week, bank stocks sank to their lowest point since early December. For individual investors, who have long favored bank stocks as a source of dividends and at least the promise of stability, their recent performance has been a big disappointment. And few experts expect a turnaround anytime soon. “I haven’t seen investor sentiment this bad in a long time,” said Jason Goldberg, a longtime bank stock analyst at Barclays. “Not owning the group has been the right call, and people are skeptical about getting back in.” By many measures, the sector is pretty cheap. Diversified banks are trading at about 9.4 times earnings, compared with a multiple of 12.4 for the broader S.&amp; P. 500, according to FactSet Research. But then, they may deserve to be selling at a discount. Besides the worries about a possible debt downgrade and the investigations into the role they played in the financial crisis, major banks are facing headwinds on many fronts. For starters, federal regulations passed last year are set to cut deeply into revenue on everything from debit card transactions to trading on Wall Street. The restriction on debit card fees, known as the Durbin Amendment after the senator who proposed it, Dick Durbin of Illinois, could alone cost the top 25 banks roughly $8 billion in lost revenue, Mr. Goldberg said. The new regulations are set to go into effect on July 21, although Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, is pushing a proposal on Capitol Hill that could come up for a vote as early as next week that would delay their start by 15 months. Even if Mr. Tester wins a reprieve for the banks, other rules in the broader Dodd-Frank bill, which overhauled financial regulations, could cost the industry another $8 billion, according to Mr. Goldberg. In addition, new international rules now being developed to require major institutions to hold more capital as a buffer against future financial crises will also erode profitability. That is because money set aside as ballast is cash that will not be available to lend out or pay dividends or buy back stock. More than any of the changes hurtling toward them is a more fundamental problem that banks face — revenue is stuck in neutral. And a huge chunk of profits is not coming from the actual business of lending money, but instead represents gains from the release of reserves set aside in the past for possible loan losses. As these costs have eased, that money for a rainy day has fallen to the bottom line. In the first quarter of 2011, the top 20 banks earned $27.5 billion in pretax income. Nearly $11 billion, or 40 percent of that, came from the release of reserves, according to Mr. Goldberg. The proportion was even higher in the fourth quarter of 2010, when it hit 54 percent. While that money has helped camouflage anemic revenue and lackluster loan growth, it is hardly a long-term strategy for sustainable profit increases. 1 2 Next Page »Michael Scanlon is tempted by bank stocks, truly he is.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/business/03bank.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Moody’s Reviewing Credit Ratings of Major Banks<date>Published: June 2, 2011</date><text>Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday that it was reviewing the ratings of the Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup and Wells Fargo &amp; Company for possible downgrades.The banks’ current ratings are already in the middle of the investment-grade corporate credit ratings, and that is with a boost from Moody’s assumption that the federal government would prevent them from failing in a crisis. Moody’s said Thursday that this “too big to fail” assumption might no longer be true. In a statement, a Moody’s senior vice president, Sean Jones, said the Dodd-Frank Act made clear that the government “does not want to bail out even large, systemically important banking groups.” One aim of the act, signed into law last July, was to make it easier to break up large financial institutions. Moody’s currently rates Bank of America’s senior debt A2, Citigroup’s A3 and Wells Fargo’s A1. But the implied government backing pushes those ratings up. The banks may not lose all of that ratings cushion. Moody’s said improving financial strength at Citigroup and Bank of America might temper any ratings cuts. A downgrade would very likely raise the banks’ borrowing costs. In total, eight banks have assumptions of government backing that give them higher ratings. The others are the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company, the Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and the State Street Corporation. Moody’s said it continued to evaluate its assumption of federal backing for all of them.Moody’s Investors Service said Thursday that it was reviewing the ratings of the Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup and Wells Fargo &amp; Company for possible downgrades.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/smallbusiness/26sbiz.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Bankers Defend Their Small-Business Lending<date>Published: May 25, 2011</date><text>Back in the darkest days of the economic crisis, few people had anything good to say about the nation’s biggest banks, least of all small-business owners. The big banks took federal bailout money, if in some cases reluctantly, and then faced accusations of being stingy with all of that capital. Even some business owners with longstanding banking relationships reported difficulty getting new loans. Others claimed their banks had dropped them altogether.Among the institutions that took criticism was Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest United States bank and the biggest lender to small businesses. But Marc Bernstein and Douglas Case, the bank’s two top executives for small-business lending, say the criticism was misplaced. In 2010, the bank made $14.9 billion in new loans to small companies, “just shy,” as Mr. Case put it, of a $16 billion goal for the year but more than the $14.5 billion it lent in 2009. In the first quarter of this year, the bank lent $3.7 billion, a 27 percent increase over the first quarter of 2010. Wells Fargo, like many banks, defines a small business as any company with less than $20 million in annual revenue. But, said Mr. Bernstein: “Wells Fargo historically has put an awful lot of focus on lending to the smallest businesses. That’s why we’re the largest lender in loans under $100,000.” Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Case spoke recently about lending through the economic crisis and maintaining the bank’s ties with struggling — and angry — customers. This is a condensed version of the conversation. Q. Why has it been so difficult to approve loans? MR. BERNSTEIN: First of all, a lot of businesses entered the recession with a great deal of debt. There was a 33 percent increase in the small-business loan balances nationally, between 2005 and 2008. Now that had grown slowly for years, but all of a sudden banks really went hog wild in terms of loaning to small businesses. Then, in some industries we saw sales fall as much as 30 percent. Now, imagine that small-business owner: they’re carrying much more debt than they’ve ever had, sales fall 30 percent, they have negative cash flow, they’re drawing down their reserves. It is highly likely they’re not going to survive another six months or 12 months in a scenario like that, and that’s the sort of thing we were dealing with at the height of the Great Recession. There were people coming to try and borrow more, who already had no visible means of being able to pay their existing debt. Q. In the past, you have emphasized the consumer debt some of these business owners were carrying. MR. BERNSTEIN: We saw that in what I call the bubble markets — Phoenix, Las Vegas, Southern California, Florida — a lot of small-business owners borrowed against their house to do whatever. Sometimes to expand their business, sometimes to do what other consumers did, to buy boats and other things. So when the real estate market collapsed, those people were in a very precarious situation as well. Q. What happened to them? MR. BERNSTEIN: Well, many businesses have closed in the Great Recession, and many bank loans to small businesses were charged off. The good news is that increasingly the small-business owners who have survived are having an easier and easier time paying their debts. Q. How much of the Wells Fargo small-business loan portfolio had to be charged off? MR. BERNSTEIN: From what I see from industry statistics, substantially less than our competitors. If you look at Bank of America’s quarterly earning statements, you’ll see that their charge-off rates got quite high for a while. Q. Bank of America’s chief executive called his small-business portfolio a “disaster.” Was yours? MR. BERNSTEIN: Not in my mind. Without meaning to criticize one of our fellow banks, our loan losses never got anywhere near, never approached even the neighborhood that Bank of America reported. Q. Did you set a lending goal for this year? MR. BERNSTEIN: We intend and expect loans to increase, but how much will depend on the economy. That’s one of the things that surprised us last year: the economy did not recover quite as quickly as we’d hoped, and loan demand didn’t recover quite as quickly as we hoped. Q. How is your approval process different now than it was, say, a year ago? MR. BERNSTEIN: I can tell you how it’s been different from two or three years ago. We use credit scoring — Wells Fargo was the pioneer in the United States in using credit scoring for small business, and it was a way to help us make more small-business loans than we were able to make before. But we have lenders looking at more decisions than we’ve ever had lenders look at before. It’s worth the time for a lender to save applications that the scorecard says are not quite good enough, people who maybe didn’t pass the cut-off score, but are not far from it. By the same token, sometimes the lenders look at applications that score high but have some serious problem. Q. How does credit scoring work? MR. BERNSTEIN: Credit scores are developed by looking at thousands of actual experiences where lenders made loans and determining what characteristics of the applicant predicted their likelihood of default. You look at 50 or 70 characteristics or more of an applicant — variables related to credit history, and also aspects of the business itself — and then you mathematically determine how does each of those contribute to the likelihood of going to loss. Q. How often does an application that gets a second look end up getting approved? MR. BERNSTEIN: That’s proprietary, but often enough that it’s worth our while to do it, and it’s a lot of peoples’ time. Q. The financial industry market researchers Greenwich Associates surveyed small-business borrowers and found that the biggest banks not only failed to keep ties to small borrowers, they often actively severed them. Do you think Wells Fargo has to re-establish trust with the small-business marketplace? MR. CASE: We never retreated from small business. And not to talk about competitors, but if you look at different approaches to small business, some came and went, and came back again, or will need to come back again. We’ve always been dedicated to this space, and this customer segment. MR. BERNSTEIN: We are cognizant that the situation was ripe for people to feel like we weren’t serving them, and we tried to do whatever we could reasonably do to help our customers — and be very conscious of the fact even the customers we were calling to collect were often good people having tough times. Q. Do you understand why so many small-business owners seem to feel big banks got a bailout and then did nothing to help small businesses? MR. BERNSTEIN: A lot of people who frankly are not very good credit risks and who want a loan, I can understand their frustration. But Wells Fargo has been committed to small-business lending for a quite a while now, and we know here that we don’t help our customers, our communities or shareholders by declining a good loan. Q. We get a lot of comments from readers who feel they have been mistreated by their banks, and some of them name Wells Fargo. MR. BERNSTEIN: That’s hard to understand, because we’re definitely doing more small-business lending than other banks. MR. CASE: We’re doing everything we can to say yes to every single loan that’s possibly approvable.Back in the darkest days of the economic crisis, few people had anything good to say about the nation’s biggest banks, least of all small-business owners.

Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo already introduced the transfer service, called clearXchange, in Arizona, and it will roll out in more markets in coming months. It will be available nationwide within a year. The new service will improve upon banks’ existing person-to-person payment services, and it will compete directly with PayPal, which has shuttled money between consumers for years. But the banks claim that their new service will be more convenient because it cuts out the middle man: PayPal isn’t a bank, so you need to fund your account with money from a checking or other account. With the banks’ service, the money will be ferried directly from your checking account to the person you want to pay. And it doesn’t require you to dig around for a routing or other account number, as some services require. “The key thing here is that you don’t have to set up any additional accounts,” said Mike Kennedy, head of payments strategy at Wells Fargo and chairman of clearXchange. “People have a primary savings and checking account with their institution and that is what they want to transact out of.” The new service should save consumers time — though paper checks and cash still work just fine. But it’s unclear how much, if anything, it will cost. Pricing is up to each participating bank. If banks do charge for the service, you’ll have to figure out if the convenience factor makes it worthwhile. So how will it work? Let’s say you want to pay your friend back for dinner. If you both bank at any of the institutions in the network, you can reimburse your friend in a couple of ways. You can do it on the spot with your cellphone by accessing your bank’s mobile application or mobile banking site. Or, you can do it from your bank’s Web site on your computer. Either way, you would then enter their name, mobile phone number or e-mail address, and the amount you want to transfer. There’s also an optional “memo” field to note what the payment is for. After you hit send, the recipient will then get an e-mail or text message that alerts them of your payment with instructions on how to make sure it lands in the correct account. The first time they use the service, they will need to register their e-mail or phone number so it’s associated with their account. That raised several concerns in my mind: What happens if you mistype your buddy’s e-mail address or mobile phone number and the wrong person gets the message – will they be able to retrieve your money instead? Or what if someone hacks into your e-mail account and finds the note that someone wants to send you $200? In all of those scenarios, bank executives said the potential thief would need to have your online banking user name and password. If someone did manage to break into your online banking account, they could conceivably send your money to their own account. That’s not a new threat though. If a fraud were to occur, the banks said they would refund the person sending the money as soon as possible. Many banks already offer person-to-person payment services. At ING Direct, for instance, you can send money from your phone or your computer using the person’s name, e-mail address and the last four digits of their bank account number; you can save their information on a drop down menu for future payments. (ING customers with iPhones can also transfer money to one another by entering the amount in the bank’s mobile app and “bumping” their phones). But the banks that are part of the new exchange argue that their service makes the process even easier, for both senders and recipients. For instance, recipients in many existing services would need to enter their routing number on the bank site of the person sending them money. In the clearXchange system, they can retrieve their money using their own bank. The exchange hopes to lure more institutions to its service – it’s already discussing those possibilities with other big banks – which would increase the population of people who can transfer money this way. And eventually, the banks said they plan to offer the same service to customers who want to send money outside of the network. Would you use the new service? And would you pay for it?</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/business/06redlining.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Redlining Suits Against Wells Fargo Are Allowed to Proceed<date>Published: May 5, 2011</date><text>Two lawsuits accusing Wells Fargo of discriminatory lending practices have been allowed to move forward, a victory for plaintiffs that have accused the bank of steering African-Americans toward predatory loans.In one lawsuit, brought by the city of Memphis and Shelby County, Tenn., Judge S. Thomas Anderson of Federal District Court for the Western District of Tennessee on Wednesday denied a motion from Wells Fargo to dismiss, partly on the grounds that the suit was too broadly drawn. Both jurisdictions accused the lender of improperly steering African-Americans toward loan products that ultimately led to foreclosures, vacancies and increased government costs. “The City of Memphis and Shelby County have not alleged that Wells Fargo lending practices resulted in a host of social and political ills plaguing entire sections of the community,” Judge Anderson wrote in a 32-page order. “Rather plaintiffs contend that defendants have targeted individual property owners with specific lending practices (reverse redlining), resulting in specific effects (foreclosures and vacancies) at specific properties, which in turn created specific costs (services and tax revenue) for local government.” Judge Anderson’s ruling came two weeks after Judge J. Frederick Motz, of Federal District Court in Maryland denied Wells Fargo’s attempt to dismiss a similar lawsuit brought by the mayor and city council of Baltimore. Two previous versions of that lawsuit, claiming reverse redlining, in which the bank steered African-Americans toward more predatory loans, had been dismissed by the court. But this time, Judge Motz said city officials had narrowed the allegations enough to show a plausible link between Well Fargo’s actions and its impact on the city. The issue, he said, was whether “the city has plausibly alleged that the properties in question would not have become vacant but for the allegedly improper loans made by Wells Fargo.” He said the city provided the link by claiming that Wells Fargo deliberately steered African-American borrowers who qualified for prime mortgages into subprime loans. As a result, the plaintiffs claim, borrowers who could have kept up with payments on a prime loan defaulted because of the more expensive subprime payments. The city also contends that Wells Fargo approved mortgage refinancing or home equity loans for African-American borrowers even though it knew or should have known that the borrowers couldn’t afford the payments. Decades of economic gains by African-Americans in many of the nation’s cities have been reversed by unemployment and foreclosures. While many factors have contributed to the decline, some have accused the nation’s largest banks of pushing blacks toward predatory loans that ultimately led to more foreclosures and vacancies. Asked about the two recent rulings, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Teri Schrettenbrunner, said: “We disagree with these rulings, and we will present the facts which we believe will ultimately win these cases. Our team members make loan pricing decisions based on credit and transaction risks, consistently treating our customers fairly.” In its legal responses to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo had also maintained that Baltimore’s housing woes were caused by “a complex weave of social and economic factors” rather than its own lending practices.Two lawsuits accusing Wells Fargo of discriminatory lending practices have been allowed to move forward, a victory for plaintiffs that have accused the bank of steering African-Americans toward predatory loans.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/the-case-against-111-page-checking-account-disclosures/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">The Case Against 111-Page Checking Account Disclosures<date>May 5, 2011, 12:27 pm</date><text>While you are opening that new checking account, don’t forget to read the accompanying 111 pages of legal fine print that go along with it. How many pages? A new study from the Pew Charitable Trusts found that 111 pages is the median length of checking account disclosure documents given to customers by the 10 biggest banks in the United States. Often nestled in the thicket of disclosures, schedules and related addenda are rules that favor the bank over the customer. These include binding arbitration clauses, which require any dispute over the contents of the agreement to be settled by a private arbitrator — usually one picked by the bank — instead of a judge. Other versions allow customers to take their case to court, but require them to cover the bank’s costs — even if the customers are found to be in the right. An excerpt from a PNC Bank disclosure, included in the report, even states that such funds will be withdrawn from your account “without prior notice to you.” The report, on “hidden risks” in checking accounts, notes that the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has already been asked by Congress to look into such mandatory arbitration clauses. Pew recommends that the bureau require banks to summarize crucial information about fees, account terms and conditions in a short, plain-language format, similar to the so-called Schumer Box now used for credit cards. That would make it easier for consumers to compare accounts and avoid costly fees. Pew also recommends that regulators require banks to post deposits and withdrawals in an “objective” way — like chronological order — to minimize instances when banks reorder postings to increase fees from bounced checks. Most banks post checks in order of highest dollar amount to lowest, which tends to maximize the bounced check fees. Banks can also process debits to the account before posting deposits. Pew provides a clear illustration of the effect of this method, in a chart based on a recent court challenge of Wells Fargo’s daily transaction-posting policy. The chart shows that posting deposits and debits in chronological order would result in fees of $22, while Wells Fargo ordered them in a way that the customer ended up owing $88. Citibank, in a departure from its big bank peers, recently announced that it would start processing checks in in “low to high” order to minimize potential fees for overdrawn accounts. But it remains in the minority. “Since we collected our data, some banks have said they’re changing this policy,” said Eleni Constantine, director of Pew’s financial security portfolio. “But it’s voluntary. They could go back to what they were doing before, anytime they want to.” The Pew report also found that consumers are not given enough information to compare the various overdraft options — that is, protection against overdrawing your account by debits or bounced checks — offered by their banks. Usually, a transfer plan, in which funds are moved from the customer’s savings account or credit card to cover shortages in the checking account, is significantly cheaper, at about $10 a transfer. But many banks promote more expensive options in which the bank pays the shortage and charges a fee — typically $35. Have you read your checking account disclosure? Did you understand it? Did anything in it surprise you?</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/wells-fargo-profit-jumps-48/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Profit Jumps, but Revenue Falls Slightly<date>April 20, 2011, 8:58 am</date><text>Noah Berger/Bloomberg News 8:20 p.m. | Updated Wells Fargo &amp; Company posted a 48 percent increase in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, but investors were not impressed by the results, given fears that sluggish mortgage loan growth would erode the bank’s earnings power. Shares of the bank, which is based in San Francisco, fell 4.1 percent as traders looked past bottom-line earnings of $3.8 billion and focused on slow top-line growth. Revenue fell 5.2 percent to $20.3 billion as rising interest rates caused the mortgage refinancing boom to slow down. The bank, which is the nation’s biggest mortgage underwriter, said that home loan origination volume fell by more than 34 percent from the fourth quarter. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release Nonetheless, Wells Fargo beat analysts’ estimates by a penny and recorded a record profit with the help of some sophisticated financial management. The bank reduced the amount it set aside to cover future loan losses by about $3 billion from a year ago even as its pile of bad loans decreased. The reserve reduction strategy has been a favorite of the major banks this quarter, as they have all taken advantage of the improved economy to lower loan-loss provisions. That leaves more money to be counted as profit, although it can camouflage underlying weakness. Other giant banks with big Wall Street businesses were able to make up for some of the missing income with stronger results from investment banking and trading. But Wells Fargo, which is more oriented to retail banking, could not. However, Timothy J. Sloan, Wells Fargo’s newly installed chief financial officer, brushed aside concerns that Wells Fargo would be severely hurt by a fall-off in its mortgage business. “If rates go up, it is probably because the economy is going to grow,” he said in an interview. “And if the economy is growing, it’s more likely the rest of our businesses will grow.” With an improved economy, he said, he foresees a pickup in its wealth management and small business lending operations, as well as finding new profits by deploying more than $100 billion of cash it has on hand. Investors were not convinced. Wells Fargo’s stock fell $1.24, to $28.83 a share, while shares of its rivals, Bank of America, Citigroup, and JPMorgan Chase, were flat. Along with the slowdown in mortgage lending, Wells Fargo faces rising operating costs for servicing loans that are headed into foreclosure, especially after reaching a deal with federal regulators this month to increase staff levels and improve oversight. Wells Fargo said it took a quarterly charge of about $214 million on its mortgage servicing business after factoring in the higher operating expenses. The bank has strengthened internal processes and hired 1,000 staff members after adding several thousand last year. Wells also said it was setting aside an additional $472 million to cover other foreclosure expenses, like fines and litigation costs. That is up from about $193 million in the fourth quarter. Like the other big banks, Wells Fargo may be required to buy back bad loans it sold to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other private investors. In the first quarter, the bank set aside $249 million to cover future repurchases, after setting aside $464 million in the fourth quarter. Still, the spill of red ink has slowed. Although the housing market and broader economy remain fragile, Wells Fargo said it had released $1 billion from its loan loss reserves in the first three months of the year and expected to continue drawing down its reserves in the coming quarters. “We wanted to see more sustained performance in the improvement of the portfolio,” Mr. Sloan said. “We have seen that trend continue.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/realestate/commercial/13charlotte.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Charlotte Looks to a Future Based Less on Banking<date>Published: April 12, 2011</date><text>CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Just a few years ago, this city had placed all its eggs in the banking basket, becoming a regional powerhouse and a symbol of the New South after a series of mergers and acquisitions that resulted in the financial titans Bank of America and Wachovia.Bank of America’s 50-story headquarters, Charlotte’s tallest building when it was completed in 1993, was to be joined by a similarly sized home for Wachovia. But the economic convulsions of late 2008 intervened. Almost overnight, Wachovia became a subsidiary of Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco. Its unfinished tower, including three museums and a theater at its base, was briefly christened the Wells Fargo Cultural Center. Wells Fargo then negotiated a deal with Duke Energy to give the utility about 500,000 square feet of space on 21 floors in the building, which was finished last year and is now known as the Duke Energy Center. The lease, and the construction of two other new buildings in the city’s central business district, known as Uptown, point to a more diversified future for the city. One of the other tenants in the tower is Cassidy Turley, the city’s fourth-largest property management firm. Maxwell Hanks, a senior vice president, said Charlotte has had to adjust to a new array of realities: a 13.5 percent office vacancy rate, nearly three million square feet of vacant space and a banking-based economy that was diversifying rapidly into military and energy. “I find myself in the psychology business these days — of managing expectations for both landlords and tenants,” Mr. Hanks said in his office on the 34th floor. “The market has changed. There’s more supply, weaker demand and greater vacancy. But there are more concessions too.” The Duke Energy Center — or the Tower of Power as some call it — has 1.3 million square feet over 48 stories and is now 97 percent occupied. The Duke name has transformed it into a symbol not only of Charlotte’s ability to weather a severe financial downturn, but also of a regional economy that is moving beyond banking and into other industries. “The city fathers took a body blow in 2008,” said Tom Shiel, the communications manager of Duke Energy. “They took an eight count, then asked what they could do to prevent that from ever happening again.” They began by focusing on industry sectors that had been recruited in previous years and were growing, like military contracting and aerospace. One contractor, Goodrich, had established its headquarters in Charlotte in 1999, while General Dynamics, which is based in Virginia, moved executive offices for its armament and technical products division here in 2004. Last year, BAE Systems of Britain, whose United States unit is based in Arlington, Va., committed to opening a human resources and finance center in Charlotte, creating 176 jobs. Also on their radar screen was the energy sector. Already, the Shaw Group and Areva were among about 50 such companies clustered in and around the city. Then last June, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, the energy engineering company based in Lynchburg, Va., moved its headquarters and 130 jobs here. More significantly Duke Energy is now poised to lay claim to the title of the nation’s largest electric utility, pending approval of its $13.7 billion acquisition, not including debt, of Progress Energy of Raleigh, N.C. Recently, Duke’s chief executive, James E. Rogers, told The Financial Times that the deal would put the company in a stronger position for further consolidation. “Usually when you go to a major city, all the tall buildings are the banks,” said Clark Gillespy, vice president of economic development at Duke Energy. “I’ve never been to a city where it’s the energy company. Here, it’s because Rogers has driven a stake in the ground and said it’s the energy sector that’s going to lead us out of this recession.” That may take a while. Vacancy rates have been steadily increasing since a low of 2.5 percent in 2008, rising this year by almost a full percentage point over 2010’s rate of 12.7 percent. The last time Charlotte was bumping this long and low across the bottom was 1993. Then, two bank chief executives, Hugh McColl of NationsBank and Edward E. Crutchfield of First Union, set out on a nationwide tear of acquisitions that eventually formed Bank of America and Wachovia, respectively the nation’s largest and fourth-largest banks. “They really got traction back then,” Mr. Hanks said. “It took about 24 months from that downturn to get back to single digits.” But in 1993, Uptown Charlotte consisted of just 10 million square feet of commercial space. In 2011, it covers 22 million, much of that available because banks are giving up third-party space and heading back to buildings they own. That leaves a lot of empty offices — about 2.8 million square feet — much of it Class A space. Mr. Hanks said the Duke Energy Center was one of two new buildings he would characterize as “Super-A” space — because it was LEED platinum certified by the United States Green Building Council and dominated the city skyline. The other is the recently completed 32-story Bank of America Center, now 95 percent under lease. Nearby is the new Nascar Plaza office tower, with 230,000 of its total 390,000 square feet available — all of it Class A space and much of it contiguous. Effective leasing rates are estimated at 15 to 25 percent lower than they were four years ago. The remaining Super-A space — a little under 100,000 square feet between the two high-rises — can be had for $28 to $34 a square foot, Mr. Hanks said. The Uptown area has 1.6 million square feet of Class A space commanding $23 to $28 a square foot, and 1.1 million square feet of Class B space that runs $18 to $23 a square foot. Charlotte’s changes will be on display to the world in September 2012, when the Democratic Party holds its convention here. It is expected to bring in 35,000 visitors and generate $150 million. Mr. Hanks predicted that companies would like what they saw during the convention. “It will be enticing for a top-tier company to come in and reboot in a New South city,” he said. “With the convention in 2012, companies will come in, like it and stay.”CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Just a few years ago, this city had placed all its eggs in the banking basket, becoming a regional powerhouse and a symbol of the New South after a series of mergers and acquisitions that resulted in the financial titans Bank of America and Wachovia.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/wells-fargo-will-test-chip-cards-for-travelers/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Will Test Chip Cards for Travelers<date>April 13, 2011, 3:23 pm</date><text>Updated | April 14, 2011 Yesterday we reported on the slowness of big U.S. banks, compared with smaller credit unions, to offer their customers debit and credit cards with newer, more secure processing chips that are in wide use in Europe and often cause card acceptance problems for American travelers. Today, Wells Fargo said it would test credit cards this year with the newer technology, known as E.M.V., with about 15,000 American-based but globetrotting customers. (A tip of the hat to American Banker for the news.) Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance, which promotes the cards, said the move was heartening because it was likely that more big banks would follow suit after a major player like Wells entered the market. JPMorgan Chase also said this week that it would start offering some customers a credit card with the E.M.V. chip.  In June, the bank will offer the chip cards to holders of its Palladium Visa, which is typically issued to private and commercial banking customers who tend to travel  a lot, said Laura Rossi, a Chase spokeswoman.  But within the year, chip-card versions of some other Chase cards will be available,  too. U.S. banks still issue debit and credit cards with older, less secure magnetic stripe technology, which is more prone to fraud like skimming. Plus, Americans sometimes have had trouble using the cards when traveling overseas, often with ticket kiosks and other unattended payment sites, like gas pumps. Wells Fargo is testing Visa Smart Cards, which will have the new chips as well as the older, magnetic stripe technology, so they can be used in the United States as well as abroad. Most domestic retailers lack the correct readers to process payments with cards using the newer chips, so the cards must carry both systems. “By combining traditional magnetic stripe along with the E.M.V. chip technology, we hope our customers will have the convenience to use their credit card no matter where they are in the world,” said Eric Schindewolf, vice president of product development for the bank’s consumer credit card business, in a prepared statement. Eligible customers have been identified based on their “frequent international travel history,” a bank spokeswoman said in an e-mail. They will be notified in the “near future” and receive their cards by midsummer. They can opt out of the pilot if they choose. Right now, the bank isn’t testing the technology with debit cards, she said, but it could down the road if the pilot went well and the bank found “broad customer demand.” The Chase version is different in that while it uses E.M.V. chips, it is a “signature” card — meaning that holders sign for their purchase, instead of entering a PIN  number as they do with  the “chip and PIN” cards dominant in Europe. (Users don’t have to sign, however, at unattended kiosks.) The chip-and-signature version has the same security features as chip-and-PIN, said Ms. Rossi, the Chase spokeswoman, but has the added benefit of being widely used in Asia as well. Would you find it more useful to have a credit card or debit card with the new technology? Which do you use more when traveling? Updated to add news that JPMorgan Chase will offer chip credit cards too.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/citis-new-policy-may-mean-fewer-bounced-checks/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Citi's New Policy May Mean Fewer Bounced Checks<date>April 7, 2011, 12:50 pm</date><text>Citibank says it will change the way it processes customers’ checks, a move that could result in fewer fees for bounced checks for account holders. Customers are being notified this week in their bank statement mailings that as of July 25, the bank will process checks in order of “low to high”—that is, it will pay checks in order of smallest dollar amount to the largest. Currently, Citibank — as do most banks — pays checks in order of highest dollar amount to the lowest. The thinking has been that big checks are often covering important bills like mortgage or car payments. The method, though, tends to maximize fees for bounced checks and has long been criticized by consumer advocates. Cece Stewart, Citibank’s president of consumer and commercial banking, writing in a company memo this week, gave the example of a customer with $100 in a checking account who wrote three checks, for $90, $35 and $25. Currently, the bank would pay the $90 check first, leaving insufficient funds to cover the second two, resulting in two fees of $34 each — $68 total. Under the new system, the bank will process the $25 and $35 checks first. The $90 check would still bounce, but the customer would face just one $34 fee. “We think this is the right thing to do and we believe we are the first major bank to do it,” Ms. Stewart wrote. The Center for Responsible Lending says on its Web site that the change makes Citibank “unusually active among our nation’s largest banks in voluntarily reforming” its overdraft practices. “We think it’s a really big deal,” says Rebecca Borne, a senior policy analyst at the center. “Finally, a large bank has acknowledged what we think is the reality, that low to high is best for customers.” Citibank has never charged overdraft fees for debit card transactions or A.T.M. withdrawals, according to Ms. Stewart. Rather, the bank simply declines those transactions if an account balance is too low. Wells Fargo and Bank of America currently pay checks from high to low, but have bowed to consumer concerns by reducing the maximum number of overdraft fees to four a day from 10. Both banks charge $35 for each overdraft, so that’s still a potentially hefty $140 a day. Since customers write fewer checks these days, however, paper checks are often less of a concern than fees charged when debit card purchases push accounts past their limits. Someone sitting in a coffee shop for a few hours, paying for snacks and refills, could potentially do some real damage if the balance dips too low. Last summer, Bank of America began declining debit card transactions if they exceeded the account’s funds, instead of letting them go through and then charging a fee. Wells Fargo currently gives customers the option — required by federal regulators — of having debit transactions declined or having them go through, with a fee, if their balance is too low. (Even if the customer has given permission to be charged overdraft fees, thought, the bank still won’t impose more than four.) Wells Fargo says it will make changes later this spring to the way it processes some payments. Currently, all categories of deductions are processed at the end of the day and paid in high-to-low order. But as of May 16, the bank will take a hybrid approach. Paper checks and automatic deductions — like preauthorized monthly student loan payments — will still be paid from high to low. But the bank will process A.T.M. withdrawals, debit card purchases and online bills chronologically, in the order received. (JPMorgan Chase has followed a similar approach for about a year, a spokesman said). If for some reason a specific transaction time isn’t available, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Richele Messick, said, the bank will process such debits in order of low to high. “These changes are going to help simplify processes and benefit customers,” Ms. Messick said. What do you think? Would you rather see one standard for charging overdraft fees, or do you prefer letting banks set their own policies?</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/business/06wachovia.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Settlement With S.E.C. Over Overpriced Wachovia C.D.O.’s<date>Published: April 5, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Even as Wall Street churned out mortgage-backed securities and derivatives in 2006, the sellers of the often-convoluted packages sometimes knew that parts of the deals — namely those that they could not sell — were worth far less than face value.So it seemed reasonable in October 2006, when Wachovia Capital Markets, after failing to find a buyer for a tranche of a collateralized debt obligations known as Grand Avenue II, listed the securities on its books at 52.7 cents on the dollar. Four months later, with the mortgage market starting to collapse, Wachovia sold those same securities to the Zuni Indian Tribe for 90 to 95 cents on the dollar. A year later, the deal went into default, and the tribe and other investors lost millions. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that it had approved an $11 million settlement for a securities fraud complaint related to the Grand Avenue II deal and a second derivatives transaction with a subsidiary of Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008 as the troubled bank neared collapse. “Wachovia caused significant losses to the Zuni Indians and other investors by violating basic investor protection rules,” Robert Khuzami, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said in a statement. The rules, he added, include “don’t charge secret excessive markups, and don’t use stale prices when telling buyers that assets are priced at fair market value.” Without admitting wrongdoing, Wells Fargo Securities agreed to pay a disgorgement of $6.75 million and a civil penalty of $4.45 million, the S.E.C. said, with $7.4 million going to a fund to be distributed to investors who had lost money on the two transactions. In a second deal involving a C.D.O., called Longshore 3, Wachovia Capital Markets falsely told investors that it had acquired some of the assets “on an arm’s-length basis,” and at “fair market prices.” In fact, the S.E.C. said, Wachovia “transferred these assets at stale prices in order to avoid losses on its own books.” In a statement, Well Fargo said: “The settlement relates to actions taken by Wachovia in 2007 in the early days of the credit crisis. The issues presented here were complex, and Wells Fargo is pleased to have resolved this matter with the S.E.C.” In its order outlining the case, the S.E.C. documents numerous instances of conduct that could only have been performed by individuals who worked for Wachovia — marking up the value of the Grand Avenue securities by 70 percent, or approving the false and misleading disclosure that the Longshore securities were acquired “on an arms-length basis” and “at fair market prices.” But no individuals were included in the complaint, or even named, in the S.E.C.’s cease and desist order or the settlement. Both the Zuni Indian Tribe, whose reservation is in Arizona and western New Mexico, and an individual investor who bought a substantial share of the transaction, bought the Grand Avenue securities at an inflated price through a Wachovia broker in El Paso, Tex., the S.E.C. said A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, Mary Eshet, declined to comment on whether any of the people involved in the C.D.O. sales still worked for Wells Fargo. Regarding the lack of charges against individuals, she pointed to a footnote in the S.E.C.’s order that says C.D.O.’s trade infrequently and are not listed on an exchange, making current prices “not readily discoverable.” Lorin L. Reisner, deputy director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, said that “it’s reasonable to assume that we look very carefully at the involvement of individuals” in cases like this. He said the S.E.C. had filed complaints against individuals in several cases related to the financial crisis, including senior executives of Countrywide Financial, New Century Financial and IndyMac Bancorp. The S.E.C. complaints were brought by the enforcement division’s structured and new products unit, one of four new enforcement offices created by Mr. Khuzami after he took over as agency’s top enforcer in February 2009.WASHINGTON — Even as Wall Street churned out mortgage-backed securities and derivatives in 2006, the sellers of the often-convoluted packages sometimes knew that parts of the deals — namely those that they could not sell — were worth far less than face value.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/s-p-warns-about-excessive-bank-dividends/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">S.&amp;P. Warns About 'Excessive' Bank Dividends<date>March 24, 2011, 5:55 pm</date><text>Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg News Standard &amp; Poor’s issued a warning on Thursday to big banks itching to increase their dividends: proceed with caution. S.&amp;.P., one of the three largest credit rating agencies, said in a report that it “remains wary of banks aggressively increasing capital returns to shareholders at this juncture of the economic recovery.” S.&amp;.P. indicated it might downgrade credit ratings at banks that made “excessive” payouts to investors. Several big banks unveiled plans in recent days to raise their dividends and buy back stock for the first time since the financial crisis. They did so soon after getting the green light from the Federal Reserve, which recently completed a second round of stress tests on the nation’s 19 biggest banks. On the heels of receiving its stress test score, JPMorgan Chase said it would buy back stock worth $15 billion and raise its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, up from 5 cents. Last Friday, Goldman Sachs said it would pay back the $5 billion it received from Warren E. Buffett at the peak of the financial crisis. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Regulators waited for the banks to rebuild their capital levels and profit before blessing the payouts. But S.&amp;.P. still sees room for improvement. Banks need an 8 percent risk-adjusted capital ratio to weather another economic meltdown, the report said. The average bank in the United States featured a 7.6 percent rate in late 2010. “We are therefore wary of a bank’s possible decision to return a large portion of capital to shareholders in 2011,” the report said. S.&amp;.P. is particularly concerned about the payouts “in light of continuing global macroeconomic issues,” citing the recent rise in oil prices and the earthquake in Japan. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are in the safety zone, with risk-adjusted capital levels of 8.2 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively. But several banks that rushed to announce dividend bumps fall below the 8 percent threshold. State Street’s risk-adjusted capital ratio is 6.2 percent. The bank plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 18 cents, up from a penny. S.&amp;.P.’s report does not object to such “modest” dividends bumps. It instead raised concerns about share buybacks and special dividends. BB&amp;T has announced a modest 1 cent dividend increase and a 1 cent special dividend, effective May 2. Wells Fargo plans to issue a special dividend of 7 cents. State Street plans to buy back about $600 million worth of stock. The report warned that “excessive” special dividends and stock repurchases “could hinder the ability to build additional needed capital.” The report did not define “excessive” and did not call out any banks by name for drafting imprudent capital plans. Of course, not every bank has the luxury of returning capital to shareholders. The Fed, for instance, put the kibosh on Capital One’s dividend plans. The Fed also objected to Bank of America’s plans to award a “modest” dividend increase in the second half of 2011. The bank, which currently issues a token dividend of a penny a share, plans to tweak and resubmit its proposal in the coming months.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/business/27gret.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">In a Mortgage Case, a 7-Year Wait for 2 Answers<date>Published: February 26, 2011</date><text>WHEN Zella Mae Green of Georgia filed for bankruptcy to save her home from foreclosure in 2004, she and her lawyer wanted to know two things: Did she actually owe any back payments on her mortgage? And, if so, to whom?It didn’t seem like a lot to ask. But until last week, those questions had been unanswered for seven years. Mortgages are complicated to begin with, of course. But when homeowners fall behind on their payments, the situation becomes far more complicated. Recurring fees and charges muddle the accounting. That banks routinely transfer the notes underlying a property can make things cloudier still. But how Ms. Green’s case became her personal version of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the endless lawsuit at the center of the Charles Dickens novel “Bleak House,” is a story for our times. The conflicting claims made over the years by employees and representatives of Wells Fargo, which says it holds the note on her property, are enough to make your head spin. Wells Fargo and Ms. Green didn’t exactly agree on how much she owes on her mortgage. Ms. Green took out a $40,250 mortgage in 1988, never refinanced and figured she is four payments behind. Wells Fargo contended that she owes 113 back payments, totaling more than $48,000. Ms. Green said she would have given up years ago if it weren’t for her lawyer. She would have forfeited her two-bedroom home in Decatur to one of the three institutions that have claimed — at the same time, mind you — to hold title to it. “It’s been a big mess for a long time,” she said in a recent interview. Howard Rothbloom, a foreclosure defense lawyer in Marietta, Ga., represents Ms. Green. “The point of this whole case is that inaccurate, incomplete and conflicting information has been provided to Ms. Green over the course of seven years,” he said. “Determining the balance due on her loan should not have to be so difficult.” THE whole episode makes you wonder, yet again, how many of the millions of foreclosures in recent years might have been based on questionable accounting or improper practices by loan servicers. Years ago, Ms. Green, a widowed seamstress, ran into trouble on her mortgage several times. In the early to mid-1990s, after she was laid off and had to undergo an expensive emergency medical treatment, she filed for bankruptcy four times to hold on to her house. Georgia is a nonjudicial foreclosure state, and filing for bankruptcy lets borrowers keep their homes and work out a payment program overseen by a judge. In the late 1990s, payment records show, Ms. Green got her mortgage back on track for about five years. Then a previous loan servicer began misapplying some of her payments, Mr. Rothbloom said. In January 2004, he took her case, filing a bankruptcy proceeding to stave off a foreclosure. Wells Fargo took over servicing Ms. Green’s loan in May 2004. Mr. Rothbloom kept trying to determine who owned the loan and how much Ms. Green owed so that they could complete her case. “We filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to cure the arrearage, and we could never get a clear answer or supported answer as to what that arrearage was,” he said. “Bankruptcy rules require supporting documentation.” Since then, he said, Ms. Green, 71, has paid her loan on schedule to a unit of Wells Fargo. After two years passed, Mr. Rothbloom still had not received a complete and accurate accounting of Ms. Green’s loan. So he filed suit in May 2006 to determine who owned the note on her property. Because three institutions claimed ownership but none could produce the original note, Mr. Rothbloom began conducting discovery. During this exercise, three different Wells Fargo employees made three different representations to the court about the whereabouts of the note. Story No. 1: The note was lost. Wells Fargo’s lawyers produced a sworn statement to that effect made on Oct. 20, 2004, by Lisa Joseph, a Wells Fargo employee. But that affidavit was incomplete. The section where Ms. Joseph was supposed to describe the diligent search she had conducted to find the note was blank. The document also said that a copy of the mortgage was attached. It wasn’t. Hoping to verify that no one else might be holding the supposedly lost note, Mr. Rothbloom asked for Ms. Joseph’s deposition. Wells Fargo’s lawyers refused to supply her address. Instead, the bank produced an employee who knew nothing about the loss of the note or what Ms. Joseph had done to try to find it. It was during that interview, in July 2006, that Story No. 2 emerged. The Wells employee said that the note had never been transferred to the bank, ergo, Wells could not have lost it, as Ms. Joseph had previously sworn. Two months later, Wells filed a brief conceding that it did not own a security interest in Ms. Green’s loan but asking the court to dismiss Ms. Green’s suit. The court refused. Late last month came Story No. 3. Wells told the court that it had found the missing note. It sits in the bank’s files in Maryland. Over almost seven years, Wells Fargo employees swore to three different stories about the note on Ms. Green’s property. When asked two weeks ago how this could be, a spokeswoman for the bank said: “We regret any difficulties our customer experienced in this circumstance. This is the kind of situation we seek to avoid, and we are working on this customer’s situation to reach a solution.” Late last week, Wells Fargo agreed to a settlement with Ms. Green. The terms are confidential. The deal came shortly after the United States Trustee, the unit of the Justice Department that oversees the nation’s bankruptcy courts, indicated it was interested in the facts of the case. Fascinating how quickly these things get resolved when some daylight shines in.WHEN Zella Mae Green of Georgia filed for bankruptcy to save her home from foreclosure in 2004, she and her lawyer wanted to know two things: Did she actually owe any back payments on her mortgage? And, if so, to whom?</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EED8123FF935A15751C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Inquiries May Bring Big Fines, Banks Say<date>Published: February 26, 2011</date><text>Several big banks warned investors on Friday that they could face sizable financial penalties as a result of state and federal investigations into abusive mortgage practices. The disclosures by Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup came after a furor late last year over how foreclosures were being conducted. Until now, the banks have emphasized that the foreclosure controversy was mostly a threat to their reputation, rather than a financial worry. But the disclosures, made in the banks' annual financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, suggest that a settlement with the government may affect both. State attorneys general and federal regulators began examining the servicers' practices last fall after reports that some foreclosures were being pursued despite lost or missing documents. In other cases, employees had signed off on thousands of pages of paperwork a month, after only a cursory look. In some cases, banks mistakenly pursued homeowners who should not have been threatened with foreclosure, while other mortgage holders reported it to be nearly impossible to reach anyone at the banks to discuss their situation. The review also includes more basic practices, including scrutiny of whether the original loans were made properly and whether modifications of existing home loans have been done fairly. ''The current environment of heightened regulatory scrutiny has the potential to subject the corporation to inquiries or investigations that could significantly adversely affect its reputation,'' Bank of America said in the filing. The state and federal inquiries ''could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies (including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs,'' Bank of America said. Wells Fargo said in its filing that it was ''likely that one or more of the government agencies will initiate some type of enforcement action,'' including possible ''civil money penalties.'' Citigroup acknowledged that federal and state regulators were investigating its foreclosure processes, which could result in increased expenses, fines and other legal remedies like a program to reduce the principal amount owed on some loans. While Citigroup has determined that ''the integrity of its current foreclosure process is sound and there are no systemic issues,'' it warned that it could be adversely affected by industrywide regulatory or judicial action. Since last fall, a task force of federal bank regulators has been reviewing the foreclosure practices and internal controls of the 14 largest mortgage servicers. The examination has already identified a range of sloppy practices at all the servicers, including inadequate staffing, lax oversight of outside law firms and other vendors hired to assist with the foreclosure process, and errors with documentation. In testimony before a Senate banking committee last week, John Walsh, the acting comptroller of the currency, which oversees national banks, said his agency and other federal regulators had ordered the servicers to take corrective actions. The banks have not yet received any formal proposals from either the attorneys general or the regulators. But a proposed settlement is expected to be ironed out in the coming weeks and then presented to the banks. The banks are eager to put the foreclosure controversy behind them. Earlier this month, Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said the bank was creating a special unit to hold billions of dollars in defaulted mortgages and other toxic debt. Despite reports in recent days that a global settlement of the mortgage accusations was being floated by the Obama administration, for $20 billion or more, some bank officials and regulators expressed skepticism Friday that the eventual hit to the banks will be that high. Indeed, many regulators in Washington are wary of too punitive a settlement for fear of hobbling their recovery just as they are turning around. Memories of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 and the subsequent federal bailout are still vivid. Still, even if any settlement with regulators and the attorneys general does not run into the tens of billions, the financial consequences of the housing boom and subsequent bust will haunt the banks for years. Private investors are seeking to force financial institutions to buy back tens of billions of dollars' worth of mortgages in default, arguing the original loans were made improperly. Over the last year, the biggest banks have set aside several billion dollars each to cover potential claims stemming both from the foreclosure mess and lawsuits by private investors holding soured mortgages. On Friday, Elijah E. Cummings, a Maryland Democrat who is a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, requested information from 11 mortgage servicers and foreclosure specialists as part of a separate Congressional investigation. He also requested special reviews of servicer abuse claims, as well as the actions of law firms specializing in foreclosures. A hearing is scheduled for March 8 in Baltimore. Ben Protess contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Now it is up to an unwieldy council of regulators to set the parameters of that loophole. They will do that by defining the term “qualified residential mortgage.” If a loan is a Q.R.M., as bankers now refer to such loans, then it can be sold to investors without the lender retaining any risk. Much of the banking industry has been pushing for an expansive definition that would leave few, if any, conventional loans subject to the skin-in-the-game requirement. To hear them tell it, there is virtually no way that any bank would make a mortgage loan at a reasonable rate if it had to share in any losses. “The potential impact on the availability of credit stemming from the Q.R.M. risk-retention exemption cannot be overestimated,” John A. Courson, the president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, wrote in a letter to regulators. “Few loans to ordinary customers are likely to be made outside the Q.R.M. construct; the loans that are made will be costlier and likely to be made only to more affluent customers.” In other words, Congress did not know what it was doing when it mandated the retention of risk, and the regulators should spare us such folly. If bankers had their way, only loans that were negatively amortizing, or had balloon payments, would be excluded. You could buy a house with no money down, so long as you took out mortgage insurance. Even interest-only loans would be acceptable in some instances, and what few rules there were could be circumvented because bankers would be given discretion when applying the rules. It now appears the regulators will not go nearly that far. According to people knowledgeable about the discussions, the regulators are likely to propose that the definition allow only loans with a down payment of at least 20 percent. Adjustable-rate loans would be permitted, but there would be limits on how large an adjustment would be allowed. These people spoke on the condition that they not be named. One provision likely to set off controversy is a limit on how that 20 percent down payment is obtained. The buyer would have to put up at least half of it — 10 percent of the purchase price — from his or her own holdings. The rest could be a gift, from parents, for instance, but it could not come from seller concessions or from borrowing. Mortgage insurance would not enable a nonqualifying loan to become qualifying. The regulators hope the result of this will be two vibrant mortgage markets, with a substantial share of mortgages in each market. If a qualified mortgage is defined too broadly, there would be few other loans made, and even fewer of them would be able to be packaged in securities, when and if a private-label market for those securities begins to function again. Without enough available loans, no such market would be likely to develop. The bankers’ solid front on the issue was shattered by Wells Fargo, which suggested that only loans with a 30 percent down payment — a 70 percent loan-to-value ratio — should qualify. Other bankers were horrified. In an interview, John P. Gibbons, an executive vice president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said he thought “skin in the game” made sense and would make it more likely that private investors would again be willing to invest in mortgage securities that did not have a government guarantee. “You gain confidence when you go to a restaurant and see an owner is eating his own food,” he said. That was the view of Barney Frank, the Massachusetts congressman whose name is attached to the law. “We’re basically saying now, ‘You’ve got to keep 5 percent of that,’ ” he said after the law was passed. “That way we’ll just get better-quality loans made in the future.” One reason some lenders oppose skin in the game is that they do not have enough capital to cushion the additional risk. Those not affiliated with depository institutions are not used to keeping loans on their books, and a requirement that they do so could reduce the amount of competition. That could help well-capitalized banks, like Wells Fargo, the largest mortgage lender in the country. According to Mortgage Daily, a trade publication, Wells Fargo had a 25 percent market share for mortgage loans made in 2010. The group of regulators, which includes the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulatory agencies, as well as the agency that supervises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, must also decide just what constitutes “skin in the game.” The law says banks should keep a 5 percent stake, but it does not say how that should be calculated. 1 2 Next Page »When the mortgage securitization market collapsed amid a flood of defaults and foreclosures — many of them on loans that should not have been made — the cry arose for lenders to have “skin in the game.” To properly align incentives, the argument went, those who make loans must suffer if the loan goes bad.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/10/business/10views.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Toronto Exchange Merger May Be Capitalist Test for Canada<date>Published: February 9, 2011</date><text>More than the queen’s visage on their money binds the financial centers of London and Toronto. They are two of the world’s preferred destinations for raising capital in the mining and metals businesses. So sort of a merger of equals, like the one announced by the TMX Group and the London Stock Exchange, carries strong industrial logic.But without a premium offered to shareholders of TMX, the $3 billion operator of the Toronto bourse, there’s still a chance for interlopers from New York, Chicago or Asia to spoil the royal wedding. That would put Canada’s already-questionable capitalist credentials to the test. Under the announced deal, TMX shareholders will own around 45 percent of the combined group, have seven of 15 board seats and divvy up the executive roles. The combination will boast the largest collection of public mining companies, ranging from global heavyweights like Xstrata, Rio Tinto and the soon-to-be public Glencore to the smaller, riskier enterprises that have sought comfort on Toronto’s Venture Exchange and in Bay Street’s system of financiers focused on natural resources. It is this specialization that makes TMX attractive — and that could entice deeper-pocketed rivals like NYSE Euronext (should its merger talks with Deutsche Börse collapse), Nasdaq OMX, the CME Group of Chicago or the Hong Kong exchange, whose allure as a mining marketplace has won it recent prominent listings. Moreover, it’s not obvious that a deal with London would yield more cost savings than the alternatives. NYSE-Deutsche Börse is projecting cost cuts seven times greater than the £35 million ($56 million) on offer from the Anglo-Canadian duo. The question is whether money would be allowed to do the talking. TMX shareholders might prefer a juicy cash offer to a no-premium takeover by an Anglo-Italian-Emirati-Qatari consortium run by a Frenchman. But any buyer seeking more than 10 percent must receive approval from Ontario and Quebec securities regulators and the federal government. Just three months ago, Ottawa rejected BHP’s bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan for reasons that it has still not entirely articulated. If the Canadian government thinks a hole in the ground is worthy of such capitalism-crushing protection, don’t expect its premier financial exchange to go to the highest bidder. Openness at Wells Wells Fargo has never been particularly cuddly with shareholders. So its executives ought not to be shocked that the unexpected, unexplained resignation of Howard Atkins, the chief financial officer, knocked $5 billion off its value Wednesday and nudged it off its perch as the most valuable bank in America ahead of JPMorgan Chase. Now that it has joined the big leagues, Wells Fargo needs to be a better communicator. The $173 billion California bank has never been a fan of public back-and-forth. Its executives refused to take questions on quarterly earnings calls until recently and would prerecord their statements. Both the current chief executive, John Stumpf, and his predecessor, Richard Kovacevich, were outspoken in their criticism of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the 2009 stress tests. But those remarks probably appealed to their peers and were made in what was thought to be a private setting. Moreover, Mr. Atkins was for a decade the face of the bank for shareholders. He was the one to explain why investors shouldn’t be overly concerned about its portfolio of mortgage assets, including hundreds of billions of dollars of home equity loans and other risky assets it assumed when regulators gave it approval to acquire Wachovia during the depths of the financial crisis. Executives resign for all sorts of reasons. But Mr. Atkins’s abrupt departure is potentially unsettling. He will take unpaid leave for several months before officially retiring — an odd sequence, even if it might put him in line for a bigger pension. Yet the bank isn’t offering much besides crumbs of explanation: it said his retirement is for personal reasons that have nothing to do with the company’s financial condition or financial reporting. Wells’s statement contained little of the praise typical when long-serving executives leave. That’s strange given the importance of Mr. Atkins’s financial role at a systemically critical banking giant. Wall Street was more effusive. “We viewed Atkins as one of the more respected C.F.O.’s in the business,” a Barclays analyst wrote in a report. If Wells wants Wall Street to accept what it says without the skepticism in evidence on Wednesday, it may just have to display a bit more openness.

The bank, which is based in San Francisco, earned $3.4 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $2.8 billion, or 8 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, matching analysts' forecasts. For the year, Wells Fargo reported net income of $12.36 billion in 2010, compared with $12.28 billion in 2009. The bank's full-year revenue fell to $85 billion, however, from $88.7 billion in 2009, as new federal regulations limited the overdraft fees that banks can charge on checking accounts. Still, compared with the third quarter, the bank generated revenue growth in roughly two-thirds of its businesses. ''As the U.S. economy showed continued signs of improvement, our diversified model continued to perform for our stakeholders, as demonstrated by growth in loans and deposits, solid capital levels and improving credit quality,'' John G. Stumpf, the bank's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Despite its heavy hand in the lending industry, which has been hit by losses for three years, Wells Fargo has quietly emerged from the financial crisis as one of the nation's strongest banks. The report from Wells is an important step for the bank as it looks to increase its dividend, which has been stuck at 5 cents for nearly two years. When the financial crisis struck, Wells, JPMorgan Chase and other industry giants cut dividends as they moved to bolster their capital. Now, two years later, banks are eager to give money back to shareholders - if the government will let them. The Federal Reserve must first complete a second round of bank stress tests, whose results are expected in March. JPMorgan, which last week reported a $17 billion profit for 2010, has said it hopes to raise its dividend as much as a dollar in the coming months. Wells Fargo has been more coy about its plans. Mr. Stumpf, in a conference call with investors, said he was eager to raise the dividend. But Brian Foran, a senior bank analyst with Nomura Securities International, noted, ''They historically have been cagey about saying anything before they know it.'' The bank's dividend outlook has improved on the back of its lending operation. Wells Fargo picked up new borrowers in the fourth quarter, particularly businesses, and it released $850 million from its reserves, thanks to the improving loan portfolio. The bank's provision for credit losses was cut nearly in half, to $2.99 billion in the fourth quarter from $5.91 billion a year earlier. Shares of Wells Fargo fell 68 cents, or 2.1 percent, on Wednesday, closing at $31.81. Although the bank's mortgage shop reported a 19 percent drop in income from 2009, it originated $128 billion in home mortgages in the fourth quarter, up from $94 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009. ''You can see the momentum building as economic activity is returning,'' said Marty Mosby, a managing director at Guggenheim Partners. Yet Wells Fargo still faces problems surrounding its mortgage portfolio. On Jan. 7, the highest state court in Massachusetts ruled that Wells Fargo and US Bancorp had wrongly foreclosed on two homes, because they could not prove they owned the mortgages. Regulators in all 50 states have begun investigations into whether hundreds of thousands of foreclosures made in recent years were invalid. Some banks temporarily suspended foreclosures last year during the controversy. Wells Fargo officials say they have largely avoided the documentation problems and have decided not to halt foreclosures. ''At the end of the day, the litigation will be less of an impact on Wells Fargo than people fear,'' said Lawrence Remmel, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, where he leads the firm's banking and financial institutions group. Wells Fargo has also moved to distance itself from litigation over soured loans that banks securitized and sold to investors. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage finance companies, are demanding that Wells Fargo and other big banks buy back loans sold at the height of the mortgage bubble. In the fourth quarter, the bank recorded a $464 million provision for future mortgage repurchases, up from $370 million in third quarter. But the bank's chief financial officer, Howard I. Atkins, said Wednesday that Wells Fargo did not plan to settle its dispute with Fannie and Freddie. Mr. Atkins said the bank's mortgage securities were of higher quality than those generated by its competitors. ''This is a diminishing issue, not an increasing issue,'' Mr. Atkins said in an interview. Eric Dash contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

A big chunk of the newfound earnings, nearly a third, comes from those withdrawals. So bank earnings since the peak of the financial crisis in 2008 have been exaggerated to a large degree, in both directions, by the shuffling of money into and out of reserves. A more reliable gauge of the banks’ health, then, would be not the bottom line of the income statement but rather the top-line revenue, which is not affected by rainy-day reserves. Here, the picture is less rosy. Industrywide, revenues are off 17 percent from their peak in 2007, and the latest figures are flat or declining. “This decade for U.S. banks will show the worst revenue growth since the decade of the Great Depression,” said Michael Mayo, a longtime banking industry analyst. “It’s a real issue for long-term investors.” On Tuesday, Citigroup announced earnings of $10.6 billion for 2010, its first full-year profit since the start of the financial crisis. This came only a month after the federal government sold off the last part of its nearly one-third stake in the company, acquired during the bailouts. But revenue fell by more than 5 percent from the prior year, to $86.6 billion, hurt by weak trading results and lackluster performance in its domestic consumer lending operations. Even JPMorgan Chase, which bucked the trend in banking by remaining relatively healthy throughout the crisis, is straining to move the revenue needle. On Friday, it posted a $17.4 billion profit for 2010, helped by a large withdrawal of money it had set aside to cover bad credit card loans and mortgages. Still, its revenue dipped more than 3 percent, to $104.8 billion. New questions about the industry’s growth prospects will surely come this week, when Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo release their year-end results. All told, the banking industry’s profits rose to about $70 billion in 2010, with about $20 billion coming from the release of loss reserves, according to estimates by Foresight Analytics, a research firm. That is nearly a sevenfold increase in net income. Revenue, on the other hand, is down about 1 percent, to about $790 billion. The challenges are formidable. New regulations, particularly those governing derivatives and credit cards, are only starting to cut into revenue. And unemployment remains historically high. Although bankers report a modest pickup in requests for credit, it is hard to see a surge in new lending so long as a large portion of the work force remains on the sidelines. What’s more, the lucrative margins that made Wall Street trading businesses such profit engines in the immediate aftermath of the crisis are starting to narrow as corporations and investors return to the markets and demand lower fees. So are the fat returns that banks made off their own investments, as they snap up securities with lower rates. At Citigroup, the revenue drag was a result of weaker performance in its investment banking and trading groups. Because markets are always unpredictable, investors can’t count on those businesses to lead a revenue rebound. The bank’s consumer businesses face strong headwinds as well. On Tuesday, Citigroup executives warned that the tough new credit card rules would start to take a bite out of revenue in the first half of the year. And even though most loan losses have started to stabilize, the executives stopped well short of predicting a near-term turnaround in the mortgage business. JPMorgan Chase reported its best year for 2010. But roughly $6.85 billion of its $17.4 billion profit came from the release of funds set aside to cover losses. Even Jamie Dimon, the chief executive, seemed to put little faith in that kind of income. “We do not look at reserve releases as earnings,” he said. “You don’t look at it as earnings. Let’s not pretend the company is trying to pull the wool over anyone’s eyes with reserve releases.” Investors could expect a similar pattern on Wednesday when Wells Fargo releases its 2010 results. On Friday, Bank of America will follow suit. Wells Fargo’s earnings are expected to rise roughly 46 percent, to about $11.7 billion, with revenue falling by about 4 percent, to $84.9 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Analysts expect Bank of America’s profit to swing to a profit of about $9.8 billion with revenue falling 6 percent, to an estimated $112.7 billion. To be sure, there are bright spots in banking. Bad loans are being flushed out of the system, and more restrictive loan-making means banks are taking on fewer risks. But health is one thing, and growth is another. Investors want both, but it’s unclear how banks will manage to please them if the economy continues to recover sluggishly. “It’s the revenue picture that remains the wild card,” said Charles Peabody, a financial analyst at Portales Partners. “How and when revenue returns is the big issue for the banks.”The nation’s banks are posting runaway profits for 2010, in a drastic reversal from 2009, when the prospect of widespread loan defaults forced them to set aside billions of dollars to cover losses.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/business/mutfund/09topp.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Mutual Funds Gained on Energy and Gold Bets in Fourth Quarter<date>Published: January 8, 2011</date><text>FEAR dominated many headlines in the fourth quarter, as unemployment in the United States, a debt crisis in Europe and inflation in China nagged at investors. But hope for an economic resurgence bubbled up, too, and a variety of market sectors had positive returns.Three of last quarter’s top-performing mutual funds, for example, found rising prices among commodity producers and foreign companies. One even made money on a bet that the jobs market would soon revive. An Energy Boost The Van Eck Hard Assets fund invests in diggers, drillers and tillers. It prospects in all of the commodities-producing sectors — metals, energy, agriculture and timber — but energy investments accounted for about 65 percent of the portfolio at year-end. Metals producers made up an additional 30 percent. The fund’s energy stake stemmed partly from a contrary bet on the gulf oil spill, which battered the shares of oil services outfits held by Van Eck, like Halliburton, Cameron International and Weatherford International. “By the middle of June, we thought the sell-off had been overdone,” said Shawn Reynolds, one of the fund’s co-managers. “So we added to our Halliburton, Weatherford and Cameron holdings.” All three provided double-digit returns in the fourth quarter, led by Weatherford, up more than 30 percent. Rising gold prices helped the fund, too, with Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold in the top 10 holdings as of November. Mr. Reynolds said he and his co-manager, Charles T. Cameron, believe that gold can keep rising as long as economic uncertainty prevailed in the United States and Europe. “We’re not gold nuts,” he said. “We’re mild gold bulls.” The fund returned 23.5 percent in the quarter, versus 10.2 percent for the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index. Its Class A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.39 percent, compared with an average of 1.36 percent for domestic stock funds tracked by Morningstar. Gold as Insurance David A. Nadel, co-manager of Royce Global Value, has lately favored gold miners, too. He says he sees gold as a form of insurance in a world where governments are printing money to lubricate their economies. “You can take the view that gold is the real money,” he said. “It’s been a currency for 5,000 years.” His fund specializes in small-cap investing, so he skips over stalwarts like Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, opting instead for Medusa Mining. “Medusa is producing gold at less than $250 an ounce,” versus a spot price of about $1,400, he said. “The rub is that all of their mines are in the Philippines — some people worry about political risk.” Mr. Nadel and his co-manager, W. Whitney George, range across the globe seeking stocks. Their search in the developing world has led them beyond oft-hyped places like the BRIC countries — Brazil, Russia, India and China. At the end of November, their largest developing-world stake was in South Africa, at 4.2 percent. (They had about 15 percent of the fund’s money invested in the United States.) South Africa “is at the nexus of all things sub-Saharan Africa,” Mr. Nadel said. “For global multinationals, it will drive any Africa strategy.” The country has problems, like high levels of H.I.V. incidence and consumer debt, but also advantages like top-quality companies and rich resources, he said. Among the fund’s South African investments is Adcock Ingram Holdings, a maker of drugs and hospital supplies. It has lately traded at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 10. Among well-managed drug companies, Mr. Nadel said, “you can’t find that kind of valuation in the developed world or the BRIC countries.” Mr. Nadel and Mr. George pride themselves in uncovering overlooked companies, often in ho-hum industries. Thus the fund owns two old-line Austrian manufacturers — Semperit, a maker of specialized rubber gear like escalator handrails and high-strength hoses, and Mayr-Melnhof Karton, a paper and packaging producer. “Austrian companies tend to be debt-averse, and they’re disciplined cost managers,” Mr. Nadel said. “We like companies that can survive economic cycles without needing financing.” The fund returned 17.3 percent in the fourth quarter and has an expense ratio of 1.69 percent, versus 1.54 percent for the average international stock fund followed by Morningstar. Balance-Sheet Basics Francis X. Claró and James M. Tringas, co-managers of the Wells Fargo Advantage Global Opportunities fund, also seek companies with the financial strength to tough out hard times. “The balance sheet is where we begin our analysis,” said Mr. Tringas, who is a certified public accountant. “A lot of investors look to the income statement and underestimate the impact of the balance sheet, but the balance sheet is what allows the investment thesis to play out.” If a company finds itself desperate for funding, its plans go can awry. That thinking led them to IAC/InterActiveCorp, owner of Web sites like Match.com and Ask.com. “It has retired 40 percent of its shares, and it’s still sitting on a billion and a half of cash with no debt,” Mr. Tringas said. Their belief in new media plays out in international bets, too, including 51job, their largest holding at the end of November. The company publishes online and print classified employment ads in China and helps Chinese companies with their employee benefits. It is benefiting from workers’ migration from the countryside to cities. “It’s like the Monster.com of China,” Mr. Claró said. Their interest in Monster Worldwide, owner of Monster.com, led them to 51job. Their stake in Monster, their fourth-largest holding as of the end of November, might surprise, given the sorry state of employment in the United States. But Mr. Claró said many investors were too pessimistic. “In my experience, you get the same rhetoric in every downturn — the jobs will never return,” but eventually, they do, he said, and sooner than many commentators predict. The fund returned 17.1 percent in the fourth quarter, and its Class A shares carry an expense ratio of 1.72 percent.FEAR dominated many headlines in the fourth quarter, as unemployment in the United States, a debt crisis in Europe and inflation in China nagged at investors.

It seemed a sweet deal for the bank, whose Countrywide Home Loans unit had peddled tens of billions of dollars in risky loans to the taxpayer-owned companies.While it is unfortunate that the Bank of America deal won’t recoup much for taxpayers, the resolution could have one important benefit. It might just open the door to a much-needed reckoning of the liabilities created by questionable mortgage practices at the nation’s largest banks. These institutions have not yet made a full and realistic accounting of their liabilities. It seems clear, after all, that Bank of America will not be the only institution forced to buy back billions of dollars’ worth of loans because it did not meet the lending standards promised to buyers. Costs associated with foreclosure improprieties that have come to light in courts across the country — robosigners, forged legal documents — are also likely to be substantial. But you’ll find precious little clarity on these liabilities in the financial statements of Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. The amounts that these banks, the nation’s four largest, have reserved for possible mortgage repurchases — about $10 billion as of the third quarter of 2010 — is microscopic when compared with the more than $5 trillion in mortgage securities issued from 2005 through 2007. For some investors, this is the accounting equivalent of whistling past the graveyard. And they are demanding that the audit committees of the banks’ boards step up their scrutiny of these institutions’ practices. Last Thursday, officials overseeing 11 large public pension funds that own shares in the big four banks sent a letter to the directors who head each board’s audit committee. The investors are asking that the audit committees conduct in-depth and independent reviews of all the internal controls related to the banks’ mortgage operations. Once the review has been completed — by a different accounting firm from the one currently signing off on the bank’s books — the investors want the audit committees to report their findings to shareholders. John C. Liu, the New York City comptroller and overseer of five city pension funds, instigated the campaign to focus the banks’ audit committees on mortgage problems. “There is a fundamental problem in the banks’ procedures that endangers not just homeowners, but shareholders, and local economies,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “Given the risks involved, only a swift and unbiased audit can reassure shareholders that the pension funds of 700,000 working and retired New Yorkers are in safe hands.” Joining him in signing the letters were the heads of the Connecticut Retirement Plans, the Illinois State Board of Investment and its State Universities Retirement System, the North Carolina Retirement System, the Oregon State Treasury and the New York State Common Retirement Fund. Together, the funds own $5.6 billion of stock in the top four banks and oversee $430 billion in assets. THE New York City pension funds have also put forward a shareholder proposal asking for an independent audit of the top four banks’ mortgage operations. Mr. Liu hopes that the proposal will be put to a stockholder vote at the banks’ annual meetings this year. It is unclear whether the proposal will be subject to such a vote. Citigroup doesn’t want it considered and has already asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to exclude the proposal from matters to be voted on at its coming meeting. The other banks will probably follow suit. An official at JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the shareholders’ request for an independent audit of its mortgage operations. Officials at Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo said that they were reviewing the letter but that they had confidence in their internal controls and audit committees’ vigilance. The Bank of America spokesman added that it had hired external auditors to review its foreclosure processes, which led it to enhance its practices. But Robert L. Christensen, an authority on financial services accounting, says it is high time that investors — and regulators, for that matter — scrutinize the banks’ auditing processes. “I believe there is an avalanche of liabilities that has not been recorded in their reserves,” Mr. Christensen said. “They say it’s not estimable, but the question is, are they really accounting for it properly and are regulators pushing them hard enough to do it?” 1 2 Next Page »BANK investors cheered the announcement last week that Bank of America would pay $2.6 billion to buy back mortgages it had improperly sold during the housing bubble to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the beleaguered mortgage finance giants.

Legal experts said that while this ruling did not set a precedent for other states, the outcome will be closely watched across the country because it is the first such ruling from a state’s highest court. Investors viewed the ruling as negative for banks; an index of financial company shares fell almost 1 percent on the day. “The broad implication is you’ve got to dot your i’s and cross your t’s,” said Kathleen G. Cully, an expert in bankruptcy and lender regulatory law in New York. “You need a proper chain of title, and in both of these cases there was a gap in the chain.” The case dates to 2007, when Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp began foreclosure proceedings against delinquent borrowers on two separate properties. Neither borrower fought the proceedings — the courts in Massachusetts are not obligated to oversee foreclosures — and both banks quickly seized the properties. The banks’ problems began in the fall of 2008, when Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp sought judgments from the Massachusetts Land Court that would have given them clear title to the properties. In 2009, the court rejected the banks’ arguments, ruling that the banks had not been assigned the mortgages before they foreclosed, as is required. Instead, the banks had acquired the mortgages after they had begun foreclosure proceedings. The ruling on Friday upheld that decision. Foreclosures are supposed to occur only when lenders can prove they own the note underlying the property. While it is common now for borrowers to question whether banks moving to seize their properties have the right to do so, in 2007, most borrowers assumed that the institutions foreclosing on them were acting properly. Since then, lenders’ foreclosure practices have come under intense scrutiny. Borrowers’ advocates have argued that lenders flouted private property rights in their rush to foreclose on troubled borrowers. As lenders and Wall Street firms bundled thousands of mortgage loans into securities, banks often failed to record each link in the chain of documents demonstrating ownership of a note and a property. Attorneys general in all 50 states are investigating foreclosure improprieties, which include forged signatures on legal documents and other dubious practices meant to patch up holes in loan documentation. Both mortgages in the Massachusetts case had been bundled into securities and sold to investors. The banks that foreclosed on the borrowers were acting as trustees, bringing the actions on behalf of investors in the trusts, which held the properties at the time of the ruling. In a statement, Steve Dale, a U.S. Bancorp spokesman, said: “Our role in this case is solely as trustee concerning a mortgage owned by a securitization trust. This judgment has no financial impact on U.S. Bancorp. The issues addressed by the court revolved around the process of the servicing of the loan on behalf of the securitization trust, which was preformed in this case by the servicer, American Home Mortgage Servicing.” Vickee J. Adams, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said: “The loans at issue in the court’s ruling were not originated, owned, serviced or foreclosed upon by Wells Fargo. As trustee of a securitized pool of loans, Wells Fargo expects the entities who service these loans to abide by all applicable state laws, including those laws that govern foreclosure sales.” Paul R. Collier III, a lawyer in Cambridge, Mass., represented Antonio Ibanez, one borrower in the case. “It’s been pretty clear and becoming ever more clear that the securitization industry has behaved as though it were immune from consumer protection laws, state homeowner protection laws and real estate regulations in its underwriting, securitization and foreclosure practices,” Mr. Collier said. “I am quite confident that this is merely the first petal off the rose with regard to predatory foreclosure practices.” A special education teacher in Brookline, Mr. Ibanez and his wife moved out of the house and are now living in a rental condominium, his lawyer said. U.S. Bancorp, as trustee, will either have to pay Mr. Ibanez to buy a deed from him, Mr. Collier said, or walk away from the property, leaving it to Mr. Ibanez. The loss on the property will be taken by investors in the trust that had claimed ownership of the mortgage. The other borrowers whose foreclosure was overturned — Mark and Tammy LaRace — are still living in the home. They could not be reached. The banks involved in the matter had asked the Massachusetts court to make its ruling prospective, meaning that it would affect only new foreclosures. The court declined to do so, allowing foreclosure cases that have been completed to be reopened and brought under scrutiny. Mr. Collier said he had a dozen similar cases. In a legal brief presented to the Massachusetts court, representatives of the real estate industry said there were thousands of foreclosure cases in the state with facts like those in the Ibanez matter.The highest court in Massachusetts ruled Friday that U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo erred when they seized two troubled borrowers’ properties in 2007, putting the nation’s banks on notice that foreclosures cannot be based on improper or incomplete paperwork.</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/business/21foreclosure.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">In California, Homeowners at Risk Struggle to Find Lawyers<date>Published: December 20, 2010</date><text>In California, where foreclosures are more abundant than in any other state, homeowners trying to win a loan modification have always had a tough time.Now they face yet another obstacle: hiring a lawyer. Sharon Bell, a retiree who lives in Laguna Niguel, southeast of Los Angeles, needs a modification to keep her home. She says she is scared of her bank and its plentiful resources, so much so that she cannot even open its certified letters inquiring where her mortgage payments may be. Yet the half-dozen lawyers she has called have refused to represent her. “They said they couldn’t help,” said Ms. Bell, 63. “But I’ve got to find help, because I’m dying every day.” Lawyers throughout California say they have no choice but to reject clients like Ms. Bell because of a new state law that sharply restricts how they can be paid. Under the measure, passed overwhelmingly by the State Legislature and backed by the state bar association, lawyers who work on loan modifications cannot receive any money until the work is complete. The bar association says that under the law, clients cannot put retainers in trust accounts. The law, which has few parallels in other states, was devised to eliminate swindles in which modification firms made promises about what their lawyers could do, charged hefty fees and then disappeared. But foreclosure specialists say there has been an unintended consequence: the honest lawyers can no longer afford to assist Ms. Bell and all the others who feel helpless before lenders that they see as elusive, unyielding and skilled at losing paperwork. The revelations three months ago that large banks were sloppy and negligent in preparing foreclosure documents underscore just how important it is for distressed homeowners to have representation, lawyers and consumer advocates say. Homeowners whose cases were handled improperly have little way of knowing it. Even if they found out, they would be hard-pressed to challenge a lender without a lawyer. “Consumers just don’t know what is going on,” said Walter Hackett, a former banker who is now a lawyer for a nonprofit service in Riverside. “They get a piece of paper saying they are going to lose their homes and they freak out.” The problem for lawyers is that even a simple modification, in which the loan is restructured so the borrower can afford the monthly payments, is a marathon, putting off their payday for months if not years. If the bank refuses to come to terms, the client may file for bankruptcy. Then the lawyer will never be paid. Alice M. Graham, a lawyer in Marina del Rey, said a homeowner in default recently tried to hire her. When Ms. Graham declined, the despairing owner begged her in vain to accept payments under the table. “The banks have all the lawyers they want, and the consumers are helpless,” Ms. Graham said. In some states, including New York and Florida, foreclosure proceedings are overseen by courts. In California, the process is more of a private matter between the bank and the homeowner. Through Sept. 30, lenders filed notices of default on 229,843 homes in California this year, according to the research firm MDA DataQuick. The length of time California households spend in foreclosure, which was rising as owners pursued modifications, fell in the third quarter to 8.7 months, from 9.1 months in the second quarter. That could indicate that the absence of defense lawyers is beginning to accelerate the process. While lawyers for nonprofits like Mr. Hackett continue to represent clients, they are too overwhelmed to help everyone. “A homeowner in California is going to have an extraordinarily difficult time finding an attorney,” he said. That group includes Ms. Bell, who owned two properties free and clear and then gave in to a friend’s urging to “put your money to work.” That friend was an agent, and soon Ms. Bell owned two more properties and was making unsecured loans. The loans went bad, the investments went bust, and Ms. Bell is trying to salvage her home. She wants an advocate but is reluctant to respond to any of the solicitations that fill her mailbox. “I know better,” she said. Many people did not. Defaulting owners saw television commercials or heard radio ads where a lawyer promised relief. They handed over a few thousand dollars and heard no more. Two years ago, the state bar association had seven complaints of misconduct in loan modifications. By March 2009, there were more than 100 complaints, and a task force was formed to deal with the problem. Soon, there were thousands of complaints. It was a public relations disaster. The president of the bar association wrote in a column last year that “hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of California lawyers” were victimizing people “at the most vulnerable point in their lives.” Politicians heard complaints, too. Ron Calderon, a state senator who represents several communities east of Los Angeles, sponsored a bill that prohibits advance payments for modifications and required lawyers to warn clients that they could do the job themselves without professional assistance. Lenders were supportive of the bill, Senator Calderon said. It passed 36 to 4 in September 2009. The maximum punishment is a $10,000 fine and a year in jail. The law is working well, Senator Calderon said. “You do not need a lawyer,” he said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28gret.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">U.S. Trustee Taking On Banks in Mortgage Mess<date>Published: November 27, 2010</date><text>AFTER examining their foreclosure practices for flaws in mortgage documentation and other procedures, many of the nation’s largest banks have resumed — or will soon resume — trying to evict defaulted borrowers.JPMorgan Chase, for example, told investors this month that it had extensively reviewed its foreclosure controls, trained personnel in the unit and started new procedures to ensure that all legal requirements would be met when it moves to seize a property in default. “If we find any foreclosures in error, we will fix them,” JPMorgan Chase said. But while banks may have booted a few robo-signers and tightened up some lax procedures, one question at the heart of the foreclosure mess refuses to go away: whether institutions trying to take back a property can prove they even have the right to foreclose at all. Some in the industry believe that questions about this issue — known as “legal standing” — are trivial. They say it’s just a gambit by borrowers’ lawyers to throw sand in the foreclosure machine. Nine times out of 10, bankers say, the right institutions are foreclosing on the right borrowers. Maybe so. But the United States Trustee Program, the unit of the Justice Department charged with overseeing the integrity of the nation’s bankruptcy courts, is taking a different view. The unit is stepping up its scrutiny of the veracity of banks’ claims against borrowers, and its approach is evident in two cases in federal bankruptcy court in Atlanta. In both cases, Donald F. Walton, the United States trustee for the region, has intervened, filing motions contending that the banks trying to foreclose have not shown they have the right to do so. The matters involve borrowers operating under Chapter 13 bankruptcy plans overseen by the court in the Northern District of Georgia. In both cases, the banks have filed motions with the bankruptcy court to remove the automatic foreclosure stay that results when a court confirms a debtor’s Chapter 13 repayment plan. If the stay is removed, the banks can foreclose. In one case, the borrower had her Chapter 13 plan confirmed by the court early last month. About two weeks later, Wells Fargo asked the court for relief from the stay so that it could foreclose. Responding on Nov. 16, Mr. Walton asked the court to deny the bank’s request because it had failed to produce any facts showing that it was entitled to foreclose — either as the holder of the underlying note or as the agent for the holder. The other case involves a couple who had their Chapter 13 plan confirmed by the court in March 2009. A month ago, Chase Home Finance, a unit of JPMorgan Chase, asked the court for relief from the automatic stay so that it could start foreclosure proceedings. Again, Mr. Walton objected, asking the court to deny the request on the same grounds as argued in the Wells Fargo matter — in this case, that Chase hadn’t proved that it controlled the note on the property. Jane Limprecht, a spokeswoman for the trustee program, confirmed that it was ratcheting up its scrutiny on banks’ foreclosure practices. “The United States Trustee Program is engaged in an enhanced review of mortgage servicer filings in bankruptcy cases to help ensure the accuracy of the claim to repayment,” she said. She declined to comment on specific filings. A Chase spokesman said the bank is the holder of the note in the Georgia case, giving it standing to file the motion. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said that in its case, it is the trustee of a mortgage security that contains the loan, not the servicer. In its capacity as the trustee for mortgage loans serviced by others, it says it expects those servicers to abide by all required laws, processes and procedures. Howard D. Rothbloom, a lawyer in Atlanta who represents borrowers in bankruptcy, welcomed the actions by Mr. Walton and said he believes they show a sea change in the United States trustee’s thinking on the foreclosure mess. “Until now, what we had was homeowners complaining about a lack of due process,” Mr. Rothbloom said. “Now you have the federal government complaining about the abuse of the judicial process. That’s really what was missing before.” The judges overseeing these matters have not yet ruled on the banks’ or the trustee’s requests. And Wells Fargo and Chase may indeed be able to persuade the trustee that their filings were proper. But the trustee’s intervention in these matters indicates that it wants banks to show the courts that they have the right to foreclose, rather than simply telling them they do. That had been the custom, after all. Now, Mr. Walton’s motions may serve as a warning to banks that they need to be better prepared if they want to foreclose on a borrower. “For years, the trustee would always take the creditors’ side,” Mr. Rothbloom said. “My strong opinion is the U.S. trustee’s perspective is that they exist to stop borrowers from cheating banks. Perhaps they are coming to the realization that banks can also cheat borrowers.” FEDERAL trustees in other parts of the country have also intervened in borrower cases, but many of these actions have been related to questionable foreclosure fees or to dubious legal or documentation practices. The shift to a broader focus on the issue of standing suggests that the courts may no longer accept at face value the banks’ arguments that they have the right to foreclose or represent the institution that does. David Shaev, a lawyer in New York who works with troubled borrowers, says the United States trustee there has also intervened in one of his cases, taking up the issue of a bank’s right to foreclose. In his experience, Mr. Shaev said: “The attorneys who represent the banks invariably state that they will get the collateral file for us and prove that the banks had possession of the documents at the appropriate time. But then when we review the file it doesn’t show that at all.” As many large banks renew their foreclosure efforts, Mr. Rothbloom says he hopes that the United States trustee will bring about a comprehensive change in bank practices. “I’ve gotten resolutions for clients in individual cases, but I’m just a flea on the tail of an elephant,” he said. “Resolutions of individual cases don’t bring about systemic change.” And systemic change is precisely what’s needed.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE4D6143DF933A15752C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Hands Citigroup an Unexpected Prize: A $100 Million Check<date>Published: November 20, 2010</date><text>Nearly two years after Citigroup was outfoxed for the troubled Wachovia Corporation, Citi is walking away with an unexpected prize: a $100 million check from Wells Fargo to resolve claims that it had unfairly wrestled Wachovia out of Citi's hands. The settlement, reached Friday, ends the bitter legal sparring that began just hours after Wells Fargo made a stunning middle-of-the-night bid for Wachovia in October 2008, days after Citigroup announced that it had a deal. Although Wells Fargo's offer ultimately prevailed, Citigroup mounted an aggressive fight to recover as much as $60 billion in damages - and to change the public perception that it had bungled one of the watershed deals of the financial crisis. Indeed, Citigroup officials thought they were riding to the rescue when they offered to buy Wachovia, one of a handful of deeply troubled financial companies that regulators were desperately trying to stabilize. The government arranged for JPMorgan Chase to buy Washington Mutual in one of the first shotgun mergers of the crisis, and it needed a fast solution for Wachovia. Citigroup, facing its own gaping losses, asked for federal assistance to complete the merger; Wells Fargo beat Citigroup's bid with an offer that required no extra government support. Under the terms of the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to pay Citigroup $100 million to resolve all claims related the dispute. ''We are glad to put this matter behind us and we look forward to our two institutions working together in the future,'' the companies said in a joint statement. By cutting the large settlement check, Wells Fargo hopes it can remove the legal cloud hanging over what has been a game-changing merger for the company. The deal nearly doubled the size of Wells Fargo and transformed it from a California regional bank into a national, too-big-too-fail giant. Now that its real estate losses from Wachovia appear to be easing, Wells Fargo officials say that the deal is paying off far better than they expected. The $100 million payoff may just be another merger expense. Meanwhile, the settlement should also free up the bank's leadership team to focus on the remaining challenges of integrating Wachovia's East Coast banking operations, rather than face the possibility of reputational embarrassments or other setbacks that could emerge in a trial. This week, Wells Fargo announced that it planned to convert branches in New Jersey and Delaware in February, followed by New York and Connecticut in March. For Citigroup, the legal windfall is essentially found money. Although Citigroup had vowed to mount a vigorous campaign, several legal experts regarded its case as flimsy. Citigroup had entered into only an exclusivity agreement with Wachovia; it had not formally completed the merger. Still, it is a somewhat hollow victory. By missing out on Wachovia, Citigroup lost its chance to gain one of the last remaining large regional banking franchises, which would have brought in tens of billions of dollars in stable deposits and vastly expanded its branch network in the United States. Although Citigroup officials maintain that they acted prudently, investors harshly criticized the bank's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, for bungling the acquisition. Citigroup's stock fell sharply after it became clear that Wachovia would wind up in Wells Fargo's hands, and the bank ultimately was forced to turn to the government for multiple bailouts. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/banks-face-more-demands-to-buy-back-bad-loans/?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks Brace for Costly Fights Over Mortgage Mess<date>November 5, 2010, 7:08 pm</date><text>By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ 8:14 p.m. | Updated Even as investors put aside their worries on Friday about the effect of the foreclosure mess on bank stocks, new signs emerged of what is likely to be a long and expensive legal battle for the financial services industry over mortgages gone bad. Citigroup disclosed in a regulatory filing that it was being sued by several investors, including Charles Schwab and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, in an effort to force Citigroup to buy back soured mortgages that the investors contended did not conform to proper underwriting standards. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo said in a filing that it “cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss” from these cases, and Bank of America said in a filing that investors holding $375 billion worth of mortgage securities had filed similar suits. In a separate announcement, however, Bank of America said a lawsuit brought by the Maine State Retirement System and other investors was dismissed on Thursday by a federal court in California, reducing that $375 billion figure to $54 billion. But that news came after the S.E.C. filing had already been prepared. The dismissal is a significant victory for Bank of America and underscores the legal challenges in trying to force banks to buy back defaulted mortgages. “The court’s ruling demonstrates the strict legal hurdles plaintiffs face in bringing these sorts of claims,” said Brian E. Pastuszenski, counsel for Bank of America’s Countrywide unit. Still, Bank of America faces a different effort by other investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, the giant money management firm, to force it to buy back a portion of roughly $47 billion in mortgages they hold. Neither the $375 billion nor the $54 billion figure reflects this push, because those investors have yet to sue. On Thursday, Bank of America’s lawyers sent a strongly worded letter to the lawyer leading the $47 billion effort, rejecting her claims as “utterly baseless.” The bank contends the any loss of value stemmed from the economic downturn rather than an underlying problem with how the mortgages were sold to investors or have been serviced. Bank of America and other large institutions like JPMorgan Chase and GMAC Mortgage have been criticized for pursuing foreclosures without the proper paperwork or with signatures by so-called robo-signers. But on Wall Street, the worry is that efforts to force the banks to buy back defaulted mortgages could actually be a longer and more expensive fight for the industry. Some analysts estimate the eventual cost could total tens of billions of dollars, and that worry pushed down shares of the big banks sharply last month. Indeed, Bank of America’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, has signaled that the threat of forced buybacks will not be resolved quickly — or cheaply. “It’s loan by loan, and we have the resources to deploy in that kind of review,” he said last month, during a conference call to discuss the bank’s financial results for the third quarter. “We’d love never to talk about this again and put it behind us, but the right answer is to fight for it.” Despite the disclosures, bank stocks rallied for the second day in a row. Bank of America shares closed up 23 cents, at $12.36, while Citigroup rose 16 cents, to $4.49, and Wells Fargo jumped $1.76, to $29.22.

It also acknowledged that “some aspects of the notarization process” had not always been properly followed, creating the potential for paperwork errors. Wells officials said that the bank started to correct the 55,000 questionable files, and “out of an abundance of caution,” planned to resubmit them in 23 states where foreclosures require court approval. Bank officials maintained that the underlying information in the loan files was accurate and that the bank had not improperly foreclosed on any troubled homeowners. Wells Fargo also said that it had no plans to temporarily freeze foreclosure sales, an action previously taken by its rivals Bank of America and GMAC. Still, the revelations that Wells had identified as many as 55,000 improper foreclosure files add to the mortgage morass. Attorneys general in all 50 states are conducting a sweeping investigation into the industry’s practices, while a White House task force and several federal regulators have embarked on similar reviews. In addition to Wells Fargo, four other large mortgage players are resubmitting tens of thousands of cases in large swaths of the country. Chase said it was looking at about 115,000 files in 41 states. Bank of America is looking at 102,000 in 23 states, where foreclosures require court approval. GMAC and PNC Financial have come forward to say they are resubmitting files with improper paperwork, too. Still, Wells Fargo’s announcement was the second time a bank had backtracked on statements it had made about the extent of its foreclosure problems. After weeks of insisting that its review had not turned up any serious errors, Bank of America acknowledged a number of paperwork errors, including incorrect data and misspelled names. Wells Fargo had previously taken an even more combative stance. In its Oct. 20 conference call with investors, bank officials said they were confident that the foreclosure processes and controls were sound. That statement gave the impression that there were few if any problems but left room for the possibility that the bank might have to fix a small number of mistakes. During the conference call, Wells officials dismissed concerns that the bank had systematically engaged in so-called robo-signing, where a single employee would sign thousands of loan documents without verifying their contents, as the law requires. Instead, the bank emphasized that their policies called for the same employee who compiled the foreclosure file to sign off on it — a crucial legal requirement in many states. But revelations in an obscure Florida lawsuit and elsewhere raised concerns about whether that process was always followed. Under questioning, Xee Moua, a Wells Fargo manager, said she would sign off on as many as 500 foreclosure files a day without verifying the accuracy of their contents. “We don’t go into the details with these affidavits,” she said in a deposition. Oscar Suris, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to comment on whether any of the problems the bank identified stemmed from such violations. He previously called Ms. Moua’s testimony “one isolated case” that is being disputed in the courts. Wells officials also acknowledged the possibility of notarization errors. Previously, Wells officials said they believed that their notarization procedures complied with the law in South Carolina, where the bank’s loan foreclosure operations were based. As a result of the reviews, bank officials now say they are taking into consideration the unique requirements of different counties and states.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/business/21bank.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo’s Earnings Rise 7%<date>Published: October 20, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Within weeks of scooping up the failed banking operations of Washington Mutual in late 2008, JPMorgan Chase began phasing out the WaMu brand, replacing signs on retail branches. WaMu accounts became Chase accounts. Just over a year later, the conversion was done, turning the WaMu name into a relic of the financial crisis.Wells Fargo agreed to buy the troubled Wachovia Corporation only two weeks after Chase-WaMu deal, and yet the bank’s executives here seem content to move eastward at the pace of their trademark stagecoach. Only 488 of Wachovia’s 3,300 branches have been converted so far, and not much more will change in big East Coast markets like Florida, New York and North Carolina until sometime next year. As Wells Fargo emerges as a national giant, its slow-go approach comes in stark contrast to its rivals. And it is not the only way the bank stands out. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo topped analysts’ estimates with earnings of $3.3 billion in the third quarter, up 7 percent from the same period a year ago, largely on the strength of bread-and-butter deposit growth and mortgage refinancings instead of high-octane Wall Street trading. Revenue fell 7 percent, to $20.9 billion. Despite a surge of refinancings because of ultralow interest rates, lending declined nearly 6 percent as fewer consumers sought credit. Even though Wells Fargo is the nation’s biggest lender to consumers, its losses on bad loans have been lower than the rest of the industry. Wells Fargo officials attribute that divide to prudent lending standards — like requiring higher down payments — and being quicker to restructure problem loans from the start. And while it services mortgages for one in six Americans, Wells Fargo officials insist they have sidestepped many of the documentation problems that infected the industry. Wells Fargo is so confident in its practices and controls that it has said it does not need to halt foreclosures, as other banks have. These distinctions have not been rewarded by the market, however. Wells Fargo’s stock price has fallen more than 15 percent over the last year, while the KBW Bank index, a popular barometer of the sector, has essentially held steady. At a time when its rivals are betting on faster-growing overseas markets, some investors question why they should bet on a company so firmly entrenched in the United States. “Investors are concerned about the direction of the U.S. economy and that there is no growth in U.S. lending,” said Frederick Cannon, the chief stock analyst at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. In an interview at Wells Fargo’s headquarters, the chief executive, John G. Stumpf, described the company’s domestic focus as a strength. As an example, he pointed to the bank’s emphasis on selling simple mortgages instead of the kinds of exotic, anything-goes products that got so many banks into trouble. Selective lending might have cost Wells Fargo some growth during the housing boom, but now it seems to be paying off: Its combined foreclosure and delinquency rate is about 8.15 percent, compared with 11.5 percent for the rest of the industry, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. “We let our numbers speak for themselves,” Mr. Stumpf said. “We are more of a Main Street bank than a Wall Street bank.” As questions swirl over the industry’s foreclosure practices, Wells Fargo officials dismiss concerns that the bank systematically engaged in so-called robo-signing, where a single employee would sign thousands of loan documents without verifying their contents, as the law requires. But revelations in an obscure Florida lawsuit have raised concerns about whether that process was always followed. Under questioning, Xee Moua, a Wells Fargo manager, said she would sign off on as many as 500 foreclosure files a day without verifying the accuracy of their contents. “We don’t go into the details with these affidavits,” she said in a deposition. Oscar Suris, a Wells Fargo spokesman, called Ms. Moua’s testimony “one isolated case” that is being disputed in the courts. “When we find errors, we fix them,” he added. Perhaps more worrisome is that Wells Fargo may have to buy back bad loans from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other investors. Here, too, Wells Fargo may have more cover than its competitors. Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, estimates that Wells Fargo may be forced to absorb about $2 billion in losses from loan repurchases. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, by his calculations, could each face close to $9 billion in such losses. The amount of money each bank has set aside for such expenses is roughly consistent with that variation. Wells Fargo will need to deepen its relationships with its existing customers if the Wachovia deal is to succeed. With Wachovia, it nearly doubled its size, and it is now near the federal cap of 10 percent of the nation’s deposits. So it is investing in the branches it inherited from Wachovia, adding sales people at many of them. “They simply didn’t have as many sales people per market as we had,” said Howard I. Atkins, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer. The result is that in markets where staff was added, the sale of products to existing customers has climbed by about 4.5 percent. Mr. Stumpf says he sees potential in encouraging the roughly 15,000 brokers in a greatly expanded wealth management unit to sell their clients checking accounts and mortgages, while urging its 30,000 branch workers to steer their customers to Wells brokers for investment advice. “We have a lot of opportunity in the United States,” Mr. Stumpf said.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07fargo.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo to Pay $24 Million to End Mortgage Inquiry<date>Published: October 6, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — Wells Fargo &amp; Company is paying $24 million to end an investigation by eight states into whether lenders acquired by the bank made risky mortgages to consumers without disclosing their perils.The states said loans known as option adjustable-rate loans, or pick-a-payment mortgages, were deceptive. Those loans allowed borrowers to defer some interest payments and add them to the principal balance. Borrowers could make payments so low that loan debt each month. Wells Fargo announced the agreement Wednesday with attorneys general in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Texas and Washington State. The loans were made by the Wachovia Corporation and a California company it acquired, World Savings Bank. Wells bought Wachovia at the end of 2008. Wachovia had already stopped making those loans before that acquisition. As part of the agreement, Wells has agreed to offer loan assistance worth more than $770 million to more than 8,700 borrowers through June 2013, though that amount will depend on how the economy fares. The $24 million will be used to help states reach out to such customers. The agreement includes no admission of wrongdoing by Wells Fargo.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/06mortgage.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Foreclosure Furor Rises; Many Call for a Freeze<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>The uproar over bad conduct by mortgage lenders intensified Tuesday, as lawmakers in Washington requested a federal investigation and the attorney general in Texas joined a chorus of state law enforcement figures calling for freezes on all foreclosures.Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and 30 other Democratic representatives from California told the Justice Department, the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency that “it is time that banks are held accountable for their practices.” In a request for an investigation into questionable foreclosure practices by lenders, the lawmakers said that “the excuses we have heard from financial institutions are simply not credible." Officials from the federal agencies declined to comment. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican, sent letters to 30 lenders demanding they stop foreclosures, evictions and the sale of foreclosed properties until they could provide assurances that they were proceeding legally. Both developments indicated that scarcely two weeks after the country’s fourth-biggest lender, GMAC Mortgage, revealed that it was suspending all foreclosures in the 23 states where the process requires judicial approval, concerns about flawed foreclosures had mushroomed into a nationwide problem. Some of the finger-pointing was also being directed back at Congress. The Ohio secretary of state, Jennifer Brunner, suggested in a telephone interview on Tuesday that a bill passed by Congress last week about notarizations could facilitate foreclosure fraud. Dubious notary practices used by banks to justify foreclosures have come under scrutiny in recent weeks as GMAC and other top lenders suspended homeowner evictions over possible improper procedures. Ms. Brunner, who has recently referred possible cases of notary fraud in her state to federal authorities, worries that the legislation would allow the lowest standard for notaries to become a nationwide practice. She said she also worried that the changes were coming in the middle of a foreclosure storm where people could lose their homes improperly. “A notary’s signature is that of a trusted, impartial third party, whose notarization bolsters the integrity of the document,” Ms. Brunner said. “To take away the safeguards of notarization means foreclosure procedures could be more susceptible to fraud.” As banks’ foreclosure practices have come under the microscope, problems with notarizations on mortgage assignments have emerged. These documents transfer the ownership of the underlying note from one institution to another and are required for foreclosures to proceed. In some cases, the notarizations predated the preparation of the legal documents, suggesting that signatures were not reviewed by a notary. Other notarizations took place in offices far away from where the documents were signed, indicating that the notaries might not have witnessed the signings as the law required. Notary practices vary from state to state and the bill, sponsored by Representative Robert B. Aderholt, a Republican from Alabama, would essentially require that one state’s rules be accepted by others. If one state allows its notaries to sign off on electronic signatures, for example, documents carrying such signatures and notarized by officials in that state would have to be recognized and accepted in any state or federal court. Ms. Brunner pointed out that some states had adopted “electronic notarization” laws that ignored the requirement of a signer’s personal appearance before a notary. “Many of these policies for electronic notarization are driven by technology rather than by principle, and they are dangerous to consumers,” she said. Mr. Aderholt had introduced the bill twice before and both times it passed the House of Representatives but not the Senate. Mr. Aderholt reintroduced the bill last October and it passed the Senate on Sept. 29. It is awaiting President Obama’s signature. Mr. Aderholt’s press secretary, Darrell Jordan, said there was no connection between the timing of the bill and the current notarization problems with foreclosures. In a statement announcing the bill’s passage, Mr. Aderholt said: “This legislation will help businesses around the nation by eliminating the confusion which arises when states refuse to acknowledge the integrity of documents notarized out of state.” Last week, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America joined GMAC in suspending foreclosures in the states where they must be approved by a judge. The judicial states do not include California or Texas. But Mr. Abbott, the Texas attorney general, told lenders in letters dated Oct. 4 that if they used so-called robo-signers — employees who signed thousands of foreclosure affidavits a month, falsely attesting that they had reviewed the material — it would be a violation of Texas law. As a result, he wrote, “the document and therefore the foreclosure sale would have been invalid.” The three lenders who are at the center of the controversy, GMAC Mortgage, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, declined to comment. Other lenders singled out by Mr. Abbott include Wells Fargo, CitiMortgage, HSBC and National City. Meanwhile, shares of a major foreclosure outsourcing company, Lender Processing Services of Jacksonville, Fla., fell 5 percent on Tuesday, adding to a slide that began last week. The company’s documentation practices are stirring questions, including how the same employee can have wildly varying signatures on mortgage documents. L.P.S. blamed a midlevel manager’s decision to allow employees to sign forms in the name of an authorized employee. It says it has stopped the practice. The United States Attorney’s Office in Tampa began investigating L.P.S. in February. An L.P.S. representative could not be reached Tuesday for comment. Other calls for investigations came from Senators Al Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/business/energy-environment/31coal.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks Make a Shift Toward Greener Lending<date>Published: August 30, 2010</date><text>Blasting off mountaintops to reach coal in Appalachia or churning out millions of tons of carbon dioxide to extract oil from sand in Alberta are among environmentalists’ biggest industrial irritants. But they are also legal and lucrative.For a growing number of banks, however, that does not seem to matter. After years of legal entanglements arising from environmental messes and increased scrutiny of banks that finance the dirtiest industries, several large commercial lenders are taking a stand on industry practices that they regard as risky to their reputations and bottom lines. In the most recent example, the banking giant Wells Fargo noted last month what it called “considerable attention and controversy” surrounding mountaintop removal mining, and said that its involvement with companies engaged in it was “limited and declining.” The bank was a small player in the sector, representing about $78 million in bonds and loan financing for such companies from 2008 to April of this year, according to data compiled by the Rainforest Action Network, an environmental group tracking the issue. But the policy shift by Wells Fargo follows others over the last two years, including moves by Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank, to increase scrutiny of lending to companies involved in mountaintop removal — or to end the lending altogether. HSBC, which is based in London, has curtailed its relationships with some producers of palm oil, which is often linked to deforestation in developing countries. The Dutch lender Rabobank has applied a nine-point checklist of conditions for would-be oil and gas borrowers that includes commitments to improve environmental performance and protect water quality. In some cases, the changing policies represent an attempt to burnish green credentials in areas where the banks had little interest, and there is no indication that companies engaged in the objectionable practices cannot find financing elsewhere. Still, banking analysts and others suggest that heated debate over climate change, water quality and other environmental considerations is forcing lenders to take a much harder — and often uncomfortable — look at where they extend credit, and to whom. “It’s one thing if your potential borrower is dumping cyanide in a river,” said Karina Litvack, the head of governance and sustainable investment with F&amp;C Investments, an investment management firm based in London. “But if they’re dumping carbon dioxide into the air, which is not exactly illegal — what do you do? Banks are in kind of a quandary, because they are competing for business, and if they get holier-than-thou and start to play policeman, they risk allowing other banks to take that business.” Environmental risk has been on the radar for lenders since the 1980s and early 1990s, when courts began forcing some measure of responsibility on banks for the polluting factories, superfund sites and other environmental problems that had, to one degree or another, been facilitated by their financing. Congress passed a law in 1996 that limited the exposure of lenders on this front, but since then, most major banks have developed environmental risk management divisions as part of their commercial banking due diligence efforts. Now, the rise of murkier issues like global warming, along with increasing scrutiny by environmental groups of banks’ investments in many other industries — like oil and gas development, nuclear power, coal-fired electricity generation, oil sands, fuel pipeline construction, dam building, forestry and even certain types of agriculture — are nudging lenders into new territory. “We’re taking a much closer look at a much broader variety of issues, not all of which are captured under state and local laws,” said Stephanie Rico, a spokeswoman for the environmental affairs group at Wells Fargo. Ms. Litvack, of F&amp;C Investments, pointed to large protests last week by many climate activists outside the Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh. At least a dozen protesters have been arrested in demonstrations against the bank’s financing of oil sands development in Canada. The Royal Bank of Canada, meanwhile, responding to intense pressure from environmental advocates denouncing the bank’s financing of oil sands projects, hosted 18 international banks in Toronto in February for “a day of learning” on the “regulatory, social and environmental issues” surrounding the oil sands. Globally, banks and environmental advocates are seeking to make things easier by developing best practices and other voluntary standards. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley helped initiate the Carbon Principles, which aim to standardize the assessment of “carbon risks in the financing of electric power projects” in the United States. Several international financial institutions — including HSBC, Munich Re and others — have formed the Climate Principles, which aim to encourage the management of climate change “across the full range of financial products and services,” according to the compact’s Web site.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06EFD81739F93BA1575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">BUCKS; A Lender Asks a Lot<date>Published: August 28, 2010</date><text>When Linda Falcao applied for a mortgage from Wells Fargo, she didn't realize she would be required to write the type of essay that's more commonly included with a college application. So she and her husband, Kemuel Ronis, were taken by surprise when Wells Fargo asked the couple, both 50, to pen a ''motivational letter'' explaining why they were moving. What they found even more shocking, however, were some of the themes that Wells required them to include in their statement, specifically, their plans regarding an ''increase/decrease in family'' or property size. ''It is wrong and invasive to ask people about their family plans,'' said Ms. Falcao, a civil rights attorney and founder of America Serves, a youth volunteer organization. ''It very much offended me.'' Offensive or not, basing a loan decision on a borrower's family status or future plans is also against the law. It violates the Fair Housing Act, a law enforced by the Department of Housing and Development, which prohibits discrimination in lending based on disability, sex or family status -- including pregnancy or having children in the family. ''The question itself certainly suggests that the lender is violating the Fair Housing Act by making decisions based on their familial status,'' said a federal investigator who would speak only on the condition of anonymity. Besides asking for information about their family plans, which was paired with questions about plans to change the ''property size,'' Wells Fargo also requested that the letter include information that supported the fact that the property, in Glen Mills, Pa., would be their primary residence. The bank also asked them to include their commuting distances to work, as well as other properties that they may own in the area. The request for the so-called motivational letter was included in the bank's mortgage commitment letter, which offered to approve their loan if they answered the bank's questions and provided other documentation. A Wells Fargo spokesman said that motivation letters were generally requested when the loan underwriter had more questions about a borrower's ''occupancy intentions.'' For instance, he said the company might request such a letter when a family's existing home is not yet sold and it wants the buyer to show that the new home will indeed serve as the primary residence. The spokesman did not say why the bank would request information about a prospective borrower's family plans, but said that ''under no circumstances would any information about family status be used by Wells Fargo as the basis for a decision on a loan application.'' But then why did it ask? The spokesman said he could not answer that for certain without knowing more about the specifics of the case. Last month, I wrote an article that found that some lenders were taking a harder look at prospective mortgage borrowers who were out on temporary leave, including parents at home with a newborn. Shortly after the article ran, the housing department said it would investigate the lending practices of certain mortgage lenders to see if any would-be borrowers had been illegally denied a mortgage because they were pregnant or on short-term disability. Ms. Falcao said she and her husband, a teacher, filed their own complaint with the department last month, though Wells did ultimately approve them for a mortgage. During the application process, the couple asked if they could be excused from the letter-writing exercise. But the bank said that they were required to provide the letter because they had not yet sold their existing home, a townhouse that they owned outright. But even after the couple had a signed agreement on the sale of their home, Ms. Falcao said that Wells Fargo still wanted the letter. With no final mortgage as their closing date grew near, Ms. Falcao said they grudgingly wrote the letter and answered the bank's questions. The couple were ideal loan candidates. Ms. Falcao said she and her husband both have good credit scores, at least in the high 700s, and they have no debt. They were also making a down payment of more than 60 percent. (The couple took out a temporary line of credit on their townhouse, essentially as a bridge loan, to pay for the down payment until that sale closed, four days after the purchase of their new home).</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/business/20norris.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Banks Get Stuck With the Bill as Mortgage Loans Fail<date>Published: August 19, 2010</date><text>If nobody does their job right, and disaster ensues, who should pay for the sins of all?That is the predicament now confronting the mortgage industry, where it has become clear that many billions of dollars in home loans were sold, guaranteed and rated as safe without anyone bothering to examine whether the loans were made with due regard for the rules. You can make a case — call it the caveat emptor case — that no one should be able to recover any losses they suffered from loans that went bad. If they had performed even rudimentary checks before the loans were made, sold, rated, insured or securitized, it’s very likely that big problems would have been visible before disaster hit. There would have been fewer bad loans and many fewer foreclosures. That case is not, however, showing any sign of prevailing as legal battles increase in number. Instead, it appears that big banks will be compelled to pay for their own sins as well as the sins of others. Already the four big commercial banks — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup — have taken losses of $9.8 billion on loans they have repurchased or expect to be forced to repurchase. Moshe Orenbuch, an analyst at Credit Suisse, says he thinks that figure will rise to $20 billion or $30 billion before the wave is over. Other analysts think the number could be significantly higher. Even now, long after we learned just how bad the underwriting standards were, it is surprising to see how bad many of these loans were. In the second quarter, Wells Fargo repurchased $530 million of mortgage loans. It concluded those loans were worth, on average, a little less than half their face value. Wells says it has the right to recover some of that from the companies that sold it the loans. Unfortunately, “due primarily to the financial difficulties of some correspondent lenders, we typically recover on average approximately 50 percent from these lenders,” Wells added in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. So far, most of the money the banks have paid has gone to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which used to be government-sponsored enterprises and now, after the bailouts, are government-controlled. But even though they have collected billions, Fannie and Freddie are getting increasingly frustrated with the banks for what they see as foot-dragging. Freddie, in its quarterly report filed this month, said it was now requiring banks “to commit to plans for completing repurchases, with financial consequences or with stated remedies for noncompliance, as part of the annual renewals of our contracts with them.” A spokesman for Freddie would not say just what those remedies or financial consequences might be. But any bank that wants to keep offering mortgages must have contracts with Fannie and Freddie. Tying the repurchases to contract renewals could be a strong bargaining chip. The mortgages sold to Fannie and Freddie were supposed to conform to specified requirements. Those requirements did get weaker as the credit bubble intensified — a fact some bankers privately mutter the government now wants to forget — but they were still of higher quality than many mortgages sold into private securitizations. Those securitizations are the subject of demands for mortgage repurchases made by monoline insurers like MBIA and Ambac, which erred in promising to make the payments if the securitizations did not have enough money from payments by borrowers. When MBIA began making such claims last year, it seemed a little presumptuous. In its suits, it admitted it did virtually no due diligence to assess the quality of the loans it was insuring. Instead, it said it had relied on the representations and warranties made by banks and brokerage firms that bought the insurance. “It would be enormously expensive, even if it were logistically feasible, for a credit insurer to investigate the health of these ground-level loans,” MBIA argued in a court filing, adding that if it had done such research, it would have been forced to charge much higher premiums. Something similar could be argued by almost everyone involved. To cite one example, Credit Suisse, which was sued by MBIA after it guaranteed a securitization of second-mortgage loans that may have been among the worst such loan collections ever, said it had not reviewed the loans either. Instead, it relied on assurances from the firms that made the loans. Nor did the bond rating agencies do reviews of individual loans before they assigned AAA ratings to securities that in no way deserved them. Conveniently, everyone assumed that the others were telling the truth. The industry motto could have been, “Since we trust, why verify?” In decisions that should send alarms through bank boardrooms, MBIA has managed to persuade judges in three cases that it has a strong enough argument to avoid dismissal at an early stage. In a decision on Credit Suisse earlier this month, a New York judge rejected the bank’s claim that MBIA was a sophisticated party that failed to perform due diligence and thus had only itself to blame.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/11wells.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Loses Ruling on Overdraft Fees<date>Published: August 10, 2010</date><text>A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Wells Fargo to pay California customers $203 million in restitution for claims that it had manipulated transactions to maximize the overdraft fees it charged.Instead of processing transactions in the order in which they were received, Wells Fargo put through the largest to smallest, a judge in San Francisco found. In a stinging 90-page opinion, United States District Judge William Alsup wrote that the practice was unfair and deceptive. “The bank’s dominant, indeed sole, motive was to maximize the number of overdrafts and squeeze as much as possible” out of customers who spent more than they had in their accounts, the judge wrote. The ruling comes after a two-week trial in the spring heard by the judge. Wells Fargo, which collected nearly $1.8 billion in overdraft fees in California alone from 2005 to 2007, said it would appeal. “We’re disappointed with the judge’s ruling,” said Richele Messick, a bank spokeswoman. “We don’t believe the ruling is in line with the facts of the case.” Ms. Messick said Wells Fargo’s method of processing transactions was “appropriate and consistent with customers’ interest and the laws and rules of governing regulatory authorities.” The judge’s ruling could portend problems for other banks that are defendants in similar cases. Other federal lawsuits regarding overdraft fees have been consolidated into one class-action suit in Florida, which also claim that Wells Fargo and other banks manipulated transactions to maximize overdraft fees. Ruben Honik, one of the lawyers representing plaintiffs in the Florida case, said the judge’s ruling would provide a “road map.” “It was a litmus test for our theory and the whole approach we took,” Mr. Honik said. Overdraft fees have become an important source of revenue for banks and credit unions in the last decade, particularly as debit cards have risen in popularity. But now, banks stand to lose billions because of new federal laws requiring banks to obtain customers’ permission before allowing many overdrafts to go through. Wells Fargo, for instance, reported that the new regulations would cost it $275 million in the fourth quarter alone, Ms. Messick said. The rules, however, do not prohibit banks from processing transactions from largest to smallest. Banks and credit unions had previously bounced checks and charged customers a fee, but many realized that they could make more money if they allowed consumers to overdraw their accounts when making debit purchases or when using an A.T.M., paper checks or regularly scheduled electronic payments. Banks charged a fee for this service of as much as $39 per overdraft, and customers began complaining of being charged for exceeding their balance by only a few dollars. In some instances, consumers complained that they had been charged hundreds of dollars of overdraft fees in a single day. Such problems were compounded by the way that some banks, like Wells Fargo, processed transactions. According to the judge’s ruling, Wells Fargo changed the way that it processed transactions in 2001. When a bank processes the big transactions first, a consumer’s balance goes below zero faster, leading to separate fees for each overdrawn transaction. Wells Fargo and other banks maintain that customers like having their big and important purchases like rent and car payments paid first. But Judge Alsup ripped apart that argument, saying that a small item like a check to a local government might be more important than a large item. “The supposed net benefit of high-to-low resequencing is utterly speculative,” he wrote. “Its bone-crushing multiplication of additional overdraft penalties, however, is categorically assured.” The judge also accused Wells Fargo of going “to lengths to hide these practices while promulgating a facade of phony disclosure.” For instance, he said that customers had learned about the change in how Wells Fargo processed transactions only after they complained about it.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/business/22wells.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo’s Earnings Top Estimates<date>Published: July 21, 2010</date><text>Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest consumer bank, said Wednesday that second-quarter earnings fell 3 percent, to $3.06 billion, as a slowdown in lending was offset by the improvement in the financial health of consumer and corporate borrowers.Wells Fargo released about $500 million it had previously set aside to cover losses and suggested the worst of its troubles were over. Bank executives said that a stronger economy and tighter lending standards had helped control losses and that as long as conditions did not significantly worsen, they expected to release more reserves in coming quarters. “We believe credit quality has indeed turned the corner,” Howard Atkins, Wells Fargo’s chief financial officer, said in a statement. Unlike many of the biggest banks, Wells does not have a large trading operation, so it sidestepped the shaky market conditions that caused sharp declines in profit at Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. But just as at other consumer giants, the bank’s executives warned that the new financial legislation could significantly lower revenue. “We remain concerned that some aspects of regulatory reform may have unintended negative impacts for America’s financial system, consumers and businesses,” John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, said in a statement. The bank’s $3.06 billion profit, which amounts to 55 cents a share, beat analyst expectations. However, it compares with a profit of $3.17 billion, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter was $21.4 billion, down 5 percent. Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 12 percent, to $2.88 billion. Mr. Stumpf said that the bank was making “strong progress” on its merger with the Wachovia Corporation, the troubled lender it acquired during the financial crisis to give it a foothold in the eastern United States. The process, Mr. Stumpf said, was about half finished and had already achieved about 80 percent of the projected annual cost savings. By the end of July, Wells Fargo expects to have converted Wachovia branches in markets like California, Texas and Kansas, where the two banks competed. The bank is expected to convert Wachovia branches in the New York area in early 2011. Bank executives were also pleased with the improvement in credit performance. The bank said charge-offs fell 16 percent in its consumer and corporate loan books, and fewer borrowers were falling behind on their credit card, home equity and mortgage loans. “We have seen credit quality improve earlier and to a greater extent than we had previously expected,” Michael J. Loughlin, Well Fargo’s chief credit and risk officer, said. In particular, the so-called Pick-a-Pay option-ARM mortgages and commercial loans that it acquired with the purchase of Wachovia are performing better than expected. That will allow the bank to book a gain of $506 million in the quarter, and could result in at least another $1.8 billion in additional income over the next several years. The company’s shares closed up 15 cents to $ 26.06.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DE1F3AF937A25754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">An Initiative Pushes Banks On New York Foreclosures<date>Published: July 14, 2010</date><text>Hoping to succeed where Washington has largely failed, New York City's comptroller, John C. Liu, and six large unions plan to begin a campaign on Wednesday to press the biggest banks to do more to prevent foreclosures in the New York area. Mr. Liu said the group would send Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, among others, a letter that criticizes them for dragging their feet on modifying mortgages that are underwater or delinquent, and that urges them to do ''everything possible'' to avert foreclosures. Depending on the response the coalition members get, they might move pension funds and bank deposits to other institutions, according to union officials. ''The federal programs in place just aren't having a desired effect,'' Mr. Liu said in an interview on Tuesday. ''People are losing their homes. It continues to be a drag on our regional economy.'' In the letter, a copy of which was provided in advance to The New York Times, Mr. Liu and the presidents of six of New York's most powerful unions will ask the banks to immediately name a high-level official to handle appeals of borrowers who are denied mortgage loan modifications. Their letter criticizes the banks for ''unanswered phone calls, delays in the modification process and multiple requests for homeowners to resend paperwork already submitted.'' ''Banks like you can do more,'' the comptroller and union presidents write. The coalition will officially announce the effort a news conference on Wednesday. The unions involved are the United Federation of Teachers, the 1199 health care workers union, the Transport Workers Union, the District Council 37 municipal employees union, the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, and Local 32BJ of the service employees union. The group said that 265,000 mortgages in New York State -- 13 percent of all mortgages in the state -- are past due or already in the foreclosure process. The officials ask the banks what efforts they have undertaken to respond promptly to customers' requests about modifying mortgages and to suspend foreclosures while evaluating a borrower's eligibility for loan modification. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said hundreds of teachers and teachers aides faced foreclosure. ''We're trying to help people who are doing the right thing,'' he said. ''It seems that the banks are not really doing a lot on this. They're not trying to negotiate in many instances.'' The letter asks the banks to respond by Sept. 1, with some of the signers suggesting there will be a second letter that demands the banks take specific steps. Federal officials, from President Obama on down, have tried various techniques to persuade banks to make more loan modifications and take other steps to reduce foreclosures. But so far, those steps appear to have done little to stem the foreclosure flood. Mr. Liu said that ''it's premature to talk about sticks,'' like moving city funds out of banks that are deemed unresponsive. But Mr. Mulgrew said he had alerted the trustees of his union's pension fund to the situation, raising the possibility that they might take some action. Union officials say pension funds are hurt by foreclosures because they weaken the economy and hurt bank profits, helping to drive down bank share prices. Richard Simon, a Bank of America spokesman, said his bank had led the industry in addressing the foreclosure crisis. In an e-mail message, he said, ''Bank of America is committed to helping our customers remain in their homes, as demonstrated by 650,000 modifications we have completed since January 2008, including about 160,000 so far this year.'' A Citigroup spokesman, Mark Rodgers, made similar comments. ''In the first quarter of 2010, our various modification and extension programs helped many families stay in their homes in New York State, outnumbering those who were foreclosed by approximately 54 to 1,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Nationally, from Jan. 1, 2007, through March 31, 2010, Citi has helped more than 900,000 homeowners avoid potential foreclosure.'' PHOTO: John C.

But it was also a predatory institution, and the F.T.C., citing Countrywide’s serial abuse of troubled borrowers, extracted a $108 million fine from Bank of America last week. That money will go back to some 200,000 customers whom Countrywide forced to pay outsized fees for foreclosure services. These included billing a borrower $300 to have a property’s lawn mowed and levying $2,500 in trustees’ fees on another borrower, when the going rate for that service was about $600. Though Countrywide’s mortgage contracts specifically barred such practices, they served the company well by generating income during downturns when it was harder to keep making money off new mortgages. This “counter-cyclical diversification strategy,” as Countrywide called it, was designed to “extract the last dollar out of the pockets of the most desperate consumers,” said Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman. Mr. Leibowitz also said Countrywide made bogus claims about what homeowners owed during the resolution of bankruptcy cases and added fees to borrowers’ obligations without notice. His office’s investigation turned up cases in which Countrywide tried to collect improper fees years after a bankruptcy case was over. In some cases, Mr. Leibowitz said, even after a distressed homeowner became up-to-date on all of his or her payments, Countrywide would start another foreclosure proceeding against the same borrower. PRETTY shameful, all in all. But nothing new to lawyers who represent troubled borrowers. They say these kinds of abuses still occur. “We’ve been screaming about these practices for I don’t know how many years now,” said David B. Shaev, a lawyer in New York City who represents consumers. “A lot of the fees seem like nickel-and-dime charges, but they add up to big money. The $108 million in the Countrywide case is the tip of the iceberg.” The other dubious Countrywide actions identified by the F.T.C. — pursuing foreclosure improperly, adding fees without notice — also sound familiar to consumer lawyers across the country. Consider a recent federal bankruptcy case in Houston involving Wells Fargo. The facts of the case were outlined last month in a harsh contempt ruling against the bank by Judge Jeff Bohm. Back in 2003, Antoinette and Lenord De La Fuente filed for bankruptcy protection after they fell behind on their Washington Mutual mortgage. Court filings show they proposed a restructuring plan that called for 60 monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee, who would in turn distribute the money to their creditors. The bankruptcy court agreed to the couple’s plan in June 2004. The couple dutifully made their payments. Wells Fargo took over their loan in June 2007 and the next January sent the couple a letter accusing them of being delinquent by $8,400. Wells told them that they had until mid-February to come up with the money or the bank would start foreclosure proceedings. The court documents show that the borrowers tried unsuccessfully to argue that Wells was wrong. But Wells refused to back down; afraid they would lose their home, the couple struck a forbearance agreement and received a loan modification in April 2008. This loan modification violated the borrowers’ repayment plan. “Wells Fargo frightened the De La Fuentes into making payments to Wells Fargo in violation of the confirmation order,” Judge Bohm wrote. In June 2008, the couple hired a lawyer to investigate the dispute with Wells; they filed a lawsuit against the bank that August. About a year later, Wells offered to settle with the couple. In a court-approved settlement, Wells stated that the couple were indeed current on their $66,572 mortgage and owed no outstanding fees or charges. Wells agreed to pay the couple about $30,000 for their legal fees. With that, the couple thought their problem with Wells had been solved. But in November 2009, Wells told them their mortgage balance had mysteriously increased to almost $71,000, even though they had made all of their payments. Two months later, Mrs. De La Fuente noticed that Wells had reversed several of the mortgage payments she and her husband had made. When she asked Wells why, she was told her loan was in bankruptcy status; if she wanted to resolve the problem, she would have to pay almost $9,000. Late fees were also accruing. The couple and their lawyer went back to court and accused Wells of violating the settlement agreement. After hearing testimony, the court agreed. It also didn’t buy the argument of Wells that errors, including a computer glitch, caused the couple’s problems. “The court certainly agrees that ‘mistakes happen,’ ” Judge Bohm wrote. “However, when mistakes happen not once, not twice, but repeatedly, and when actions are not taken to correct these mistakes within a reasonable period of time, the failure to right the wrong — particularly when the basis for the problem is a months-long violation of an agreed judgment — the excuse of ‘mistakes happen’ has no credence.” Judge Bohm also punted Wells’s claim that its problems with the couple were anomalies. He cited three other federal cases — one in Florida and two in Louisiana — in which Wells improperly collected money from borrowers, applied payments inappropriately, overcharged borrowers or failed to keep accurate records. The judge imposed $11,825 in fines on Wells and required it to pay $4,544 in lawyer’s fees to the De La Fuentes. Teri Schrettenbrunner, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said, “There is no doubt here that we didn’t handle this case well, but it is rare that you see a confluence of this many errors coming together as you did on this case.” She contended that a vast majority of Wells’s mortgage customers are satisfied with it and that its operations are nothing like Countrywide’s. “There are significant contrasts between the way Countrywide did business and the way we do business,” she said. NEVERTHELESS, for imperiled borrowers, the new scrutiny on foreclosure practices is long overdue. Thankfully, the United States Trustee, the Department of Justice unit that oversees the nation’s bankruptcy courts, is also investigating possible improprieties among lenders, mortgage servicers and the law firms that represent them in bankruptcy cases against homeowners. The trustee’s office assisted the F.T.C. in the Countrywide matter. It’s a slow process, to be sure. But at least it is proceeding.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E4DC143CF932A05756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">THE NEW POOR; Decades of Gains Vanish for Blacks in Memphis<date>Published: May 31, 2010</date><text>MEMPHIS -- For two decades, Tyrone Banks was one of many African-Americans who saw his economic prospects brightening in this Mississippi River city. A single father, he worked for FedEx and also as a custodian, built a handsome brick home, had a retirement account and put his eldest daughter through college. Then the Great Recession rolled in like a fog bank. He refinanced his mortgage at a rate that adjusted sharply upward, and afterward he lost one of his jobs. Now Mr. Banks faces bankruptcy and foreclosure. ''I'm going to tell you the deal, plain-spoken: I'm a black man from the projects and I clean toilets and mop up for a living,'' said Mr. Banks, a trim man who looks at least a decade younger than his 50 years. ''I'm proud of what I've accomplished. But my whole life is backfiring.'' Not so long ago, Memphis, a city where a majority of the residents are black, was a symbol of a South where racial history no longer tightly constrained the choices of a rising black working and middle class. Now this city epitomizes something more grim: How rising unemployment and growing foreclosures in the recession have combined to destroy black wealth and income and erase two decades of slow progress. The median income of black homeowners in Memphis rose steadily until five or six years ago. Now it has receded to a level below that of 1990 -- and roughly half that of white Memphis homeowners, according to an analysis conducted by Queens College Sociology Department for The New York Times. Black middle-class neighborhoods are hollowed out, with prices plummeting and homes standing vacant in places like Orange Mound, White Haven and Cordova. As job losses mount -- black unemployment here, mirroring national trends, has risen to 16.9 percent from 9 percent two years ago; it stands at 5.3 percent for whites -- many blacks speak of draining savings and retirement accounts in an effort to hold onto their homes. The overall local foreclosure rate is roughly twice the national average. The repercussions will be long-lasting, in Memphis and nationwide. The most acute economic divide in America remains the steadily widening gap between the wealth of black and white families, according to a recent study by the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University. For every dollar of wealth owned by a white family, a black or Latino family owns just 16 cents, according to a recent Federal Reserve study. The Economic Policy Institute's forthcoming ''The State of Working America'' analyzed the recession-driven drop in wealth. As of December 2009, median white wealth dipped 34 percent, to $94,600; median black wealth dropped 77 percent, to $2,100. So the chasm widens, and Memphis is left to deal with the consequences. ''This cancer is metastasizing into an economic crisis for the city,'' said Mayor A. C. Wharton Jr. in his riverfront office. ''It's done more to set us back than anything since the beginning of the civil rights movement.'' The mayor and former bank loan officers point a finger of blame at large national banks -- in particular, Wells Fargo. During the last decade, they say, these banks singled out blacks in Memphis to sell them risky high-cost mortgages and consumer loans. The City of Memphis and Shelby County sued Wells Fargo late last year, asserting that the bank's foreclosure rate in predominantly black neighborhoods was nearly seven times that of the foreclosure rate in predominantly white neighborhoods. Other banks, including Citibank and Countrywide, foreclosed in more equal measure. In a recent regulatory filing, Wells Fargo hinted that its legal troubles could multiply. ''Certain government entities are conducting investigations into the mortgage lending practices of various Wells Fargo affiliated entities, including whether borrowers were steered to more costly mortgage products,'' the bank stated. Wells Fargo officials are not backing down in the face of the legal attacks. They say the bank made more prime loans and has foreclosed on fewer homes than most banks, and that the worst offenders -- those banks that handed out bushels of no-money-down, negative-amortization loans -- have gone out of business.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/realestate/25mort.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">N.A.A.C.P. Accord With Wells Fargo May Be a Harbinger<date>Published: April 23, 2010</date><text>A DECISION this month by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to drop its racial-discrimination lawsuit against Wells Fargo in exchange for a say in reviewing its lending practices could set the stage for similar agreements with other big mortgage lenders, some experts say. From 2007 to 2009, the N.A.A.C.P. filed suit against 15 lenders, accusing them of offering high-cost loans to many black borrowers during the subprime lending boom, even though many of the applicants could have qualified for lower interest rates and closing costs. Wells Fargo, the first of the lenders to end the litigation, agreed to allow the N.A.A.C.P. to review its lending practices and recommend ways to “improve credit availability to African American and diverse businesses and consumers,” according to a statement by the N.A.A.C.P. Benjamin Todd Jealous, the group’s president, said Wells Fargo would give his staff access to lending data typically provided only to federal regulators; if discriminatory trends were discovered, Wells Fargo’s executives would be apprised. Wells Fargo and the N.A.A.C.P. will also collaborate on outreach programs to help persuade struggling borrowers to seek help, according to Jon Campbell, Wells Fargo’s executive vice president for social responsibility. When the bank is actually able to meet with borrowers, he said, they are able to avoid foreclosure nearly half the time. Kenneth D. Wade, the chief executive of NeighborWorks America, a nonprofit group that assists homeowners, said he supported the N.A.A.C.P.’s contention that many minority borrowers had faced racial discrimination when they applied for loans during the mortgage bubble. “People of color were disproportionately impacted by the subprime debacle,” he said. “And it’s likely going to result in the largest loss of wealth for African-Americans and Latinos in the country’s history.” Mr. Wade added that the agreement between Wells Fargo and the N.A.A.C.P. would have broader implications for all lenders. “It serves notice on the sector as a whole,” he said, “to look at their policies, procedures and practices and make sure they’re not doing anything that could subject them to litigation risks.” Mr. Jealous said he was optimistic that the N.A.A.C.P. would reach similar agreements with Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, which the N.A.A.C.P. is also suing. He added that he also hoped to negotiate such an agreement with Bank of America, which is not part of the lawsuit. “Bankers were using affinity-based marketing — for instance, going into churches and other networks and aggressively marketing,” Mr. Jealous said, and as a result, the borrowers often believed that the lenders’ offers were trustworthy. He added that when his group was reviewing complaints of racially discriminatory lending, the greater New York City area was among the regions with the most complaints. These days fewer minorities are being steered toward subprime loans, said Brian Kabateck, a lawyer representing the N.A.A.C.P. in its remaining lawsuits, though largely because lenders have stopped offering subprime loans. Mr. Kabateck said he was now tracking loan modifications. “Blacks are having a harder time keeping their homes,” he said, “and it’s not just related to their ability to pay or not pay.” Mr. Wade of NeighborWorks America said that in the past three years his organization had worked with about 950,000 borrowers through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program and more than half of them were minorities. Meanwhile, Mr. Campbell of Wells Fargo said that the bank’s lending policies would not immediately change as a direct result of the agreement with the N.A.A.C.P. “But now we have a partner, and we can look at ourselves through their lens,” he said. “Will there be tweaks? We hope so.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D71730F937A15757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Corrections<date>Published: April 24, 2010</date><text>An article in some editions on Wednesday about a legal motion to hold Wells Fargo bank or LNR Property responsible for the upkeep of 10 buildings in the Bronx that are in foreclosure overstated the bank's financial involvement.

(AP) — Wells Fargo &amp; Company said Wednesday that its first-quarter net income declined 16 percent to $2.54 billion as the bank dealt with continuing losses on consumer loans. However, the bank said it had “turned the corner” with its credit problems. Income in the quarter a year ago was $3.04 billion. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo joined other big banks in the most recent quarter in reporting improvement in their consumer loan businesses. Wells Fargo set aside $5.3 billion to cover soured loans during the quarter, down 9.9 percent from $5.9 billion in the previous quarter. A year earlier, it had set aside $4.6 billion. Many analysts predict loan losses should peak some time in the first half of 2010. “We believe quarterly provision expenses and quarterly total credit losses have peaked,” the chief credit and risk officer Mike Loughlin said in a statement. Wells Fargo earned 45 cents per share after payment of dividends on preferred stock, versus $2.38 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts expected profit of 42 cents per share in the most recent quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 2 percent to $21.4 billion. As one of the biggest banks in the country, Wells Fargo’s performance provides insight into the current financial state of consumers. With the acquisition of the Wachovia Corporation in late 2008, its operations now stretch across the country.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CEFD9143FF932A15757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Bid to Make Banks Fix Crumbling Bronx Properties<date>Published: April 21, 2010</date><text>The hot water was out again on Tuesday, so Maria Paulino, a woman of 103 years, had to bathe with a pan of water heated on the stove. Upstairs, Frank Jenkins stepped over a pile of debris in his kitchen to check on the gaping hole in his ceiling. In the hallway, a shattered window refracted light across graffiti that cursed the management. This building in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, along with nine others owned by Milbank Real Estate, went into foreclosure last year when Milbank defaulted on its $35 million mortgage, which the rents could never support. Since then, the tenants have been left to watch conditions deteriorate -- there are now more than 900 open violations on Ms. Paulino's Heath Avenue building alone -- as their homes wind through the foreclosure process. But now, tenants and housing lawyers have hit upon a novel strategy intended to make the bank that owns the mortgage responsible for upkeep and repairs. The approach has been embraced by housing advocates and backed by City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who said that it could be replicated at foreclosed properties across the city, offering relief to tenants stuck in crumbling buildings. Legal Services NYC-Bronx plans to file a motion on Wednesday in State Supreme Court in the Bronx asking Justice Stanley B. Green to order Wells Fargo, the bank that owns the mortgage, or LNR Property, the ''special servicer'' handling the troubled loan, to repair the buildings. ''If you are the bank that lent money to someone you shouldn't have and those people walk away from those buildings, the clear result would be that the bank is on the hook,'' said Ms. Quinn, who helped form a city task force on financially distressed rental housing last year. ''The games of delay and passing the buck are no longer going to be tolerated.'' Housing advocates estimate that 4,700 apartments in dozens of buildings across New York City are in foreclosure, and that about 110,000 apartments are at risk. During a typical foreclosure, the court appoints a receiver to maintain the properties. But in overleveraged buildings, like the ones owned by Milbank, the rent rolls do not nearly cover the maintenance costs, let alone the millions of dollars needed for repairs. The buildings are unable to sustain themselves and get stuck in what Ms. Quinn called ''a lost world of ownership.'' The strategy being employed at the Milbank properties would put the responsibility for those buildings squarely on the banks, a step that advocates say will be crucial in staving off a housing crisis. ''The building is falling apart, and the banks are saying, 'What do you want us to do?' '' said Dina Levy of the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board, a tenant advocacy group. ''Well, they're responsible. They put the buildings underwater; now they're the one who are going to have to fix it.'' Ms. Quinn and organizers from the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition were to join tenants at a news conference on Wednesday morning to announce the legal motion. Milbank Real Estate, a Los Angeles firm, was one of many private equity investors that bought property in low-income neighborhoods in New York during the housing boom, betting on a wave of gentrification that would bring in new tenants willing to pay top-dollar rents. The strategy was to force out the longtime tenants, renovate the building and raise the rent drastically.Milbank bought 10 properties in the Bronx with a $35 million mortgage from Deutsche Bank, which in turn sold the mortgage into a commercial mortgage-backed security that is now controlled by Wells Fargo. Milbank laid out its approach on its Web site, billing itself as a specialist in ''litigation related to evictions,'' and suggesting it would push for ''an improved tenant base'' in the Bronx, which was ''positioned to undergo significant gentrification.'' LNR and Wells Fargo declined to comment, and Milbank did not return a call for comment. The tenant advocates' legal strategy poses some risks. If Justice Green holds the bank responsible, the move could discourage other banks from entering foreclosure proceedings on other properties, leaving buildings to sink deeper into limbo. ''It is certainly not a magic bullet,'' Ms. Levy said. ''This is one tool in an arsenal of tools that we need to combat this really atrocious problem.'' Jonathan Levy, the lawyer writing the motion, said: ''We think there's a very clear ethical or moral responsibility here. We're trying to establish the legal responsibility.'' Alvin Horton lives in a Milbank building on Holland Avenue in the Bronx. In the years since Milbank bought the building, he said squatters had started sleeping on the roof, ceiling leaks had gone unrepaired, and heat had been sporadic. ''They bought all these buildings and wanted to make money off them, but they didn't care how the tenants were doing,'' he said.

In the last year and a half, the largest financial institutions have only grown bigger, mainly as a result of government-brokered mergers. They now enjoy borrowing at significantly lower rates than their smaller competitors, a result of the bond markets' implicit assumption that the giant banks are ''too big to fail.'' In the sweeping legislation before the Senate, there is no attempt to break up big banks as a means of creating a less risky financial system. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve officials have rejected calls for doing so, saying bank size alone is not the most important threat. Instead, the bill directs regulators to compel the largest banks to hold more capital as a cushion against losses. It sets up a procedure intended to allow big banks to fail, with the cost borne not by taxpayers but by the biggest financial institutions. As the debate over the regulatory overhaul heated up this week, a populist minority in both Congress and the Fed requested a revisit to the size issue. They would like to go beyond a provision in the bill, suggested by Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, and supported by President Obama, that would seek to keep banks from growing any larger but not force any to shrink. ''By splitting up these megabanks, we by definition will make them smaller, safer and more manageable,'' Senator Edward E. Kaufman Jr., Democrat of Delaware, said in a speech Tuesday. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Richard W. Fisher, broke ranks with most of his colleagues within the central bank last week, declaring, ''The disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding institutions that are too big to fail is to dismantle them over time into institutions that can be prudently managed and regulated across borders.'' There also has been concern about the size of banks from Republicans who believe in free-market principles. Several senators from the South and West -- Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, John Cornyn of Texas and John McCain of Arizona -- have expressed a desire to revisit the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking. Alan Greenspan, the former Fed chairman, has entertained the idea of splitting up the banks but has stopped short of advocating it. ''If they're too big to fail, they're too big,'' he said in an October speech. He added: ''In 1911, we broke up Standard Oil. So what happened? The individual parts became more valuable than the whole. Maybe that's what we need.'' In January, the White House embraced a proposal by Mr. Volcker that would ban banks that take customer deposits from running their own proprietary trading operations, or making market bets with their own money. It would also limit the share of all financial liabilities that any one institution can hold -- besides deposits -- but it would be up to regulators to set the limit. A federal law enacted in 1994 already addresses size by restricting any bank from holding more than 10 percent of the nation's deposits, although several of the largest banks have been granted waivers from that requirement or used loopholes to evade its intent. The Volcker proposal resembled an amendment by Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, that would let regulators dismantle financial companies so large, interconnected or risky that their failure would jeopardize the entire system. The amendment was part of a regulatory overhaul that the House adopted in December, largely along party lines, and is also in the Senate version in a modified form. At a hearing on Tuesday about the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, which caused credit markets to seize up in September 2008, the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, reiterated that his preference was to limit the risky behavior of banks rather than break them up.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/opinion/16fri1.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Fighting Foreclosures<date>Published: April 15, 2010</date><text>From the start, the central concern about President Obama’s antiforeclosure effort has been that it would postpone foreclosures but ultimately not prevent enough to ease the economic strain from mass defaults.

But an official at one of the banks, David Lowman of JPMorgan Chase, said principal reduction could reward households for consuming more than they could afford, might punish future homeowners by raising the cost of borrowing and in any case was simply unworkable. “We are concerned about large-scale broad-based principal reduction programs,” Mr. Lowman, the bank’s chief executive for home lending, testified during a hearing of the House Financial Services committee. Mr. Lowman’s comments were briefly echoed in more restrained form by an executive from Wells Fargo. “Principal forgiveness is not an across-the-board solution,” said the executive, Mike Heid, co-president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. Two other bankers who testified, from Bank of America and Citigroup, largely avoided the issue. A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the hearing. The government modification program has been under attack by lawmakers and community groups for doing too little too slowly. The Congressional Oversight Panel is issuing a report Wednesday that says, “Treasury’s response continues to lag well behind the pace of the crisis.” In response, the Treasury Department said that its latest modification report, also to be released Wednesday, showed that the number of permanent modifications grew in March to 230,000 households, an increase of 35 percent from the previous month. The Treasury also stressed it was still introducing programs, including those aimed at reducing mortgage principal. The testimony on Tuesday, however, offered the first public acknowledgment that these latest foreclosure prevention measures might encounter some resistance among banks, ultimately rendering them less effective than hoped. One of the new government programs will require lenders to strongly consider reducing the mortgage balance for distressed borrowers who qualify for the government’s modification plan. A more radical plan urges lenders to refinance loans for borrowers who may be solvent but who owe much more on their homes than they are worth. Many of these loans have been securitized into investment pools but are serviced by the big banks. The investment pool would get the mortgage off its books for the current market value of the property — less than it is owed, perhaps, but more than it would receive if the house went into foreclosure. The borrower would receive a new government-insured loan at market value, presumably making him less likely to walk away. It is this last program that seemed to irk JPMorgan Chase. “If we rewrite the mortgage contract retroactively to restore equity to any mortgage borrower because the value of his or her home declined, what responsible lender will take the equity risk of financing mortgages in the future?” Mr. Lowman asked in his prepared comments. In any case, he said, Chase cannot rewrite most of these deals. The bank’s contractual arrangements with the investors do not allow for principal reduction. Furthermore, Mr. Lowman argued, the cost of reducing principal will be built into future loans, resulting in less access to credit and higher costs for consumers. What Chase — one of the strongest of the big banks — might be really worried about is not the primary mortgages it services but the $133 billion in home equity loans and lines of credit it carries on its own books. The question of what happens to these secondary loans in a mortgage modification was at the heart of the Congressional hearing on Tuesday. Investors who own the primary loans argue that the others should be second in line, getting only the money that is left over after they have been satisfied. But banks like Chase, which own the majority of second loans, want a better deal. Since they have the power to disrupt any modification, the result so far has been a standoff. Alan M. White, an assistant professor at Valparaiso University School of Law who has closely studied the various modification plans, said, “Chase and Wells are attacking a straw man. Nobody is arguing for across-the-board principal reduction. But I think that they feel a need to push back hard on any attempts to get them to write down the troubled second mortgages and home equity lines of credit in their portfolios.” Mr. Lowman emphasized the moral side of the issue. Mandating write-downs in home equity loans would be a particularly bad idea, he said, because these loans were simply used to consume rather than pay for housing.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/business/11haggler.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">At Cisco and Wells Fargo, Communication Breakdowns<date>Published: April 10, 2010</date><text>LET’S start with an update about the Flip video camera. The Haggler wrote recently about a manufacturing flaw with the device’s USB arm, the doodad that links it to your computer. At the time, Flip representatives offered assurances that the problem had been fixed, so a few weeks ago, the Haggler bought one — a sleek, silvery contraption that came in a nifty black box.Unfortunately, it had a faulty USB arm and would not link to the Haggler’s iMac. So the Haggler returned it for a replacement, which also had a faulty USB arm. That one also expired — no vital signs but for a recording light — the first time it was used. So the Haggler sent it to the manufacturer, Cisco Systems. A few days later this e-mail message arrived, copied here verbatim: “Flip Video has removed the model numberDVD-DATA-RECOVERYfrom RMA number 700806.” Would you care to guess, dear reader, at the meaning of these words? Good luck. A service rep subsequently explained the mystery: This was Cisco’s way of saying that whatever videos were on the Flip could not be recovered to a DVD and returned to you. Well, duh. It seems a bit odd to send the gibberish e-mail first and the translation later, and only if you express bewilderment. Here’s an idea that may sound insane but humor the Haggler for a moment: Perhaps Cisco could offer the translation first and then the gibberish to anyone who found it too straightforward. Karen Sohn, a Cisco P.R. rep said via e-mail that the company was revising this correspondence with customers and would send the new language as soon as it had been drafted. The Haggler was going to offer a simple alternative: “Hey Flip customer. In case you were hoping we’d retrieve the videos on your camera — we can’t. Sorry. Bye.” Then Ms. Sohn called to say that the company was unable to change the wording because — well, it just can’t, O.K.? Yes, Cisco is a tech company, but apparently it is powerless to alter the software that generates the language of this particular e-mail. “So we decided to stop sending it,” Ms. Sohn said. Yahtzee! Problem solved. Next. Q. A few months ago, I borrowed about $5,000 through my Wells Fargo line of credit and promptly paid it back, plus interest, in a couple of weeks. I know from past experience that when you pay off loans like this, you need to check whether there is any residual interest that posts at the end of a 30-day account cycle. The reason is that interest accrues in real time, and given the slight lag between when you transfer the money and when it actually lands in your account, there is often a difference between what you paid and how much you actually owe. So the vigilant consumer that I am, I looked at my account for several weeks, just to be sure I had paid off the whole loan. Each time, the balance in my line of credit account was zero. A couple months later, a Wells Fargo collections agent called and spoke to me as if I were a felon. Seems I actually had owed about $30 in that line of credit account, and now that it was overdue by three months, I also owed $117 ($39 a month) in late fees. Here’s the galling part: The $30 in interest that caused those late fees never showed up in my line-of-credit account when I checked online. Ever. The rep said I was looking in the wrong place. If I’d opened a PDF file linked to my account page, she explained, I would have seen the actual sum that I owed. But why would I open any file, or check anywhere else on the site, when my home page at Wells Fargo plainly tells me that I owe nothing? Here’s a variation on the same question: Why put the accurate number in a PDF file and an inaccurate number where customers routinely look? Would it be too cynical to suggest that this is about generating fees? Heather Gramp Portland, Ore. A. We put this question to Lisa Westermann, a Wells Fargo P.R. rep. She explained that the home page of online accounts will list principal owed but not interest and fees. Why? Because the interest and fees change, often day to day. To which the Haggler replied, "And that’s a problem because?" Seriously, if you can keep that ever-changing information up to date in a PDF file, why not on the customer’s account page? And if you really lack the technology to keep the account page accurate, why not just tell customers: “Hey, you owe fees and interest. Call us.” That would be more helpful than posting “$0.” Ms. Westermann and the Haggler went around and around on this one for a few minutes on the phone. She said it suffices that there is a sentence on the Web site instructing customers to click that PDF file for a more complete view of their accounts. The Haggler: “Why not just alert customers that they are on the hook for fees and interest?” Ms. Westermann: “Because those change.” And around and around we went again. This was threatening to become one of those circular conversations that ends with you making the face from that guy in “The Scream.” Until Ms. Westermann said that Wells Fargo “will be fixing this; it’s just a matter of figuring out the best way to fix it.” Ah, Wells Fargo isn’t trying to snooker its customers! It just needs some advice on a fix. So how about this? Instead of an account page that says “$0” when fees and interest are owed, how about if it said “NOT $0” when fees and interest are owed? Double Yahtzee! That’s comped, Wells Fargo. The next brilliant idea is going to cost you.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/business/18launder.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wachovia and U.S. Settle a Money Laundering Case<date>Published: March 17, 2010</date><text>MIAMI (Reuters) — The Wachovia Bank, a unit of Wells Fargo &amp; Company, has agreed to pay $160 million to settle accusations that it laundered Mexican drug money. Under the agreement, Wachovia will forfeit $110 million, representing the proceeds of illegal narcotics sales that were laundered through the bank, the United States attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida said. The bank will pay an additional $50 million fine to the Treasury. A deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department resolved charges that the bank had willfully failed to establish a program to guard against money laundering. It also resolved Wachovia’s admitted failure to identify, detect and report suspicious transactions in third-party payment processor accounts. A Wachovia representative was not immediately available for comment. The federal prosecutor in Miami began an investigation about three years ago, focusing on the supposed role of a Wachovia unit in processing illegal money transfers for Mexican exchange houses along the border between the United States and Mexico. The investigation predated Wachovia’s takeover by Wells Fargo. Before the settlement, Wachovia said it was cooperating and was “committed to maintaining compliant and effective antimoney-laundering policies and practices, and a strong compliance and risk management culture.” Exchange houses in Mexico are part of the global remittance business that allows immigrants in the United States to send money back to relatives in Latin America. Federal officials say drug traffickers have used the money transfer business as a way to move cash around.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7DC143CF937A35750C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo Chief Earns $21 Million<date>Published: March 4, 2010</date><text>Wells Fargo paid its chief executive, John G. Stumpf, compensation worth $21.3 million for 2009, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Stumpf's compensation included a salary of $5.6 million in cash and stock, and stock awards of more than $13 million. Last year, he received total compensation of $8.8 million, according to the filing. Other banks have yet to file preliminary proxy statements, but Goldman Sachs said in filings last month that its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, would receive a $9 million stock bonus. JPMorgan Chase is set to give its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, a $16 million stock payout for 2009. Wells Fargo said in December that Mr. Stumpf would receive a stock payout worth about $10 million but would not receive a cash bonus. Wells Fargo, which reported a profit of $12.3 billion in 2009, said last month it would give shareholders a ''say on pay'' vote at its annual meeting on April 27. This would be only the second such vote in the company's history. Stock in Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, rose 33 cents, to $28.20 a share on Wednesday. The shares are up 4.5 percent this year, after falling 8.4 percent in 2009.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04EEDD113FF932A25751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Top Pay List For Bankers: Fresh Names<date>Published: February 11, 2010</date><text>The list of the biggest earners in finance usually reads like a Who's Who of Wall Street. But these days, it reads more like a Who's That? It turns out that some of the highest-paid financial executives in America work far from the canyons of Lower Manhattan, at companies that have largely avoided the outcry over the return of hefty paydays on Wall Street. Topping the list is John G. Stumpf, head of Wells Fargo, the bank based in San Francisco, according to an analysis of 2009 compensation in the industry. Mr. Stumpf was paid a personal best of $18.7 million in cash and stock for 2009 -- up 64 percent from 2007, just before the financial crisis struck. Mr. Stumpf is making twice as much as Lloyd C. Blankfein, his counterpart at Goldman Sachs. Mr. Blankfein -- who for many Americans has come to symbolize this new period of Wall Street riches -- was paid $9.7 million for 2009, less than some expected. It is a stunning reversal in the old pecking order of pay. Big names on Wall Street like Mr. Blankfein usually take home far more than staid bankers like Mr. Stumpf, whose bank's biggest business is making home mortgages and loans to corporations. But since the bailout, the rules of banker pay are bending. Some of the industry's biggest names are being paid less than relative unknowns. Chief executives, who are usually at the top of the pay heap, are taking home roughly the same amounts as executives who work for them -- and sometimes less. Mr. Stumpf and other executives have moved up the pay ladder partly because the likes of Mr. Blankfein have moved down. And for all the focus on what top executives earn, what is most startling is how many six-, seven- and eight-figure sums are being awarded to Wall Street bankers and traders whose pay often is unnoticed -- if it is disclosed at all. How much senior executives earn, in cash and stock, is made public in corporate filings. This year, the results are surprising, according to an analysis by Equilar, an executive compensation research firm. Leaders in the pay sweepstakes include the heads of the credit card giants Visa, Mastercard Worldwide, Capital One Financial and American Express. Joseph W. Saunders, who runs Visa, was paid about $15.5 million, a figure that vastly eclipses the compensation for top executives at Bank of America and Citigroup. Ajay Banga, the president of MasterCard Worldwide; Laurence D. Fink, the chairman and chief executive of the giant money management company BlackRock; and Richard B. Handler, the boss at the Jefferies Group, a midsize investment bank that is virtually unknown outside financial circles, were each paid about $13 million. Executives at certain discount brokerages, insurance companies and regional banks were close behind. The big money, as ever, is in Wall Street trading. But pay for employees with few executive responsibilities is typically exempted from disclosure requirements. Brokers and asset managers also land windfalls that are often undisclosed. ''There are probably thousands of people that are in the Millionaire Club -- or even the Ten Millionaire Club -- that have gotten no heat,'' said Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant. To be sure, a handful of prominent companies dominate the well-paid list. Senior managers from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs occupy many of the top spots. Few of those executives are boldface names, however. While Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, appears to be the second-highest-paid banker, at $17.6 million, one of his subordinates collected nearly as much: Ina R. Drew, JPMorgan's chief investment officer. Ms. Drew, whose correct calls on interest rates helped the bank earn several billion dollars of profit, was paid about $13 million. Despite the spotlight on Mr. Blankfein's pay at Goldman, little was said about how much Gordon Nixon of Royal Bank of Canada received. His paycheck was roughly the same amount as Mr. Blankfein's, $9.7 million, though he is hardly a household name. The Equilar analysis provides an early peek at 2009 pay and is not a comprehensive review. For consistency, any stock or options that were subject to performance hurdles were valued at the target levels; in practice, many executives receive larger payouts for surpassing the company's financial goals. Wells Fargo posted strong results, even as it struggled to contend with rising mortgage and commercial real estate losses and accepted a bailout from the government in 2008.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/business/04bribe.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">U.S. Report Details Money Laundering<date>Published: February 3, 2010</date><text>A suitcase containing $1 million in shrink-wrapped bills, hand-carried into New York by the former president of Gabon for his daughter to buy a Manhattan apartment.

These and other deals and money transfers took place in recent years because of inadequate controls on money laundering at large American banks and unregulated American lawyers, real estate agents and lobbyists, according to a Senate report released late Wednesday. The 325-page report by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which will conduct a hearing on Thursday, sheds new light on how banks like Citigroup, Wachovia and Bank of America unwittingly shifted hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of African politicians, their relatives and associates. The banks ended up closing or restricting the accounts and cooperated with the subcommittee, offering comments on individual transactions. In all cases, the Senate report says, the banks ignored controls intended to prevent money laundering and related screens on PEP, meaning politically exposed persons  high-risk clients from corrupt countries. The report recommends strengthening regulations against money laundering at banks and revoking exemptions for lawyers and other third parties from restrictions on money laundering in the USA Patriot Act. It recommends that Congress pass laws requiring people who form corporations to disclose the true owners. The report, brimming with bank statements and internal e-mail messages, contains four case studies. “Together, these four case histories demonstrate the need for the United States to strengthen its PEP controls to prevent corrupt foreign officials, their relatives and close associates from using U.S. professionals and financial institutions to conceal, protect and utilize their ill-gotten gains,” it says. The report details how Teodoro Nguema Obiang, the son of Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the president of Equatorial Guinea, used lawyers, bankers, real estate agents and escrow agents, all Americans, from 2004 through 2008 to move more than $110 million into the United States, including $100 million through Wachovia and Citibank. Mr. Obiang, the subject of a criminal investigation into charges of money laundering, bribery and extortion, also employed Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood, a law firm now known as Sidley Austin, to help him buy a $38.5 million Gulfstream G-5 jet in 2005, the report says. Janet Zagorin, a spokeswoman for the firm, did not return telephone calls seeking comment. The report says two American lawyers, Michael Berger and George Nagler, helped Mr. Obiang circumvent controls at the banks by setting up accounts for shell companies with names like Beautiful Vision, Unlimited Horizon and Sweet Pink, named on honor of the rapper Eve, Mr. Obiang’s girlfriend at the time. Mr. Obiang, Equatorial Guinea’s minister of agriculture and forestry, used the accounts to pay his personal expenses, including chefs and butlers for his home in Malibu, Calif., and bills at Ferrari of Beverly Hills and Dolce &amp; Gabbana, receipts cited in the report show. He also arranged for Mr. Berger to be invited to the 2007 “Kandy Halloween Bash” at the Playboy Mansion, the report says. It says Mr. Obiang hired two American real estate agents to help him buy the $30 million home in Malibu, with suspect money transferred from Equatorial Guinea. The report also details how in recent years an American lobbyist, Jeffrey Birrell, helped the former president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, buy six armored vehicles, including the Hummer, and obtain United States government permission to buy six C-130 military cargo aircraft to support his government, all suspect transactions. The purchases were routed through accounts set up at HSBC, Commerce Bank and JPMorgan Chase, the report says.

But some, like Wells Fargo, are wary of rising interest rates. Higher rates overall might encourage them to lend, but simultaneously could reduce their capacity to do so. It’s a tricky problem. Skip to next paragraph James Estrin/The New York Times John G. Stumpf, head of Wells Fargo, believes banks are wise to hold back. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Berkshire Hathaway Inc Go to your Portfolio » When long-term interest rates are substantially higher than short-term rates  a situation known as a steep yield curve  banks should be able to profit by borrowing cheaply in the short term and lending for longer periods at higher rates. But this time around, the net interest margins at American banks are not tracking the steepness of the yield curve as they generally have in the past, according to FBR Research. That’s partly because banks do not seem to be lending as much as they have the capacity for. Demand for loans is hardly healthy: economic weakness means a dearth of interested and creditworthy borrowers. But as John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, noted during the bank’s earnings call on Wednesday, banks also have reasons to hold back. First, accumulating cash and highly liquid securities protects them from the volatility of credit markets and prepares them for stricter liquidity requirements expected from regulators. Second, although the yield curve is steep, interest rates are low  near zero over the short term. Many banks currently have to pay more than that for deposits, so they do not get the benefit of the interest rate gap even when they do lend. And Mr. Stumpf and other bank chiefs worry that if they make loans now, rising short-term rates over the loans’ life will eat away their profits. As a result, FBR believes that many banks will not really have the motivation to lend more aggressively until the Federal Reserve starts raising short-term rates. The trouble is, higher interest rates over all tend to cause the value of credit assets to fall. That in turn would generate fresh losses for banks, depleting their capital and reducing their capacity to lend. It’s a conundrum for the banks as well as for the Fed as it tries to set monetary policy. Defying the Oracle Irene Rosenfeld is clearly feeling lucky. Ms. Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft Foods, raised her price to secure Cadbury’s agreement to a takeover. But in reducing the stock component, she also removed a chance of Warren E. Buffett voting against the deal. Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which is Kraft’s biggest shareholder, had already expressed concern about the deal as Ms. Rosenfeld was lining it up. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett, an investing legend, told CNBC that he was doubtful about the transaction this week and would vote against it if he could. But he can’t. Ms. Rosenfeld increased Kraft’s bid for Cadbury to 850 pence a share (about $13.92), to total some $19 billion. By adding to the cash component, she reduced the stock Kraft needed to issue to 18 percent of what was already outstanding. That neatly ducked under the 20 percent threshold that would have required shareholder approval under New York Stock Exchange rules. Reducing the stock component does nod to one of Mr. Buffett’s objections, namely that Kraft’s stock is undervalued and therefore would be an expensive acquisition currency. And other influential shareholders support the deal, including William A. Ackman of the activist hedge fund Pershing Square. But it’s gutsy to go against a big shareholder, especially one with Mr. Buffett’s aura. Sure, it appears to be a disagreement primarily about price rather than overall strategy; Mr. Buffett says he will not sell his shares and still speaks highly of Ms. Rosenfeld. Even so, it leaves her especially exposed to the slightest mishap as the deal unfolds. Kraft’s chief must be aware of this. And it looks as if she has a margin of safety. The stated expectations for cost savings, for instance, have barely changed since the initial hostile bid. With Cadbury now on board, it should be possible to cut more than the mooted 7 percent or so of sales. If Kraft shares do strengthen sustainably, Ms. Rosenfeld will no doubt gladly debate Mr. Buffett about whether they did so because of, or in spite of, the Cadbury deal. Ms. Rosenfeld’s alternative  defending a deal done against her biggest shareholder’s judgment with nothing in Kraft’s share price to show for it  would be a much less attractive proposition.

Fights Bias in Lending<date>Published: January 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON  The Justice Department is beginning a major campaign against banks and mortgage brokers suspected of discriminating against minority applicants in lending, opening a new front in the Obama administration’s response to the foreclosure crisis. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Foreclosures Tom Perez, the assistant attorney general for the department’s Civil Rights Division, is expected to announce Thursday in New York that the administration is creating a new unit that will focus exclusively on unfair lending practices. “We are looking at any and every practice in the industry,” Mr. Perez said in a recent interview. As part of an expansion of the Civil Rights Division approved by Congress last year, the Justice Department is hiring at least four lawyers and an economist for the new unit, while about half a dozen current staff members will transfer into it. Mr. Perez plans to formally announce the new unit at the “Wall Street Project” conference organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. He characterized the effort as a major turnaround, and criticized the previous administration as failing to scrutinize lending practices amid the subprime mortgage boom. While past lending discrimination cases primarily focused on “redlining”  a bank’s refusal to lend to qualified borrowers in minority areas  the new push will instead center on a more recent phenomenon critics have called “reverse redlining.” In reverse redlining, a mortgage brokerage or bank systematically singles out minority neighborhoods for loans with inferior terms like high up-front fees, high interest rates and lax underwriting practices. Because the original lender would typically resell such a loan after collecting its fees, it did not care about the risk of foreclosure. It is a rarely used theory, and it carries political risks. Some critics have contended that government rules pushing banks to lend to minority and low-income borrowers contributed to the financial meltdown. The campaign could rekindle that debate. “They encourage lenders to make risky loans for reasons such as diversity, and then when lenders have a problem because they made too many risky loans, they condemn them for that,” said Ernest Istook, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and a former Republican congressman from Oklahoma. Still, Mr. Istook emphasized that he was “not defending anybody who engages in wrongful redlining practices.” A representative of the Mortgage Bankers Association, the lobbying arm of the real estate finance industry, did not respond to a request for comment. Under federal civil rights laws, a lending practice is illegal if it has a disparate impact on minority borrowers, and the Obama administration is signaling that it intends to make the enforcing of fair lending laws a signature policy push in 2010. The division has already opened 38 investigations into accusations of lending discrimination. Under federal lending laws, it can seek compensation for borrowers who were victimized by any illegal conduct, as well as changes in a lender’s practices. John Relman, a housing lawyer, said there was plenty of evidence that some banks violated fair housing laws during the subprime boom. Mr. Relman has helped the Cities of Baltimore and Memphis sue Wells Fargo over the costs taxpayers incurred because of foreclosures. As part of those lawsuits, he obtained affidavits from former Wells Fargo loan officers who said the bank had systematically singled out minority borrowers for high-interest, high-fee mortgages, bypassing its own underwriting rules. The State of Illinois has also sued the bank. Wells Fargo has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, a judge dismissed Baltimore’s lawsuit, saying there were too many other causes of the damage to inner-city neighborhoods to blame the bank. Mr. Relman said the city intended to file a new complaint that focused more narrowly on recouping costs associated with specific properties. But it is much easier for the federal government to sue banks like Wells Fargo. Mr. Relman said he hoped the Justice Department decided to join the cases. “Not only would we welcome them; we encourage them to get involved,” Mr. Relman said. “It’s long overdue.” Mr. Perez has hired Eric Halperin as a special counsel for fair lending.

The division has also gained access to data the Treasury Department is collecting from banks about loan modifications for people seeking to avoid foreclosure. It intends to search for signs of any disparate impact on minorities. The Justice Department is also working with several state attorneys general who have taken an interest in bringing potential lawsuits over banks’ subprime lending practices. Richard Cordray, the attorney general of Ohio, said federal and state officials were sharing information and helping one other develop potential legal theories about how to go after reverse redlining. “We are looking at a common problem and a common pattern to determine what can be done about it,” Mr. Cordray said.

Baltimore officials have accused the bank of tipping hundreds of black homeowners into foreclosure by singling them out for high-interest subprime mortgages. But the city’s claims are “even more implausible,” Judge J.

But Cara Heiden, co-president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said in a statement after the ruling, “From the beginning, we have consistently maintained that Baltimore’s economic problems could not be attributed to the small numbers of foreclosures Wells Fargo has done in Baltimore.” Judge Motz left the legal door ajar for Baltimore, saying city officials could file a more limited complaint detailing specific damages caused in specific neighborhoods. Lawyers for Baltimore said they would do so. “We are not saying that Wells is responsible for a catastrophe in Baltimore and all the deterioration of the neighborhoods,” said John P. Relman, a lawyer representing the city. “We are simply saying that they are engaged in illegal conduct.” Mr. Relman promised that the city would detail the costs it incurred, including boarding up foreclosed and abandoned properties, responding to fires and dispatching police officers to evict squatters. And he said the city would point to the damage to the home values for surrounding homeowners, about which there is extensive academic literature. The Baltimore lawsuit included affidavits from former Wells Fargo loan officers who said the bank had systematically singled out black applicants for high-interest subprime mortgages. The judge’s decision was a blow to a growing number of efforts by cities and states to hold banks accountable for some of the loose lending practices of the past decade. In Memphis, city officials last week filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo, saying the bank’s lending practices had wreaked havoc in predominantly black neighborhoods. In Illinois, the state attorney general filed a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of marketing high-cost mortgage loans to black and Latino customers while selling lower-cost loans to white borrowers with similar incomes.

On Wednesday, Mr. Wharton and other city and county officials filed a lawsuit accusing one of the nation’s largest banks, Wells Fargo, of singling out black homeowners for high-interest subprime mortgages. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Tennessee, marshaled a raft of statistics to argue that Wells Fargo offered one lending reality for whites and another for blacks. In Shelby County, which includes Memphis, one of every eight Wells Fargo loans in predominantly black neighborhoods resulted in foreclosure, compared with only one in 59 such loans in white neighborhoods, the lawsuit said. Such charges, if proven, amount to reverse redlining  marketing expensive loan products specifically to black customers. “You drive through our neighborhoods and it’s just palpable  you can see a strong emerging black homeowning community that’s gone,” Mr. Wharton said in an interview. “The clarity of the patterns just stand out like a sore thumb.” The lawsuit is one of several discrimination suits filed against Wells Fargo in the past two years, as city and state officials argue that the bank must take responsibility for the social and economic effects of a decade of loose  some federal agencies have argued irresponsible  lending practices. In Baltimore, officials say that Wells Fargo’s lending practices tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city millions of dollars in taxes. Lawyers for the City of Baltimore produced two former loan officers who described a pattern of discriminatory practices aimed at persuading blacks to take out what the officers called “ghetto loans,” high-interest mortgages. Their affidavits are also cited in the Memphis suit. Last summer, the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, started a lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of marketing high-cost mortgage loans to black and Latino customers while selling lower-cost loans to white borrowers with similar incomes. The cumulative effect, Ms. Madigan argued, was to turn the black and Latino neighborhoods of the nation’s cities “into ground zero for subprime lending.” Wells Fargo officials have consistently declined interviews on the subject and noted only that their loans account for a small fraction of the nation’s total mortgage lending. A spokesman, Kevin Waetke, wrote in an e-mailed statement that while the bank had not had a chance to study the Memphis lawsuit, “the allegations referenced in earlier news reports about Wells Fargo’s lending practices are baseless and inaccurate. “Other courts have found similar suits against lenders to be without merit,” Mr. Waetke wrote, “and we are confident of a similar outcome here.” A federal judge in Baltimore has not gone that far, but this month he did suggest he might narrow the scope of that city’s lawsuit. The judge said the suit tended to hold Wells Fargo responsible for “the deterioration of the inner city,” which, he said, was implausible. Memphis and Shelby County officials make a similar argument, if perhaps more grounded in statistics. Memphis draws 70 percent of its budget from property taxes, and so, Mayor Wharton said, rows of vacant homes are like a fiscal dagger to its heart. Shelby County has 40 percent of all the foreclosed homes in Tennessee. “Property tax is the mother’s milk of government here,” Mr. Wharton said. “Our unemployment is high, our poverty rate is 35 percent; we cannot afford to lose our tax base.” Many black homeowners in Memphis, the lawsuit says, could have qualified for prime-rate mortgages, thereby saving themselves tens of thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage. That conforms with nationwide patterns, according to a variety of studies. Last spring, The New York Times analyzed foreclosures and subprime lending in New York City and found that black homeowners making more than $68,000 were nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages as whites of similar or lower incomes. (The disparity was greater for Wells Fargo borrowers in New York, where 2 percent of whites and 16.1 percent of blacks in that income group hold subprime mortgages.) What makes the Memphis case particularly nettlesome, said John Relman, a lawyer who represents the city and county, is that statistics suggest that Wells Fargo knew how to write responsible mortgage loans  for whites. “Wells knew how to write and get people into low-cost loans,” Mr. Relman said. “You just don’t see much of that in the black community.” More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on December 31, 2009, on page A15 of the New York edition.The mayor of Memphis, A C Wharton Jr., has walked with bile rising in his throat through the streets of Hickory Hill and Orange Mound and Whitehaven in recent years, as house after house in those black neighborhoods has fallen into foreclosure.

Related Times Topics: Obama Housing Plan There, in a dusty, high-ceilinged room with a steam radiator that never stopped wheezing, they took a seat across a table from a lawyer for a mortgage company. Then their work began: trying to persuade a stranger not to foreclose on their home. The Obama administration’s plan to rescue Americans from foreclosure plays out day after day in rooms like this. On this day, as on most, nothing happened. One lawyer, visibly bored, put in a brief, token appearance. A few others seemed barely familiar with their cases. Another asked for more records, hinting that maybe next month the lender might talk about a settlement. Ismail Ali, a silver-haired immigrant from Guyana, hoped to save his home in Ozone Park. “If it takes you another three months to evaluate me, and I keep paying, will I get a new mortgage?” he asked, almost pleading. The lawyer shrugged, not unsympathetically. “I can’t answer that for you,” he said. Ten months ago President Obama announced a $75 billion program to keep as many as four million Americans in their homes by persuading banks to renegotiate their mortgages. Lenders have accepted more than one million applications and cut three-month trial deals with 759,000 homeowners. But they have converted just 31,000 of those to the permanent new mortgages that are the plan’s goal. In New York City, where 20,000 homeowners faced foreclosure this year, a recent study by the Center for NYC Neighborhoods found that lenders have offered new or trial mortgages to just 3 percent of the homeowners who have sought help. Big mortgage companies  servicers, in the parlance of the industry  stand at the heart of this program. Many of the servicers that have agreed to participate are subsidiaries of the nation’s largest banks  Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. They say their performance is improving. “We ourselves stated that we fell short of our customer service goals,” said Mary Coffin, executive vice president for loan servicing at Wells Fargo. “Now we are doing three modifications for every foreclosure.” But a drove of critics, including homeowners, nonprofit loan counselors, legal services lawyers and court officials, say these companies are also at the heart of the problem. Servicers, they say, pile delay upon delay, and too often steer homeowners into new mortgages with onerous terms. Some companies have insisted that homeowners waive their right to sue before getting a new mortgage, even though the Obama plan prohibits such demands. Administration officials have vowed to shame servicers into action. And New York State lawmakers, like their counterparts in a few other states and cities, have tried to slow the headlong hurtle toward foreclosure by requiring lenders to negotiate with troubled borrowers in court. Leonard N. Florio, a court-appointed referee, oversees such sessions in that dusty room in Queens. He is a chatty man and punctilious about not taking sides. But as he watched Mr. Ali, the Ozone Park homeowner, load his piles of bills and receipts back into his shopping bags, he could not help noting a pattern. “I have yet to see an attorney for a servicer cut a deal,” he said. “Update this, update that. I mean, what’s the holdup?” Loan servicers argue that homeowners are as often to blame: Many cannot show proof of income, and fail to make payments even on modified mortgages. And millions are in bigger trouble than the public realizes, burdened with monthly payments so exorbitant that even a reduced mortgage payment will not save their home. The servicing companies make money either way. The Obama program pays them $1,000 for each loan modified, and another $1,000 per year for three more years if the borrower avoids foreclosure. On the other hand, the companies make large sums charging late and legal fees on overdue mortgage payments, and sometimes it is cheaper to foreclose than to cut the mortgage payment. These same companies turned billions of dollars in profits during the fat years of the bubble. Four years ago, lenders strung banners from storefronts in Jamaica and Cypress Hills and Bedford-Stuyvesant, promising “You will not be turned down!” A no-documents-needed mortgage was easily obtained, often accompanied by the flimsiest of appraisals. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: December 31, 2009 An article on Wednesday about the slow pace of negotiations to forestall foreclosures under a federal program misstated, in some copies, the surname of a counselor with the Parodneck Foundation, which receives New York City and State money to advise homeowners.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Citigroup Inc Bank of America Corp Go to your Portfolio » No, I’m not talking about the big bonuses you’ve been reading about already. I mean a new one, courtesy of companies like Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America returning their federal bailout money and raising new capital to replace it. And that means big fees for all the banks that will hawk these new shares for themselves and their rivals. More than $50 billion of new capital was raised as part of the effort by the biggest banks to repay the money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and get out from under the thumb  and pay caps  of Washington. All told, December was the biggest month in history for offerings, according to Thomson Reuters. Here’s what the post-bailout bonanza means for all the banks that helped find investors for the new shares: Bank of America’s $19.3 billion offering generated $482 million in fees; Citigroup’s $17 billion offering resulted in $425 million in fees; and Wells Fargo’s $12.2 billion offering led to $275.6 million in fees. (The banks paid themselves roughly 2.5 percent of the offering price.) Other banks were beneficiaries as well. As part of the Citigroup offering, for example, Citi syndicated part of the sale to Morgan Stanley, BNP, Lloyds and ING. (Why can’t Citi do it alone? The answer is that to raise that kind of money, you need a little help from your friends, some of whom are better at raising money than others.) Those fees are likely to factor into the bonuses for the investment bankers involved. “Ironically, the mechanics of exiting TARP turned out to be lucrative business for equity underwriters this year,” said Matthew Toole, director of the Deals Intelligence unit of Thomson Reuters’ Investment Banking Division. Mr. Toole ran some numbers and turned up a startling figure: fees over the last two years for follow-on share offerings among financial companies in the United States totaled $5.4 billion. That’s more than the $4.8 billion that was raised in the previous 20 years. There’s one wrinkle in the case of Citigroup, and it is good news. When the Treasury Department begins to unload its shares in Citigroup  it originally said last week that it planned to sell $5 billion worth, but then said it would delay the sale  the taxpayers are not likely to be asked to pay the fees. Citigroup has privately signaled that it will pay the fees, though  wait for it  Citigroup will participate in the offering itself, so it will in effect pay fees to itself. These outsize fees are even providing a bit of funhouse-mirror distortion to so-called league tables, which rank banks based on the size of the deals they handle each quarter. Banks that were in such bad shape that they needed the government’s aid are now, perversely, getting extra bragging rights from raising money to replace the capital they have returned to the government. Consider this: Citigroup, which has long been an also-ran when it comes to stock offerings, is ranked No. 4 by Dealogic, which tracks financial data, leapfrogging the likes of stalwarts like Morgan Stanley. Why? Not because it worked for the largest number of clients on offerings this year, as the measurement usually implies, but because of the work it is doing on its own offering. By the way, Thomson Reuters, which similarly tracks the data, doesn’t give credit to banks doing their own offerings, so Citigroup is further back in the pack. Which ranking do you think Citigroup will use in its brochures for clients next year? (While we’re on the subject of rankings, here’s an interesting aside: this year Dealogic anointed Goldman Sachs the top mergers adviser, while Thomson Reuters said the top firm was Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs has historically used the Thomson Reuters numbers. But guess what? Now Goldman bankers are sending out the Dealogic numbers.) On the fees from the post-bailout offerings, there is an element in all of this of just moving money from one pocket to another. After all, paying yourself a fee just means the cost of the offering is lower than if you had used an outside bank to do the work. It’s not real revenue. But when bonus time comes, and when employees tally up the work they did for the year, they will be compensated for their work on these offerings as if they had worked for an outside client. That’s not to say that an offering like this, especially at this size, doesn’t require real work. Indeed, most banks typically take 1 to 5 percent of the total offering as a fee for rounding up money from investors. The harder the offering, the more money they usually seek. In the case of Citigroup, its enormous size made it especially difficult. (Still, in an age of Wal-Mart and squeezed margins in just about every industry in the nation, it is surprising that Wall Street has been able to hold onto such large bounties.) While many on Wall Street may hold a dim view of the Treasury, one banker I spoke with said he had a message for Timothy F. Geithner: “Thank you.” The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

The answer is that to raise that kind of money, you need a little help from your friends, some of whom are better at raising money than others.) Those fees are likely to factor into the bonuses for the investment bankers involved. “Ironically, the mechanics of exiting TARP turned out to be lucrative business for equity underwriters this year,” said Matthew Toole, director of the Deals Intelligence unit of Thomson Reuters’ Investment Banking Division. Mr. Toole ran some numbers and turned up a startling figure: fees over the last two years for follow-on share offerings among financial companies in the United States totaled $5.4 billion. That’s more than the $4.8 billion that was raised in the previous 20 years. There’s one wrinkle in the case of Citigroup, and it is good news. When the Treasury Department begins to unload its shares in Citigroup  it originally said last week that it planned to sell $5 billion worth, but then said it would delay the sale  the taxpayers are not likely to be asked to pay the fees. Citigroup has privately signaled that it will pay the fees, though  wait for it  Citigroup will participate in the offering itself, so it will in effect pay fees to itself. These outsize fees are even providing a bit of funhouse-mirror distortion to so-called league tables, which rank banks based on the size of the deals they handle each quarter. Banks that were in such bad shape that they needed the government’s aid are now, perversely, getting extra bragging rights from raising money to replace the capital they have returned to the government. Consider this: Citigroup, which has long been an also-ran when it comes to stock offerings, is ranked No. 4 by Dealogic, which tracks financial data, leapfrogging the likes of stalwarts like Morgan Stanley. Why? Not because it worked for the largest number of clients on offerings this year, as the measurement usually implies, but because of the work it is doing on its own offering. By the way, Thomson Reuters, which similarly tracks the data, doesn’t give credit to banks doing their own offerings, so Citigroup is further back in the pack. Which ranking do you think Citigroup will use in its brochures for clients next year? (While we’re on the subject of rankings, here’s an interesting aside: this year Dealogic anointed Goldman Sachs the top mergers adviser, while Thomson Reuters said the top firm was Morgan Stanley. Goldman Sachs has historically used the Thomson Reuters numbers. But guess what? Now Goldman bankers are sending out the Dealogic numbers.) On the fees from the post-bailout offerings, there is an element in all of this of just moving money from one pocket to another. After all, paying yourself a fee just means the cost of the offering is lower than if you had used an outside bank to do the work. It’s not real revenue. But when bonus time comes, and when employees tally up the work they did for the year, they will be compensated for their work on these offerings as if they had worked for an outside client. That’s not to say that an offering like this, especially at this size, doesn’t require real work. Indeed, most banks typically take 1 to 5 percent of the total offering as a fee for rounding up money from investors. The harder the offering, the more money they usually seek. In the case of Citigroup, its enormous size made it especially difficult. (Still, in an age of Wal-Mart and squeezed margins in just about every industry in the nation, it is surprising that Wall Street has been able to hold onto such large bounties.) While many on Wall Street may hold a dim view of the Treasury, one banker I spoke with said he had a message for Timothy F. Geithner: “Thank you.” The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/business/economy/15bank.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Wells Fargo to Repay U.S., a Coda to the Bailout Era<date>Published: December 14, 2009</date><text>When Washington pressed the nation’s largest banks to take billions in federal support last autumn, few protested more loudly than Wells Fargo.

Join the Discussion » Add to Portfolio Citigroup Inc Go to your Portfolio » Hours after Citigroup confirmed it was exiting the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program, Wells said it would return the $25 billion it was given to weather the worst financial storm since the Depression. Wells, the largest consumer bank in the United States, will raise $10.4 billion in a share sale to help replenish its coffers. Wells joins Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, its largest rivals, in shedding the stigma of taxpayer support and the restrictions on compensation that came with it. At the same time, President Obama was pressing chief executives of large bailed-out banks to step up lending to help an economic recovery. “The stigma of TARP is becoming such an emotional, testosterone-driven thing that they want to be done with the government,” said David H. Ellison, a portfolio manager at FBR Funds, which specializes in financial stocks. “If Bank of America, if Citigroup can do it, then why not me, too?” Mr. Ellison said banks appeared to be “rushing in” to pay back the government, so they can offer bigger bonuses to their executives and get lawmakers off their backs. But the prospect of huge losses on mortgages and commercial real estate loans early next year might also be causing the repayment stampede, he said. “It may be as much about raising capital as it is paying off TARP,” he said. While bank profits surged this year as the economy recovered and the stock market rebounded, many banks were fearful of what next year might bring and wanted to raise money in the capital markets now. Although the recession has ended, high unemployment means banks like Wells and Citigroup, which aggressively peddled consumer loans, will face looming losses as consumers struggle to make ends meet. The stock market is also likely to level off after a breakneck year, analysts said. Any sudden event on the world stage, like a further weakening in emerging markets or a sovereign default, could restrain the environment for raising capital. Only nine months ago, big institutional investors were so fearful during the credit crisis that they refused to pour money into the banks that badly needed it. Talk of nationalization prevailed. But confidence has come back to the market, in part because the government has shown its willingness to save large banks whose demise would produce systemic risks after the fall of Lehman Brothers. Yet even as banks pay back their bailout money, the government is still extending them billions of dollars in taxpayer support through other programs run by the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In spite of the recent rush to repay the government, many financial experts say the financial system is sound. At both Citigroup and Wells Fargo, regulators required the banks to swap in private money almost dollar for dollar with the bailout funds. “You are talking about them having about the same amount of capital and less of a government role, which the markets will like,” said Douglas J. Elliott, a former investment banker and fellow at the Brookings Institution. Even so, other financial experts worry that the government may be making a terrible mistake by allowing the biggest banks to exit too quickly. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, they argue, these same large banks will return to the government for a new round of aid. “The guarantee is no longer explicit, it’s implicit  just like the implicit guarantee for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,” said Dino Kos, a banking analyst and former Federal Reserve official. “This is the nature of the ‘too big to fail’ problem.” For the banks’ existing stockholders, repayment comes at a high cost. As part of Citigroup’s agreement with the government, the bank is planning to raise about $17 billion by selling stock, which will dilute the value of existing shares. “It’s terribly negative,” said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities. “Management has shown that it is willing to take any action to harm shareholders as long as the executives get paid more money.” Mr. Bove said the payback did nothing to improve Citigroup’s overall financial health, nor did it remove the bank entirely from government control. Instead, Citigroup’s management had “ruined” the stock price for the next three or four months, he said. On Monday, Citi’s stock lost 25 cents and closed at $3.70. Citigroup will still operate under a loose set of pay restrictions. By contrast, Wells will now face no pay restrictions since it will have fully repaid its bailout funds. But that may hold less significance, because Wells, a commercial bank, does not have the traders and bankers who demand multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses. That became a sore point for Wells when Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the Treasury secretary, summoned its chief executive to appear last October with seven others at the Treasury Department. At the meeting, Richard M. Kovacevich, then the Wells Fargo chairman, protested strongly that, unlike its New York rivals, Wells was not in trouble because of investments in exotic mortgages, and did not need a bailout, according to people briefed on the meeting. But Wells has since changed its tune as it struggles to digest Wachovia, which it took over at the height of the financial crisis after a heated fight with Citigroup. After that merger, Wells was saddled with a giant portfolio of troubled real estate loans, and it faces a coming wave of losses on its pick-a-pay mortgages and commercial real estate and corporate loans. Under the terms of the deal, Wells will raise $1.35 billion by issuing common stock to Wells benefit plans. The bank will also increase equity by $1.5 billion through asset sales. Wells’s current chief executive, John G. Stumpf, said the move was a good deal for investors and taxpayers, who walk away from their investment in the bank with a $1.4 billion dividend. Jeff Zeleny reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York.

The decision settles a lawsuit brought against the firm by California's attorney general, which accused it of violating the state's securities laws. Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco, also agreed to pay the state's expenses related to the lawsuit. The brokerage arm of the bank marketed the securities, which resemble corporate debt and whose interest rates were regularly reset by auctions, as an alternative to cash for years, even after analysts warned that the market could freeze up. In February 2008, banks stopped participating in the auctions and effectively locked up investors' cash. The suit, brought by the California attorney general, Jerry Brown, contended that Wells Fargo had routinely misrepresented, marketed and sold auction-rate securities as safe, liquid and cashlike investments, omitting material facts. ''Wells Fargo convinced thousands of investors to purchase auction-rate securities with promises of robust returns and liquidity, but when the market collapsed, investors were left out in the cold,'' Mr. Brown said in a statement. ''Based on misleading advice, investors bought these risky securities. Now, retail investors and small businesses are finally getting their money back.'' Under the terms of the settlement, Wells Fargo agreed to buy back at par value by April 2010 all auction-rate securities bought through its brokerage unit by investors before the market froze up. About half of the auction-rate securities sold by Wells, which is based in San Francisco, were bought by California residents. Mr. Brown and Wells reached a settlement agreement Tuesday night, people briefed on the matter said. The settlement arises in part from an investigation led by Washington State's Department of Financial Institutions, according to a statement by the North American Securities Administrators Association. Washington State filed an administrative action against Wells before California filed its own case. That matter has also been settled. State regulators have secured settlements in which banks have agreed to repurchase more than $61 billion in auction-rate securities from investors. Among the firms that have settled these lawsuits are UBS, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7D81031F93AA35752C1A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=wellsfargoandcompany">BREAKINGVIEWS.COM; Wells Fargo's Big Dilemma<date>Published: November 9, 2009</date><text>Wells Fargo's Big Dilemma John G. Stumpf, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, objected vocally to the federal injection of rescue funds into banks, saying taxpayers were benefiting at Wells Fargo's expense. A year on, the government still owns $25 billion of Wells preferred stock. The bank's boss has cooled his rhetoric, but still wants to pay back the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program investment ''shortly.'' He also wants to avoid damage to his shareholders. Reconciling the two objectives is not easy. Much of Wall Street interprets Mr. Stumpf's emphasis on shareholder-friendliness to mean he has no intention of raising new common equity, which might be dilutive. That would suggest he is resigned to repaying Washington's investment out of accumulated earnings. On current performance, that could take two years or more. Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, might have considered repaying the government quickly in cash. After all, the bank did raise $21.2 billion issuing common equity as the financial crisis unfolded. But it's not clear that regulators would be satisfied with that. More importantly, parting with that much cash would deplete the bank's capital. The bank's Tier 1 ratio of capital to assets would drop to just above 8 percent, fine in the good old days, but way below its rivals now. JPMorgan's equivalent ratio stands at 10.2 percent, and US Bancorp's is at 9.5 percent. The implication is that Mr. Stumpf cannot repay his relief funds in short order unless he raises equity, a move that would not be good for shareholders. But there may still be a middle way. That's because selling new common stock and being shareholder-friendly are not entirely mutually exclusive. Paying back the relief funds would extinguish $1.25 billion a year in post-tax dividends, freeing up earnings for common shareholders. Wells could issue up to $8.8 billion in stock without reducing the earnings per share available to current holders, according to JPMorgan. Doing that and repaying the rest of the funds in cash would put a 9 percent floor under Wells' Tier 1 ratio. The slug of new common stock would also raise the narrower Tier 1 common equity ratio to 6 percent from the current 5.2 percent, which is three percentage points below the bank's two bailout-free peers. Those improved ratios still appear skinny. But Wells set aside an extra cushion against loan losses when it bought Wachovia. That's worth another 1.5 percentage points on both capital ratios. Squaring the circle this way would call for careful explanation. Should Mr. Stumpf decide to do it, though, he has no problem speaking up. Call It Socialism Here's a shocker: Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the only self-described socialist in the Senate, has put forth the most capitalistic proposal yet for banking reform. The senator's Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act proposes that if a firm is so big that its failure would threaten the economy or financial system, it should be broken up, not protected by the promise of a bailout. That sounds simple and logical, yet none of the competing proposals floating around Capitol Hill -- those from the White House or the House Financial Services Committee, or others expected this week from Christopher Dodd, the Senate Banking Committee chairman -- have been so explicit in calling for an end to government rescues for private companies. Of course, Senator Sanders's bill is intended to be provocative. In two pages it outlines sweeping powers for the Treasury secretary to identify banks, hedge funds and insurers that are too big to fail. Within a year they would have to be broken up into smaller pieces whose failure would no longer torpedo the national or global economy without a bailout. Vermont is not home to any large financial groups, so it's not altogether surprising that Mr. Sanders would champion such legislation. If taken seriously, the proposals would face a struggle against the financial services industry and powerful political forces. And their brevity, while welcome in some ways, leaves too many questions unanswered. That said, Mr. Sanders's philosophy seems sensible. Breaking up the biggest financial firms would remove unfair subsidies in the form of implicit government backing, sharply reduce systemic risk, and perhaps foster greater competition. Given the poor performance of some of the biggest financial conglomerates, it might even benefit shareholders. It's quite a show of capitalist sympathies from a Green Mountain socialist.

Public transit agencies in cities including New York, Atlanta, San Francisco and Washington are under pressure to surrender $2 billion from their budgets because financial institutions have spotted a chance to gain a windfall from complicated tax-shelter deals known as “leasebacks.” In the heady 1990s, the federal government encouraged these leaseback deals as a quick fix for budget problems. Transit agencies like New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority would sell their railcars and other equipment to banks, which would then lease them back to the agencies. Leasebacks appeared to promise that everyone would emerge a winner. Banks  including many that later took federal bailout money like Bank of America and Wells Fargo  were able to cash in on substantial tax deductions through the transactions. The transit companies, which were paid with a portion of those tax savings, could use the cash to modernize their systems and make safety improvements. Alas, as with any quick fix, the deals have set off a cascade of problems. First, while the Internal Revenue Service declared the deals illegal in 2004, it allowed previously completed deals to remain on the books. And the situation exploded last fall when financial markets crashed and the third-party insurers chosen by the transit agencies as guarantors of the transactions lost their triple-A credit ratings (in many cases, the insurer was A.I.G.). This placed the transit agencies in “technical default” on the leases, even though they hadn’t missed any payments. In turn, many of the banks have decided to take advantage of these “technical defaults” to reap a windfall in early-termination payments. By rights, they can immediately demand from transit authorities an amount equal to all their anticipated tax savings.

Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, have proposed a bill that would levy a 100 percent excise tax on any lump-sum payments demanded by the banks.

Public transit agencies in cities including New York, Atlanta, San Francisco and Washington are under pressure to surrender $2 billion from their budgets because financial institutions have spotted a chance to gain a windfall from complicated tax-shelter deals known as “leasebacks.” In the heady 1990s, the federal government encouraged these leaseback deals as a quick fix for budget problems. Transit agencies like New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority would sell their railcars and other equipment to banks, which would then lease them back to the agencies. Leasebacks appeared to promise that everyone would emerge a winner. Banks  including many that later took federal bailout money like Bank of America and Wells Fargo  were able to cash in on substantial tax deductions through the transactions. The transit companies, which were paid with a portion of those tax savings, could use the cash to modernize their systems and make safety improvements. Alas, as with any quick fix, the deals have set off a cascade of problems. First, while the Internal Revenue Service declared the deals illegal in 2004, it allowed previously completed deals to remain on the books. And the situation exploded last fall when financial markets crashed and the third-party insurers chosen by the transit agencies as guarantors of the transactions lost their triple-A credit ratings (in many cases, the insurer was A.I.G.). This placed the transit agencies in “technical default” on the leases, even though they hadn’t missed any payments. In turn, many of the banks have decided to take advantage of these “technical defaults” to reap a windfall in early-termination payments. By rights, they can immediately demand from transit authorities an amount equal to all their anticipated tax savings. These can run to hundreds of millions of dollars  New Jersey Transit alone is on the hook for $150 million.

Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, introduced legislation on Monday to limit the number of fees charged to one per month, and to require a bank to seek consumers’ permission to cover debit card and check purchases that would push their bank balance below zero. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Bank of America Corp Go to your Portfolio » The measure, the latest in a series being examined by lawmakers and regulators, goes beyond voluntary caps on overdraft fees announced last month by the nation’s largest banks. Bowing to growing pressure, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and other big banks pledged to limit the number of overdraft fees they charge to several a day. They will also allow consumers to choose overdraft protection, rather than offer it automatically. Under Senator Dodd’s proposal, banks would have to cap the number of overdrafts they charge at six a year, and require fees to be proportional to the cost of processing the overdraft. “It can be five transactions in a day before you’ve discovered it, and it can be $35 a transaction,” Mr. Dodd said. Recently, he added, a 75-year-old constituent called to complain that he had accumulated $140 in fees by overdrawing his account by a few dollars. “I’m not saying consumers should get a free ride if they overdraw,” Mr. Dodd added. “But they should have a choice whether or not they want to participate.” Earlier this year, Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, introduced similar legislation in the House. Senator Dodd’s measure would also end banks’ practice of posting the largest transactions first, which critics say that has the effect of maximizing overdraft fees. But unlike Representative Maloney’s plan, Mr. Dodd’s legislation would not require consumers to be notified of over-the-limit breaches at the cash register, a proposal that angered retailers. The Dodd bill comes as overdraft fees face intense scrutiny. Consumer advocates say the fees tend to target lower-income customers who are living on the edge and who can unwittingly accumulate hundreds of dollars in fees, even when they try to monitor the cash in their account. This year, banks are expected to generate $27 billion by covering overdrafts on checking accounts. The Federal Reserve is currently considering rules that would require banks to seek permission before signing consumers up for overdraft protection. Edward L. Yingling, head of the American Bankers Association, warned that the Dodd bill would hurt community banks and anger consumers. “It is the equivalent of saying that drivers can only be hit with one speeding ticket per month no matter how fast they drive after getting the ticket,” he said in a statement.

Indicts Dozens in Online Bank Fraud<date>Published: October 7, 2009</date><text>In what it is calling Operation Phish Phry, the F.B.I. began arresting 53 people on Wednesday on charges of conducting a vast financial fraud based on phishing  the act of tricking Internet users into revealing their passwords and other information. The arrests were in Southern California, Nevada and North Carolina, while the authorities in Egypt sought to arrest 47 people whom the F.B.I. said were co-conspirators. An 86-page indictment, filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, accuses the defendants of tricking people into giving up their bank account information. The F.B.I. said that this was the largest number of defendants ever charged in a cybercrime case, and that they had stolen at least $2 million from 2007 to last month. The scams victimized people with accounts at Bank of America and Wells Fargo, two of the nation’s largest banks. The online component of the fraud was perpetrated in Egypt, Keith B. Bolcar, the acting chief of the F.B.I.’s Los Angeles bureau, said. The defendants there sent mass e-mail messages that appeared to be authentic communication from the banks, the F.B.I. said. The people who clicked on those e-mail messages were sent to fake Web sites made to look identical to the real banking sites, where they were asked to enter personal information like their bank account numbers, passwords, Social Security numbers and drivers’ license numbers. The co-conspirators in the United States took over from there, transferring funds into their own accounts and remitting some money back to their accomplices in Egypt, according to the indictment. “It was very well done, it was very organized and everybody got paid,” Mr. Bolcar said. The F.B.I. said the mastermind of the operation in the United States was Kenneth Joseph Lucas, 25, who had help from John Clarke, a friend, and Nichole Merzi, Mr. Lucas’s former girlfriend. A public defender for Mr. Lucas did not immediately return a call seeking comment. According to the indictment, the trio would ask other conspirators, some down on their luck, to open accounts and then withdraw money that had been transferred from victims’ accounts. They would then send some money to participants in Egypt. The investigation began in early 2007, when the banks alerted the F.B.I. to the fraud. Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, would not comment specifically on this case but said the bank “monitors for fraudulent sites and works to shut them down as quickly as possible.” Each of the 53 defendants named in the indictment is charged with conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Some defendants face other charges. The case highlights the pernicious problem of phishing, in which online scammers send e-mail messages and build Web sites that look authentic, then make off with sensitive information. Early this week, more than 10,000 addresses and passwords for customer accounts on Hotmail, one of Microsoft’s Web-based e-mail services, appeared online, apparently after being stolen via phishing. In what appeared to be a separate incident, a list of more than 20,000 addresses and passwords for accounts on Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo and AOL were posted to a Web site. The Internet companies said they were working with affected customers to help them recover their accounts. Chet Wisniewski, senior security adviser at Sophos, a Web security firm, doubted the arrests would have an effect on the number of online banking scams. “I would imagine there are many different groups doing similar things,” he said. “You squash one bug and another one emerges. If there’s an opportunity to make money, someone will be there to collect the bill.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on October 8, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.In what it is calling Operation Phish Phry, the F.B.I. began arresting 53 people on Wednesday on charges of conducting a vast financial fraud based on phishing  the act of tricking Internet users into revealing their passwords and other information.

Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase announced plans on Tuesday to drastically overhaul their debit card programs by lowering or eliminating fees. The banks are also changing the way they credit transactions and are allowing customers to opt out of overdraft protection. Chase and Wells Fargo will cancel fees for accounts overdrawn by $5 or less, according to separate statements. Bank of America will end fees on accounts that are short $10 or less, it said in a statement. Banks and credit card lenders have come under fire from Congress because of the fees, which are charged when customers exceed their checking account balance by writing checks or using a debit card. Complaints about such fees helped spur calls for a consumer financial protection agency. ''These are positive changes, but the system has gotten completely out of whack,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who introduced legislation last week to crack down on overdraft fees. ''I will take a close look at the banks' new policies as I continue work on a bill to permanently protect customers from excessive overdraft fees.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/opinion/24thu3.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">A Small Step Back From Usury<date>Published: September 23, 2009</date><text>Federal lawmakers should curb their enthusiasm over the news that some of the country’s largest banks are revising usurious overdraft policies aimed at catching debit card users unaware and wringing as much money out of them as possible. The new policies, announced by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America on Tuesday and Wells Fargo on Wednesday, do not go far enough and could eventually be reversed when the spotlight moves elsewhere and the banks feel free to change their minds. The banks’ moves are no substitute for federal legislation that would make fair overdraft fees a permanent part of the regulatory landscape. Current policies are a far cry from a decade ago when most banks simply denied debit transactions, without a fee, when a customer’s account was empty. Citibank has a no-charge denial policy. But over the last decade or so, most major banks have adopted a euphemistically labeled “overdraft protection” system, under which unsuspecting customers are charged as much as $35 for overdrawing an account by the price of a cup of coffee or a bottle of aspirin. Under this scenario, a series of small, incidental purchases totaling less than $20 can rack up $300 in fees. Chase said that it will cut the maximum number of overdraft charges per day to three from six and will eliminate overdrafts for debit cards unless the customer opts in to the program. Bank of America said it will also cut the number of overdraft charges allowed per day and will make it easier for customers to opt out of the service. Congress should end the widespread practice by the banks of automatically enrolling customers in these programs. This should be a program that people opt into, as in the Chase model, and only after they have been told in plain language about the costs. Customers should also have the option of terminating a transaction  at the A.T.M. or with a cashier  before they incur a fee. The new policies do nothing about individual overdraft charges, which are still much too high and can carry an annualized interest rate that exceeds 3,500 percent. That’s usury, no matter how you cut it, and it should be disallowed under federal law.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Bank of America Corp Go to your Portfolio » A report released by Treasury officials identified lenders who had made slow progress in offering more affordable mortgages, naming Bank of America and Wells Fargo as among those failing to reach large numbers of eligible borrowers. While 15 percent of eligible homeowners have been offered help through the mortgage modification program, the low rate of actual mortgage reductions has frustrated administration officials. Michael S. Barr, the assistant secretary for financial institutions, said in a news conference that there were “significant variations” in performance and that some institutions had made “an infinitesimally small amount” of progress. “I think it’s safe to say we’re disappointed in the performance of some of the servicers,” Mr. Barr said. “We expect them to do more.” The release of data showing the progress of individual institutions is part of a Treasury effort to push banks to modify loans faster. Under the $75 billion program, homeowners whose monthly mortgage payments are more than 31 percent of their gross income are eligible for modified loans, with interest rates as low as 2 percent. Bank of America has modified only 4 percent of the eligible mortgages, and Wells Fargo has modified 6 percent. Citimortgage, a unit of Citigroup, fared better at 15 percent, while JPMorgan Chase was among the most successful, modifying loans for 20 percent of eligible borrowers. All four institutions received federal bailout money. Since President Obama announced the mortgage modification program in February, mortgage holders have criticized the slow response by lenders. The Treasury Department hopes to reach as many as four million borrowers through the program in the next three years. Mr. Barr said he expected institutions to modify 500,000 loans through the program by November. “We’re going to pay specific attention to making sure that the institutions that have been slow out of the block ramp up more quickly and more effectively,” he said. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner met on July 28 with lenders who had signed agreements to participate and asked them to streamline the application process and improve customer service. “For us the bottom line is, they need to reach the borrowers,” Mr. Barr said. “For some of them that means better training, for some of them that means ramping up capacity, for some of them that means treating people better in their call centers.” The Treasury Department hopes the name-and-shame tactic will encourage banks to improve. In addition, Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage buyer, will audit rejected applications. Wells Fargo and Bank of America issued statements on Tuesday promising to comply with the program. “Despite our aggressive efforts to find solutions for homeowners in default, we must improve our processes for reaching those in need,” said Barbara J. Desoer, president of Bank of America Home Loans. She said that Bank of America completed 150,000 modifications through its own programs in the first half of 2009. Mike Heid, a president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, said the company would now send eligible customers a trial modification agreement within 48 hours of their initial contact. “Our company has been accelerating our use of HAMP,” said Mr. Heid, referring to what is officially the Home Affordable Modification Program. “We’re confident we can achieve our portion of the government’s goal to reach 500,000 HAMP trial modification starts by Nov. 1.” But John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said the government should not depend on voluntarily compliance from banks. “There are other modifications that Wells Fargo and Bank of America would argue that they’re making,” he said. “But maybe they’re making modifications that are not as deep or consistent with the guidelines.” Michael Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, was also skeptical that banks had enough incentive to comply with the program. The Treasury Department offers $1,000 payments to lenders for each modified loan and pays lenders part of the difference between borrowers’ old monthly payments and their new ones. “For over three years, leaders have insisted they can handle this crisis on their own, but today’s report shows that the time for voluntary action is over,” Mr. Calhoun said in a statement. Kathleen Day, a spokeswoman for the center, said: “There’s still a lot of market reasons why they wouldn’t do it. Some may not have the warm bodies to do it. They may feel overwhelmed.” That would change, she said, if banks knew judges could modify mortgages in bankruptcy courts.

But across the nation, many small and midsize lenders are still struggling  and bracing for even more bad news. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Wells Fargo &amp; Company A spate of quarterly results from regional banks this week is painting a sobering portrait of the potential pitfalls ahead. KeyCorp of Cleveland said Wednesday that it was girding for losses on commercial real estate loans. At SunTrust Banks, based in Atlanta, the big worry was residential real estate loans. And at Wells Fargo, the giant lender in San Francisco, rapidly souring home mortgages cast a shadow over otherwise robust profits. “There is no doubt that the challenges are clearly not behind us,” said C. Dowd Ritter, the chief executive of Regions Financial in Alabama, which on Tuesday reported a $188 million loss for the second quarter. It is just another tough week in a tough year for the regional banks, and more downbeat news is expected on Thursday, when several others, including Fifth-Third Bancorp of Ohio, report their latest results. The problems underscore the widening gap between huge banks like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, which have bounced back with hefty profits in investment banking and trading, and regional banks that rely on more traditional transactions like accepting deposits and making loans. “They don’t have the diversity,” said Kathy Boyle, the president of Chapin Hill Advisors in New York. “They don’t have a place to hide.” And the problems are expected to worsen as one of the industry’s biggest troubles  commercial real estate loans  continue to sour. KeyCorp reported a $226 million net loss for the second quarter as it built up reserves to cover bad loans, particularly in commercial real estate. SunTrust lost $184 million during the period. At Wells Fargo, worries about future loan losses stained news of record profits  $3.17 billion  for the period. The bank said borrowers had stopped making payments on $18.3 billion of loans, a jump of 45 percent from the first quarter. Losses from uncollectible loans increased by a third in the second quarter, to $4.4 billion, from the prior quarter. Despite the mostly bleak news, some analysts found signs of hope. Jennifer Thompson, an analyst at Portales Partners, said many regional banks showed strong deposit growth, a better financing mix and improving net interest margins. While loan portfolios from the Midwest and West show signs of stabilizing, she said construction-related loans in the Southeast were deteriorating faster than she had expected. Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities, said several regional banks reported that early stage delinquencies  payments that are 30 to 89 days late  were slowing, suggesting that consumer loan losses could decline in coming months. Given that, buying some regional banks stocks makes sense, he said. Shares of SunTrust and KeyCorp leapt on Wednesday, even as Wells Fargo’s share price fell. “People believe we are at the cusp in the turn in the cycle,” Mr. Bove said. Not everyone agrees. Ms. Boyle, of Chapin Hill, worries regional banks are particularly susceptible as losses accelerate in commercial real estate. “Everybody is looking for hope right now,” she said. “We are still very much in the bear camp.” At Comerica bank, based in Dallas, executives attributed a big drop in quarterly profits to running problems with residential real estate development. “We have seen signs of stabilization in the residential real estate portfolio in California,” Ralph W. Babb Jr., Comerica’s chief executive, said in a call with investors. The bank’s home market of Texas was holding up relatively well, he said, but the recession has taken a toll in other markets, like Florida, he said. “I think with the real estate piece clearly, the fall off in values has been more significant than anyone would have anticipated,” he added.

But across the nation, many small and midsize lenders are still struggling  and bracing for even more bad news. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Wells Fargo &amp; Company A spate of quarterly results from regional banks this week is painting a sobering portrait of the potential pitfalls ahead. KeyCorp of Cleveland said Wednesday that it was girding for losses on commercial real estate loans. At SunTrust Banks, based in Atlanta, the big worry was residential real estate loans. And at Wells Fargo, the giant lender in San Francisco, rapidly souring home mortgages cast a shadow over otherwise robust profits. “There is no doubt that the challenges are clearly not behind us,” said C.

Its market share slid by a quarter to a paltry 1.4 percent. To offer its enlarged client base higher-margin products, Wells Fargo will need to invest and hire bankers.

It’s alone among the former Big Three in avoiding a government-financed restructuring and increasing its market share.

The problem is that both G.M. and Chrysler are emerging from Chapter 11 protection with comparatively light debt loads.

It will soon have $6 billion more in loans from the Department of Energy to develop fuel-efficient cars, and it owes $11 billion to a union health care fund. Factor in losses for the rest of 2009, and Ford’s liabilities may head toward $40 billion. That is almost four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, as estimated by JPMorgan. Those liabilities could limit Ford’s flexibility and its investment in research and development compared with its cleaned-up peers. And while rivals can now concentrate on making cars people want to buy, Ford’s executives will still be distracted by balance sheet issues  not least because $10.5 billion in bank loans are due for repayment in just over two years. All this could be avoided, however, if Ford sells more stock now. That wouldn’t be easy for shareholders to stomach. Analysts reckon up to $7 billion would be needed, diluting current owners by a third. But that would be better than the prospect of being wiped out when it comes to refinancing. Stocking up on cash to cover debt repayment and reduce leverage should address one big fear: that Ford’s status as the savvy survivor might be threatened or limited by obligations its rivals, refreshed by government-abetted bankruptcy, no longer have.

Stop-payment: $30. A.T.M. charge: as high as $3. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter Foley/European Pressphoto Agency Customers using A.T.M.s, like these at a Bank of America branch in New York, are noticing higher fees for transactions. Multimedia Graphic Add to Portfolio Bank of America Corp US Bancorp Go to your Portfolio » Even now, after all those bailouts, banks never seem to tire of dipping a little deeper into your wallet. Despite the tough economic times and increased scrutiny from Washington, they are keeping most fees at record highs, and are eking out slight increases on others like overdraft charges  a step they rarely took during past recessions. The result? Americans are paying more to save and spend their money. And while the increases are still relatively small by historical standards, they illustrate how banks are looking for almost any nugget of income to help offset huge loan losses and lower revenue as consumers buckle down on spending. The nation’s biggest banks  those that received the biggest bailouts from taxpayers, and are once again gaining strength  charge fees that are on average at least 20 percent higher than those at smaller lenders, according to Moebs Services, a economic research firm used by banks and federal regulators. Some of the charges are getting more creative. Several big banks  including JPMorgan Chase, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo &amp;  recently began billing some small-business customers for federal deposit insurance increases. Citigroup and PNC Financial assess around a 3 percent international transaction fee when customers swipe their debit cards overseas. Bank of America recently introduced a raft of changes. In June, it raised the fees on its basic monthly checking account to $8.95 from $5.95. In April, the bank considered raising its overdraft charge to $39, nearly double what the typical bank charged a decade ago. It backed down only after an eruption of consumer complaints, tweaking its rules to keep its initial fee at $35. And then there are credit cards: banks are scrambling to raise rates and fees before a credit card reform bill that President Obama signed into law last month takes effect. JPMorgan Chase recently announced it would raise some balance transfer fees to 5 percent, from 3 percent, in August. Citigroup, Bank of America and other lenders have also been raising the interest rates for millions of cardholders. Over all, fees at the biggest banks are running at their highest levels on record. The average A.T.M. charge, which generates billions of dollars for banks annually, rose at the end of 2008 to $1.97, up from $1.78 the year before and nearly double the 89-cent average recorded in 1998, according to Bankrate.com. Other charges are more eye-popping: today’s typical $30 stop-payment fee is about twice as much as a decade ago, according to Moebs. But the most unexpected change has occurred in overdraft fees  the industry’s most lucrative and controversial charge  where the typical fee rose to $26 after five years at $25. That is only a modest 4 percent increase, compared with the double-digit overdraft fee increases a few years ago, when charges rose to $25 from $22. But amid intense scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers, consumer advocates  and even some bankers are surprised. “We’ve never seen a price increase during a recession,” said Michael Moebs, the chief economist and founder of the research firm that analyzed the fee data at more than 2,200 lenders. “What the bankers are saying is that I want to maintain my revenue.” Scott E. Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, said that the banks’ fees reflect the cost of providing those services and the rise in overdraft charges reflects increased risk. “There is an increased riskiness around repayment because of the recession,” he added. Most banks have been reluctant to raise overdraft fees or have made subtle but potentially lucrative changes to how they are assessed. Bankers are worried about criticism from Washington and would rather find ways to bolster profits under the radar. For instance, many banks already generate rich profits by charging consumers high interest rates for loans, while keeping interest rates paid on money market and checking accounts low  a trend that has become more acute as the Federal Reserve keeps rates near zero to help stoke an economic recovery. But that may not be enough. Large banks, which tend to charge the highest fees, incur a range of expenses that smaller banks do not, including high nationwide advertising bills and the costs of operating networks of A.T.M.’s and retail branches. Many smaller banks are also struggling now more than ever to offset losses and dwindling revenue. And as consumers themselves rein in their finances, raising the overdraft fee has become an easy option. With fewer customers overdrawing their accounts, overdraft fees risk shrinking to a smaller income stream from what Moebs estimates is a $38.5 billion business this year. That is, unless banks raise fees on customers who run into trouble. Aaron Fine, a retail banking consultant at Oliver Wyman, said that overdraft fee income could fall 5 to 20 percent for some banks in the second and third quarter. “That is the multibillion-dollar question,” he said. “How do you replace those fees with something else?” Two large regional banks, which have been hit hard by the recession, appear to be struggling to find answers. KeyCorp, a regional lender based in Cleveland, raised its overdraft fee by 50 cents to a dollar for repeat offenders in the last few months, bringing its maximum charge to as much as $39. Comerica, which has big operations in Michigan and California, raised similar fees by approximately $2 to $3 when it introduced a tiered fee structure that charges $25 to $37 as the number of offenses increase. Regulators and lawmakers say they plan to crack down on excessive service fees, just as they did with a new bill barring unfair credit card practices. Federal Reserve officials have proposed new rules that would let debit and A.T.M. customers “opt in” for overdraft protection, or allow existing customers to opt out of the service. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, introduced more stringent legislation this spring requiring banks to notify customers before they overdraw their accounts. Of course, consumers do not have to be taken in. Consumer advocates suggest comparing the fees charged by big banks with those of credit unions and community lenders in a given area. When possible, use an A.T.M. in the bank’s network. And if you do incur fees, ask your bank manager about waiving them. Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at BankRate.com, said that as banking fees head into overdrive, consumers simply need to be more alert. “We will have to be on our toes to avoid getting tripped up,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Matt Roth for The New York Times A foreclosed home on Barclay Street in Baltimore. The city is suing Wells Fargo Bank over its mortgage lending practices in black neighborhoods. Enlarge This Image Matt Roth for The New York Times Another foreclosed house on Baltimore's North Brice Street, which shares a downed fence with a house still lived in. These loans, Baltimore officials have claimed in a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city tens of millions of dollars in taxes and city services. Wells Fargo, Ms. Jacobson said in an interview, saw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation’s home-owning mania. Loan officers, she said, pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages. Another loan officer stated in an affidavit filed last week that employees had referred to blacks as “mud people” and to subprime lending as “ghetto loans.” “We just went right after them,” said Ms. Jacobson, who is white and said she was once the bank’s top-producing subprime loan officer nationally. “Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans.” Ms. Jacobson’s account and that of the other loan officer who gave an affidavit, Tony Paschal, both of whom have left Wells Fargo, provide the first detailed accusations of deliberate racial steering into subprimes by one of the nation’s top banks. The toll taken by such policies, Baltimore officials argue, is terrible. Data released by the city as part of the suit last week show that more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods. Judge Benson E. Legg of Federal District Court had asked the city to file the additional paperwork and has not decided whether the lawsuit can go forward. Wells Fargo officials have declined detailed interviews since Baltimore filed suit in January 2008. In an e-mail statement on Friday, a spokesman said that only 1 percent of the city’s 33,000 foreclosures have come on Wells Fargo mortgages. “We have worked extremely hard to make homeownership possible for more African-American borrowers,” wrote Kevin Waetke, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “We absolutely do not tolerate team members treating our customers or others disrespectfully or unfairly, or who violate our ethics and lending practices.” City and state officials across the nation have investigated and sometimes sued Wells Fargo over its practices. The Illinois attorney general has investigated whether Wells Fargo Financial violated fair lending and civil rights laws by steering black and Latino homeowners into high-interest loans. New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, raised similar questions about the lending practices of Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, among other banks. The N.A.A.C.P. has filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks, including Wells Fargo. At the heart of such charges is reverse redlining, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products to black customers. The New York Times, in a recent analysis of mortgage lending in New York City, found that black households making more than $68,000 a year were nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages as whites of similar or even lower incomes. (The disparity was greater for Wells Fargo borrowers, as 2 percent of whites in that income group hold subprime loans and 16.1 percent of blacks.) “We’ve known that African-Americans and Latinos are getting subprime loans while whites of the same credit profile are getting the lower-cost loans,” said Eric Halperin, director of the Washington office of the Center for Responsible Lending. “The question has been why, and the gory details of this complaint may provide an answer.” The affidavits of the two loan officers seem to bolster Baltimore’s lawsuit. Mr. Paschal, who is black and worked as a loan officer in Wells Fargo’s office in Annandale, Va., from 1997 to 2007, offers a sort of primer on Wells Fargo’s subprime marketing strategy by race. In 2001, he states in his affidavit, Wells Fargo created a unit in the mid-Atlantic region to push expensive refinancing loans on black customers, particularly those living in Baltimore, southeast Washington and Prince George’s County, Md. 1 2 Next Page » Janet Roberts contributed reporting.

Enlarge This Image Matt Roth for The New York Times Another foreclosed house on Baltimore's North Brice Street, which shares a downed fence with a house still lived in. These loans, Baltimore officials have claimed in a federal lawsuit against Wells Fargo, tipped hundreds of homeowners into foreclosure and cost the city tens of millions of dollars in taxes and city services. Wells Fargo, Ms. Jacobson said in an interview, saw the black community as fertile ground for subprime mortgages, as working-class blacks were hungry to be a part of the nation’s home-owning mania. Loan officers, she said, pushed customers who could have qualified for prime loans into subprime mortgages. Another loan officer stated in an affidavit filed last week that employees had referred to blacks as “mud people” and to subprime lending as “ghetto loans.” “We just went right after them,” said Ms. Jacobson, who is white and said she was once the bank’s top-producing subprime loan officer nationally. “Wells Fargo mortgage had an emerging-markets unit that specifically targeted black churches, because it figured church leaders had a lot of influence and could convince congregants to take out subprime loans.” Ms. Jacobson’s account and that of the other loan officer who gave an affidavit, Tony Paschal, both of whom have left Wells Fargo, provide the first detailed accusations of deliberate racial steering into subprimes by one of the nation’s top banks. The toll taken by such policies, Baltimore officials argue, is terrible. Data released by the city as part of the suit last week show that more than half the properties subject to foreclosure on a Wells Fargo loan from 2005 to 2008 now stand vacant. And 71 percent of those are in predominantly black neighborhoods. Judge Benson E. Legg of Federal District Court had asked the city to file the additional paperwork and has not decided whether the lawsuit can go forward. Wells Fargo officials have declined detailed interviews since Baltimore filed suit in January 2008. In an e-mail statement on Friday, a spokesman said that only 1 percent of the city’s 33,000 foreclosures have come on Wells Fargo mortgages. “We have worked extremely hard to make homeownership possible for more African-American borrowers,” wrote Kevin Waetke, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “We absolutely do not tolerate team members treating our customers or others disrespectfully or unfairly, or who violate our ethics and lending practices.” City and state officials across the nation have investigated and sometimes sued Wells Fargo over its practices. The Illinois attorney general has investigated whether Wells Fargo Financial violated fair lending and civil rights laws by steering black and Latino homeowners into high-interest loans. New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, raised similar questions about the lending practices of Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, among other banks. The N.A.A.C.P. has filed a class-action lawsuit charging systematic racial discrimination by more than a dozen banks, including Wells Fargo. At the heart of such charges is reverse redlining, specifically marketing the most expensive and onerous loan products to black customers. The New York Times, in a recent analysis of mortgage lending in New York City, found that black households making more than $68,000 a year were nearly five times as likely to hold high-interest subprime mortgages as whites of similar or even lower incomes. (The disparity was greater for Wells Fargo borrowers, as 2 percent of whites in that income group hold subprime loans and 16.1 percent of blacks.) “We’ve known that African-Americans and Latinos are getting subprime loans while whites of the same credit profile are getting the lower-cost loans,” said Eric Halperin, director of the Washington office of the Center for Responsible Lending. “The question has been why, and the gory details of this complaint may provide an answer.” The affidavits of the two loan officers seem to bolster Baltimore’s lawsuit. Mr. Paschal, who is black and worked as a loan officer in Wells Fargo’s office in Annandale, Va., from 1997 to 2007, offers a sort of primer on Wells Fargo’s subprime marketing strategy by race. In 2001, he states in his affidavit, Wells Fargo created a unit in the mid-Atlantic region to push expensive refinancing loans on black customers, particularly those living in Baltimore, southeast Washington and Prince George’s County, Md. 1 2 Next Page » Janet Roberts contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/business/02hartmarx.html?ref=wellsfargoandcompany">Shift by Hartmarx Reopens Bidding<date>Published: June 2, 2009</date><text>CHICAGO (AP)  A federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago on Monday approved a bidding process for the Hartmarx Corporation after the company revised a takeover bid to provide more cash for its largest creditor, the Wells Fargo bank.
