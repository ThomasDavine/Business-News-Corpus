Buffett, reported a smaller third-quarter profit on Friday after losing more than $2 billion on derivatives related to stock market performance.That was nearly three times what Berkshire lost on the same instruments a year ago. Buffett has sharply criticized derivatives in general, but has said these particular contracts were safe and would ultimately be lucrative. But Berkshire was hurt, like many other insurance companies in particular, by sharp declines in a broad range of market values. In a quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire said the indexes covered by the contracts fell 11 to 23 percent in the quarter. Berkshire reported a net profit of $2.28 billion, or $1,380 for each Class A share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $2.99 billion, or $1,814 a share. Cash at the end of the quarter was $34.78 billion, down from $47.89 billion at the end of June. During the third quarter, Berkshire financed the purchase of the chemical maker Lubrizol and a $5 billion investment in Bank of America, which accounted for the decline. Operating income rose across segments, except for the company’s finance business, where it fell slightly. Profit in the insurance business rose as a rebound in reinsurance results offset sharp declines at the auto insurer Geico. Earnings were also nearly 10 percent higher at Berkshire’s next-biggest unit, the Burlington Northern railroad, as revenue per car rose by more than 10 percent.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E4D8163CF930A35752C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=berkshirehathawayinc">280 Big Public Firms Paid Little U.S. Tax, Study Says<date>Published: November 3, 2011</date><text>Warren E. Buffett, take note. It is not just a few wealthy individuals paying unusually low taxes to the federal government. Corporate America is not far behind. A comprehensive study released on Thursday found that 280 of the biggest publicly traded American companies faced federal income tax bills equal to 18.5 percent of their profits during the last three years -- little more than half the official corporate rate of 35 percent and lower than their competitors in many industrialized countries. Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, has said that the tax code is unfair, allowing him to pay just 17 percent in federal taxes last year, about half the percentage his secretary paid. The corporate study, prepared by the left-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, examined the regulatory filings of the companies to compute each year's current federal taxes. Some of the companies disputed the findings, saying that the study understated their tax payments by omitting deferred taxes that they may pay in future years. Using information from the companies' own corporate filings, however, the study concluded that a quarter of the 280 corporations owed less than 10 percent of profits in federal income taxes and 30 companies had no federal tax liability for the entire three-year period. The report is being released as corporations are pushing for a cut in their official tax rate, saying the current system puts American companies at a disadvantage with competitors abroad and encourages them to shift jobs and investments overseas. The Congressional supercommittee charged with cutting the budget deficit is also considering proposals to revamp the tax system, simplifying the corporate structure and possibly lowering corporate rates. The study said that the shelters and loopholes in the current tax system rewarded companies that aggressively avoided taxes at the expense of those that did not. A quarter of the companies in the study had a federal tax bill of 35 percent of their profits, while a similar number had an effective rate of less than 10 percent. ''Companies that are paying their fair share ought to demand that the tax-dodging companies pay their fair share too,'' said Robert S. McIntyre, the author of study. ''So should the public, which is subsidizing them in terms of increased federal debt.'' The report is based on data gleaned from the companies' regulatory filings, which can be different from their corporate tax returns. Even in a year when a company claims an overall tax benefit, it may pay some cash taxes while accumulating credits that can be redeemed in future years. But because most corporations do not release their tax returns, these corporate regulatory filings offer the best publicly available gauge of what companies pay and what strategies they use to reduce their tax bills. Among the companies that the study said escaped a liability for all three years were Boeing and Ryder System, whose chief financial officer, Art A. Garcia, said the company had benefited from the additional depreciation intended to stimulate the economy. Boeing officials said they, too, had paid some federal taxes, but would not say how much. They said they had lowered their rate by taking advantage of tax breaks intended to encourage hiring. Chaz Bickers, a company spokesman, said Boeing hired 9,000 American workers this year Also on the list was General Electric, which has come under close scrutiny since The New York Times reported earlier this year that the company had recorded $5.1 billion in American profits in 2010, but claimed a federal income tax benefit of $3.2 billion in its regulatory filing. ''The report is inaccurate and distorted,'' said Kenneth Juarez, a G.E. spokesman. He said G.E. paid ''billions of dollars in taxes in the United States over the last decade,'' but would not say what part was federal income taxes. The company that recorded the biggest reduction in taxes was Wells Fargo Bank, which is a large holding of Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. The banking company reported a total of $49 billion in profits in 2008 through 2010, yet received a tax benefit of $651 million. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said much of the tax savings came from write-offs obtained after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, which incurred big losses during the financial crisis. American corporations are paying a smaller share of taxes than in previous decades. They paid a total of $191 billion in federal income taxes in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service said, representing about 1.3 percent of the nation's gross domestic product. That is down from about 6 percent during the 1950s (although some of the decline is because a smaller percentage of businesses now file as corporations). Despite the decline in corporate tax rates since then, business advocates say the nation needs to lower its top rate further to encourage hiring and investment. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the United States system was not competitive because it taxed income earned around the world, instead of just in this country. ''There are still Bolsheviks who recognize that we need to bring the rates down,'' he said. But the Citizens for Tax Justice study found that two-thirds of the American companies with significant profits overseas actually paid more in taxes to foreign governments than they did in the United States. Rather than lowering the corporate rate more, the study said, the federal government should end the subsidies and shelters that favor companies that game the system. ''Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and school -- things that are really important for economic development here in the United States,'' the report said.

The battle for the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings continued on Thursday, as Validus Holdings failed to win approval for its latest bid even after increasing the offer. The bid of $55.35 a share in cash and stock, which valued Transatlantic at more than $3.4 billion, was rejected by the Transatlantic board as too low, Validus announced on Thursday. “Given the work that has been done on both sides over the past six weeks, Validus was extremely disappointed that the Transatlantic board has failed to accept our increased offer,” Edward J. Noonan, the chief executive of Validus, said in a statement. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Validus has been trying for months to strike a deal with Transatlantic. In July, it made a hostile play for the company, but Transatlantic sued Validus, claiming the company had misrepresented the benefits of a possible deal to shareholders. Validus countersued in August, charging that Transatlantic had set up obstacles to merger negotiations. The salvos looked to be ending in September, when the companies signed a confidentiality agreement under which Validus agreed to put its legal battle on hold and enter deal talks. But that negotiating period failed to produce a mutually agreeable bid. Transatlantic has proved a frustrating takeover target. It has received offers from many bidders, including one from Allied World Assurance Company Holdings that fell apart in September, and a $3.25 billion bid from Berkshire Hathaway that was rejected in September. The company has since entered into confidential negotiations with two other potential buyers. Now, Validus has said once again take its bid directly to Transatlantic’s shareholders and attempt to place three independent directors — Raymond C. Groth, Paul G. Haggis and Thomas C. Wajnert — on the Transatlantic board. “We are confident Transatlantic stockholders will share our disappointment that the Transatlantic board has failed to accept our compelling increased offer,” Mr. Noonan said in the statement. “Transatlantic stockholders should have the right to decide the future of their company, and our consent solicitation is designed to provide them with this opportunity.” Both Transatlantic and Validus shares were up slightly in premarket trading on Thursday.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/another-potential-transatlantic-suitor-emerges/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Another Potential Transatlantic Suitor Emerges<date>October 11, 2011, 12:09 pm</date><text>Two bidders for Transatlantic Holdings have already walked away, but another potential suitor may yet make an offer for the reinsurance company.

His Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate said on Monday that it might buy back an unlimited amount of both classes of shares, at up to a 10 percent premium over book value. Many investors like to copy what Mr. Buffett does, but stock repurchases are best left to the Oracle of Omaha. If shares of other companies were truly undervalued, Berkshire probably wouldn’t be buying its own.The moment seems right for Berkshire. Its shares have suffered badly this year, falling 17 percent before Monday’s announcement. For a company that prides itself on beating the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index, it is small wonder that Mr. Buffett pulled the trigger on an option he has, at least in theory, supported for years. Shareholders liked the decision, pushing Berkshire’s A shares up 8 percent. What’s good for Mr. Buffett, though, might not be so good for other corporate bosses. Along with his hunting companion Charlie Munger, Buffett has been engaging in a mergers and acquisitions quest for “an elephant.” Yet Berkshire’s roughly $180 billion market value has made it tough to bag one big enough to help the company’s returns. In recent years, Berkshire has found smaller but satisfying game in finance. Fat dividends from preferred stock in Goldman Sachs, General Electric and Bank of America have proved appetizing. And although Berkshire will keep at least $20 billion of cash on hand, the decision to turn inward for rewards suggests the herd might be starting to look thin. It’s something investors would be wise to keep in mind. The view that stocks are undervalued remains entrenched on Wall Street and in boardrooms. Companies are buying back stock in droves, and sometimes borrowing to do so, without giving investors objective measures to justify the decisions. But there may yet be a strategy to mimic from Berkshire’s buyback. Since Mr. Buffett has put a ceiling on what he means by undervalued, and given his history of well-timed investments compared with the poor track record of most corporate share buybacks, maybe other companies should consider buying Berkshire stock instead of their own. Playing With Death The Delaware Supreme Court has just made death arbitrage a tougher game. Cashing out life insurance can keep a policyholder afloat if he suddenly needs the dough. But an active secondary market tempts some to buy insurance just to sell the policy. Delaware’s judges have wisely made such ghoulish bets on life expectancy easier for insurers to stop. Since the creation of life insurance in the 16th century, speculators have tried to wager on the death of strangers. Britain banned the practice in 1774, and United States law required policyholders to have an interest in seeing that the insured person stayed alive. But the rules in the United States loosened as both policyholders and financiers saw the potential advantage of letting insured people whose circumstances changed cash out their policies. A regulated secondary market sprang up. Taking this to its perhaps logical extreme, people were eventually persuaded to buy policies solely for investors, who set out to beat the insurance companies’ system of figuring when people would probably die. Now, with thousands of such policies coming due, insurers are contesting their validity. A big hurdle, though, is that the small print of most policies says they cannot be challenged after two years. That keeps insurers from reneging on coverage after holders have paid premiums for years, and some courts have proved reluctant to change that. But last week, Delaware’s top court came up with a creative solution. It relied on centuries-old precedents to say policies that were, in reality, investors’ bets on human life were invalid from the beginning. That meant the two-year limitation on challenges was also invalid. But the court also wanted to preserve legitimate payouts. So the judges specified that if the original policyholder paid the initial premiums, the policy was probably valid and could be resold. If, however, the premiums were paid by someone with no stake in the insured person staying alive, that was evidence of a sham. The decision puts Delaware at odds with New York, which recently upheld the two-year limitation without exception. But it reaffirms what is fast becoming the law in most states. That means more uncertainty for secondary market investors as insurers contest policies. But it’s also a welcome reminder that there are just a few things that remain off-limits in financial markets.

Buffett, said it would begin a share buyback program that comes after months of investor complaints that the stock is undervalued.Mr. Buffett had long avoided a stock buyback, saying he preferred using spare cash to buy companies that would increase his company’s profit margins. Yet some longtime investors have said Berkshire shares were lately at their cheapest in a generation, and even analysts who were cautious on the stock acknowledged it was attractively priced. Berkshire said Monday it was now willing to pay up to 10 percent more than book value for its stock. “In the opinion of our board and management, the underlying businesses of Berkshire are worth considerably more than this amount, though any such estimate is necessarily imprecise,” Berkshire said in a statement. Berkshire class A shares closed at $108,449, up 8.1 percent, while the more actively traded class B shares rose 8.6 percent to $72.09. Last week both classes fell to their lowest point since early 2010. The company’s A shares have never had a stock split. The B shares, which hold lesser voting rights, were split to help finance the takeover of a railroad, Burlington Northern. The company said it would use cash on hand to finance the buybacks, but would not buy any shares if doing so took the company’s cash position below $20 billion. Berkshire had $47.89 billion cash on June 30 but has spent at least $15 billion this quarter on acquisitions and investments, most notably the chemical company Lubrizol and a preferred stake in Bank of America. The timing of Berkshire’s announcement might be related to recent sharp market declines, said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of investment manager YCMNet Advisors and a Berkshire shareholder. Other investors said the buyback was a sign that Berkshire’s relationship with investors was changing, which could portend even bigger changes down the road, like an idea often rejected by Mr. Buffett: a dividend.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/transatlantic-says-berkshire-bid-remains-3-25-billion/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Transatlantic Says Berkshire Bid Remains $3.25 Billion<date>September 19, 2011, 9:32 am</date><text>Transatlantic Holdings said on Monday that Berkshire Hathaway‘s takeover bid for the reinsurer remains $3.25 billion in cash, ensuring that the two companies will not strike a deal. In a letter sent on Friday to Transatlantic, Berkshire’s head of reinsurance, Ajit Jain, wrote that the conglomerate’s National Indemnity unit would not raise its offer beyond its current $52-a-share level. The offer is valid until the close of business on Monday. The unsurprising news means the end of yet another merger opportunity for Transatlantic. Last Friday, the company canceled its proposed merger with Allied World Assurance, as shareholder opposition mounted. The only bidder that remains is Validus Holdings, which is pursuing a hostile stock-and-cash bid that is currently worth $2.96 billion, or $47.41 a share. Validus is also seeking to replace Transatlantic’s board, as part of an effort to force its target to the negotiating table. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Transatlantic press release Transatlantic said in a statement that Berkshire’s “opportunistic” bid remains well below the company’s book value, which was $69 to $70 as of the end of the reinsurer’s third quarter. Transatlantic added that Berkshire had not shown any particular interest in conducting more due diligence, which could have led to a higher offer. “The Transatlantic board of directors believes that selling Transatlantic for cash at the substantial discount to book value represented by the National Indemnity proposal simply would not deliver fair value to its stockholders,” the company said in its statement. Transatlantic indicated on Friday that it was willing to entertain other deal proposals. As a concession to one of Validus’s main concerns — that previous conditions to starting negotiations were too onerous — Transatlantic is willing to lower the hurdles for deal talks, according to people briefed on the matter. That would include shortening the length of time that Validus would be prohibited from buying additional Transatlantic shares to less than two years.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/transatlantic-ends-deal-with-allied-world/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Transatlantic Ends Deal With Allied World<date>September 16, 2011, 8:31 am</date><text>Transatlantic Holdings and Allied World Assurance called off their proposed $2.94 billion merger on Friday, after the two insurers faced stiff shareholder opposition and two rival bids for Transatlantic. Transatlantic has been fending off a higher $3.01 billion takeover bid by another reinsurer, Validus Holdings, and had been in talks with a unit of Berkshire Hathaway that had offered $3.25 billion. Friday’s announcement came as no surprise. Transatlantic’s biggest shareholder, Davis Selected Advisors, had already said it would vote against the Allied deal. And several influential proxy advisory firms recommended that Transatlantic investors reject the deal. Transatlantic said in a statement that it would continue to consider takeover offers, and increased an existing share buyback program to $600 million. Under the terms of the two companies’ agreement, Transatlantic will pay Allied a $35 million breakup fee, and will cover $13.3 million of Allied’s merger-related costs. Should Transatlantic strike a deal with another company during the next 12 months, it will owe Allied an additional $66.7 million. Transatlantic and Allied shareholders were scheduled to vote on their companies’ merger next week. Both meetings have been canceled. Earlier this week, Validus began a campaign to oust Transatlantic’s board in an effort to apply additional pressure. It has said that it might be willing to pay more than the amount it is offering, but has been stymied by an unwilling Transatlantic board. While Transatlantic had rejected a $52-a-share all-cash bid from Berkshire’s National Indemnity, it began negotiations with the insurance giant in hopes of fetching a higher offer. But a person briefed on the matter said that National Indemnity did not indicate a willingness to raise its bid, and that the prospects of a deal appeared increasingly unlikely. As of Thursday’s close, Allied’s all-stock deal was worth $47.05 a share. Validus’s cash-and-stock offer was worth $48.26 a share. Transatlantic shares closed at $49.55.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/general-electric-to-pay-back-warren-buffett/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">G.E. Will Pay Back $3 Billion to Buffett<date>September 13, 2011, 5:11 pm</date><text>Mario Anzuoni/ReutersWarren E. Buffett will get back $3 billion that he invested in General Electric during the financial crisis, plus a $300 million bonus. 8:31 p.m. | Updated Warren E. Buffett continues to collect benefits from the financial crisis. General Electric said on Tuesday that it would pay back the $3 billion investment that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, made in the depths of the crisis, netting Mr. Buffett a tidy profit. He will get back his principal, a $300 million bonus, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, according to a regulatory filing by G.E. on Tuesday. General Electric said it would repay the investment on Oct. 17. Mr. Buffett has been quick to capitalize on the problems of financial companies, forging deals at beneficial terms to Berkshire. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. filing In 2008, just before striking an agreement with G.E., Mr. Buffett picked up a $5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. This year, Goldman returned the $5 billion to Berkshire with an extra $500 million for paying back the investment early. The investment netted Mr. Buffett $1.7 billion, or roughly $190,000 a day. At the time the deal was negotiated, Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, joked that he would pay Mr. Buffett back in $1 bills. Mr. Buffett said that was fine, provided Goldman kept up a 10 percent dividend until he had finished counting the bills. As the market turbulence has picked up in recent months, Mr. Buffett has continued to hunt for opportunities. In August, Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion stake in Bank of America. Mr. Buffett is scheduled to receive a 6 percent annual dividend. Berkshire provided General Electric — and its finance unit GE Capital — with much-needed support in the crisis. Amid the market turmoil in fall 2008, General Electric reduced expectations for earnings, citing “unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets.” It also cut its dividend, stopped its stock buyback program and issued additional shares to raise capital. But those moves were not enough. As its stock continued to plummet, General Electric reached out Berkshire for a lifeline. With his investment, Mr. Buffett gave G.E. his implicit stamp of approval. But he extracted a hefty price. General Electric agreed to pay a 10 percent annual dividend on the $3 billion investment. The steep payout reflected the timing of the deal, which was negotiated during Wall Street’s darkest days. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar who covers Berkshire Hathaway. “There was a lot deeper concern about financial institutions.” Since then, G.E. has steadily improved its operations, notably retooling its finance arm to focus on less risky lending strategies. In the second quarter, GE Capital reported a profit of $1 billion, up 57 percent from the second quarter of 2010. “General Electric proved to be vulnerable to the financial crisis in 2008, as the group had sizable troubled assets and was too dependent on funding through the commercial paper market,” Henk van Tulden, an analyst with Financiele Diensten Amsterdam, wrote in a recent report. “The company reacted by restructuring, downsizing and stabilizing its financial division.” But despite the improvements, the stock has continued to languish, a situation that could crimp Mr. Buffett’s total profits on his G.E. investment. Berkshire has the option to buy $3 billion worth of G.E. common shares for $22.25 each until late 2013. General Electric shares closed at $15.41 on Tuesday, down nearly 40 percent from when Mr. Buffett made his investment nearly three years ago.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/berkshire-names-second-investment-manager/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Names Second Investment Manager<date>September 12, 2011, 9:18 am</date><text>Mario Anzuoni/ReutersWarren E.

Mr. Buffett, who turned 81 last month, has said that his roles of chairman, chief executive and chief investment officer will be split among at least three people upon his death or departure from the company. And Berkshire has said that as many as three managers may have responsibility for the company’s equity and debt portfolio.

Comes Out Against Transatlantic's Deal With Allied<date>September 11, 2011, 3:44 pm</date><text>Allied World Assurance, via Bloomberg NewsScott Carmilani, chief of Allied World Assurance. The proposed merger of Transatlantic Holdings with Allied World Assurance experienced a fresh setback on Friday, as a major shareholder advisory firm recommended that investors vote against the $2.86 billion deal. Institutional Shareholder Services, the biggest proxy advisory firm, wrote in its report that Transatlantic shareholders could likely get more for their holdings, given higher competing bids from Validus Holdings and Berkshire Hathaway. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “Upon review of the negotiation process and the premiums offered by the competing bidders, there is compelling reason to believe that for TRH shareholders, there is better chance of maximizing the value of their investment by voting down the AWH transaction,” I.S.S. wrote, referring to the stock tickers for Transatlantic and Allied. The Transatlantic-Allied deal has taken several big hits since it was announced in June. Last month, Transatlantic’s biggest shareholder, Davis Selected Advisors, publicly opposed the Allied deal. Davis’s holdings represent 9.9 percent of Transatlantic’s votable stock. The I.S.S. report bolsters arguments by Validus, another insurance company that is pursuing a $2.89 billion hostile bid for Transatlantic. Validus has argued that its stock-and-cash bid offers the most for Transatlantic shareholders, and has contended that Transatlantic is improperly refusing to begin merger negotiations. Validus has also said that it might offer a higher price if Transatlantic were to begin deal talks. Transatlantic has also been holding talks with a unit of Warren E. Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway, which bid $52 a share. While Transatlantic deemed that bid insufficient, it has said that it would begin talks with the unit, National Indemnity, in hopes of securing a higher bid. The value of both the Validus and Allied offers has steadily fallen since each was announced. As of Friday’s market close, the Validus offer was worth $46.27 a share, while the Allied bid was valued at $45.70 a share. Transatlantic’s stock closed at $48.83. Transatlantic and Allied have argued that their merger makes the most sense, creating a company that offers both reinsurance and specialty insurance like environmental liability policies. A spokesman for Transatlantic told DealBook in a statement: “We are disappointed with the recommendation because a merger with Allied World would accelerate our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.” A spokesman for Allied declined to comment. In its report, I.S.S. questioned whether a merger with Allied made the most sense for Transatlantic shareholders. The proxy adviser argued that Transatlantic had not done a recent “market check” to determine what price it could fetch in a sale, let alone a robust auction process that could have yielded a higher price. I.S.S. also wrote that, despite hurdles for competing bids like a relatively high $115 million break-up fee, two rival offers have emerged. That should signal to Transatlantic shareholders that their company could have gotten more in a sale, the proxy adviser said. Transatlantic and Allied have tried to resolve at least some of the ongoing concerns about their deal, in part by talking up the proposed benefits of the merger. Last week, Allied announced that it had doubled its estimates of the deal’s cost savings, to $160 million. Transatlantic shareholders are scheduled to vote on the Allied deal next week.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/buffett-to-invest-5-billion-in-bank-of-america/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett Invests $5 Billion in Bank of America<date>August 25, 2011, 9:22 am</date><text>Chuck Burton/Associated Press and Pablo Martinez Monsivais/Associated PressBrian T.

Bank of America's Capital Quandary Still, the Berkshire investment has helped allay concerns about Bank of America.

Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Moynihan has taken steps to cut costs and improve its capital cushion. He put the European credit card operation up for sale and sold off the Canadian card division, making it clear non-core assets would be on the block. Last week, the bank announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs. In a memo to employees, Mr. Moynihan said that “we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.” But the embattled chief stopped short of raising capital, reiterating that the financial firm was on solid footing. The assertions did little to soothe investors. Then on early Wednesday, Mr. Buffett called Mr. Moynihan to discuss a potential deal. At first, Bank of America’s chief was skeptical, saying the bank didn’t need a capital injection. But Mr. Buffett emphasized it would be a long-term investment, not a short-term fix. Over the course of the day and multiple calls, they hammered out the investment, finalizing the details late on Wednesday. Under the terms of the deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that pay a 6 percent annual dividend, and receive warrants for 700 million shares that it can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. It is the sort of move industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting the “the malaise to lift.” “We think this news is clearly a positive for the entire group as Buffett’s investment injects confidence into the system and Bank of America in particular following its consistent erosion in recent trading,” Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said in a research note, adding that it should help dampen volatility in the stock. Mr. Buffett has played the role of savior before. In the depths of the financial crisis, Berkshire Hathaway gave Goldman Sachs a $5 billion lifeline, which came with a hefty 10 percent dividend. The investment bank paid back the money earlier this year after getting the greenlight from regulators. When shares of General Electric got hit, Mr. Buffett stepped in with a $3 billion investment. The deal also came with a 10 percent annual payout. With Bank of America, Mr. Buffett is once again jumping in at a point of weakness. Since the beginning of the year, the bank’s shares have dropped to less than $7, from $15. Last year, it was trading at more than $19. “Bank of America is a strong, well-led company, and I called Brian to tell him I wanted to invest in it,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. “I am impressed with the profit-generating abilities of this franchise, and that they are acting aggressively to put their challenges behind them. Bank of America is focused on their customers and on serving them well. That’s what customers want, and that’s the company’s strategy.” Mr. Buffett is a fan of financial companies that he thinks have a strong franchise and brand. He owns Wells Fargo, gradually upping his stake over the past year. In the latest quarter, he bought nearly 10 million shares of the lender. He has also counted Bank of America among his past holdings. In the midst of the subprime crisis in 2007, Berkshire bought 8.7 million shares, quickly increasing the stake to 9.1 million shares. But Mr. Buffett was critical of management at the time. He told Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Bank of America paid a “crazy price” to acquire Merrill Lynch in the midst of the disaster. Mr. Buffett sold off his remaining shares in Bank of America at the end of 2010. In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E.

Buffett’s investment has a guaranteed payout. The financial crisis has been good to Warren E. Buffett. The billionaire investor snatched up shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during some of the darkest days of 2008, injecting life and funds into the companies and turning a handsome profit later. On Goldman alone, Mr. Buffett netted $1.7 billion. On Thursday, he sought to turn the same trick again, investing $5 billion in an institution that is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Bank of America. Like the Goldman deal, the Bank of America infusion comes with a rich plum: a guaranteed dividend payout of about $300 million a year, whether the stock goes up or down. The stock shot up on Thursday as the investment allayed concerns about the bank. Its shares rose as much as 27 percent, before ending the day up 9.4 percent, at $7.65. “He has the golden touch,” said Mitchel Penn, an analyst with Legg Mason Capital Management, one of Bank of America’s largest shareholders. “It’s a wonderful vote of confidence in Bank of America.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Buffett's $5 Billion Bet The Problems at a Shaky Bank of America The deal came together quickly. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Buffett’s assistant called the office of Brian T. Moynihan, the Bank of America chief executive, and a call was set up, said two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Mr. Moynihan told the investor that the bank did not need capital. Mr. Buffett responded by saying that he was planning to invest for the long term and outlined a proposal. Interested, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the two of them meet to discuss it. No, thanks, Mr. Buffett said, his mind was made up and he didn’t need a sit-down. The call was soon over. In the hours that followed, Mr. Moynihan, Bruce Thompson, the bank’s chief financial officer, and Charles Holliday, the chairman, met and briefed directors on Mr. Buffett’s proposal. Lawyers for both sides — Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson for Mr. Buffett’s company and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represented Bank of America — hashed out the details, working straight through the night. Robert E. Denham, a partner at Munger Tolles, said there were no major hurdles to an agreement. “It’s a very boring story,” he said laughing. “Just a very, very intense turning of the documents.” At 7 a.m. on Thursday, the board held a conference call to approve the deal. The investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. It has set aside more than $20 billion to cover its legal exposure for mortgages made during the housing bubble, and the bank faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Buffett is aware of the bank’s mortgage issues, but a person briefed on his thinking said that the investor felt that Bank of America was well positioned to make money over the long term and that the legal woes would diminish. At the age of 80, Mr. Buffett can claim a global reputation as a savvy investor for his bets on railroads, insurers and famous brands like Coca-Cola. But in recent years, he has also become one of the world’s mightiest champions of the banking industry. With the $5 billion investment by his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett stands to eventually become the largest shareholder in Bank of America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo and American Express. It stands to be a large stakeholder in Goldman when shares he obtained during the financial crisis convert. “He always likes to buy into industries he understands and he feels comfortable with banking,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar. That was not always the case. In his 1990 letter to shareholders Mr. Buffett wrote, “The banking business is no favorite of ours.” He had good reason to be skeptical. Just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of preferred shares in Salomon Inc. To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett did something unusual, stepping in to become chairman in August 1991 after he forced out Salomon’s chairman, John Gutfreund, during a Treasury auction scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving Salomon from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. Mr. Buffett stepped down as chairman of Salomon about 10 months later. It was many years before he would return to Wall Street. During the financial crisis in September 2008, Mr. Buffett came to the rescue of Goldman, investing $5 billion in the firm. A week later, he bought $3 billion in preferred shares from General Electric, as the conglomerate’s shares were plummeting. Each investment proved to be highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. By some measures, his Bank of America investment closely resembles the earlier deals. Each contained investments of $5 billion or lower and the deals all included warrants with strike prices near the pre-deal share price. During the crisis, however, Mr. Buffett commanded a steeper price. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Mr. Woodbury of Morningstar. Under the terms of the Bank of America deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Mr. Buffett also will receive warrants for 700 million shares that he can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. The deal is expected to close on Sept. 1, according to a regulatory filing. It was the sort of move that many industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big-name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting “the malaise to lift.” Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays, on Thursday commended Bank of America for being the one to nab the highly coveted “Buffett seal of approval.” In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E.

General Electric said on Tuesday that it would pay back the $3 billion investment that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, made in the depths of the crisis, netting Mr. Buffett a tidy profit. He will get back his principal, a $300 million bonus, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, according to a regulatory filing by G.E. on Tuesday. General Electric said it would repay the investment on Oct. 17. Mr. Buffett has been quick to capitalize on the problems of financial companies, forging deals at beneficial terms to Berkshire. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. filing In 2008, just before striking an agreement with G.E., Mr. Buffett picked up a $5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs, the investment bank. This year, Goldman returned the $5 billion to Berkshire with an extra $500 million for paying back the investment early. The investment netted Mr. Buffett $1.7 billion, or roughly $190,000 a day. At the time the deal was negotiated, Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, joked that he would pay Mr. Buffett back in $1 bills. Mr. Buffett said that was fine, provided Goldman kept up a 10 percent dividend until he had finished counting the bills. As the market turbulence has picked up in recent months, Mr. Buffett has continued to hunt for opportunities. In August, Berkshire Hathaway took a $5 billion stake in Bank of America. Mr. Buffett is scheduled to receive a 6 percent annual dividend. Berkshire provided General Electric — and its finance unit GE Capital — with much-needed support in the crisis. Amid the market turmoil in fall 2008, General Electric reduced expectations for earnings, citing “unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services markets.” It also cut its dividend, stopped its stock buyback program and issued additional shares to raise capital. But those moves were not enough. As its stock continued to plummet, General Electric reached out Berkshire for a lifeline. With his investment, Mr. Buffett gave G.E. his implicit stamp of approval. But he extracted a hefty price. General Electric agreed to pay a 10 percent annual dividend on the $3 billion investment. The steep payout reflected the timing of the deal, which was negotiated during Wall Street’s darkest days. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar who covers Berkshire Hathaway. “There was a lot deeper concern about financial institutions.” Since then, G.E. has steadily improved its operations, notably retooling its finance arm to focus on less risky lending strategies. In the second quarter, GE Capital reported a profit of $1 billion, up 57 percent from the second quarter of 2010. “General Electric proved to be vulnerable to the financial crisis in 2008, as the group had sizable troubled assets and was too dependent on funding through the commercial paper market,” Henk van Tulden, an analyst with Financiele Diensten Amsterdam, wrote in a recent report. “The company reacted by restructuring, downsizing and stabilizing its financial division.” But despite the improvements, the stock has continued to languish, a situation that could crimp Mr. Buffett’s total profits on his G.E. investment. Berkshire has the option to buy $3 billion worth of G.E. common shares for $22.25 each until late 2013. General Electric shares closed at $15.41 on Tuesday, down nearly 40 percent from when Mr. Buffett made his investment nearly three years ago.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/berkshire-names-second-investment-manager/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Names Second Investment Manager<date>September 12, 2011, 9:18 am</date><text>Mario Anzuoni/ReutersWarren E.

He has also counted Bank of America among his past holdings. In the midst of the subprime crisis in 2007, Berkshire bought 8.7 million shares, quickly increasing the stake to 9.1 million shares. But Mr. Buffett was critical of management at the time. He told Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Bank of America paid a “crazy price” to acquire Merrill Lynch in the midst of the disaster. Mr. Buffett sold off his remaining shares in Bank of America at the end of 2010. In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E.

Buffett’s investment has a guaranteed payout. The financial crisis has been good to Warren E. Buffett. The billionaire investor snatched up shares of Goldman Sachs and General Electric during some of the darkest days of 2008, injecting life and funds into the companies and turning a handsome profit later. On Goldman alone, Mr. Buffett netted $1.7 billion. On Thursday, he sought to turn the same trick again, investing $5 billion in an institution that is still struggling to recover from the financial crisis, Bank of America. Like the Goldman deal, the Bank of America infusion comes with a rich plum: a guaranteed dividend payout of about $300 million a year, whether the stock goes up or down. The stock shot up on Thursday as the investment allayed concerns about the bank. Its shares rose as much as 27 percent, before ending the day up 9.4 percent, at $7.65. “He has the golden touch,” said Mitchel Penn, an analyst with Legg Mason Capital Management, one of Bank of America’s largest shareholders. “It’s a wonderful vote of confidence in Bank of America.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Buffett's $5 Billion Bet The Problems at a Shaky Bank of America The deal came together quickly. On Wednesday morning, Mr. Buffett’s assistant called the office of Brian T. Moynihan, the Bank of America chief executive, and a call was set up, said two people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. Mr. Moynihan told the investor that the bank did not need capital. Mr. Buffett responded by saying that he was planning to invest for the long term and outlined a proposal. Interested, Mr. Moynihan suggested that the two of them meet to discuss it. No, thanks, Mr. Buffett said, his mind was made up and he didn’t need a sit-down. The call was soon over. In the hours that followed, Mr. Moynihan, Bruce Thompson, the bank’s chief financial officer, and Charles Holliday, the chairman, met and briefed directors on Mr. Buffett’s proposal. Lawyers for both sides — Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson for Mr. Buffett’s company and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, which represented Bank of America — hashed out the details, working straight through the night. Robert E. Denham, a partner at Munger Tolles, said there were no major hurdles to an agreement. “It’s a very boring story,” he said laughing. “Just a very, very intense turning of the documents.” At 7 a.m. on Thursday, the board held a conference call to approve the deal. The investment comes at a pivotal time for Bank of America. It has set aside more than $20 billion to cover its legal exposure for mortgages made during the housing bubble, and the bank faces a nationwide investigation into its foreclosure practices. Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Buffett is aware of the bank’s mortgage issues, but a person briefed on his thinking said that the investor felt that Bank of America was well positioned to make money over the long term and that the legal woes would diminish. At the age of 80, Mr. Buffett can claim a global reputation as a savvy investor for his bets on railroads, insurers and famous brands like Coca-Cola. But in recent years, he has also become one of the world’s mightiest champions of the banking industry. With the $5 billion investment by his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett stands to eventually become the largest shareholder in Bank of America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Berkshire is already the biggest shareholder in Wells Fargo and American Express. It stands to be a large stakeholder in Goldman when shares he obtained during the financial crisis convert. “He always likes to buy into industries he understands and he feels comfortable with banking,” said Drew Woodbury, an analyst with Morningstar. That was not always the case. In his 1990 letter to shareholders Mr. Buffett wrote, “The banking business is no favorite of ours.” He had good reason to be skeptical. Just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of preferred shares in Salomon Inc. To protect his holdings, Mr. Buffett did something unusual, stepping in to become chairman in August 1991 after he forced out Salomon’s chairman, John Gutfreund, during a Treasury auction scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving Salomon from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. Mr. Buffett stepped down as chairman of Salomon about 10 months later. It was many years before he would return to Wall Street. During the financial crisis in September 2008, Mr. Buffett came to the rescue of Goldman, investing $5 billion in the firm. A week later, he bought $3 billion in preferred shares from General Electric, as the conglomerate’s shares were plummeting. Each investment proved to be highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. By some measures, his Bank of America investment closely resembles the earlier deals. Each contained investments of $5 billion or lower and the deals all included warrants with strike prices near the pre-deal share price. During the crisis, however, Mr. Buffett commanded a steeper price. “It was an indication of how bad it was at the time,” said Mr. Woodbury of Morningstar. Under the terms of the Bank of America deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that will pay a 6 percent annual dividend. Mr. Buffett also will receive warrants for 700 million shares that he can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. The deal is expected to close on Sept. 1, according to a regulatory filing. It was the sort of move that many industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley’s chief executive, James P. Gorman, told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big-name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting “the malaise to lift.” Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays, on Thursday commended Bank of America for being the one to nab the highly coveted “Buffett seal of approval.” In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E. Buffett’s decision to invest $5 billion in Bank of America.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/risks-rescues-and-remorse/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Risks, Rescues and Remorse<date>August 25, 2011, 2:09 pm</date><text>Warren Buffett rode to the rescue of Bank of America today, as he did for Goldman Sachs in the dark days of September 2008. FLOYD NORRIS Notions on high and low finance. B of A will pay less to be saved, but that can be explained by the fact there is less panic to contend with this time. This time the rumors were that the bank needed to raise capital; back then, the rumors were that Goldman was the next Lehman Brothers. The terms of the two deals are similar. Berkshire Hathaway, Mr. Buffett’s company, invests $5 billion in straight preferred stock, and gets a warrant allowing him to invest another $5 billion in common stock at a set price. The preferred stock is perpetual, but the company can buy it back at a premium whenever it wishes to do so. At Goldman he got a 10 percent coupon on the preferred, and it would cost Goldman a 10 percent penalty to buy it back. At B of A, he gets 6 percent coupon and a 5 percent premium for a buyback. The warrants are different, and reflect that B of A was in a better position. B of A stock closed on Wednesday at $6.99. The warrants are at $7.142857. So at least B of A gets a little premium to market price at the time of the deal if the warrants are exercised. Goldman shares were at $125.05 when the deal with Mr. Buffett was announced. His warrant was at $115 per share. He got a discount exercise price. How has Mr. Buffett done at Goldman? Fine on the preferred. Not so fine on the warrant. Goldman bought the preferred back in April. Add in the interest and the repurchase premium, and Berkshire made $1.75 billion over two and a half years. Anything it collects on the warrants will be gravy, but at the moment there is none available. Goldman shares trade around $110. The warrants had five-year terms, so Berkshire has until October 2013 to exercise them. Mr. Buffett did do a little better on one term of the warrants at B of A. They are 10-year warrants, twice as long as at Goldman. So he has a lot longer time for the share price to work out. When Mr. Buffett made his first Wall Street rescue, of Salomon Brothers amid a scandal two decades ago, he was reported to have called his investment a Treasury bill with a lottery ticket attached. He would get a solid return if the company merely survived, and a great one if it prospered. Seen that way, this is not nearly as risky as a bet as a purchase of B of A stock would be. That may be the essential point that led the early euphoria to fade. B of A stock leaped to $8.80 soon after the opening this morning, but was under $8 by 11 a.m. It is a sign of both the prestige of Mr. Buffett and of the fragility of markets that either of these deals were available to him. Of course, there are risks in being a rescuer. A rescuer needs to use cash it can afford to lose, and it needs to have the judgment and courage to refuse to throw good money after bad if things do not go according to plan. In August 2007, Countrywide Financial, a major home lender, was bailed out by B of A, which invested $2 billion in convertible preferred stock. It was convertible at a discount to current market value. B of A stock rose on the news. A few months later, with Countrywide in deeper trouble, B of A agreed to take over the whole company for stock then worth $4 billion. The deal closed July 1, 2008. By then B of A was trading for about half what it was worth when it first invested in Countrywide. It had a lot further to fall. It was one of the worst mergers ever. B of A has yet to reach the bottom of the sinkhole of legal liability created by Countrywide’s reckless lending policies. But for that rescue by Bank of America, this one — of Bank of America — would not be necessary.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/e-u-clears-lubrizol-deal/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">European Union Clears Lubrizol Deal<date>August 25, 2011, 8:42 am</date><text>European Union antitrust regulators approved Berkshire Hathaway’s $9 billion acquisition of Lubrizol, Reuters reports.

Buffett is among the nation’s best deal-makers, and in the $5 billion investment he struck with Bank of America, he’s getting a guaranteed profit. Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will receive 50,000 perpetual preferred shares. That stock carry a 6 percent annual dividend payable quarterly, meaning that Bank of America will be sending about $300 million a year to Berkshire’s headquarters in Omaha. Put another way, Berkshire will be earning $821,917.81 a day, or $9.51 a second. All in all, not a bad way to spend $5 billion, especially when Berkshire had $47.9 billion in cash and equivalents as of the end of the second quarter. Berkshire will also receive 10-year warrants that can be converted into 700 million common shares in Bank of America, at a strike price of about $7.14. (To be exact, $7.142857.) As of Thursday afternoon, that meant an immediate paper profit of $392 million on the warrants, based on Bank of America’s stock price of $7.70. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Want more granular detail? Analysts told Reuters that the actual value of Berkshire’s warrants are worth $3.17 billion to $3.84 billion, though the actual value will change over time. And Dealbreaker has put together a nicely considered analysis of the value of Bank of America implied by Berkshire’s investment, replete with a Google Docs spreadsheet. The short answer: $5.28 a share or so. (The stock was trading around $7.70 on Thursday afternoon.) The deal will provide Berkshire with a tidy profit as long as Mr. Buffett can hold on to the stake. Bank of America can buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium, or an additional $250 million. Bank of America is undeniably getting a better deal than Goldman Sachs or General Electric did when they secured similar deals with Berkshire. Mr. Buffett paid $5 billion for preferred shares and warrants in Goldman and $3 billion for the same in G.E. The preferred shares in both carried a 10 percent annual dividend and a 10 percent premium to be repaid early. In Goldman’s case, when it finally bought out Berkshire’s stake in the spring, it paid out $5.64 billion. But as Mr. Buffett told CNBC on Thursday morning, those were struck during the financial crisis, and therefore demanded much harsher terms.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/buffett-adds-another-bank-to-his-investment-portfolio/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett Adds Another Bank to His Portfolio<date>August 25, 2011, 12:15 pm</date><text>Pankaj Nangia/Bloomberg NewsWarren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation’s banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. Here were Berkshire’s top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing: FIRM MARKET VALUE OF STAKE AMOUNT OF SHARES CHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER American Express $7.84 billion 151,610,700 No change Wells Fargo $9.89 billion 352,327,608 + 9,703,683 shares US Bancorp $1.76 billion 69,039,426 No change Source: Bloomberg News/S.E.C. filing Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&amp;T Bank Corporation. Of course, Mr. Buffett’s most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. Still, not all of Mr. Buffett’s Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm’s stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.) Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares.

Davis owns about 23.6 percent of Transatlantic shares.

One wild card remains in the mix: Transatlantic is in discussions about a potential takeover by a unit of Berkshire Hathaway. While Transatlantic has said that a $52-a-share bid by Berkshire’s National Indemnity is a nonstarter, it believes that holding talks with the insurance giant could yield an offer superior to the Allied merger.

The legal shot by Validus follows the increasingly complex evolution of the fight over Transatlantic, which has also received offers from Allied World Assurance and a unit of Berkshire Hathaway. Transatlantic said earlier this week that it would like to begin negotiations with Berkshire’s National Indemnity. In a letter sent to Transatlantic’s board on Thursday, Validus’s chief executive, Edward J. Noonan, again complained about what he described as onerous conditions that his company must meet to begin merger negotiations. Chief among these is a standstill agreement that would block Validus from acquiring additional shares in Transatlantic while the two are in talks. Validus asserted that Transatlantic was hiding behind a misreading of a clause in its merger agreement with Allied that would give the company greater discretion to negotiate the terms of the talks. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Validus letter Validus also offered to let Transatlantic take a look at its own books. To back up the letter, Validus sued Transatlantic in Delaware Chancery Court for breach of fiduciary duty. (Read the lawsuit here.) Thursday’s lawsuit is the latest legal shot fired in the insurance battle. Late last month, Transatlantic sued Validus in Delaware, arguing that the bidder had misrepresented the benefits of the deal to shareholders. The move by Validus follows a slide in the value of its hostile offer. Initially valued at $55.95 a share, or about $3.5 billion, the stock-and-cash bid is now worth about $46.38 a share. Allied’s proposal, which Transatlantic first accepted and which it is still urging shareholders to take as well, is now valued at $45.66. Only about $45 million separates Validus’s and Allied’s overall offers. Both are currently well below the $52-a-share bid by Berkshire, which Transatlantic has rejected but said is likely to lead to a superior offer. One complication is that the bid would probably be all-cash, which offers Transatlantic shareholders little future upside. That could be a problem for the company’s board, given that the offer values the reinsurer’s assets at about 77 cents on the dollar.

Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway is known as the ultimate deal maker. But it doesn’t always get its way. Berkshire has offered to buy a reinsurer, Transatlantic Holdings, for about $3.25 billion, seeking to top existing proposals from Validus Holdings and Allied World Assurance. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Berkshire Unit Bids $3.25 Billion for Transatlantic But Berkshire previously competed against Validus two years ago over a different insurance target, IPC Holdings — and lost to Validus. For now, Berkshire’s bid for Transatlantic, made through its National Indemnity unit, is the highest offer on the table. In a brief letter sent on Friday by a top Buffett lieutenant, Ajit Jain, Berkshire offered $52 a share. Given Mr. Buffett’s track record, that would likely be an all-cash bid. In classic Buffett fashion, Berkshire wrote in the letter that it expected a response from Transatlantic by the end of the Monday business day. Berkshire also does not plan to engage in customary due-diligence review. Transatlantic responded Monday that it would “carefully consider and evaluate the proposal from National Indemnity.” It said shareholders did not need to take any action at this time ahead of its board’s recommendation. As of Friday, Validus’s hostile stock-and-cash offer was worth $46.37 a share, while Allied’s all-stock bid was worth $44.22. But both had been valued higher: Validus’s offer was valued at $55.95 when first announced last month, while Allied’s was worth about $51.10 when disclosed in June. For their part, Validus and Allied persisted in their campaigns. Validus said that it wanted to be able to hold deal negotiations with Transatlantic without what it called “onerous” hurdles. People close to the insurer say that it might also favor Transatlantic beginning a formal auction process. And Allied criticized the Berkshire offer as “at best, opportunistic.” But Transatlantic’s board will have to consider more than just the per-share numbers. If Berkshire’s bid is all cash, it would be entirely taxable, while any stock-for-stock component in the other offers wouldn’t be. And it would offer no future gains for Transatlantic shareholders if the combined company does well. The Berkshire bid is also below Transatlantic’s book value, or its assets minus its liabilities, of $4.2 billion. Some of those factors may have played into Berkshire’s inability to win over IPC, another reinsurer that drew a slew of takeover bids when it was put up for sale in 2009. In a regulatory filing, IPC named a “Party M” — identified only as “a global insurance and reinsurance company” — that eventually bid $30 a share. People with knowledge of that sale process have since said that Party M was Berkshire. Validus’s hostile bid for IPC, which eventually prevailed, was valued at $29.48 a share in stock and cash. What happened? According to the regulatory filing, Party M’s bid required an “inducement fee” of $50 million, and would have prevented IPC from paying out a dividend in the third quarter of 2009. Transatlantic’s board may be a little hard-pressed to come up with a decision by the Berkshire bid’s deadline, especially with two other offers already on the table. For now, the company says that its board will “carefully consider and evaluate the proposal” and has advised its shareholders to take no action. Perhaps Berkshire will succeed this time around. But the Buffett playbook, it seems, isn’t always a surefire winner.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/s-p-negative-on-berkshire-hathaway/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">S.&amp;P.

The legal shot by Validus follows the increasingly complex evolution of the fight over Transatlantic, which has also received offers from Allied World Assurance and a unit of Berkshire Hathaway. Transatlantic said earlier this week that it would like to begin negotiations with Berkshire’s National Indemnity. In a letter sent to Transatlantic’s board on Thursday, Validus’s chief executive, Edward J. Noonan, again complained about what he described as onerous conditions that his company must meet to begin merger negotiations. Chief among these is a standstill agreement that would block Validus from acquiring additional shares in Transatlantic while the two are in talks. Validus asserted that Transatlantic was hiding behind a misreading of a clause in its merger agreement with Allied that would give the company greater discretion to negotiate the terms of the talks.

To back up the letter, Validus sued Transatlantic in Delaware Chancery Court for breach of fiduciary duty. (Read the lawsuit here.) Thursday’s lawsuit is the latest legal shot fired in the insurance battle. Late last month, Transatlantic sued Validus in Delaware, arguing that the bidder had misrepresented the benefits of the deal to shareholders. The move by Validus follows a slide in the value of its hostile offer. Initially valued at $55.95 a share, or about $3.5 billion, the stock-and-cash bid is now worth about $46.38 a share. Allied’s proposal, which Transatlantic first accepted and which it is still urging shareholders to take as well, is now valued at $45.66. Only about $45 million separates Validus’s and Allied’s overall offers. Both are currently well below the $52-a-share bid by Berkshire, which Transatlantic has rejected but said is likely to lead to a superior offer. One complication is that the bid would probably be all-cash, which offers Transatlantic shareholders little future upside. That could be a problem for the company’s board, given that the offer values the reinsurer’s assets at about 77 cents on the dollar.

Buffett‘s Berkshire Hathaway is known as the ultimate deal maker. But it doesn’t always get its way. Berkshire has offered to buy a reinsurer, Transatlantic Holdings, for about $3.25 billion, seeking to top existing proposals from Validus Holdings and Allied World Assurance. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Berkshire Unit Bids $3.25 Billion for Transatlantic But Berkshire previously competed against Validus two years ago over a different insurance target, IPC Holdings — and lost to Validus. For now, Berkshire’s bid for Transatlantic, made through its National Indemnity unit, is the highest offer on the table. In a brief letter sent on Friday by a top Buffett lieutenant, Ajit Jain, Berkshire offered $52 a share. Given Mr. Buffett’s track record, that would likely be an all-cash bid. In classic Buffett fashion, Berkshire wrote in the letter that it expected a response from Transatlantic by the end of the Monday business day. Berkshire also does not plan to engage in customary due-diligence review. Transatlantic responded Monday that it would “carefully consider and evaluate the proposal from National Indemnity.” It said shareholders did not need to take any action at this time ahead of its board’s recommendation. As of Friday, Validus’s hostile stock-and-cash offer was worth $46.37 a share, while Allied’s all-stock bid was worth $44.22. But both had been valued higher: Validus’s offer was valued at $55.95 when first announced last month, while Allied’s was worth about $51.10 when disclosed in June. For their part, Validus and Allied persisted in their campaigns. Validus said that it wanted to be able to hold deal negotiations with Transatlantic without what it called “onerous” hurdles. People close to the insurer say that it might also favor Transatlantic beginning a formal auction process. And Allied criticized the Berkshire offer as “at best, opportunistic.” But Transatlantic’s board will have to consider more than just the per-share numbers. If Berkshire’s bid is all cash, it would be entirely taxable, while any stock-for-stock component in the other offers wouldn’t be. And it would offer no future gains for Transatlantic shareholders if the combined company does well. The Berkshire bid is also below Transatlantic’s book value, or its assets minus its liabilities, of $4.2 billion. Some of those factors may have played into Berkshire’s inability to win over IPC, another reinsurer that drew a slew of takeover bids when it was put up for sale in 2009. In a regulatory filing, IPC named a “Party M” — identified only as “a global insurance and reinsurance company” — that eventually bid $30 a share. People with knowledge of that sale process have since said that Party M was Berkshire. Validus’s hostile bid for IPC, which eventually prevailed, was valued at $29.48 a share in stock and cash. What happened? According to the regulatory filing, Party M’s bid required an “inducement fee” of $50 million, and would have prevented IPC from paying out a dividend in the third quarter of 2009. Transatlantic’s board may be a little hard-pressed to come up with a decision by the Berkshire bid’s deadline, especially with two other offers already on the table. For now, the company says that its board will “carefully consider and evaluate the proposal” and has advised its shareholders to take no action. Perhaps Berkshire will succeed this time around. But the Buffett playbook, it seems, isn’t always a surefire winner.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/s-p-negative-on-berkshire-hathaway/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">S.&amp;P.

At 80, the Oracle from Omaha says he’s pretty comfortable sticking with his long-held strategy. Although fellow attendee, Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC, told reporters Thursday morning that current valuations are “wildly overpriced,” Mr. Buffett said he was optimistic about his ability to find great investments in this market. “We’re looking for ones that aren’t crazy,” Mr. Buffett said. “Most companies I don’t know how to value, there’s a few that I think I know how to value and every now and then one of those are a price number that falls within my valuation range.” Despite his bullish outlook on India and China, he’s not rushing to put Berkshire’s capital in Asia. “The Chinese economy is going to be growing a lot faster than the U.S. economy, but that’s good for us,” Mr. Buffett said. “The world is not a zero-sum game, and we will do much better in the next 50 or 100 years, if the Chinese do better in the 50 or 100 years.

I’ve seen nothing to indicate that myself, and I don’t want him to,” he said enthusiastically. “I want him to stay!” Mr. Buffett came to Goldman’s rescue in 2008 during the financial crisis, investing $5 billion in the Wall Street firm. It was a crucial lifeline for Goldman and a sweet deal for Mr. Buffett. He negotiated a 10 percent annual dividend on the deal, which amounted to about $500 million a year. While Goldman paid back the money this year, Mr. Buffett still has a lucrative tie to the investment bank. Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, negotiated the right to buy $5 billion in stock with a strike price of $115. Those warrants are outstanding. In Sun Valley, Mr. Buffett said his plans to exercise those warrants remained the same. He expects to do so in 2013 when they are set to expire. “We’ll wait till the last month or two, before their expiration,” he said.

Buffett, second from right, sits with his children, from left, Howard, Susie and Peter at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting in Omaha, Neb. OMAHA — At the annual gathering of Berkshire Hathaway’s investors here this weekend, Warren E. Buffett made it clear that, as far as he is concerned, it’s back to business as usual. But a former top manager for him, David L. Sokol, may make that a difficult goal to accomplish. Mr. Buffett said at a news conference on Sunday that while he viewed the controversy caused by Mr. Sokol’s abrupt departure a month ago as sad, he saw little reason to dwell on the matter for very long. “I’ve got no strong feelings about it, except that it’s a very sad situation,” he said. He said he planned no major changes to Berkshire’s management practices, which largely leave the executives of the company’s subsidiaries to operate as they please. With more than 260,000 employees working for him around the world, something can and will inevitably go wrong, Mr. Buffett said. His longtime investing partner, Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charles Munger, addressed the issue more bluntly. “We’ve had a close brush with scandal two times in 50 years,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to devote a lot of time to this.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Nevertheless, Mr. Sokol appears ready to keep the issue alive and wage a fight against Berkshire and his onetime boss. In a statement issued after Berkshire’s annual meeting, Mr. Sokol’s lawyer insisted that Mr. Buffett was “transparently scapegoating” his client, and that Mr. Sokol had not violated company policy with those trades. Mr. Buffett already used the annual meeting on Saturday, attended by tens of thousands of ardent investors from around the world, to speak at length about what he knew of Mr. Sokol’s stock purchases in a chemical maker that he later recommended to Mr. Buffett as a potential acquisition. Berkshire announced in March that it would buy the chemical producer, Lubrizol, for $9 billion. The deal produced a $3 million paper profit for Mr. Sokol. Mr. Buffett said Saturday that Mr. Sokol’s actions were “inexplicable and inexcusable,” though he declined to personally attack him. Mr. Buffett said that Mr. Sokol had violated company trading policy. In his statement, Mr. Sokol’s lawyer defiantly denied that claim, saying, “At no time did Mr. Sokol violate the law or any Berkshire policy.” Mr. Buffett sought to parry those assertions on Sunday, arguing that he has been forthright in disclosing the relevant details of the matter. He said that he did not know of any other details relevant to an investigation, and that he was cooperating with regulators in their inquiries. “The facts are the facts,” he said. “His lawyer wasn’t there. I know what happened.” Since Berkshire disclosed Mr. Sokol’s resignation and its circumstances, the controversy has threatened to mar Mr. Buffett’s lustrous reputation among investors. But Mr. Buffett said he did not expect the affair to cause permanent damage. The pressure on Mr. Sokol is likely to grow. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into his trades, according to people briefed on the matter, using in part information submitted by Berkshire. Mr. Buffett said on Saturday that the data his company had turned over was “pretty damning.” Mr. Buffett spoke at greater length Sunday about more traditional topics of discussion for Berkshire meetings. Asked by reporters from various countries — including Germany, Brazil and South Korea — about whether he would be interested in acquiring companies in those areas, he responded yes to all of them. Asked again about a potential successor to him, Mr. Buffett said only that even the worst of the unnamed candidates would be “very, very good.” Shareholders appeared to side largely with Mr. Buffett. At Berkshire’s meeting on Saturday, most seemed more concerned with potential investments and successors than with the Sokol matter. “I trust Buffett and the board,” Mary Murphy, from Omaha, said on Sunday. “He seemed like he was being honest and saying what he knew.”</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/warren-buffett-lets-the-facts-bury-sokol/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett Lets the Facts Bury Sokol<date>May 2, 2011, 8:32 pm</date><text>Prashanth Vishwanthan/Bloomberg News OMAHA — In Warren E. Buffett’s view, he was as ruthless as ever. The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — who has faced scrutiny for weeks after revelations that a top lieutenant, David L. Sokol, bought $10 million of shares of Lubrizol while orchestrating an acquisition of the company — has been criticized for his initial response to the situation. In a press release, Mr. Buffett provided a detailed account of the questionable trades and declared that he did not believe the purchases “were in any way unlawful.” But the public was vocal. Admittedly, I’ve been among those scratching my head about his reaction. After all, this is a guy whose mantra is, “Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Buffett on the Sokol Affair Responding to the criticism, Mr. Buffett said, “What I think bothers some people is that there wasn’t some big sense of outrage.” He added, “I plead guilty to that.” Over the weekend at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, where I was one of the three journalists posing questions to Mr. Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger, I think I have finally come to understand Mr. Buffett’s thinking. While Mr. Buffett praised Mr. Sokol in the statement announcing the resignation, he left out one big “ruthless” fact that would change the narrative completely. The day he issued the release, Berkshire called the Securities and Exchange Commission and briefed them on Mr. Sokol’s trades, which Mr. Buffett described to me as “pretty damning evidence.” “Calling the head of the enforcement division of the S.E.C. and laying out a pattern of trading that you know is going to result in something — Dave probably thought it was pretty harsh,” Mr. Buffett told me. The S.E.C. is now investigating the matter, people briefed on the inquiry said. In a statement after the Berkshire meeting, a lawyer for Mr. Sokol issued a statement, saying the stock trades did not violate the law or Berkshire policy. A close friend of Mr. Buffett’s explained his thinking this way. “Warren knew that the second that press release hit the wires, Sokol’s professional career was over. Done. Forever. Sokol was finished. He didn’t need to brag about being ‘ruthless.’ ” “The media wanted more — a nasty quote about how upset Warren was with Dave. But what’s the point? Just laying out the facts so publicly was the most ruthless thing he could have done. If you worked at Berkshire, you got the message loud and clear.” Mr. Buffett, who was clearly overcome with emotion at the time he drafted the original press release and is said not to have slept well for several days that week, said he praised Mr. Sokol out a sense of fairness. “I felt that if I’m laying out a whole bunch of facts that are going to create lots of problems for him for years to come, that I also list his side of the equation in terms of what he’d done for Berkshire,” Mr. Buffett said. That’s not to say Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger believed they handled the situation perfectly. “I think we can concede that that press release was not the cleverest press release in the history of the world,” Mr. Munger said. “The facts were complicated, and we didn’t foresee appropriately the natural reaction.” “But I would argue that you don’t want to make important decisions in anger,” he continued. “You want to display as much ruthlessness as your duty requires, and you do not want to add one single iota because you’re angry.” “You can always tell a man to go to hell tomorrow.” Upon reflection, however, there may be virtue in Berkshire’s measured approach. Despite all the blaring headlines and questions about whether Mr. Buffett’s reputation has been forever tarnished, Berkshire’s shareholders, the ones who actually have money on the line, seemed to be fine with the way the matter was handled. At the shareholders’ meeting, I could not find any who were overly worked up about the matter or were raising larger questions about Berkshire’s compliance programs. Mario Gabelli, a big investor with shares of Berkshire, called the Sokol episode “irrelevant” and derided it as “a good story for the media.” Nor did they seem worried about succession. Mr. Buffett made a passing remark that actually may have been the most telling of the entire weekend. After a query about whether Mr. Sokol had been his heir apparent, Mr. Buffett replied that the question “made an assumption there about Sokol being the next in line, which I’m not sure was warranted.” From an investment perspective, Mr. Gabelli said the Sokol matter would not impact his thinking on the company, succession or anything else. He, like Mr. Buffett, simply cares about the company’s cold, hard numbers. As for Berkshire’s compliance programs, which are not nearly as tough as those at most investment firms, Mr. Buffett clearly believes that he must run his company based on a modicum of trust. “We can have all the records in the world and if somebody wants to trade outside them or something, you know, they’re not going to tell us they’re trading in their cousin’s name,” Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Munger added. “I think your best compliance cultures are the ones which have this attitude of trust and some of the ones with the biggest compliance departments, like Wall Street, have the most scandals.” By the end of the weekend I still got the sense that Mr. Buffett, while furious with Mr. Sokol, struggled to publicly criticize him. When asked why he thought Mr. Sokol did it, he repeatedly said it was “inexplicable.” Mr. Munger, who often acts as the unfiltered version of Mr. Buffett, put it more bluntly, with a simple, one-word reply: “hubris.” Andrew Ross Sorkin is the editor of DealBook. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 4, 2011 The DealBook column on Tuesday, about Warren E.

Buffett, to his credit, dived right into the David L. Sokol affair early at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting on Saturday. Mr. Buffett compared his onetime deputy’s dealing in Lubrizol shares to the scandal that rocked Salomon Brothers two decades ago. He called both events “inexcusable” and “inexplicable.” Yet Mr. Buffett overlooked the more significant link to Salomon, the Wall Street bank he once partly owned and led as chairman. The rogue trading there exposed poor controls. Charles Munger, Mr. Buffett’s longtime investing partner, diagnosed part of the problem. He told the packed Qwest Center in Omaha that hubris can sometimes cause irrational behavior. Mr. Munger could just as easily have been describing some of Mr. Buffett’s actions, including praising Mr. Sokol in the news release that disclosed his questionable trades and resignation. Mr. Buffett at the time said nothing of the apparently glaring violations of Berkshire’s codes of conduct. Though Mr. Buffett seemed unwilling, or unable, to dwell on his own failings when addressing Berkshire shareholders, he joked that Mr. Munger would handle future news releases and pleaded guilty to not expressing any outrage. Mr. Buffett also stumbled onto something. Evoking Salomon Brothers was right on the nose. Then, the violation of Treasury trading rules by Paul W. Mozer was only a major symptom of a bigger internal ailment, which led all the way to the top. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger would learn belatedly, for example, that senior management, including John H. Gutfreund, then the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers, had neglected to inform the board and regulators about the full extent of the trading misdeeds. Mr. Sokol’s actions do not seem to be exposing anything quite as sinister at Berkshire. In fact, the company is generally, and rightly, admired for a strong ethical focus. But this recent blind spot — with an audit committee report about it — reveals a lack of appropriate governance and controls. RIM Risks Reversal Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, is starting to feel a squeeze. The company, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, is hemorrhaging market share and just warned that product delays are hurting sales. The pressure is showing: its co-chief executive, Michael Lazaridis, recently stormed off a television interview when asked about security issues. RIM needs to compose itself if a new tablet and operating system are to keep the company relevant. Just weeks after issuing profit estimates, RIM warned that delays in bringing out new handsets scared off customers. Those still buying its devices in the United States and Latin America are choosing cheaper, lower-end ones. As a result, earnings per share will actually shrink slightly, despite the booming market for smartphones. RIM contends this is a temporary hiccup. Phones introduced this summer, and its answer to the iPad, mean earnings should rise 18 percent during the fiscal year ending February 2012. If so, the shares, including their 14 percent tumble on Friday, look incredibly cheap at 6.5 times this year’s earnings. But the projections sound optimistic. Maybe management is becoming overly defensive. Mr. Lazaridis certainly looked it in a recent BBC interview. He walked off when asked about demands by foreign governments to monitor BlackBerry phones. It’s hard to see how earnings won’t suffer. Reviews of RIM’s recently introduced tablet device have been mediocre. New phones, based on the latest version of its operating system, may be better than what it currently offers. But these look like more of a stopgap. After all, RIM plans to introduce a system called QNX in 2012. What’s more, customers seem to be defecting, not waiting. BlackBerry’s share of recent smartphone sales in the United States shrank from 37 percent a year ago to 15 percent in the first quarter, according to Nielsen. RIM executives are promising lots of progress in the coming months. But it will take considerably more poise to stop the motion from going backward. AGNES T.

He said he planned no major changes to Berkshire’s management practices, which largely leave the executives of the company’s subsidiaries to operate as they please.

Three journalists will ask him questions culled from thousands that have been e-mailed by shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s sprawling holding company. The audience will consist of 35,000 of those shareholders who traveled to Omaha to hear him. Buffett describes this event — a k a the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting — as “Woodstock for capitalism.” It’s normally a festive affair, with shareholders celebrating a stock that has made many of them wealthy, while Buffett, a shameless ham, cracks wise and dispenses folksy investing wisdom. This year, though, the tone is likely to be more somber, thanks to l’affaire Sokol, which has seriously dented Buffett’s pristine image. For someone who has said repeatedly that he would rather lose money than even a shred of reputation, his actions have been inexplicable. Thus the questions this morning are going to be unusually tough. As they should be. David Sokol, of course, was the trusted Buffett aide who left Berkshire last month after it was revealed that he had bought $10 million worth of Lubrizol, a company he then convinced Buffett to buy — giving Sokol a nifty $3 million profit in a few weeks’ time. To his credit, Buffett is the one who revealed this information in a press release. But in that same release, Buffett went to embarrassing lengths to absolve his former top lieutenant, even writing at one point, “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful.” That is a stupefying sentence for someone who tells his executives that if they’re worried that “some action is too close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget about it.” Since then, Buffett has been subject to criticism of a kind he has never before faced. Michael Steinhardt, the former hedge fund manager, went on CNBC and essentially denounced him as a hypocrite. Journalists have written stories that show Sokol in an extremely unflattering light; in a lawsuit last year, he was accused of ripping off minority shareholders of a venture he controlled — an accusation with which the judge, after hearing Sokol testify, wholeheartedly agreed. “It makes you question Warren’s judgment,” said Jeff Matthews, an investor and the author of the new e-book, “Secrets in Plain Sight: Business and Investing Secrets of Warren Buffett.” Earlier this week, the Berkshire Hathaway audit committee issued a scathing report, accusing Sokol of dissembling about his Lubrizol purchase. The report seemed rather conveniently timed to take a little pressure off Buffett in advance of the annual meeting. But it shouldn’t. Even if Sokol did lie to Buffett, as the audit committee suggests, the Sokol mess still raises a host of painful questions for both Buffett and his shareholders. For starters, the report doesn’t explain why Buffett let Sokol walk out the door with a pat on the back instead of a kick in the rear. What moved him to pre-emptively clear Sokol, who had so clearly violated Berkshire’s code of conduct, of wrongdoing? What does that tell us of possible flaws in Buffett’s character? Just as importantly for shareholders, there are questions about his management style — questions that were once easy to ignore but no longer are. Buffett has always operated Berkshire Hathaway more or less by the seat of his pants. Although Berkshire owns more than 40 companies outright and has more than $136 billion in revenue, Buffett employs fewer than two dozen people at the holding company itself. He often buys companies with very little due diligence; he reads their financial reports, meets the owners and makes a deal. His board is made up primarily of cronies, including his son Howard. Berkshire’s compliance practices essentially consist of a letter that he sends to his top executives every two years reminding them to act ethically. In other words, Buffett has always played by his own rules — rules that are extraordinarily lax by the standards of good corporate governance. He’s been able to get away with this because, well, he’s Warren Buffett. His track record has been so great, and his persona so impregnable, that his shareholders have been willing to give him a bye. But after the Sokol business, Buffett’s management practices at Berkshire Hathaway deserve much tougher scrutiny. “Standards and practices have to change,” Matthews told me this week, shortly before hopping on a plane to Omaha. I can’t imagine that most Berkshire shareholders would disagree. If they’re smart, Buffett and his shareholders will view this fiasco as a wake-up call. Buffett is 80 years old. He can’t run Berkshire forever, much as he might like to. When he finally retires, Berkshire will only succeed if it has a management structure that is not solely reliant on one man’s investing genius.

Buffett’s view, he was as ruthless as ever. The chairman of Berkshire Hathaway — who has faced scrutiny for weeks after revelations that a top lieutenant, David L. Sokol, bought $10 million of shares of Lubrizol while orchestrating an acquisition of the company — has been criticized for his initial response to the situation. In a press release, Mr. Buffett provided a detailed account of the questionable trades and declared that he did not believe the purchases “were in any way unlawful.” But the public was vocal. Admittedly, I’ve been among those scratching my head about his reaction. After all, this is a guy whose mantra is, “Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Video: Buffett on the Sokol Affair Responding to the criticism, Mr. Buffett said, “What I think bothers some people is that there wasn’t some big sense of outrage.” He added, “I plead guilty to that.” Over the weekend at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting, where I was one of the three journalists posing questions to Mr. Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger, I think I have finally come to understand Mr. Buffett’s thinking. While Mr. Buffett praised Mr. Sokol in the statement announcing the resignation, he left out one big “ruthless” fact that would change the narrative completely. The day he issued the release, Berkshire called the Securities and Exchange Commission and briefed them on Mr. Sokol’s trades, which Mr. Buffett described to me as “pretty damning evidence.” “Calling the head of the enforcement division of the S.E.C. and laying out a pattern of trading that you know is going to result in something — Dave probably thought it was pretty harsh,” Mr. Buffett told me. The S.E.C. is now investigating the matter, people briefed on the inquiry said. In a statement after the Berkshire meeting, a lawyer for Mr. Sokol issued a statement, saying the stock trades did not violate the law or Berkshire policy. A close friend of Mr. Buffett’s explained his thinking this way. “Warren knew that the second that press release hit the wires, Sokol’s professional career was over. Done. Forever. Sokol was finished. He didn’t need to brag about being ‘ruthless.’ ” “The media wanted more — a nasty quote about how upset Warren was with Dave. But what’s the point? Just laying out the facts so publicly was the most ruthless thing he could have done. If you worked at Berkshire, you got the message loud and clear.” Mr. Buffett, who was clearly overcome with emotion at the time he drafted the original press release and is said not to have slept well for several days that week, said he praised Mr. Sokol out a sense of fairness. “I felt that if I’m laying out a whole bunch of facts that are going to create lots of problems for him for years to come, that I also list his side of the equation in terms of what he’d done for Berkshire,” Mr. Buffett said. That’s not to say Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger believed they handled the situation perfectly. “I think we can concede that that press release was not the cleverest press release in the history of the world,” Mr. Munger said. “The facts were complicated, and we didn’t foresee appropriately the natural reaction.” “But I would argue that you don’t want to make important decisions in anger,” he continued. “You want to display as much ruthlessness as your duty requires, and you do not want to add one single iota because you’re angry.” “You can always tell a man to go to hell tomorrow.” Upon reflection, however, there may be virtue in Berkshire’s measured approach. Despite all the blaring headlines and questions about whether Mr. Buffett’s reputation has been forever tarnished, Berkshire’s shareholders, the ones who actually have money on the line, seemed to be fine with the way the matter was handled. At the shareholders’ meeting, I could not find any who were overly worked up about the matter or were raising larger questions about Berkshire’s compliance programs. Mario Gabelli, a big investor with shares of Berkshire, called the Sokol episode “irrelevant” and derided it as “a good story for the media.” Nor did they seem worried about succession. Mr. Buffett made a passing remark that actually may have been the most telling of the entire weekend. After a query about whether Mr. Sokol had been his heir apparent, Mr. Buffett replied that the question “made an assumption there about Sokol being the next in line, which I’m not sure was warranted.” From an investment perspective, Mr. Gabelli said the Sokol matter would not impact his thinking on the company, succession or anything else. He, like Mr. Buffett, simply cares about the company’s cold, hard numbers. As for Berkshire’s compliance programs, which are not nearly as tough as those at most investment firms, Mr. Buffett clearly believes that he must run his company based on a modicum of trust. “We can have all the records in the world and if somebody wants to trade outside them or something, you know, they’re not going to tell us they’re trading in their cousin’s name,” Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Munger added. “I think your best compliance cultures are the ones which have this attitude of trust and some of the ones with the biggest compliance departments, like Wall Street, have the most scandals.” By the end of the weekend I still got the sense that Mr. Buffett, while furious with Mr. Sokol, struggled to publicly criticize him. When asked why he thought Mr. Sokol did it, he repeatedly said it was “inexplicable.” Mr. Munger, who often acts as the unfiltered version of Mr. Buffett, put it more bluntly, with a simple, one-word reply: “hubris.” Andrew Ross Sorkin is the editor of DealBook.

Buffett, to his credit, dived right into the David L. Sokol affair early at the Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholders meeting on Saturday. Mr. Buffett compared his onetime deputy’s dealing in Lubrizol shares to the scandal that rocked Salomon Brothers two decades ago. He called both events “inexcusable” and “inexplicable.” Yet Mr. Buffett overlooked the more significant link to Salomon, the Wall Street bank he once partly owned and led as chairman. The rogue trading there exposed poor controls. Charles Munger, Mr. Buffett’s longtime investing partner, diagnosed part of the problem. He told the packed Qwest Center in Omaha that hubris can sometimes cause irrational behavior. Mr. Munger could just as easily have been describing some of Mr. Buffett’s actions, including praising Mr. Sokol in the news release that disclosed his questionable trades and resignation. Mr. Buffett at the time said nothing of the apparently glaring violations of Berkshire’s codes of conduct. Though Mr. Buffett seemed unwilling, or unable, to dwell on his own failings when addressing Berkshire shareholders, he joked that Mr. Munger would handle future news releases and pleaded guilty to not expressing any outrage. Mr. Buffett also stumbled onto something. Evoking Salomon Brothers was right on the nose. Then, the violation of Treasury trading rules by Paul W. Mozer was only a major symptom of a bigger internal ailment, which led all the way to the top. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger would learn belatedly, for example, that senior management, including John H. Gutfreund, then the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers, had neglected to inform the board and regulators about the full extent of the trading misdeeds. Mr. Sokol’s actions do not seem to be exposing anything quite as sinister at Berkshire. In fact, the company is generally, and rightly, admired for a strong ethical focus. But this recent blind spot — with an audit committee report about it — reveals a lack of appropriate governance and controls. RIM Risks Reversal Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, is starting to feel a squeeze. The company, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, is hemorrhaging market share and just warned that product delays are hurting sales. The pressure is showing: its co-chief executive, Michael Lazaridis, recently stormed off a television interview when asked about security issues. RIM needs to compose itself if a new tablet and operating system are to keep the company relevant. Just weeks after issuing profit estimates, RIM warned that delays in bringing out new handsets scared off customers. Those still buying its devices in the United States and Latin America are choosing cheaper, lower-end ones. As a result, earnings per share will actually shrink slightly, despite the booming market for smartphones. RIM contends this is a temporary hiccup. Phones introduced this summer, and its answer to the iPad, mean earnings should rise 18 percent during the fiscal year ending February 2012. If so, the shares, including their 14 percent tumble on Friday, look incredibly cheap at 6.5 times this year’s earnings. But the projections sound optimistic. Maybe management is becoming overly defensive. Mr. Lazaridis certainly looked it in a recent BBC interview. He walked off when asked about demands by foreign governments to monitor BlackBerry phones. It’s hard to see how earnings won’t suffer. Reviews of RIM’s recently introduced tablet device have been mediocre. New phones, based on the latest version of its operating system, may be better than what it currently offers. But these look like more of a stopgap. After all, RIM plans to introduce a system called QNX in 2012. What’s more, customers seem to be defecting, not waiting. BlackBerry’s share of recent smartphone sales in the United States shrank from 37 percent a year ago to 15 percent in the first quarter, according to Nielsen. RIM executives are promising lots of progress in the coming months. But it will take considerably more poise to stop the motion from going backward. AGNES T.

Buffett had spoken publicly at length about David L. Sokol, criticizing his former lieutenant for violating Berkshire Hathaway‘s policies about trading. Now Mr. Sokol is fighting back. Shortly after the Berkshire meeting here, a lawyer for Mr. Sokol released a statement, arguing that neither Mr. Buffett nor the company’s board is telling the entire story. In the e-mailed statement, Barry William Levine, a partner at Dickstein Shapiro, said that neither Mr. Buffett nor Berkshire’s audit committee had spoken to his client since March 30. Mr. Levine also argued that no new information had emerged to show that Mr. Sokol violated Berkshire policies or withheld information from the company, and hinted that his client was prepared for a tough fight. “It is alarming that Mr. Buffett would be advised to so completely flip-flop and resort to transparent scapegoatism,” Mr. Levine said in the statement. “After 11 years of dedicated and hugely successful service to various Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, Mr. Sokol would have expected to be treated fairly. That would have been in Berkshire’s interest.” Statement of Dickstein Shapiro Partner Barry Wm. Levine, attorney for David Sokol following the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting “David Sokol is deeply saddened that Mr. Buffett, whom he considered a friend and mentor, would disparage him as he has done today. Neither Mr. Buffett nor the Audit Committee at Berkshire has requested to speak nor has spoken to Mr. Sokol since his resignation was made public by Mr. Buffett on March 30th. Mr. Buffett drafted the March 30th press release announcing Mr. Sokol’s resignation in cooperation with Mr. Charlie Munger and Mr. Ronald Olson both of whom are Berkshire Board Members. They know the law and they know the Berkshire policies. In that context, Mr. Buffett correctly declared Mr. Sokol’s conduct lawful and indeed was effusive of his praise of him. There is no new information or new fact which has become available to them since that press release was issued on March 30th. At no time did Mr. Sokol attempt to withhold information from Mr. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway or the Audit Committee. Every question asked of Mr. Sokol on or prior to March 30th and any information requested of him has been provided. The Audit Committee report, which was prepared by the law firm of Munger Tolles &amp; Olson contains errors and omissions, both of which could have been avoided if the Audit Committee had inquired of Mr. Sokol. It is alarming that Mr. Buffett would be advised to so completely flip-flop and resort to transparent scapegoatism. After 11 years of dedicated and hugely successful service to various Berkshire Hathaway subsidiaries, Mr. Sokol would have expected to be treated fairly. That would have been in Berkshire’s interest. Let me be clear about central facts: At no time did Mr. Sokol violate the law or any Berkshire policy. At no time did Mr. Sokol intend to personally profit at the expense of Berkshire or its shareholders. At no time did Mr. Sokol mislead or deceive. Such a conclusion would be wholly out of character and the Berkshire Board is keenly aware of that. At all times he faithfully discharged his fiduciary duties to Berkshire, a company he heroically served and continues to regard with reverence.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/buffett-takes-sharper-tone-in-sokol-affair/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett Takes Sharper Tone on Sokol's Actions<date>April 30, 2011, 6:22 pm</date><text>OMAHA — The billionaire Warren E. Buffett offered on Saturday his sharpest criticism yet of a former top lieutenant at his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, saying that David L. Sokol had violated company trading policy and calling Mr. Sokol’s actions “inexplicable and inexcusable.” Addressing a gathering of thousands of investors at Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting here, Mr. Buffett spoke at length publicly for the first time about the controversy involving Mr. Sokol, who resigned from Berkshire a month ago after it was revealed that he had bought shares in the chemical maker Lubrizol before pitching that company to Mr. Buffett as a potential takeover target. “I don’t think there’s any question about the inexcusable part,” Mr. Buffett said. “He violated the code of ethics. He violated our insider trading rules. He violated the principles I lay out every two years.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Since disclosing Mr. Sokol’s trades one month ago, Berkshire has conducted what it says are more thorough inquiries into the matter and found more of what Mr. Buffett called “pretty damning evidence” that it has forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission. A lawyer for Mr. Sokol, who was the chairman of Berkshire’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings, said in a statement last week that his client “would not, and did not, trade improperly,” and did not violate Berkshire’s policies. Still, Mr. Buffett, 80, conceded that he had erred in not asking more questions of Mr. Sokol about his investment in Lubrizol, especially as Mr. Sokol was presenting the company as a possible acquisition. “I obviously made a big mistake by not saying ‘well, when did you buy it?’ ” Mr. Buffett said. Mr. Buffett said he first grew concerned about the Lubrizol deal after a conversation with a longtime Berkshire broker, John Freund of Citigroup, who mentioned the investment bank’s role in highlighting the chemical company to Mr. Sokol as a potential acquisition for Berkshire. That began a series of inquiries by Berkshire and its outside law firm. The cloud hanging over Berkshire in the aftermath of Mr. Sokol’s departure lent a more serious tone to the annual meeting, which in most years is a lighthearted celebration of the conglomerate’s astoundingly consistent success. More traditional elements of Berkshire shareholder meetings were present earlier in the day. Mr. Buffett took a tour of exhibitions in the Qwest Center, including those set up by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, See’s Candy and Dairy Queen, all owned by Berkshire. Over 100 shareholders and photographers pressed close to the Berkshire chief, with passersby straining to get even a blurry photo of themselves next to the back of Mr. Buffett’s head. During a stop at the Justin Brands booth for college-themed cowboy boots, Mr. Buffett was greeted by four University of Nebraska cheerleaders, who chanted “Go Big Red.” While the reporters on stage, including one from The New York Times, appeared to ask most of the questions about Mr. Sokol, shareholders appeared focused on broader questions about investment strategy and Berkshire’s performance. Among their biggest concerns is the performance of a core Berkshire profit engine, its reinsurance business. Because of this year’s run of natural disasters — including the Japan and New Zealand earthquakes and the recent plague of tornadoes that has swept across the South —Berkshire’s insurance operations are likely to post an underwriting loss for the year, Mr. Buffett added. Still, the Sokol affair has provided the biggest challenge to Mr. Buffett’s reputation since the billionaire came to the rescue of Salomon Brothers 20 years ago when the investment bank was battered by a bond trading scandal. The Salomon bailout yielded one of the clearest and harshest statements on business ethics that Mr. Buffett has ever uttered: “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” But in disclosing Mr. Sokol’s trade last month, Mr. Buffett wrote in a public letter only that he did not view the actions as unlawful, and his uncritical response was widely criticized for being too tame. Last Wednesday, Berkshire’s board took a much tougher stance, accusing Mr. Sokol of intending to deceive and mislead Mr. Buffett. The directors wrote in a lengthy report that they were considering suing Mr. Sokol and were fully cooperating with regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission is already looking into the matter, people briefed on the matter have said. On Saturday, though he was harsh in his assessment of Mr. Sokol’s trading actions, he pointedly declined to personally attack Mr. Sokol, instead highlighting the executive’s years of service and good performance. Mr. Sokol, according to his now-former boss, once turned down an additional $12.5 million in compensation, instead asking that it be given to his second-in-command at MidAmerican Energy, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett wondered aloud what could drive an executive who turned down $12.5 million to make improper trades a decade later that yielded $3 million. Mr. Buffett acknowledged that his initial press release on Mr. Sokol’s departure might have seemed too supportive of his former lieutenant. “What I think bothers some people is that there wasn’t some big sense of outrage” in the news release, Mr. Buffett said. “I plead guilty to that. But this fellow had done a lot of good.” Both Mr. Buffett and his longtime business partner, the Berkshire vice chairman Charles Munger, said that by the time the board delivered its report on Mr. Sokol, the company had already turned over evidence to the S.E.C. and had saved the firm money by not firing him. “I feel like you don’t want to make important decisions in anger,” Mr. Munger said, defending Berkshire’s press release. “You can always tell a man to go to hell tomorrow.” In resigning, Mr. Sokol said that he never aspired to succeed Mr. Buffett, again leaving open the question of who would eventually take over Berkshire. Mr. Buffett was characteristically vague about his plans, except that his son Howard would eventually become Berkshire’s unpaid chairman. As to who would eventually become chief executive, Mr. Buffett told one shareholder. “The guy who’s the leading candidate now, I would lay a lot of money on the fact that he’s straight as an arrow.” Later in the meeting, Mr. Buffett repeatedly praised one perennial candidate: the head of Berkshire’s reinsurance operations, Ajit Jain, whom he described as exceptionally loyal and having a mind “like a machine.” Nati Harnik/Associated PressAt the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, Warren Buffett was greeted by four University of Nebraska cheerleaders.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/what-would-you-ask-warren-buffett-2/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">What Would You Ask Buffett?<date>April 29, 2011, 4:15 pm</date><text>The billionaire investor Warren E.

Buffett has many unpleasant questions to address at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting on Saturday. The stock dealings of David L. Sokol, a former heir apparent, have raised concerns over the company’s internal controls — even about Mr. Buffett’s judgment. But one subject may be a step too far for the Buffett faithful congregating in Omaha: isn’t it time to break up the company?To Mr. Buffett’s acolytes, the idea of splintering Berkshire into pieces borders on heresy. But the furor over Mr. Sokol’s share trading, resignation and lack of remorse for his behavior has highlighted the difficulty of grooming a successor capable of steering the $200 billion behemoth into a brighter tomorrow. Moreover, a breakup may even be more lucrative for shareholders. Berkshire’s share price is suffering. Over the last six months, the stock has gained 4 percent, significantly underperforming the 15 percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. As a result, the discount at which Berkshire shares trade relative to the stand-alone value of its assets has widened to a point where breaking up can’t be ruled out. A calculation by Barclays Capital a year ago valued Berkshire’s holdings at around $87 per Class B share. At the time, that meant the stock was trading 13 percent below the sum of its parts a year ago. Apply the S.&amp; P.’s gain since then to Barclays’ estimate, and the stock could be worth around $99. Trouble is, as a result of Berkshire’s performance that means the theoretical discount has increased to nearly 20 percent. Though a back-of-the-envelope calculation, it does suggest dismantling the group into manageable parts is a reasonable alternative, and worthy of the Berkshire’s board’s consideration. The board’s report on the Sokol matter this week exhibited an uncharacteristic willingness to challenge the chairman’s judgment. Why not extend this independence to revisiting the group’s structure? Berkshire’s stellar returns for most of the last half-century reflected its founder’s instincts, impeccable reputation and eye for value. The Sokol affair suggests these can no longer be counted on, nor easily replicated. Yet without these features, Berkshire is just another conglomerate whose shares trade at a discount to their true value. That would be a sad legacy for Mr. Buffett to leave. Royalty’s Worth Britain’s royal family is an affordable indulgence. If taxpayers stopped financing the clan destined to be led by William Windsor and Catherine Middleton, they would escape a £1.14 billion (or $1.9 billion) liability. For some, this is a burden the financially hurting nation could do without. In fact, it’s a national treasure. True, the royal wedding will lead to some large one-time costs. There’s the extra public holiday. Assuming Britain’s economy is evenly spread across the 260 working days of a normal year, that’s £5.9 billion in lost output. The direct cost of the celebration may add another £50 million. Both these figures look too high, however. Some of the costs are sunk. Others are shared. Much of the lost gross domestic product will be recovered. The financial focus should instead be on the continuing overhead the monarchy creates. The latest report of the Royal Trustees shows that the queen and her entourage were awarded £39.9 million in the year ended March 2011. This figure has been quite stable, rising by just 1.6 percent a year over the last decade. Assume these payments, ignoring inflation, stretch into perpetuity, apply a discount equivalent to the yield on 10-year British government bonds, and the present value of this liability is £1.14 billion — or less than £19 for every British subject. With national debt at £1.1 trillion and all manner of public services now being squeezed, cutting off the royals would represent a symbolic saving. But the economy would miss the tourism and other income generated from brand Windsor. Besides, another head of state would still cost money. Even elected ones don’t come free with afternoon tea. Britain’s royal family is an anachronism that wouldn’t be invented if it didn’t exist. But for the global entertainment value alone — regardless of whether the Windsors appreciate that people are laughing at them as well as with them — the monarchy earns its place in the national portfolio. Pageantry as represented in apogee by this royal wedding should be preserved, paid for from a controlled budget, and enjoyed.

Buffett. Many responded with queries related to the controversy over his former lieutenant, David L. Sokol, and and his trades in the shares of Lubrizol, a company Berkshire subsequently acquired. But some questions ranged much further than that. Here is a selection of edited responses: Two questions - 1. …In assessing Sokol’s trading activity, the Audit Committee report focused solely on the Lubrizol transaction. Are they planning the broaden their review of Mr. Sokol’s other, earlier investment/trading activities? If not, why not? 2. Does Berkshires’s Code of Conduct, or any other policy, require executives to file a “contact” memorandum with the Audit Committee detailing their contacts with bankers and other “finders”? L. HALPERN ROCHESTER, N.Y, Could the Board issue its version of the entire timeline of the Sokol affair, including what it has learned of the dinner meeting between Mr. Sokol and Lubrizol’s chief, orchestrated by Citi bankers? Has Lubrizol’s chief given his version of how and why the meeting was set up? Mr. Sokol has stated that he told Mr. Buffett of his investment in Lubrizol…. What is the specific language in B.H. ethics/insider trading rules that Mr. Sokol violated? My family and I are loyal shareholders. BEVERLY CRANDALL NAPA, CALIF. Regarding the Sokol/Lubrizol matter: Doesn’t Berkshire have the legal right to require employees to disclose all investment activities they engage in as a condition of employment? … Anyone who might be even casually considered as a C.E.O. candidate should have all his/her investment activities (including those of family members as well) available for company officials to scrutinize. Berkshire is too active an investor for it to rely merely on the good-faith of its senior executives. And relating to Mr. Sokol in particular, did anyone at Berkshire or on behalf of its Audit Committee determine just what kind of investor Mr. Sokol has been? He traded in and out of LZ in December, before taking a $10 million position later. Was this trading, in form and scale, consistent with his apparent claim that it was routine for him to conduct such activity?… PAUL HILLSDALE, N.Y. While not a Berkshire shareholder, my question to Mr Buffett is regarding the internal controls that are in place for Berkshire. The Sokol incident reflects undue reliance on Mr Buffett himself rather than a process to protect the assets and integrity of the corporation. What changes are going to be made as a result of what he and the Board have learned from this incident? WILLIE RHODE ISLAND As a shareholder, I would like to know more about how Berkshire prevents front-running of Berkshire trades and deals, not just by insiders in the know, but also by brokers, traders and back-office personnel. Berkshire’s size means that it takes a substantial amount of time for Mr. Buffett to build a position. Given the nature of Wall Street, it seems like the easiest thing in the world for news of Mr. Buffett’s buying to spread.

BRIAN NEW YORK For many years Berkshire Hathaway has paid its directors token compensation ($2,700 in cash except for audit committee members who earn $6,700 in 2010) and provided them no officers and directors liability insurance. Consequently your directors self-insure and must have a considerable net worth to do so and extraordinary confidence in your and your team’s corporate governance practices (which may have recently been weakened). Many of your board members are centimillionaires or billionaires. Question — “How does that promote boardroom diversity and would you be willing to pay a living director wage and provide O.&amp;D. insurance to the lower wealth directors you might add.” NORTHFORK INVESTOR You bought your operating companies at 10 or more times earnings but can now buy them at less than 6 times earnings just by buying back Berkshire shares.

Buffett, but it is unlikely to deter his deal-making. Among the questions nagging at investors making the pilgrimage to Omaha this weekend to attend the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway will be this: Will the outcry over David L. Sokol affect Warren E. Buffett’s deal machine? Only two months ago, Berkshire appeared to be riding high. The conglomerate posted a 61 percent gain in annual profit for last year. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that he was again on the hunt. “We’re prepared,” he wrote. “Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.” In March, Mr. Buffett appeared to at least partly sate that itch when he agreed to buy the chemicals manufacturer Lubrizol for $9 billion in cash. Yet that deal has now trapped Berkshire in controversy. Mr. Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, resigned after disclosures that he had bought shares in Lubrizol shortly before recommending the company to Mr. Buffett as a takeover target. Initially hesitant, Mr. Buffett eventually agreed to the deal, the third-largest purchase in his career. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: What Would You Ask Warren Buffett? On Wednesday, the audit committee of Berkshire’s board condemned Mr. Sokol’s actions as violations of the company’s insider stock-trading policy and hinted that the company might sue Mr. Sokol, a onetime star manager. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Mr. Sokol’s trades, people briefed on the matter have said previously. It is unclear whether the Sokol affair will have lasting implications for Berkshire. Some Buffett-watchers say that the biggest damage may be to the investor’s reputation. “Buffett was on an unrealistically high pedestal to begin with,” Alice Schroeder, the author of an authorized biography of Mr. Buffett, said. “A lot of Berkshire’s business advantage came from that mystique.” But it is unlikely to deter Berkshire from its takeover safari. “I don’t think if there are any deals on the horizon that this is going to cause Buffett to pause in the least,” said Michael Yoshikami, the chairman and chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a Berkshire shareholder. The fundamentals for why Berkshire must pursue even more acquisitions have not changed. The company generated $17.9 billion in cash from its operations last year, and currently has more than $38 billion to spend. And its underlying businesses, apart from its commercial insurance operations, have rebounded well from the recession, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “I expect no changes and that we may see Berkshire do a $10 billion deal in the next 12 months,” he said. And despite the reputational damage done to the Buffett brand, the executive still exerts a magnetic charm and has a strongly performing business that many companies still want to join, Ms. Schroeder said. Just what exactly Berkshire will buy next remains a parlor game among analysts and investors. Mr. Buffett has hewed to a fairly rigid set of criteria for potential deal targets, including consistently high earnings, little debt and strong management teams in place. Mr. Buffett has long regarded his big investments as crucial to continuing Berkshire’s strong financial performance. He singled out his $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern as a big contributor to Berkshire’s bottom line. The deal appeared likely to raise Berkshire’s earning power by nearly 40 percent before taxes, and the cash needed to strike the deal was quickly replenished. “The economics of this transaction have turned out very well,” he wrote in this year’s investor letter. While Mr. Buffett most recent shareholder letter sang the praises of the United States — he described the country as ripe with an abundance of opportunity — many observers say that his next trophy may well be abroad. Mr. Yoshikami noted that many of Berkshire’s recent big deals, including those for Lubrizol, Burlington Northern and the industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings, had been largely for developed companies with high cash flow. A logical next step may be in finding a high-growth but stable foreign company, as Berkshire did in 2008 when it acquired a 10 percent stake in the Chinese auto parts maker BYD, Mr. Yoshikami said. That opportunity may lie in a growing economy like India, which Mr. Buffett visited last month. “I’ve been dropping my phone number around as I cover the city,” he told reporters then. “I hope someone rings me Monday morning with good news.” The New York Times</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/berkshire-fires-back-against-sokols-lawyer/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Fires Back Against Sokol's Lawyer<date>April 28, 2011, 8:45 am</date><text>Berkshire Hathaway has escalated its war of words with its former executive, David L. Sokol, who resigned last month after buying shares in a specialty chemicals manufacturer while orchestrating a potential takeover of the company. A Berkshire director and lawyer, Ronald L. Olson, released a statement on Wednesday night saying that the company’s board had sought to interview Mr. Sokol about his $10 million stake in Lubrizol, contradicting earlier remarks made by Mr. Sokol’s lawyer. Mr. Sokol declined that interview request, Mr. Olson said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Sokol Accused of Misleading Buffett What Would You Ask Buffett? On Wednesday afternoon, the board released a scathing report accusing Mr. Sokol of misleading Berkshire about his Lubrizol trades and violating the company’s ethics and insider trading policies. Mr. Sokol, once seen as a leading contender to succeed Warren E. Buffett atop the Berkshire empire, never told Mr. Buffett that he had bought his stake in Lubrizol after Citigroup bankers had pitched the company as a potential takeover target, the report said. In response, Mr. Sokol’s lawyer complained that the directors had failed to question his client, the former chairman of MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, for the report. “I am profoundly disappointed that the audit committee of Berkshire Hathaway would authorize the issuance of its report to the public without the care and decency to ask even a single question of Mr. Sokol,” said the lawyer, Barry W. Levine, of Dickstein Shapiro. A few hours later on Wednesday, Mr. Olson disputed Mr. Levine’s statement. “Mr. Sokol was interviewed at least three times regarding his Lubrizol trading activity and contacts with Citi bankers,” Mr. Olson, a partner at Munger Tolles &amp; Olson, said in the statement. “In connection with the preparation of the audit committee report, a request for a further interview with Mr. Sokol was made to his attorney. Mr. Sokol was not made available.” Munger Tolles &amp; Olson, Berkshire’s longtime outside law firm, helped prepare the audit committee report, which was presented to Berkshire’s board on Tuesday night. Mr. Levine did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr. Levine disputed the audit committee report, saying that Mr. Sokol’s trading was above board. Mr. Sokol, his lawyer said, had been considering a personal investment in Lubrizol since summer 2010, before meeting with Citigroup in December to discuss the company. Mr. Sokol, 54, resigned from Berkshire Hathaway after it emerged that he had personally bought about 100,000 Lubrizol shares shortly before bringing the company to Mr. Buffett’s attention in January. Berkshire later agreed to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion, causing Lubrizol’s shares to surge and increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by about $3 million.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/advice-for-david-sokol/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Advice for David Sokol<date>April 28, 2011, 11:56 am</date><text>To: David L. Sokol From: Steven M. Davidoff and Peter J. Henning Re: Reversal of fortune Warren E. Buffett’s letter announcing your resignation from Berkshire Hathaway in March was also a defense of your conduct. Unfortunately, Thursday’s audit committee report was the exact opposite. It was a brief but to-the-point indictment. And it was no doubt released in anticipation of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting this weekend. Mr. Sokol, the Berkshire Hathaway audit committee threw you to the wolves. But before giving you some advice as to your next steps, it is worth setting forth the variety of state and federal claims that the audit committee report sets out: Breach of the Duty of Candor The audit committee directly accuses you of a breach of the duty of candor that each employee owes to their employer. This duty generally requires a employee to disclose information germane to any company transaction within their knowledge that would be found material. The standard does not take into account whether you believed it was material at the time of the transaction. The committee based its allegations on your alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest. The audit committee states that you misled Mr. Buffett by failing to disclose when and under what circumstances you bought Lubrizol stock. The audit committee also alleges that you improperly told Mr. Buffett not to include a paragraph in the now infamous news release noting that you were leaving Berkshire in part because of these allegations. Usurpation of Corporate Opportunity The audit committee alleges that you seized a corporate opportunity from Berkshire Hathaway by trading in the stock of Lubrizol. More specifically, the profit you made trading Lubrizol stock more rightly belongs to Berkshire Hathaway because you breached the duty of loyalty, a duty each employee owes to his employee. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Sokol Is Accused of Misleading Buffett The Deal Professor White Collar Watch DealBook: What Would You Ask Buffett? This principle, with the not-so-catchy name the usurpation of opportunity doctrine, is a complicated one. Professor Brian Quinn at the M&amp;A Law Prof Blog has some thoughts on this and outlines the scope of the doctrine. But suffice to say that a violation of this duty does not require a showing that Berkshire would have actually have made the trade, just that the corporation had an expectation that it would obtain that profit. This is easier to establish in this case – namely, if you had presented the trading opportunity to Mr. Buffett, would he have thought it belonged to the company? The audit committee clearly thinks so. The penalty for a breach of this doctrine is typically disgorgement of any profit earned. Federal Insider Trading This is the big kahuna, the one you should truly fear. The audit committee again did not help your case. To find insider trading, there not only has to be possession of inside information, but the information must be obtained through a breach of duty. The audit committee alleges in its report that you violated the company’s insider trading policy. If true, this is probably sufficient to establish the breach of duty part of the insider trading test. In such a circumstance, the other significant question is whether the information was material. The audit committee here hedges and does not state whether it is material for purposes of insider trading, but does assert it was confidential. In addition, by claiming that you breached your duties of candor and loyalty, the committee is making a back-door argument that this information was material. Be careful here, because this means that a judgment on the state law claims could influence the outcome of any federal charges. State Law Insider Trading Delaware has recently reaffirmed the principle that its law, like the federal insider trading laws, prohibit insider trading. Berkshire Hathaway is a Delaware company, and so this prohibition applied to you. The Delaware State standard is a lower threshold than the more traditional federal claim. It still requires that the information be material and nonpublic, but it requires only that you were motivated improperly to profit from that information. And, Mr. Sokol, you have admitted you were. The remedy for a violation of the state insider trading law is disgorgement of profits. The audit committee report did not specifically cite these state laws, but no doubt the report is grist for a claim of this type. All of this would be enough, but the committee goes even further. The audit committee not only affirmatively states that it will cooperate with any government investigation, but to your lawyer’s horror, it may also refuse to reimburse you for your legal fees under Berkshire Hathaway’s indemnification provisions. The $3 million profit made on these trades is nothing next to the tens of millions in legal fees you are about to rack up. Berkshire’s bylaws do not require that the company advance such expenses to you. And Delaware’s indemnification law permits reimbursement of lawyer fees “if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.” The report’s reference to what it called your intent to “deceive” Mr. Buffett can be a basis for arguing that you did not act in good faith. There is a shareholder lawsuit looming against you and the company, but as Professor Bainbridge artfully describes, that has some difficult procedural hurdles to clear. It appears, however, that the company is ready to take over prosecution of the suit, an act that would sidestep these hurdles. All of this is no doubt sobering news for someone who appeared so relaxed on CNBC immediately after public disclosure of these trades. Here’s our advice, for whatever it might be worth. The good news is that it is going to be hard in the state law cases to obtain a judgment for more than disgorgement of your profit plus interest. In this light, stubborn pride will get you nowhere. Instead, you can admit that, while you did not think it wrong before, you now realize that your trade may be viewed as a poor decision and so a settlement is in the best interest of all parties. Return the $3 million profit to Berkshire, and offer to reimburse the costs of the investigation. This should take care of the state lawsuits and possibly save you tens of millions in legal fees.

Now, on the eve of Berkshire’s annual shareholders meeting, the company has come out fighting.

When Mr. Sokol’s lawyer publicly protested that the directors had failed to question Mr. Sokol for the report, a Berkshire lawyer and director quickly retorted that Mr. Sokol had declined to make himself available.

Mr. Warren, who is going to the annual meeting in Omaha, said he eliminated “six or seven questions” he had planned to ask Mr. Buffett “because of the report.” Still, Berkshire has yet to quell completely the controversy surrounding Mr. Sokol, public relations experts say. “What’s so surprising to me is how little strategy there has been,” said Paul A. Argenti, professor of corporate communication at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. Mr. Buffett, he noted, is fond of saying: “Lose money for my firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” But he has yet to publicly take Mr. Sokol to task. “Why isn’t Warren Buffett being ruthless?” Mr. Argenti asked. “The report was a good thing to get out there, but the real question is how he handles it this weekend. This is his moment.” In a brief interview on Fox Business Network on Thursday night, Mr. Buffett said he would not duck any questions about Mr. Sokol at the meeting. “We can answer any question that gets asked,” he said. “You will not hear ‘no comment.’ If our lawyer gets up and wrestles me to the ground, I will still talk.” Corporate governance experts said Berkshire was taking a step in the right direction. “I thought they laid out the details in a very transparent and clear way,” said David F. Larcker, an accounting professor and director of the Corporate Governance Research Program at Stanford’s graduate business school. “They were tough, and I think that’s a good thing.” Still, others added that the new approach was unlikely to lead to changes in the company’s hands-off management style. “How intrusive are you going to be into your employees’ personal lives? If you don’t trust the guy, you should fire him,” said Jonathan R. Macey, a professor of corporate law and corporate governance at Yale University. And the report does not necessarily spell an end to Berkshire’s problems. For a company that has carefully cultivated a pristine image — a rarity in modern corporate America — one black mark could threaten to tarnish years of good will. The report also does not excuse Mr. Buffett from addressing lingering questions about his handling of the Mr. Sokol affair — and the future of the company. Until now, Berkshire had been careful not to criticize Mr. Sokol, the former star chairman of NetJets and MidAmerican Energy. When Mr. Buffett announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation on March 30, he said, “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful.” He also praised Mr. Sokol’s tenure at the company, saying his ”contributions have been extraordinary.” The report appeared intended to distance Berkshire from Mr. Sokol as regulators and shareholders are scrutinizing Mr. Sokol’s trading, said Bradley Simon, a former federal prosecutor and now a defense lawyer. “The complete about-face seems a little suspect to me,” he said. “Their position seems somewhat self-serving and self-protective.” Mr. Sokol, 54, resigned from Berkshire after it emerged that he had bought about 100,000 Lubrizol shares shortly before bringing the company to Mr. Buffett’s attention in January. Berkshire later agreed to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion, causing Lubrizol’s shares to surge and increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by about $3 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Mr. Sokol’s trading, people close to the inquiry have said. Mr. Sokol and Mr. Buffett, meanwhile, face a lawsuit from a Berkshire shareholder who wants Mr. Sokol to forfeit his trading profits in Lubrizol because of the damage done to Berkshire’s reputation. Berkshire could be vulnerable to other claims that Mr. Sokol’s share purchases drove up the purchase price of Lubrizol, lawyers said. “The report was intended to stymie any lawsuits and give plaintiff lawyers pause,” Mr. Simon said. Berkshire does have another remedy at its disposal: suing Mr. Sokol. Berkshire’s board is considering whether to pursue “possible legal action against Mr. Sokol to recover any damage the company has sustained, or his trading profits,” the report said.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/david-sokol-the-deal-maker/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">David Sokol, the Deal Maker<date>April 28, 2011, 9:47 am</date><text>Jonathan Fickies/Bloomberg News David L.

In 2008, Mr. Sokol stepped down as chief executive of MidAmerican and replaced himself with his protégé, Gregory Abel. That freed up Mr. Sokol to play a broader role in Berkshire’s empire. It was about that time that his deal-making activity picked up. In September 2008 alone, the peak of the financial crisis, Mr. Sokol led Berkshire in discussions about a number of different deals. Mr. Sokol headed up Berkshire’s talks with Lehman Brothers about a possible capital infusion in the ailing bank, according to bankruptcy court filings. Hugh E. McGee III, the head of Lehman’s investment banking unit who had for years advised MidAmerican as an energy banker, called Mr. Sokol in July 2008 about a potential investment by Berkshire. Mr. Sokol expressed interest, but Mr. Buffett dismissed it as unrealistic. In September, a week prior to Lehman’s bankruptcy, Mr. McGee again reached out to Mr. Sokol with a “Hail Mary” pass and asked, “Do you have any ideas to save us?” Mr. Sokol, bear hunting in Alaska at the time, told Mr. McGee that he was stumped. Back from Alaska, September remained a busy month for Mr. Sokol. The day after Lehman’s bankruptcy filing, Mr. Sokol cold called Mayo A. Shattuck III, the chief of Constellation Energy, whose stock was in a death spiral. Mr. Sokol told Mr. Shattuck that MidAmerican was interested in a possible deal and that he would immediately fly to Baltimore to try to reach one. Mr. Sokol hopped on a NetJets plane, and by the next day he had forged an agreement for MidAmerican to buy Constellation for $4.7 billion. The deal fell apart — and garnered Berkshire a tidy $1.2 billion breakup fee — after a French utility outbid MidAmerican for a 50 percent stake in Constellation. (On Thursday, Constellation agreed to be bought by Exelon.) Later that same month, Mr. Sokol was in Hong Kong to announce Mr. Buffett’s investment in BYD, a Chinese electric car manufacturer. Mr. Sokol had been the point person on the deal, flying to China to conduct due diligence on the company. In 2009, Mr. Sokol’s role at Berkshire appeared to have reverted back to operations. In July 2009, Mr. Buffett installed him as head of its then-struggling NetJets unit. For instance, Mr. Sokol did not play a part in Berkshire’s largest acquisition to date, its $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Railroad. Earlier this year, we now know, Mr. Sokol began doing deals again. When Mr. Buffett announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation earlier this month, he praised Mr. Sokol’s work on the Lubrizol deal. “Though the offer to purchase [Lubrizol] was entirely my decision,” wrote Mr. Buffett, “it would not have occurred without Dave’s early efforts.”</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/amid-scandal-guessing-game-builds-over-buffetts-next-deal/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Guessing Game Builds Over Buffett's Next Deal<date>April 28, 2011, 4:16 pm</date><text>Prashanth Vishwanthan/Bloomberg News The Sokol affair may have shaken Warren E. Buffett, but it is unlikely to deter his deal-making. Among the questions nagging at investors making the pilgrimage to Omaha this weekend to attend the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway will be this: Will the outcry over David L. Sokol affect Warren E. Buffett’s deal machine? Only two months ago, Berkshire appeared to be riding high. The conglomerate posted a 61 percent gain in annual profit for last year. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that he was again on the hunt. “We’re prepared,” he wrote. “Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.” In March, Mr. Buffett appeared to at least partly sate that itch when he agreed to buy the chemicals manufacturer Lubrizol for $9 billion in cash. Yet that deal has now trapped Berkshire in controversy. Mr. Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, resigned after disclosures that he had bought shares in Lubrizol shortly before recommending the company to Mr. Buffett as a takeover target. Initially hesitant, Mr. Buffett eventually agreed to the deal, the third-largest purchase in his career. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: What Would You Ask Warren Buffett? On Wednesday, the audit committee of Berkshire’s board condemned Mr. Sokol’s actions as violations of the company’s insider stock-trading policy and hinted that the company might sue Mr. Sokol, a onetime star manager. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Mr. Sokol’s trades, people briefed on the matter have said previously. It is unclear whether the Sokol affair will have lasting implications for Berkshire. Some Buffett-watchers say that the biggest damage may be to the investor’s reputation. “Buffett was on an unrealistically high pedestal to begin with,” Alice Schroeder, the author of an authorized biography of Mr. Buffett, said. “A lot of Berkshire’s business advantage came from that mystique.” But it is unlikely to deter Berkshire from its takeover safari. “I don’t think if there are any deals on the horizon that this is going to cause Buffett to pause in the least,” said Michael Yoshikami, the chairman and chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a Berkshire shareholder. The fundamentals for why Berkshire must pursue even more acquisitions have not changed. The company generated $17.9 billion in cash from its operations last year, and currently has more than $38 billion to spend. And its underlying businesses, apart from its commercial insurance operations, have rebounded well from the recession, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “I expect no changes and that we may see Berkshire do a $10 billion deal in the next 12 months,” he said. And despite the reputational damage done to the Buffett brand, the executive still exerts a magnetic charm and has a strongly performing business that many companies still want to join, Ms. Schroeder said. Just what exactly Berkshire will buy next remains a parlor game among analysts and investors. Mr. Buffett has hewed to a fairly rigid set of criteria for potential deal targets, including consistently high earnings, little debt and strong management teams in place. Mr. Buffett has long regarded his big investments as crucial to continuing Berkshire’s strong financial performance. He singled out his $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern as a big contributor to Berkshire’s bottom line. The deal appeared likely to raise Berkshire’s earning power by nearly 40 percent before taxes, and the cash needed to strike the deal was quickly replenished. “The economics of this transaction have turned out very well,” he wrote in this year’s investor letter. While Mr. Buffett most recent shareholder letter sang the praises of the United States — he described the country as ripe with an abundance of opportunity — many observers say that his next trophy may well be abroad. Mr. Yoshikami noted that many of Berkshire’s recent big deals, including those for Lubrizol, Burlington Northern and the industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings, had been largely for developed companies with high cash flow. A logical next step may be in finding a high-growth but stable foreign company, as Berkshire did in 2008 when it acquired a 10 percent stake in the Chinese auto parts maker BYD, Mr. Yoshikami said. That opportunity may lie in a growing economy like India, which Mr. Buffett visited last month. “I’ve been dropping my phone number around as I cover the city,” he told reporters then. “I hope someone rings me Monday morning with good news.” The New York Times</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/berkshire-fires-back-against-sokols-lawyer/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Fires Back Against Sokol's Lawyer<date>April 28, 2011, 8:45 am</date><text>Berkshire Hathaway has escalated its war of words with its former executive, David L. Sokol, who resigned last month after buying shares in a specialty chemicals manufacturer while orchestrating a potential takeover of the company. A Berkshire director and lawyer, Ronald L. Olson, released a statement on Wednesday night saying that the company’s board had sought to interview Mr. Sokol about his $10 million stake in Lubrizol, contradicting earlier remarks made by Mr. Sokol’s lawyer. Mr. Sokol declined that interview request, Mr. Olson said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Sokol Accused of Misleading Buffett What Would You Ask Buffett? On Wednesday afternoon, the board released a scathing report accusing Mr. Sokol of misleading Berkshire about his Lubrizol trades and violating the company’s ethics and insider trading policies. Mr. Sokol, once seen as a leading contender to succeed Warren E. Buffett atop the Berkshire empire, never told Mr. Buffett that he had bought his stake in Lubrizol after Citigroup bankers had pitched the company as a potential takeover target, the report said. In response, Mr. Sokol’s lawyer complained that the directors had failed to question his client, the former chairman of MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, for the report. “I am profoundly disappointed that the audit committee of Berkshire Hathaway would authorize the issuance of its report to the public without the care and decency to ask even a single question of Mr. Sokol,” said the lawyer, Barry W. Levine, of Dickstein Shapiro. A few hours later on Wednesday, Mr. Olson disputed Mr. Levine’s statement. “Mr. Sokol was interviewed at least three times regarding his Lubrizol trading activity and contacts with Citi bankers,” Mr. Olson, a partner at Munger Tolles &amp; Olson, said in the statement. “In connection with the preparation of the audit committee report, a request for a further interview with Mr. Sokol was made to his attorney. Mr. Sokol was not made available.” Munger Tolles &amp; Olson, Berkshire’s longtime outside law firm, helped prepare the audit committee report, which was presented to Berkshire’s board on Tuesday night. Mr. Levine did not immediately return a request for comment on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr. Levine disputed the audit committee report, saying that Mr. Sokol’s trading was above board. Mr. Sokol, his lawyer said, had been considering a personal investment in Lubrizol since summer 2010, before meeting with Citigroup in December to discuss the company. Mr. Sokol, 54, resigned from Berkshire Hathaway after it emerged that he had personally bought about 100,000 Lubrizol shares shortly before bringing the company to Mr. Buffett’s attention in January. Berkshire later agreed to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion, causing Lubrizol’s shares to surge and increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by about $3 million.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/advice-for-david-sokol/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Advice for David Sokol<date>April 28, 2011, 11:56 am</date><text>To: David L. Sokol From: Steven M. Davidoff and Peter J. Henning Re: Reversal of fortune Warren E. Buffett’s letter announcing your resignation from Berkshire Hathaway in March was also a defense of your conduct. Unfortunately, Thursday’s audit committee report was the exact opposite. It was a brief but to-the-point indictment. And it was no doubt released in anticipation of Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting this weekend. Mr. Sokol, the Berkshire Hathaway audit committee threw you to the wolves. But before giving you some advice as to your next steps, it is worth setting forth the variety of state and federal claims that the audit committee report sets out: Breach of the Duty of Candor The audit committee directly accuses you of a breach of the duty of candor that each employee owes to their employer. This duty generally requires a employee to disclose information germane to any company transaction within their knowledge that would be found material. The standard does not take into account whether you believed it was material at the time of the transaction. The committee based its allegations on your alleged failure to disclose a conflict of interest. The audit committee states that you misled Mr. Buffett by failing to disclose when and under what circumstances you bought Lubrizol stock. The audit committee also alleges that you improperly told Mr. Buffett not to include a paragraph in the now infamous news release noting that you were leaving Berkshire in part because of these allegations. Usurpation of Corporate Opportunity The audit committee alleges that you seized a corporate opportunity from Berkshire Hathaway by trading in the stock of Lubrizol. More specifically, the profit you made trading Lubrizol stock more rightly belongs to Berkshire Hathaway because you breached the duty of loyalty, a duty each employee owes to his employee. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Sokol Is Accused of Misleading Buffett The Deal Professor White Collar Watch DealBook: What Would You Ask Buffett? This principle, with the not-so-catchy name the usurpation of opportunity doctrine, is a complicated one. Professor Brian Quinn at the M&amp;A Law Prof Blog has some thoughts on this and outlines the scope of the doctrine. But suffice to say that a violation of this duty does not require a showing that Berkshire would have actually have made the trade, just that the corporation had an expectation that it would obtain that profit. This is easier to establish in this case – namely, if you had presented the trading opportunity to Mr. Buffett, would he have thought it belonged to the company? The audit committee clearly thinks so. The penalty for a breach of this doctrine is typically disgorgement of any profit earned. Federal Insider Trading This is the big kahuna, the one you should truly fear. The audit committee again did not help your case. To find insider trading, there not only has to be possession of inside information, but the information must be obtained through a breach of duty. The audit committee alleges in its report that you violated the company’s insider trading policy. If true, this is probably sufficient to establish the breach of duty part of the insider trading test. In such a circumstance, the other significant question is whether the information was material. The audit committee here hedges and does not state whether it is material for purposes of insider trading, but does assert it was confidential. In addition, by claiming that you breached your duties of candor and loyalty, the committee is making a back-door argument that this information was material. Be careful here, because this means that a judgment on the state law claims could influence the outcome of any federal charges. State Law Insider Trading Delaware has recently reaffirmed the principle that its law, like the federal insider trading laws, prohibit insider trading. Berkshire Hathaway is a Delaware company, and so this prohibition applied to you. The Delaware State standard is a lower threshold than the more traditional federal claim. It still requires that the information be material and nonpublic, but it requires only that you were motivated improperly to profit from that information. And, Mr. Sokol, you have admitted you were. The remedy for a violation of the state insider trading law is disgorgement of profits. The audit committee report did not specifically cite these state laws, but no doubt the report is grist for a claim of this type. All of this would be enough, but the committee goes even further. The audit committee not only affirmatively states that it will cooperate with any government investigation, but to your lawyer’s horror, it may also refuse to reimburse you for your legal fees under Berkshire Hathaway’s indemnification provisions. The $3 million profit made on these trades is nothing next to the tens of millions in legal fees you are about to rack up. Berkshire’s bylaws do not require that the company advance such expenses to you. And Delaware’s indemnification law permits reimbursement of lawyer fees “if the person acted in good faith and in a manner the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.” The report’s reference to what it called your intent to “deceive” Mr. Buffett can be a basis for arguing that you did not act in good faith. There is a shareholder lawsuit looming against you and the company, but as Professor Bainbridge artfully describes, that has some difficult procedural hurdles to clear. It appears, however, that the company is ready to take over prosecution of the suit, an act that would sidestep these hurdles. All of this is no doubt sobering news for someone who appeared so relaxed on CNBC immediately after public disclosure of these trades. Here’s our advice, for whatever it might be worth. The good news is that it is going to be hard in the state law cases to obtain a judgment for more than disgorgement of your profit plus interest. In this light, stubborn pride will get you nowhere. Instead, you can admit that, while you did not think it wrong before, you now realize that your trade may be viewed as a poor decision and so a settlement is in the best interest of all parties. Return the $3 million profit to Berkshire, and offer to reimburse the costs of the investigation. This should take care of the state lawsuits and possibly save you tens of millions in legal fees. You’re probably going to have to return it anyway, and it would be a small sum to pay to begin fighting back on the public relations front. At that point, the only thing left is to argue with the Securities and Exchange Commission over whether the information you had was material. There is enough doubt on this question that a quick settlement is possible, and the S.E.C. might even close its investigation if you voluntarily pay the money to Berkshire Hathaway. Against the forces arrayed against you, this appears to be your best option. No doubt Mr. Buffett will cite this audit committee report to disavow his prior letter in your defense, and is likely to testify against you if it comes to that. You have already denied the audit committee’s allegations through your lawyer, but Berkshire took no time in shooting back at you . Unless you act, things are going to get much worse given the outcry over your conduct. Steven M. Davidoff Peter J.

Mr. Sokol headed up Berkshire’s talks with Lehman Brothers about a possible capital infusion in the ailing bank, according to bankruptcy court filings. Hugh E. McGee III, the head of Lehman’s investment banking unit who had for years advised MidAmerican as an energy banker, called Mr. Sokol in July 2008 about a potential investment by Berkshire. Mr. Sokol expressed interest, but Mr. Buffett dismissed it as unrealistic. In September, a week prior to Lehman’s bankruptcy, Mr. McGee again reached out to Mr. Sokol with a “Hail Mary” pass and asked, “Do you have any ideas to save us?” Mr. Sokol, bear hunting in Alaska at the time, told Mr. McGee that he was stumped. Back from Alaska, September remained a busy month for Mr. Sokol. The day after Lehman’s bankruptcy filing, Mr. Sokol cold called Mayo A. Shattuck III, the chief of Constellation Energy, whose stock was in a death spiral. Mr. Sokol told Mr. Shattuck that MidAmerican was interested in a possible deal and that he would immediately fly to Baltimore to try to reach one. Mr. Sokol hopped on a NetJets plane, and by the next day he had forged an agreement for MidAmerican to buy Constellation for $4.7 billion. The deal fell apart — and garnered Berkshire a tidy $1.2 billion breakup fee — after a French utility outbid MidAmerican for a 50 percent stake in Constellation. (On Thursday, Constellation agreed to be bought by Exelon.) Later that same month, Mr. Sokol was in Hong Kong to announce Mr. Buffett’s investment in BYD, a Chinese electric car manufacturer. Mr. Sokol had been the point person on the deal, flying to China to conduct due diligence on the company. In 2009, Mr. Sokol’s role at Berkshire appeared to have reverted back to operations. In July 2009, Mr. Buffett installed him as head of its then-struggling NetJets unit. For instance, Mr. Sokol did not play a part in Berkshire’s largest acquisition to date, its $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern Railroad. Earlier this year, we now know, Mr. Sokol began doing deals again. When Mr. Buffett announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation earlier this month, he praised Mr. Sokol’s work on the Lubrizol deal. “Though the offer to purchase [Lubrizol] was entirely my decision,” wrote Mr. Buffett, “it would not have occurred without Dave’s early efforts.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/business/27sokol.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">David Sokol May Cast Pall Over Berkshire Meeting<date>Published: April 26, 2011</date><text>David L. Sokol was treated like a rock star at last year’s annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett. Shareholders lined up for autographs and snapshots of the executive considered by many to be Mr. Buffett’s successor.Mr. Sokol will not attend Berkshire’s meeting this weekend. He announced his resignation abruptly last month after reports emerged that he had made a profit by buying the stock of a company in his own account shortly before Mr. Buffett announced he was buying the company. The sudden downfall came as a surprise to outsiders who had watched Mr. Sokol rise in the business world. He helped build a small Omaha energy business into a multibillion-dollar corporation, sold it to Berkshire Hathaway and by all appearances became one of his boss’s favorite executives. Mr. Sokol served as Mr. Buffett’s Mr. Fix-it, a turnaround artist trusted to tackle difficult jobs. But people who worked for Mr. Sokol saw a side of him that Mr. Buffett perhaps did not. His brass-knuckled approach alienated some Berkshire employees, as when he suggested that people with an illness or other personal problems were problematic and when he unceremoniously fired a top executive and made him leave the office that day. Flashes of his management style can be found in some earlier litigation as well. In one civil case, a judge rebuked Mr. Sokol for tampering with his company’s numbers so that a joint-venture partner would get a smaller payout. In another case, Mr. Sokol sued to find out which employees at a Berkshire unit were disparaging him. And he irritated colleagues at two of Berkshire’s subsidiaries, Johns Manville and NetJets, by frequently invoking Mr. Buffett’s name to burnish his own image inside the company. Some people at Berkshire were puzzled over why Mr. Buffett favored him so much, as when he credited Mr. Sokol for a turnaround of Johns Manville even though the unit’s profits fell sharply after he took over. Now, Mr. Sokol’s trading is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to two people close to the inquiry who would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. So the question of just what Mr. Buffett saw in Mr. Sokol — and why he has supported him publicly — will surely be a persistent topic of conversation this weekend in Omaha, at the usually jubilant occasion known as the Woodstock of Capitalism. Shareholders’ questions may cast a pall over the peppy affair as they consider the conduct of Mr. Sokol, who was already wealthy and was on the cusp of running one of America’s most respected companies. “The reasons behind Sokol’s actions are a mystery,” said Whitney Tilson, a fund manager and longtime Berkshire shareholder. “At the very least, he exercised very poor judgment.” Mr. Sokol has said that he resigned to focus on family investments and that the stocks were a good investment for his family that he would do again. He did not respond to questions sent by e-mail or to phone messages for this article. In some ways, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Sokol seem to share many similarities, suggesting an easy familiarity. They were both born and raised in Omaha, Neb., and still reside there. Each man credits their early jobs as newspaper delivery boys and grocery store clerks, with instilling a strong work ethic. Their business writings are filled with homespun aphorisms. But there are marked differences as well. Mr. Buffett, one of America’s richest men according to Forbes magazine, owns one home, which he bought in 1958 for $31,500. Mr. Sokol collects houses, including one near Jackson Hole, Wyo., the upscale ski resort town, and a waterfront home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he docks his yacht. While Mr. Buffett is a homebody whose favorite leisure pursuit is playing bridge on his computer, Mr. Sokol’s passion is hunting. Last month he went on a hunting trip to New Zealand. They also have different views of investment bankers. Mr. Buffett takes frequent potshots at them and boasts about striking multibillion-dollar deals without using advisers. While at Berkshire, Mr. Sokol relished his dealings with Wall Street. He flew frequently to New York for rounds of meetings with bankers pitching deals. Late last year, one of those discussions bore fruit. A meeting with Citigroup bankers led to Berkshire’s $9 billion acquisition of Lubrizol, a chemicals company. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/a-conspicuous-absence-at-berkshire-meeting/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">A Conspicuous Absence at Berkshire Meeting<date>April 27, 2011, 3:04 am</date><text>David L.

Sokol is accused of “misleadingly incomplete disclosures.” 9:02 p.m. | Updated Berkshire Hathaway directors have accused David L. Sokol, once considered a possible successor to Warren E. Buffett, of misleading the company about his personal stake in a specialty chemicals manufacturer that Berkshire recently agreed to acquire. Mr. Sokol, who resigned in March, never told Mr. Buffett that he had bought his stake in Lubrizol after Citigroup bankers had pitched the company as a potential takeover target, according to a report by the audit committee of the Berkshire board that was released on Wednesday. “His misleadingly incomplete disclosures to Berkshire Hathaway senior management concerning those purchases violated the duty of candor he owed the company,” the report says, which adds that Mr. Sokol may have failed his fiduciary duty under the law of Delaware, where Berkshire is incorporated. The accusations are a stark turnaround for Berkshire, which had been careful not to criticize its former star manager. Indeed, when Mr. Buffett announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation on March 30, he said, “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links New York Times: Sokol's Conspicuous Absence Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting is on Saturday, an event in Omaha known as the Woodstock of capitalism that is attended by thousands. Investors and journalists had been expected to try to question Mr. Buffett about Mr. Sokol and the Lubrizol trades. The board’s report, which finds no fault with Mr. Buffett’s handling of the affair, could mute some of the scrutiny facing Berkshire. The report also concluded that Mr. Sokol defied Berkshire’s insider trading policies by accumulating the personal stake in Lubrizol while orchestrating a potential takeover of the company. Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson, Mr. Buffett’s longtime outside law firm, helped prepare the report, which was presented to Berkshire’s board on Tuesday night. Ronald L. Olson, a partner at the firm, sits on Berkshire’s board. Berkshire’s board and audit committee are considering whether to pursue “possible legal action against Mr. Sokol to recover any damage the company has sustained, or his trading profits,” the report says. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, is investigating Mr. Sokol’s trading, according to people close to the inquiry. But Mr. Sokol’s lawyer, Barry W. Levine of Dickstein Shapiro, disputed several major assertions in the report, saying that his client had not traded improperly or violated company policies. Mr. Levine said that Mr. Sokol had been looking at a personal investment in Lubrizol since summer 2010, before Citigroup bankers had pitched Lubrizol. And he said that his client had told Mr. Buffett “twice, not once” about his ownership of Lubrizol shares before Mr. Buffett began discussions with the company. “I am profoundly disappointed that the audit committee of Berkshire Hathaway would authorize the issuance of its report to the public without the care and decency to ask even a single question of Mr. Sokol,” Mr. Levine said in a statement. Mr. Olson said that Mr. Sokol had been offered the opportunity, through his lawyer, to be interviewed by the audit committee, but declined. As a Berkshire manager, Mr. Sokol had emphasized the importance of integrity and ethics to his employees. In his 2007 self-published book, “Pleased, But Not Satisfied,” Mr. Sokol, wrote: “Integrity is merely doing what is right, even when no one else is looking. It is being honest and candid. It is being forthright and candid.” Mr. Sokol, 54, resigned from the company in March after it emerged that he had personally bought $10 million worth of stock in Lubrizol shortly before bringing the company to Mr. Buffett’s attention. Berkshire later agreed to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion, causing Lubrizol’s shares to surge and increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by some $3 million. The shift in Berkshire’s position toward Mr. Sokol came, the audit committee’s report says, because Mr. Buffett and the company did not have the full story in March. Mr. Sokol’s conversations with Mr. Buffett and others at Berkshire about his investment in Lubrizol were “intended to deceive” and “its effect was to mislead,” the report said. Most notably, Mr. Sokol failed to tell Mr. Buffett about the central role that Citigroup played in spawning the Lubrizol deal, according to the report. Mr. Buffett is known to mistrust Wall Street, while Mr. Sokol often flew to New York to huddle with bankers about potential deals. Mr. Sokol first expressed interest in a Lubrizol acquisition in December, after Citigroup bankers recommended the company as a possible takeover target. Citigroup then played matchmaker between Mr. Sokol and Lubrizol’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, shuttling information between the two executives. On Dec. 17, a Citigroup banker called Lubrizol’s chief executive to let him know about Berkshire’s possible interest. That same day, Citigroup told Mr. Sokol, then chairman of MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, that Mr. Hambrick planned to discuss the matter with his board. On Jan. 5, 6 and 7, Mr. Sokol accumulated nearly 100,000 Lubrizol shares. Soon after, Mr. Sokol suggested a Lubrizol deal to Mr. Buffett, who was initially cool to the idea. When Mr. Buffett asked Mr. Sokol what started his interest in Lubrizol, Mr. Sokol said he owned the stock. Mr. Sokol did not disclose that he bought the shares only after Citi had pitched the company as a potential takeover target. And Mr. Buffett did not ask about the extent of his stake in the company. The details of Mr. Sokol’s purchases — and Citi’s involvement in the deal — were not known until a bank representative told Mr. Buffett after the deal was announced on March 14. “This was the first time Mr. Buffett heard that investment bankers played any role in introducing Lubrizol to Mr. Sokol, and did not square with Mr. Sokol’s remark in January that he had come to know Lubrizol by owning the stock,” the report said. The report did not take Mr. Buffett to task for failing to press Mr. Sokol for additional details. Some analysts and corporate governance experts have criticized Mr. Buffett for trusting Mr. Sokol’s original account of the situation. “It did not cross Mr. Buffett’s mind at that time that Mr. Sokol might have bought Lubrizol shares after seeking through investment bankers to initiate discussions with Lubrizol concerning a possible Berkshire Hathaway acquisition of Lubrizol,” the report said. Shortly before Berkshire publicly disclosed Mr. Sokol’s resignation, he had one last chance to set the record straight. Mr. Buffett allowed Mr. Sokol to edit for accuracy an advance copy of the press release announcing his resignation. Mr. Sokol deleted only one sentence that implied that he had resigned because the Lubrizol trades would hinder his chances of succeeding Mr. Buffett. Mr. Sokol, according to the report, said the sentence was inaccurate. Berkshire Hathaway audit report Statement from Barry W. Levine, lawyer for David Sokol I am profoundly disappointed that the Audit Committee of Berkshire Hathaway would authorize the issuance of its report to the public without the care and decency to ask even a single question of Mr. Sokol. Mr. Sokol had been associated with the Berkshire Hathaway companies for 11 years. During this time, his indefatigable efforts helped create enormous value for the Berkshire shareholders. He deserved better. While I take issue with much of the Committee’s report, I briefly make the following points. If the Audit Committee had asked, it would have learned that: Mr. Sokol had been studying Lubrizol for personal investment since the summer of 2010; such investments are specifically allowed by his employment agreement. Mr. Buffett was told twice, not once, about Mr. Sokol’s ownership of Lubrizol stock before Mr. Buffett engaged in any discussions with Lubrizol. Contrary to the Audit Committee’s statement, Mr. Sokol’s Lubrizol shares were not acquired pursuant to a “100,000 limit order.” Rather, they were purchased as a result of several limit orders, over a period of days, at specified prices, for the day only, in order to acquire the stock at low prices. At that time, Mr. Sokol had no reason to anticipate that Mr. Buffett would have any interest whatsoever in Lubrizol. I have known Mr. Sokol and have represented his companies in business litigation since the mid 1980s. I know him to be a man of uncommon rectitude and probity. He would not, and did not, trade improperly, nor did he violate any fair reading of the Berkshire Hathaway policies.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/what-would-you-ask-warren-buffett-2/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">What Would You Ask Buffett?<date></date><text>We’re sorry, we seem to have lost this page, but we don’t want to lose you.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/25/meet-buffetts-bodyguard/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Meet Buffett's Bodyguard<date>April 25, 2011, 2:30 am</date><text>Every time Warren E. Buffett strolls through the crowd, shakes someone’s hand or takes a question at the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting this weekend, Dan Clark and his staff will be there. Mr. Clark has been in charge of Mr. Buffett’s security since 1995, and over the years has stepped up the measures taken to protect one of the richest men in the world, Cindy Gonzalez reports in The Omaha World-Herald. Mr. Buffett’s shadow retired from the Omaha Police Department in 2009 to run his security firm, Clark International, full time, and can deploy up to 150 guards and off-duty officers for taxing events like the Berkshire bash. As shareholders start looking forward to another Steak Night, Mr. Clark’s squad is crawling through the air shafts, gauging the catwalks and scrutinizing the conference rooms of the Qwest Center in Omaha. While Mr. Clark and his men have dealt with various threats, once repelling an armed man near Mr. Buffett’s Omaha home, the most common risk, tellingly, comes from fans and the media. “The reality is I have protected him more from the press and crowds than from assaults,” Mr. Clark told The World Herald. Berkshire, which started listing Mr. Buffett’s security costs in 2008, has increased what it pays by nearly 11 percent since then, from $315,709 to $349,946 a year. Those numbers are roughly in line with what other large companies pay to protect their chief executives. Mr. Clark has used the money to construct a 7,000-square foot headquarters for his company, which has diversified to protect visiting celebrities like Barack Obama, George Clooney and Sarah Palin. And yes, in case you are wondering, Mr. Buffett’s bodyguard might also be described as his long-lost pal. “Mr. Buffett and I have always done business on a handshake based on trust,” Mr. Clark told the newspaper. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 5, 2011 An earlier version of this post misidentified the author of an article in The Omaha World-Herald.

Mr. Buffett delegates; he empowers his executives. Mr. Buffett, the 80-year-old chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway known as Uncle Warren, has been praised as one of the world’s greatest business managers. He has racked up average annualized returns of more than 20 percent for four decades. Yet in a potential case study for business schools, the question is now being asked: Does Mr. Buffett delegate too much? Just in time for his company’s annual meeting with 35,000 investors next weekend, Mr. Buffett’s management style is coming under scrutiny. His heir apparent, David L. Sokol, resigned last month after it emerged that he had bought $10 million worth of stock in Lubrizol, a chemical manufacturer, a day after he began orchestrating a merger with Berkshire, which later acquired Lubrizol for $9 billion — increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by $3 million. Although Mr. Sokol mentioned that he was a shareholder in Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett when he suggested that Berkshire buy the company, Mr. Buffett said he did not ask about “the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” The controversy exposed a paradox: Mr. Buffett may be considered one of the world’s best managers, but he doesn’t actively manage the hundreds of businesses that Berkshire owns. “Did Sokol’s actions reveal shortcomings in the company’s governance system that need to be addressed?” asked Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business in a paper titled “The Resignation of David Sokol: Mountain or Molehill for Berkshire Hathaway?” Unlike Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, who spends much of his time on airplanes traveling the world to visit the company’s 287,000 employees and oversees a giant campus and management team in Fairfield, Conn., Mr. Buffett “manages” Berkshire’s 257,000 employees with just 21 people at his headquarters in a small office in Omaha. Mr. Buffett’s business partner, Charles Munger, once described Mr. Buffett’s day. He spends half of his time just sitting around and reading, Mr. Munger said. “And a big chunk of the rest of the time is spent talking one on one, either on the telephone or personally, with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him.” And that trust has advantages. “Part of his genius is that he’s created a hands-off culture that encourages entrepreneurs to sell their private companies to Berkshire,” said Larry Pitkowsky, managing partner of GoodHaven Capital Management and a longtime Berkshire shareholder, “and, critically, that they keeping showing up for work every day without worrying that they are going to get a call from headquarters telling them how to run things.” How hands-off is Mr. Buffett? When questioned once about why Berkshire didn’t take a more active role in fixing Moody’s, the troubled credit rating agency, in which he was the largest shareholder, he declared: “I’ve never been to Moody’s. I don’t even know where they’re located.” “If I thought they needed me I wouldn’t have bought the stock,” he added. He sees himself less of an activist than as a passive investor, a stock picker with a nose for a good deal. “We don’t tell Burlington Northern what safety procedures to put in or AmEx who they should lend to,” he said at his annual meeting two years ago. “When we own stock, we are not there to try and change people.” His management approach may be as much a function of his own philosophy as it is a practical preference. He likes to make his investments dispassionately, based on the numbers, rather than let emotions get involved. Mr. Buffett’s investing antennas may be genius, but some of his critics have suggested that his trust-based management style may have left him too farsighted to quickly spot operational problems. As reported by Carol Loomis of Fortune magazine, when Mr. Buffett was first told in 1991 about indications of a possible scandal at Salomon Brothers that later nearly took down the company (Berkshire was its largest shareholder), he initially did not detect any reason to be particularly alarmed, “so he went back to dinner.” Only after speaking several days later about the matter with his partner, Mr. Munger, “did Buffett get a sense of real trouble.”</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/warren-buffett-the-delegator-in-chief/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Warren Buffett, the Delegator in Chief<date>April 23, 2011, 7:25 pm</date><text>“He picked the chorus line but didn’t attempt to dance.” That is Warren E.

Sokol resigned from Berkshire Hathaway on March 30. 9:18 p.m. | Updated David L. Sokol, a former top deputy to Warren E. Buffett, knew more about Lubrizol’s interest in a potential deal with Berkshire Hathaway than previously disclosed — a revelation that comes as the government examines Mr. Sokol’s personal stake in the chemical manufacturer. A regulatory filing on Monday shows that Mr. Sokol was aware in mid-December that Lubrizol’s chief executive planned to talk to his board about a possible acquisition by Berkshire. A few weeks later, Mr. Sokol bought nearly 100,000 Lubizol shares. The fresh details once again cast a spotlight on Mr. Sokol’s decision to take a $10 million stake in Lubrizol while orchestrating a potential takeover of it. The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering whether to open a formal investigation into Mr. Sokol, according to people close to the agency. His legal liability, in part, hinges on whether he acted on material, confidential information for his own personal gain. Mr. Sokol, who abruptly resigned his managerial post at Berkshire last month, saw the value of his Lubrizol stake rise by $3 million after Berkshire announced its $9 billion bid for the industrial company. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: The S.E.C. and the Sokol Trades “I think someone could look at this set of facts and say there’s a potential problem here,” said Richard L. Scheff, a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer at Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads. “This raises a concern for me.” Even so, the insider trading rules are murky. And the government may find it difficult to prove Mr. Sokol’s trades were anything more than “innocent purchases,” said Daniel J. Hurson, a former lawyer in the S.E.C.’s enforcement office who is now in private practice. Mr. Sokol has said that he did nothing wrong, and Mr. Buffett has agreed. “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful,” Mr. Buffett said in a letter last month about the resignation, noting that Mr. Sokol made the trades before pitching the Lubrizol deal to Berkshire. The preliminary proxy filed by Lubrizol on Monday provides greater detail about Mr. Sokol’s dealings. Mr. Sokol first expressed interest in a Lubrizol acquisition in December, after Citigroup bankers recommended the industrial manufacturer as a possible takeover target. On Dec. 17, a Citigroup banker called Lubrizol’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, to let him know about Berkshire’s possible interest in the company, the new regulatory filing said. Mr. Hambrick told the banker that he would share Berkshire’s possible interest with the Lubrizol directors. That same day, Citigroup told Mr. Sokol, then chairman of MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, about the board’s planned discussions — a previously unknown part of the timeline. “That sounds pretty material to me,” Mr. Hurson said. “If I was still at the S.E.C., I’d be interested in the case.” Mr. Sokol started accumulating Lubrizol stock shortly thereafter. From Jan. 5 through Jan. 7, Mr. Sokol bought more than 96,000 shares of the company. The Lubrizol board held a “special meeting” on Jan. 6 to discuss Berkshire Hathaway’s possible interest in the company, and the board agreed right away to hire lawyers to advise on a potential acquisition. “On or about January 10, 2011, Mr. Hambrick requested that Citi contact Mr. Sokol to inform him that he should expect a call from Mr. Hambrick and thereafter Citi so informed Mr. Sokol,” according to the latest Lubrizol filing. Roughly four days later, Mr. Sokol and Mr. Hambrick talked on the phone about the “corporate cultures and philosophies” at their respective companies. They agreed to meet in person later in the month. Mr. Sokol suggested a Lubrizol deal to Mr. Buffett on Jan. 14 or 15, according to Mr. Buffett’s letter. At the time, Mr. Sokol made a “passing remark” about his stake in Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett, who did not ask about “the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” Some analysts and corporate governance experts have criticized Mr. Buffett for not demanding further details. “This is damaging to Berkshire’s reputation,” said Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst at research firm Morningstar. “It brings up questions about Berkshire’s internal controls.” Mr. Buffett indicated in his letter that “Dave’s purchases were made before he had discussed Lubrizol with me and with no knowledge of how I might react to his idea” or “what Lubrizol’s reaction would be if I developed an interest.” Although Mr. Buffett was originally skeptical of the deal, he later became convinced. Berkshire ultimately agreed on March 14 to acquire Lubrizol for $9 billion. On March 30, Mr. Buffett announced the departure of Mr. Sokol in a letter that detailed the trades. That’s when Lubrizol “first learned” of Mr. Sokol’s personal stake, the company said in the filing on Monday.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/disclosure-sheds-new-light-on-sokol-timeline/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Disclosure Sheds New Light on Sokol Timeline<date>April 12, 2011, 4:12 pm</date><text>Warren E. Buffett said he “held back nothing” in a letter announcing the resignation of David L. Sokol, a top Berkshire Hathaway manager. But a new regulatory filing once again raises questions about the dealings of Mr. Sokol, who was buying Lubrizol stock at the same time he was pushing Berkshire to acquire the company. What did Mr. Sokol tell his boss about his Lubrizol trades? What did he know about the deal — and when? And why didn’t Mr. Buffett ask for more disclosure on the issue? In the March 30 letter, Mr. Buffett wrote that Mr. Sokol bought nearly 100,000 Lubrizol shares in January, just before recommending the industrial manufacturer as a potential takeover target. But the letter never mentioned that Mr. Sokol knew Lubrizol’s chief executive was planning to talk to the company’s board about a possible deal with Berkshire — and that he knew a few weeks before buying $10 million of stock for his personal portfolio. The Lubrizol preliminary proxy, filed on Monday, revealed for the first time that Citigroup told Mr. Sokol about such discussions in December. At issue is whether such information would be considered nonpublic and material, a crucial determinant for regulators bringing insider trading cases. “I think someone could look at this set of facts and say there’s a potential problem here,” said Richard L. Scheff, a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer and chairman of Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads. Taking the letter at face value, Mr. Sokol seems to have left out crucial details when talking to his boss about the Lubrizol trades — and Mr. Buffett didn’t ask for much follow-up. Mr. Sokol first suggested a possible Lubrizol deal to Mr. Buffett on Jan. 14 or 15, according to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Sokol made a “passing remark” to Mr. Buffett about his stake in Lubrizol, Mr. Buffett said. “I did not ask him about the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” “It just seems odd to me that it didn’t throw up some red flags,” Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst at Morningstar, said at the time.

Mr. Buffett delegates; he empowers his executives. Mr. Buffett, the 80-year-old chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway known as Uncle Warren, has been praised as one of the world’s greatest business managers. He has racked up average annualized returns of more than 20 percent for four decades. Yet in a potential case study for business schools, the question is now being asked: Does Mr. Buffett delegate too much? Just in time for his company’s annual meeting with 35,000 investors next weekend, Mr. Buffett’s management style is coming under scrutiny. His heir apparent, David L. Sokol, resigned last month after it emerged that he had bought $10 million worth of stock in Lubrizol, a chemical manufacturer, a day after he began orchestrating a merger with Berkshire, which later acquired Lubrizol for $9 billion — increasing the value of Mr. Sokol’s holding by $3 million. Although Mr. Sokol mentioned that he was a shareholder in Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett when he suggested that Berkshire buy the company, Mr. Buffett said he did not ask about “the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” The controversy exposed a paradox: Mr. Buffett may be considered one of the world’s best managers, but he doesn’t actively manage the hundreds of businesses that Berkshire owns. “Did Sokol’s actions reveal shortcomings in the company’s governance system that need to be addressed?” asked Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business in a paper titled “The Resignation of David Sokol: Mountain or Molehill for Berkshire Hathaway?” Unlike Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, who spends much of his time on airplanes traveling the world to visit the company’s 287,000 employees and oversees a giant campus and management team in Fairfield, Conn., Mr. Buffett “manages” Berkshire’s 257,000 employees with just 21 people at his headquarters in a small office in Omaha. Mr. Buffett’s business partner, Charles Munger, once described Mr. Buffett’s day. He spends half of his time just sitting around and reading, Mr. Munger said. “And a big chunk of the rest of the time is spent talking one on one, either on the telephone or personally, with highly gifted people whom he trusts and who trust him.” And that trust has advantages. “Part of his genius is that he’s created a hands-off culture that encourages entrepreneurs to sell their private companies to Berkshire,” said Larry Pitkowsky, managing partner of GoodHaven Capital Management and a longtime Berkshire shareholder, “and, critically, that they keeping showing up for work every day without worrying that they are going to get a call from headquarters telling them how to run things.” How hands-off is Mr. Buffett? When questioned once about why Berkshire didn’t take a more active role in fixing Moody’s, the troubled credit rating agency, in which he was the largest shareholder, he declared: “I’ve never been to Moody’s. I don’t even know where they’re located.” “If I thought they needed me I wouldn’t have bought the stock,” he added. He sees himself less of an activist than as a passive investor, a stock picker with a nose for a good deal. “We don’t tell Burlington Northern what safety procedures to put in or AmEx who they should lend to,” he said at his annual meeting two years ago. “When we own stock, we are not there to try and change people.” His management approach may be as much a function of his own philosophy as it is a practical preference. He likes to make his investments dispassionately, based on the numbers, rather than let emotions get involved. Mr. Buffett’s investing antennas may be genius, but some of his critics have suggested that his trust-based management style may have left him too farsighted to quickly spot operational problems. As reported by Carol Loomis of Fortune magazine, when Mr. Buffett was first told in 1991 about indications of a possible scandal at Salomon Brothers that later nearly took down the company (Berkshire was its largest shareholder), he initially did not detect any reason to be particularly alarmed, “so he went back to dinner.” Only after speaking several days later about the matter with his partner, Mr. Munger, “did Buffett get a sense of real trouble.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/warren-buffett-the-delegator-in-chief/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Warren Buffett, the Delegator in Chief<date>April 23, 2011, 7:25 pm</date><text>“He picked the chorus line but didn’t attempt to dance.” That is Warren E.

Sokol resigned from Berkshire Hathaway on March 30. 9:18 p.m. | Updated David L. Sokol, a former top deputy to Warren E. Buffett, knew more about Lubrizol’s interest in a potential deal with Berkshire Hathaway than previously disclosed — a revelation that comes as the government examines Mr. Sokol’s personal stake in the chemical manufacturer. A regulatory filing on Monday shows that Mr. Sokol was aware in mid-December that Lubrizol’s chief executive planned to talk to his board about a possible acquisition by Berkshire. A few weeks later, Mr. Sokol bought nearly 100,000 Lubizol shares. The fresh details once again cast a spotlight on Mr. Sokol’s decision to take a $10 million stake in Lubrizol while orchestrating a potential takeover of it. The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering whether to open a formal investigation into Mr. Sokol, according to people close to the agency. His legal liability, in part, hinges on whether he acted on material, confidential information for his own personal gain. Mr. Sokol, who abruptly resigned his managerial post at Berkshire last month, saw the value of his Lubrizol stake rise by $3 million after Berkshire announced its $9 billion bid for the industrial company. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: The S.E.C. and the Sokol Trades “I think someone could look at this set of facts and say there’s a potential problem here,” said Richard L. Scheff, a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer at Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads. “This raises a concern for me.” Even so, the insider trading rules are murky. And the government may find it difficult to prove Mr. Sokol’s trades were anything more than “innocent purchases,” said Daniel J. Hurson, a former lawyer in the S.E.C.’s enforcement office who is now in private practice. Mr. Sokol has said that he did nothing wrong, and Mr. Buffett has agreed. “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful,” Mr. Buffett said in a letter last month about the resignation, noting that Mr. Sokol made the trades before pitching the Lubrizol deal to Berkshire. The preliminary proxy filed by Lubrizol on Monday provides greater detail about Mr. Sokol’s dealings. Mr. Sokol first expressed interest in a Lubrizol acquisition in December, after Citigroup bankers recommended the industrial manufacturer as a possible takeover target. On Dec. 17, a Citigroup banker called Lubrizol’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, to let him know about Berkshire’s possible interest in the company, the new regulatory filing said. Mr. Hambrick told the banker that he would share Berkshire’s possible interest with the Lubrizol directors. That same day, Citigroup told Mr. Sokol, then chairman of MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, about the board’s planned discussions — a previously unknown part of the timeline. “That sounds pretty material to me,” Mr. Hurson said. “If I was still at the S.E.C., I’d be interested in the case.” Mr. Sokol started accumulating Lubrizol stock shortly thereafter. From Jan. 5 through Jan. 7, Mr. Sokol bought more than 96,000 shares of the company. The Lubrizol board held a “special meeting” on Jan. 6 to discuss Berkshire Hathaway’s possible interest in the company, and the board agreed right away to hire lawyers to advise on a potential acquisition. “On or about January 10, 2011, Mr. Hambrick requested that Citi contact Mr. Sokol to inform him that he should expect a call from Mr. Hambrick and thereafter Citi so informed Mr. Sokol,” according to the latest Lubrizol filing. Roughly four days later, Mr. Sokol and Mr. Hambrick talked on the phone about the “corporate cultures and philosophies” at their respective companies. They agreed to meet in person later in the month. Mr. Sokol suggested a Lubrizol deal to Mr. Buffett on Jan. 14 or 15, according to Mr. Buffett’s letter. At the time, Mr. Sokol made a “passing remark” about his stake in Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett, who did not ask about “the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” Some analysts and corporate governance experts have criticized Mr. Buffett for not demanding further details. “This is damaging to Berkshire’s reputation,” said Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst at research firm Morningstar. “It brings up questions about Berkshire’s internal controls.” Mr. Buffett indicated in his letter that “Dave’s purchases were made before he had discussed Lubrizol with me and with no knowledge of how I might react to his idea” or “what Lubrizol’s reaction would be if I developed an interest.” Although Mr. Buffett was originally skeptical of the deal, he later became convinced. Berkshire ultimately agreed on March 14 to acquire Lubrizol for $9 billion. On March 30, Mr. Buffett announced the departure of Mr. Sokol in a letter that detailed the trades. That’s when Lubrizol “first learned” of Mr. Sokol’s personal stake, the company said in the filing on Monday.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/disclosure-sheds-new-light-on-sokol-timeline/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Disclosure Sheds New Light on Sokol Timeline<date>April 12, 2011, 4:12 pm</date><text>Warren E. Buffett said he “held back nothing” in a letter announcing the resignation of David L. Sokol, a top Berkshire Hathaway manager. But a new regulatory filing once again raises questions about the dealings of Mr. Sokol, who was buying Lubrizol stock at the same time he was pushing Berkshire to acquire the company. What did Mr. Sokol tell his boss about his Lubrizol trades? What did he know about the deal — and when? And why didn’t Mr. Buffett ask for more disclosure on the issue? In the March 30 letter, Mr. Buffett wrote that Mr. Sokol bought nearly 100,000 Lubrizol shares in January, just before recommending the industrial manufacturer as a potential takeover target. But the letter never mentioned that Mr. Sokol knew Lubrizol’s chief executive was planning to talk to the company’s board about a possible deal with Berkshire — and that he knew a few weeks before buying $10 million of stock for his personal portfolio. The Lubrizol preliminary proxy, filed on Monday, revealed for the first time that Citigroup told Mr. Sokol about such discussions in December. At issue is whether such information would be considered nonpublic and material, a crucial determinant for regulators bringing insider trading cases. “I think someone could look at this set of facts and say there’s a potential problem here,” said Richard L. Scheff, a former federal prosecutor who is now a criminal defense lawyer and chairman of Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads. Taking the letter at face value, Mr. Sokol seems to have left out crucial details when talking to his boss about the Lubrizol trades — and Mr. Buffett didn’t ask for much follow-up. Mr. Sokol first suggested a possible Lubrizol deal to Mr. Buffett on Jan. 14 or 15, according to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Sokol made a “passing remark” to Mr. Buffett about his stake in Lubrizol, Mr. Buffett said. “I did not ask him about the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings.” “It just seems odd to me that it didn’t throw up some red flags,” Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst at Morningstar, said at the time. It was not until after Berkshire agreed to buy Lubrizol in mid-March that Mr. Sokol revealed the extent of his Lubrizol holding. He did so only at the prompting of Berkshire’s chief financial officer.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/from-behind-the-scenes-altman-speaks-out/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">From Behind the Scenes, an Influential Adviser Speaks Out<date>April 7, 2011, 2:04 pm</date><text>Roger C.

Sokol after he joined Berkshire Hathaway suggest that management had some warnings about his rules-pushing nature long before his resignation last week for buying stock in a company shortly before Berkshire acquired it.The most serious lawsuit centered on the accounting of an irrigation project by MidAmerican Energy, where Mr. Sokol was chief executive when Berkshire bought it in 1999. In a rebuke last year, the judge ruled in that case that MidAmerican had improperly changed its accounting on the project and criticized Mr. Sokol directly. The change in accounting was “intended to eliminate the minority shareholders’ interests,” the judge wrote, awarding more than $32 million to the minority shareholders. The case had taken more than five years to work its way through the courts. During that time, Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire, expressed confidence in Mr. Sokol by broadening his portfolio beyond MidAmerican to include Netjets, a company that sells fractional use of private aircraft. After Mr. Sokol took over Netjets in July 2009, some critics complained about his management style and his strategy for shrinking the company, which had been ailing even before the financial crisis did more severe damage. Under Mr. Sokol’s direction, the aircraft company filed a suit last November seeking to learn which employees had provided information to Alice Schroeder, the author of “The Snowball,” the best-selling biography of Mr. Buffett. Ms. Schroeder declined to supply the information, and her lawyer characterized the action as a witch hunt. The suit was dropped on Monday. The lawsuits would have been “yellow lights: if not danger signals, at least warning signs,” Ms. Schroeder said in an interview on Monday. “Disputes in business are common, but both of these speak to the integrity of the management, not just ordinary business wrangling.” Some others have questioned Mr. Sokol’s hard-charging style as well. Michael Lissack, who was an investment banker at Smith Barney in the late 1980s, worked with Mr. Sokol when he ran Ogden Projects, the resource recovery subsidiary of the Ogden Corporation. He characterized Mr. Sokol as “very bright” but at times wondered about his motivation. “There is nothing wrong with being tough,” Mr. Lissack said. “There is something wrong with only looking out for No. 1 when you pretend to be a team player.” The Netjets suit was dropped less than a week after Mr. Sokol said he was resigning from Berkshire, which acknowledged that he had owned shares of Lubrizol, a specialty chemicals company, before Berkshire announced it would acquire the company. Investment bankers talked with Mr. Sokol about Lubrizol as a possible acquisition target. In January, Mr. Sokol accumulated about $10 million in shares of Lubrizol and had a discussion with Lubrizol’s chief executive. Mr. Sokol subsequently promoted the company to Mr. Buffett, Mr. Buffett has said. Two months later, when Berkshire agreed to buy the company, Mr. Sokol’s shares soared about $3 million in value. After the resignation, Mr. Buffett said that he did not believe the purchases were unlawful. He also said that they were made before Mr. Sokol had discussed Lubrizol with Mr. Buffett, so he could not have known whether Mr. Buffett would be in favor of a deal. At Netjets, Mr. Sokol faced a difficult task because of the recession and because, by most accounts, the company had grown bloated. Ms. Schroeder, who tracks Berkshire and its companies, noted that Netjets had shown improvement, but added that public information was very limited because the company was a tiny part of Berkshire. The Netjets lawsuit “claimed that some employees, or at least one employee, had violated his or her confidentiality agreement with Netjets by forwarding an internal e-mail from Mr. Sokol distributed to more than 2,000 of the companies’ employees,” said Cameron Stracher, of counsel to Levine, Sullivan, Koch &amp; Schulz, the firm representing Ms. Schroeder. In January, the company started a proceeding in Ms. Schroeder’s home state of Connecticut to subpoena her to produce her sources. “To sue to get an e-mail that was distributed companywide is clearly a witch hunt,” Mr. Stracher said. Michele L. Noble, a partner at Thompson Hine, the firm representing Netjets, said she could not comment on the company’s decision to withdraw its suit. Mr. Sokol did not return e-mails, and a company spokeswoman declined to comment. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/in-corporate-disclosure-a-murky-definition-of-material/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">In Corporate Disclosure, a Murky Definition of Material<date>April 5, 2011, 5:57 pm</date><text>Harry Campbell Why all the secrecy? It seems that each day brings a new revelation of a company tardily disclosing something important. Goldman Sachs was slow to disclose that there was an investigation into the Abacus transaction; Goldman, as well as Procter &amp; Gamble and AMR, all said nothing when one of their directors, Rajat K. Gupta, became ensnared in the Galleon Group insider trading investigation. There is the debate about what Apple should say publicly about Steve Jobs’s health. Most recently, Berkshire Hathaway said a senior executive, David L. Sokol, had bought shares of a company before that company was acquired by Berskshire — a revelation it made only when it announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation. It’s all a matter of materiality. American securities laws are quirky when it comes to disclosure. They do not require, as they do in Britain, that all material information be disclosed on a continuous basis. Instead, companies must periodically file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing all material information. Certain categories of such information, like director resignations, are required to be reported within two business days. But most information is allowed to be reported quarterly or yearly. Even then, the information is typically required to be disclosed only if it is deemed material. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink What is material information? It has been defined by the United States Supreme Court as “a substantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” This is a subjective legal standard, so there is no bright line rule for what is material. Each situation is different. It also allows lawyers and others to argue that something is not material because they didn’t think it was certain or important enough to affect the stock price of the company significantly. It’s here where companies have gotten into trouble. A company’s disclosure of controversial information is run past the lawyers, who look at it through a legal perspective. Since materiality is a legal concept to them, the lawyers too often find ways to judge it not material. It’s not directly related to the business (Mr. Jobs), no official allegations have been made (Mr. Gupta) or it’s not relevant to judging business performance (Abacus). Then there is the odd case of Mr. Sokol. Looking at it from a legal perspective, the question whether his trading may violate insider trading laws is murky. One issue is whether the information he possessed, Berkshire’s possible interest in acquiring Lubrizol, was material. A court would look at this by assessing the probability that the Lubrizol transaction would have occurred. Under current precedent on insider trading, this conclusion is driven by the fact that Mr. Sokol did not have final decision-making power to do the transaction — mitigating against materiality. And the question of materiality in this context is a legal swamp, one where there is anything but certainty. So, it may very well be that Mr. Sokol has a solid legal defense to his trades. (Mr. Sokol has said publicly that he has done nothing wrong in his purchase of Lubrizol shares.) The trial of the Galleon hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam on insider trading charges raises the same kind of issue. His defense is the mosaic theory, arguing that that he was only collecting bits of nonmaterial information that he then put together to make an investment decision. To nonlawyers, these efforts to find distinctions between material and nonmaterial can seem baffling. If Berkshire Hathaway was looking to bid on a company, of course any investor would want to know. An investor would especially want to know if the person interested in the purchase was a top executive. This is the problem with the current disclosure scheme and its definition of materiality. It is increasingly disconnected from the desires of investors and the marketplace. Investors live in a digital world of real-time communication. Information is a commodity whose value rapidly deteriorates — the faster a company discloses, the better, from an investor’s perspective. The definition of materiality is from the 1980s, another time. Companies have not kept up and too often view disclosure as a game, with the goal to avoid disclosure. This is what happened in another case of tardy disclosure, Bank of America’s consideration of an effort to terminate the Merrill Lynch transaction and Bank of America’s subsequent bailout by the government, neither of which were disclosed until weeks after the fact. Bank of America lawyers massaged the information internally until they could get to a position that it did not have to be disclosed. Because materiality is a complicated legal standard, Mr. Sokol can defend trades that others see as not only unseemly, but as a example of what insider trading laws should prohibit. For investors’ sake, companies need to view materiality from a broader perspective. It is not just about whether the S.E.C. could bring an action, but what investors will find important — in other words, will it move the market price? Common sense works here. The information kept by Bank of America, Goldman and Berkshire was important to investors whether or not companies were required to disclose it immediately. Companies need to understand that information disclosure is not just a legal game. Failure to disclose important information on a timely basis can harm a company’s reputation. The S.E.C. could consider expanding the disclosure requirements beyond periodic reporting. In today’s markets disclosure may be better made on a real-time basis. Such a regime has its own costs as it exposes a company to more liability for misstatements in such disclosure. But a more enhanced disclosure scheme may be a trade-off for reductions in potential liability for such disclosure or safe harbors. Then there is the question of materiality. The definition has become legally constrained, fraught with multiple interpretations and views. There is a need for renewed guidance, if not new legislation. The definition of materiality would be simpler and clearer if its test was what is important to the investor, instead of a calculation of whether the mix of information has been altered. It is more straightforward in Britain, which considers whether there would have been a significant effect on the share price in determining what is material. A failure to act here may lead to increasing distrust of the markets by an already wary public. Congress said it best when it adopted the Securities Exchange Act, the cornerstone of company disclosure, in 1934 under the concept that “there cannot be honest markets without honest publicity. Manipulation and dishonest practices of the market place thrive upon mystery and secrecy.” The principle remains true today. Steven M.

Wyly Have you heard this one recently: A senior executive buys shares in a company that he may recommend be the target of a takeover, giving him a significant profit if the deal goes through. When the trading becomes known, questions arise whether the Securities and Exchange Commission views the information as material for possible insider trading charges. This scenario brings to mind David L. Sokol, once a top deputy to Warren E. Buffett, but it is also the subject of an S.E.C. lawsuit against the billionaire brothers Samuel and Charles J. Wyly. Judge Shira A. Scheindlin recently rejected their motion in Federal District Court in Manhattan to dismiss insider trading charges against them on the ground that information about their intention to seek a sale of a company on which they were directors was not material. Judge Scheindlin’s analysis is instructive on how the S.E.C. might approach an investigation of Mr. Sokol’s trading in shares of Lubrizol before recommending the company to Mr. Buffett as a potential acquisition for his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Sokol bought 2,300 shares of Lubrizol the day after a meeting with Citigroup bankers in December 2010 at which they pitched various companies as potential takeover targets for Berkshire Hathaway. He quickly sold those shares, but then purchased 96,060 Lubrizol shares in early January, an investment of approximately $10 million. About a week later, Mr. Sokol spoke with Lubrizol’s chief executive and then recommended to Mr. Buffett that Berkshire Hathaway consider acquiring it. If the S.E.C. investigates Mr. Sokol’s purchases, as appears likely, the first question will be whether information about a potential acquisition of Lubrizol was material at the time of the trades. The S.E.C.’s position in the Wyly brothers case on the materiality of preliminary takeover information, and Judge Scheindlin’s acceptance of that approach, will be instructive on how it will approach Mr. Sokol’s situation. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A claim of securities fraud requires proof that the information was material, so any failure to establish this element means the case would fail. To determine whether information about a potential merger or acquisition is material, the Supreme Court in Basic Inc. v. Levinson applied the probability magnitude test to assess the likelihood of a transaction and its potential impact on the corporation. The S.E.C. accused the Wyly brothers of entering into a swap agreement with Lehman Brothers, which required the acquisition of two million shares of Sterling Software, so they could effectively bet that the company’s stock price would increase after deciding to pursue its sale. At the time, they served as chairman and vice chairman of Sterling Software’s board, and together with other family members and their lawyer comprised half of its directors. They argued in the motion to dismiss that their personal desire to have Sterling Software put itself up for sale was not material information because the company had not taken any steps toward making a transaction, like retaining an investment banker or identifying potential acquirers. Nothing concrete had occurred within the corporation to indicate a deal would take place, so their personal desires were not of sufficient importance to be material information on which they were prohibited from trading. Judge Scheindlin rejected the argument, pointing out the Wyly brothers were highly influential at Sterling Software and not just two ordinary directors, so “they could be confident that they could effectuate any planned sale, enhancing the probability that it would occur.” In considering the magnitude of the transaction, the opinion quoted from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit’s 1976 opinion in S.E.C. v. Geon Industries Inc., an early insider trading case involving tipping about a potential merger. “We think that inside information, as regards a merger of this sort, can become material at an earlier stage than would be the case as regards lesser transactions,’ the decision read, “and this even though the mortality rate of mergers in such formative stages is doubtless high.” Judge Scheindlin found the Wyly brothers’ intention to sell the company was “plausibly material” information because of their positions on the Sterling Software board and the likely impact of an acquisition, even though nothing had happened yet at the corporate level to pursue a deal. The decision allows the S.E.C. to move forward with its case. There are some potentially important differences between Mr. Sokol’s position at Berkshire Hathaway and the Wylys at Sterling Software that might make his information about a potential deal for Lubrizol less likely to meet the standard for materiality. Mr. Sokol did not have significant influence over the decision to pursue an acquisition, a fact that Mr. Buffett highlighted in a statement announcing Mr. Sokol’s resignation that he had “no voice in Berkshire’s decision once he suggested the idea.” The S.E.C.’s case against the Wyly brothers, which is broader than just the insider trading charge, revolves around claims that they made misleading disclosures about their ownership of shares in different companies. The insider trading count alleges that they obscured their transaction in Sterling Software by using a swap agreement, which indicates the information would have been material. Mr. Sokol did nothing to hide his purchases of Lubrizol, and even disclosed them to Mr. Buffett, albeit in a rather perfunctory manner. While these differences could be significant in the deciding whether to pursue insider trading charges, I think the S.E.C. is likely to view the information that Mr. Sokol possessed when he bought shares as “plausibly material” because of its potential impact on investors. Mr. Sokol viewed Lubrizol as the most likely target among the companies discussed by the Citigroup bankers, and his familiarity with Mr. Buffett’s criteria for selecting acquisition targets would increase the possibility that Mr. Sokol’s assessment of a company’s value would make a deal more likely to occur. In addition, although materiality is assessed at the time of the trading, the fact that Berkshire Hathaway later decided to acquire Lubrizol only heightens the perception that Mr. Sokol’s early interest in the company would have been material to other investors. Just as important, Mr. Sokol’s employer is no run-of-the-mill business but one of the leading conglomerates in the world, renowned for the investing acumen of Mr. Buffett. Any hint in the market that Berkshire Hathaway might be interested in a company would have an immediate impact on a company’s stock price, so the magnitude of any potential deal on the target’s shares would be magnified. The S.E.C. takes an aggressive view of materiality, as illustrated in its charges against the Wyly brothers. It has avoided drawing any clear lines around what is — and is not — material information about mergers and acquisitions because that might encourage trading by those who learn about a potential deal in the early stages. For the S.E.C., all information is potentially material, and a flexible approach is in its interest. Evidence of materiality is not overwhelming, however, and other factors in Mr. Sokol’s trading are likely to weigh against the S.E.C. pursuing an enforcement action, as the Deal Professor and I discussed in an earlier post. A powerful deterrent to pursuing a case against Mr. Sokol is Mr. Buffett’s statement that he did not view the trading as wrongful. I doubt the S.E.C. is eager to see Mr. Buffett testify for the defense that the information was not material when Mr. Sokol traded, even if an argument can be made that it was.

The neighbors use their hands to unplug the snow blower or drivers are convinced that they can text and drive at the same time. They all know better, but every year 1,000 people lose a finger or two to snow blowers anyway, and 20 percent of car crashes with injuries are due to distracted driving. When it comes to money, we’re equally susceptible to letting the familiar get in the way of making the smart decision. For many money decisions, the consequences are small. A friend told me the story about the time she paid her credit card bill online, but failed to realize that the payment was coming out of the wrong account. She got the notice that the payment was approved and didn’t discover the problem until she checked her bank balance and saw that the account was overdrawn. Over time, she had gotten comfortable making the payment without looking at the details, and the system didn’t raise any warning flags. Now, after paying an overdraft fee, she double-checks the account number every time she makes a payment. For every 100 small decisions that seem relatively painless, however, there are the big decisions that change lives. This past week, Warren Buffett’s deputy, David Sokol, resigned after it came to light that he made an unwise stock purchase connected to a Berkshire Hathaway deal. Mr. Sokol is a smart guy, otherwise he wouldn’t have held the position he did. But his actions are baffling. He should have known better, and his failure to question the potential consequences of his decisions seems to have cost him his job. In Andrew Ross Sorkin’s DealBook post on the matter, he highlighted a quote by Mr. Buffett that seems appropriate for everyone to remember: “Contemplating any business act, an employee should ask himself whether he would be willing to see it immediately described by an informed and critical reporter on the front page of his local paper, there to be read by his spouse, children and friends.” Simple enough, but it’s advice that’s easy to forget. And sometimes all it takes to avoid trouble is asking just one more question before you make a decision. It turns out that the extra question could keep you from paying an overdraft fee, or perhaps even losing your job.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/buffetts-ruthlessness-is-oddly-absent/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett's Ruthlessness Is Oddly Absent on Sokol<date>April 4, 2011, 9:10 pm</date><text>Mustafa Quraishi/Associated PressWarren E. Buffett said he would refer questions about David L. Sokol back to a written statement. Warren E. Buffett has a favorite saying: “Lose money for my firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.” But as speculation of insider trading swirls around Mr. Buffett’s onetime heir apparent, David L. Sokol, it has to be asked: Why hasn’t Mr. Buffett been ruthless? Mr. Buffett is likely to face a barrage of questions this month at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting in Omaha, often described as “Woodstock for Capitalists.” This year, it could be called “The Great Inquisition.” Every year, Mr. Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, take questions from shareholders and a panel of journalists — including me — in front of 35,000 people for five hours. When Mr. Buffett announced Mr. Sokol’s resignation last week in a detailed announcement, he stated, “If questioned about this matter in the future, I will simply refer the questioner back to this release.” DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink But given the scrutiny that Mr. Sokol’s behavior is now under, it will be hard for Mr. Buffett to dodge the inquiries. Here are some of the questions that deserve answers from Mr. Buffett. ¶In the statement announcing Mr. Sokol’s resignation, you acknowledged that he had made “a passing remark” that he owned shares in Lubrizol in January, two months before Berkshire announced a deal to buy the chemical maker. What, exactly, did he tell you? Do you feel he misled you? If not, why, given your penchant for straight talk, did you not come out later and say, “I should have asked more questions.” If it was only a passing remark, why did you tell Mr. Munger about Mr. Sokol’s investment? Did you tell the rest of Berkshire’s board about Mr. Sokol’s Lubrizol holdings before it voted on the deal? What prompted you to ask Berkshire’s chief financial officer for Mr. Sokol’s trading records just days after announcing the acquisition of Lubrizol? ¶During Mr. Sokol’s interview on CNBC last week, he said, “I guess knowing today what I know, what I would do differently is that I wouldn’t have mentioned it to Warren and just made the investment and left it alone. I think that’s a disservice to Berkshire. But if that’s what people want to do in the future, that’s fine.” Do you believe Mr. Sokol — to whom Citigroup floated the Lubrizol deal in his capacity as officer of Berkshire — had a fiduciary duty to run the idea past you? Or was he free to make a personal investment, without discussing a potential acquisition with you? What is Berkshire’s policy on such trading? Mr. Sokol also compared his investment with one that Mr. Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire and one of your best friends, previously made — that is, buying a 3 percent stake in BYD, the Chinese electric carmaker, before Berkshire took a big share in the company. Was it an apt comparison? ¶You have said that Mr. Sokol did not do anything “unlawful.” But Mr. Sokol bought shares of Lubrizol a day after he told Citigroup to indicate Berkshire’s interest in buying the company. Why don’t you consider that “material” information, a crucial component of insider trading? Do you not believe that a Lubrizol shareholder would have considered such information important to their investment decision? Clearly Lubrizol felt that Mr. Sokol’s inquiry was material enough to hold a board meeting on Jan. 6, one day before Mr. Sokol bought almost $10 million of shares. If Mr. Sokol was aware of Lubrizol’s board meeting, would you consider that material information? And if a news outlet had reported Mr. Sokol’s inquiry or Lubrizol’s decision to meet, do you not think that the price of Lubrizol’s shares would have risen? Here is another way to think about it: If a Citigroup banker had bought shares of Lubrizol at the same time as Mr. Sokol, would you have considered that insider trading? Isn’t that the definition of insider trading? What did Mr. Sokol do that was different? ¶Berkshire has always been a very decentralized institution with only 21 of its 257,000 employees working at headquarters and each subsidiary left to its own devices. “Most of these managers are happiest when they are left alone to run their businesses, and that is customarily just how we leave them,” you recently wrote in the annual letter. This structure might seem like a bastion of efficiency. But given Mr. Sokol’s possible transgressions, do you now think Berkshire needs more compliance programs and people to manage them? ¶In your statement, you said Mr. Sokol “told me that” the trades in Lubrizol “were not a factor in his decision to resign.” Many Buffett watchers, including myself, noticed that you did not unequivocally say that his resignation was unrelated to the trades — just that Mr. Sokol said it was. If you believed Mr. Sokol, why didn’t you just say it was unrelated? And if you didn’t believe Mr. Sokol’s explanation, why did you relay his story? ¶You have long followed the mantra of Dale Carnegie: “Praise by name, criticize by category.” But in recent years, you have been criticized, for example, as being too soft on companies like Moody’s, in which you had invested. You often publicly lambaste certain industries or practices, but rarely specific companies or people. Given your stature in the business world, do you think you have a broader responsibility to call out wrongdoing? ¶Finally, how has this scandal changed your evaluation of potential successors? Do you have a question to ask Mr. Buffett or Mr. Munger at Berkshire’s annual meeting later this month? Please send it to me at arsorkin@nytimes.com. (Also, let me know if I can use your name and if you are a shareholder.)</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/opinion/02nocera.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">From Buffett, Excuses, Excuses, Excuses<date>Published: April 1, 2011</date><text>Whenever the world’s greatest investor gets in a tight squeeze, he straps on his angel wings, readjusts his halo, and leans on his reputation for avuncular straight talk to make the problem go away.Warren Buffett did it in the early-1990s, when one of his holdings at the time, Salomon Brothers, was caught in a Treasury bond scandal. He did it in the mid-2000s, when executives at General Re, owned by Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway, were prosecuted for concocting a phony transaction with A.I.G. Now he’s doing it again as he attempts to gloss over the actions of a close associate that look suspiciously like insider trading. The deputy, David Sokol, resigned earlier this week, claiming he wanted to concentrate on his “philanthropic interests.” (That’s what they all say.) The resignation, said Buffett, came as a “total surprise.” (They all say that, too.) In a statement, Buffett laid out the facts about Sokol’s stock purchases of Lubrizol, a company Berkshire Hathaway agreed to buy two weeks ago. To give Buffett his due, this is decidedly not what chief executives usually do in this circumstance. That’s why the Oracle of Omaha has such a glowing reputation in the first place. But the statement also contains a sentence that only Buffett would have the chutzpah to write: “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful.” Yeah, well, Raj Rajaratnam has said he didn’t do anything unlawful either — and he’s being prosecuted for insider trading. No matter how pure Buffett believes Sokol’s heart is, it shouldn’t prevent the government from investigating this case. either. Yes, it’s possible that there’s an innocent explanation. But based on what we know so far, it smells to high heaven. Let’s recount the story, shall we? On Dec. 13, some investment bankers meet with Sokol to pitch possible acquisitions. He expresses an interest in Lubrizol and tells them to convey his interest to its chief executive, James Hambrick. He then buys 2,300 shares, selling them a week later. (Go figure.) The plot soon thickens. In early January, Sokol goes back into the market and buys 96,000 shares at around $100 apiece. A week later, Sokol calls Hambrick and has a preliminary discussion about a possible deal. Sokol then takes the idea to Buffett, mentioning “in passing” that he owns some Lubrizol stock. Buffett expresses “skepticism” about a deal. Inexplicably, he says nothing about Sokol’s stock holdings. Does Sokol let the matter die there? No. For some reason — what could that be? — he’s got a bee in his bonnet about this deal. On Jan. 25, he has dinner with Hambrick; when he reports back to Buffett about the conversation, Buffett becomes interested in making a deal. By early February, Buffett himself is wooing Hambrick. He tells the Lubrizol chief executive that he would like to buy all the company’s outstanding shares for $135 a share. Sokol, of course, owns a nice little chunk of those outstanding shares. When the deal is announced in mid-March, Buffett’s trusted deputy walks away with a nifty little profit of $3 million or so. Not bad for a few weeks’ work. How is this not, on its face, evidence of insider trading? A guy buys stock in a company and then talks his boss into buying the company. The fact that his boss is Warren Buffett makes it even more “material,” to use the word the S.E.C. favors when it investigates insider trading. If a company executive trades on material information, knowing that he is privy to stock-moving news that hasn’t yet been divulged to other shareholders, he is likely to be committing a crime. When Warren Buffett buys a company, the stock price goes up. Everybody knows that — including, presumably, Dave Sokol. What is galling about Buffett’s stance is not the recitation of facts, but the way they were spun to make Sokol’s actions look benign. “Dave’s purchases were made before he had discussed Lubrizol with me and with no knowledge of how I might react to his idea,” he writes. “In addition, of course, he did not know what Lubrizol’s reaction would be if I developed an interest.” I’m sorry, but that’s ridiculous. Since when do companies turn their backs on Buffett? Besides, Sokol knew that his idea would get a serious hearing; he was so esteemed by Buffett that he was rumored to be the Great Man’s successor. When you strip away the Buffett gloss, the facts are harsh. Sokol (a) brought the deal to Buffett, (b) brokered between Buffett and Hambrick, and (c) persuaded Buffett to pull the trigger. All while owning 96,000 shares he’d bought a few weeks earlier. No one is suggesting that Buffett himself did anything wrong.  But these flimsy excuses are embarrassing.  They damage Buffett’s own reputation, which he cares deeply about.  If he keeps it up, he’s going to have to turn in his angel wings.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/business/01views.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">The Interplay of JPMorgan and AT&amp;T<date>Published: March 31, 2011</date><text>JPMorgan Chase’s record $20 billion financing for AT&amp;T is turning bankers green the world over. With this as the new benchmark for credit-hungry corporate executives, the worry is that banks wind up competing in a game of one-upmanship that leads some to fly solo on riskier deals.Working with just one lender has many merits for borrowers. It has a greater capacity to minimize leaks — an enormous perk when navigating regulatory briar patches like the one AT&amp;T must to win approval for buying T-Mobile. For banks, it means juicy fees and huge bragging rights. It’s going to be difficult for rival banks to meet JPMorgan’s ante. They must have a balance sheet big enough to accommodate so large a single credit without worrying regulators. That probably leaves only Bank of America and Citigroup, both still weak from their excesses in the last boom, given the legal limits on lending. So stepping up on riskier deals would be another way to make a mark. The AT&amp;T loan is about as safe as they come. It’s an investment grade company flush with assets that will generate an estimated $7 billion in cash flow in 2011 after dividends, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Moreover, JPMorgan will soon be joined by a number of other banks interested in taking a slice of the T-Mobile financing. This will create the impression that going it alone isn’t that big a deal. And while joining the syndicate should give banks the first chance on the lucrative refinancing AT&amp;T is sure to start in the bond market, JPMorgan gets the largest share. Moody’s calls the deal a negative since it raises the stakes in an industry that thrives on cutthroat competition. Loans to highly rated companies aren’t too worrisome. That is until bankers, driven by envy and fees, head downscale. Regulators may want to revisit old rules on single-loan limits to nip that possibility in the bud. An Awkward Spot Citigroup is in an uncomfortable spot. Its bankers may have information needed to determine whether the onetime successor to Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway’s chairman and chief executive, had violated securities laws when personally trading in shares of Lubrizol, which Berkshire just acquired for $9 billion. While uncomfortable, this doesn’t have to be damaging territory for Citi. Merger documents detailing events that led to the Lubrizol deal on March 14 show Citi doing what banks are supposed to do: matching hungry buyers with willing sellers. David Sokol, long considered a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, asked Citi bankers last fall to come up with good ideas for “possible transactions” in a variety of industries, including chemicals. Citi delivered: on Dec. 13, its bankers went over a list of 18 companies, including Lubrizol, which Citi had already been advising on “a range of strategic alternatives.” Mr. Sokol found Lubrizol attractive and asked Citi to let the company’s chief executive, James L. Hambrick, know he would be interested in having a discussion. So far, so good for Citi. It got the talks started. On Jan. 6 Lubrizol’s board had an “extensive and thorough discussion” about Berkshire’s interest and hired advisers. Shortly after, Mr. Sokol and Mr. Hambrick spoke, and agreed to meet on Jan. 25, where Mr. Sokol made clear that he would need to hand off discussions to Mr. Buffett, who closed the deal. All this is M.&amp; A. 101. And, arguably, the Citi bankers who advised Lubrizol earned their fees for solving the needs of a client that felt its shares were underappreciated. Trouble is that Mr. Sokol, who says he did nothing wrong, bought shares in Lubrizol the day after the Dec. 13 meeting with Citi at which he effectively kicked things off. He did so again on Jan. 5, Jan. 6 and Jan. 7 —before, during and after Lubrizol’s board meeting. Apart from deciding whether the conversations with Citi made Mr. Sokol an insider, the Securities and Exchange Commission must answer a basic question. Did he know the board was meeting on Jan. 6 when he placed his $10 million trade? Going back to the M.&amp; A. textbook, it wouldn’t have been out of the ordinary for Citi to have mentioned that Lubrizol’s board was meeting. If Citi’s bankers haven’t heard from the S.E.C. yet on this question, they’d better prepare.  For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/pitt-criticizes-sokols-trades/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Pitt Criticizes Sokol's Lubrizol Trades<date>April 1, 2011, 3:29 pm</date><text>Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, weighs in on David L.

Sokol from Berkshire Hathaway. It’s hard to wander around at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute without bumping into people discussing Mr. Sokol’s role in Berkshire’s acquisition of Lubrizol. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Abrupt Exit for a Top Deputy to Warren Buffett On corner couches at the Roosevelt hotel here, or over soft-shell crab and coffee, lawyers were debating the technicalities of Mr. Sokol’s purchases of Lubrizol shares before approaching Warren E. Buffett about buying the company. (This isn’t the first time that breaking news with complex legal angles coincided with the conference. Last year, Robert Khuzami, the Securities and Exchange Commission‘s enforcement director, took to the lectern at the conference minutes before the agency unveiled its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs.) There was much to grapple with: What will be the consequences of Mr. Sokol buying shares before approaching Mr. Buffett, versus doing so after mentioning Lubrizol as an acquisition target? Did Mr. Sokol misappropriate sensitive company information for his own gain? Did Mr. Buffett do anything wrong? In reverse order, the consensus answers seem to be: No, probably not and tough to say. Several lawyers here told DealBook that it would be hard to bring any charges against Mr. Sokol, since he bought the stock and then approached Mr. Buffett without knowing how the Berkshire chief would react. It helps that he wasn’t ultimately in charge of making the decision of whether to pursue a deal. Nor is the revelation likely to derail Berkshire’s Lubrizol purchase, since neither company did anything wrong. One lawyer allowed that it may provide some fuel for plaintiffs’ lawyers looking to sue over the deal, but even that was not a significant threat. But everyone here was unanimous in believing that the facts certainly made Mr. Sokol look bad. Several lawyers also questioned the compliance procedures at Berkshire, given that Mr. Sokol has said that this wasn’t the first time that he bought shares of a company ahead of trying to persuade Mr. Buffett to make a deal.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/sokol-speaks-about-his-surprise-exit/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Sokol Speaks About His Surprise Exit<date>March 31, 2011, 10:56 am</date><text>David L.

Sokol from Berkshire Hathaway. It’s hard to wander around at the Tulane Corporate Law Institute without bumping into people discussing Mr. Sokol’s role in Berkshire’s acquisition of Lubrizol. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Abrupt Exit for a Top Deputy to Warren Buffett On corner couches at the Roosevelt hotel here, or over soft-shell crab and coffee, lawyers were debating the technicalities of Mr. Sokol’s purchases of Lubrizol shares before approaching Warren E. Buffett about buying the company. (This isn’t the first time that breaking news with complex legal angles coincided with the conference. Last year, Robert Khuzami, the Securities and Exchange Commission‘s enforcement director, took to the lectern at the conference minutes before the agency unveiled its lawsuit against Goldman Sachs.) There was much to grapple with: What will be the consequences of Mr. Sokol buying shares before approaching Mr. Buffett, versus doing so after mentioning Lubrizol as an acquisition target? Did Mr. Sokol misappropriate sensitive company information for his own gain? Did Mr. Buffett do anything wrong? In reverse order, the consensus answers seem to be: No, probably not and tough to say. Several lawyers here told DealBook that it would be hard to bring any charges against Mr. Sokol, since he bought the stock and then approached Mr. Buffett without knowing how the Berkshire chief would react. It helps that he wasn’t ultimately in charge of making the decision of whether to pursue a deal. Nor is the revelation likely to derail Berkshire’s Lubrizol purchase, since neither company did anything wrong. One lawyer allowed that it may provide some fuel for plaintiffs’ lawyers looking to sue over the deal, but even that was not a significant threat. But everyone here was unanimous in believing that the facts certainly made Mr. Sokol look bad. Several lawyers also questioned the compliance procedures at Berkshire, given that Mr. Sokol has said that this wasn’t the first time that he bought shares of a company ahead of trying to persuade Mr. Buffett to make a deal.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/sokol-speaks-about-his-surprise-exit/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Sokol Speaks About His Surprise Exit<date>March 31, 2011, 10:56 am</date><text>David L.

Buffett’s letter announcing the resignation of David Sokol from Berkshire Hathaway brings to mind a movie scene in which a police officer yells amid a wild crowd, “There is nothing to see here! Move along.” But there is something to see, and so the policeman’s protestations do nothing. Mr. Sokol’s departure would be significant in and of itself, but of course there are the other facts that Mr. Buffett’s letter details. In December 2010 and January 2011, Mr. Sokol bought Lubrizol stock before the announcement of Berkshire Hathaway’s takeover of the company. Mr. Sokol’s profit on the purchases appears to be about $3.1 million. In the strange case of Mr. Sokol’s resignation, there is also something to witness and the crowd is unlikely to leave. One of Berkshire Hathaway’s top executives, considered a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Buffett, is suddenly departing the company. Mr. Sokol’s value is reflected in the Class A shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which were down nearly 2 percent in midday trading on Thursday, though this may be just a short-term market overreaction. The Financial Times has reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an investigation of Mr. Sokol’s trading, raising the specter of insider-trading charges, although Mr. Buffett’s letter is a careful defense of Sokol’s conduct. Mr. Buffett is likely correct in his belief that Mr. Sokol did nothing unlawful in these purchases. To understand why, take the classic case of insider trading. An executive finds out his or her company has decided to buy another company. The executive goes out and buys the potential target’s shares – or more likely call options because the profit potential is greater – in anticipation of the takeover. When the deal is announced publicly, the executive sells his or her shares or options for a profit. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink This example is clearly insider trading because the executive has used material nonpublic information in breach of his fiduciary duty to the employer to make a profit. Compare this with Mr. Sokol’s actions. Mr. Buffett goes to great pains to explain that Mr. Sokol’s purchases were made before Berkshire Hathaway even decided to negotiate an acquisition of Lubrizol. Mr. Sokol made his first purchase on Dec. 14, shares that he sold just a week later. Then, over three days in early January, he acquired some 96,000 shares. Mr. Sokol gave some preliminary consideration to a Lubrizol acquisition in December, but he did not broach the idea to Mr. Buffett until either Jan. 14 or 15, and Mr. Buffett’s initial response was negative. He decided only to pursue the acquisition after Mr. Sokol met with Lubrizol’s chief executive on Jan. 25. Mr. Buffett in his letter notes that the takeover decision was made by him, Charlie Munger and the Berkshire board, not Mr. Sokol. This is despite the fact that the Lubrizol proxy statement filed with the S.E.C. to allow a shareholder vote on the transaction paints a picture of Lubrizol in full acquisition mode by Jan. 6. Lubrizol had been approached by Mr. Sokol, and its board had decided to engage investment bankers and lawyers to advise them on a possible deal with Berkshire. The proxy makes clear that no decision by Berkshire to make an offer had been made at that point, and Lubrizol had not agreed to be acquired, and no price was even discussed, until a meeting with Mr. Buffett on Feb. 8. The issue of whether Mr. Sokol engaged in insider trading depends on whether he had “material” information when he bought the shares. In the early phase of any transaction, there is always uncertainty regarding whether any agreement can be reached. In Basic Inc. v. Levinson, the Supreme Court said that the test of whether information about a corporate transaction is material is based on the probability-magnitude test, which it described as follows: Generally, in order to assess the probability that the event will occur, a factfinder will need to look to indicia of interest in the transaction at the highest corporate levels . . . To assess the magnitude of the transaction to the issuer of the securities . . . , a factfinder will need to consider such facts as the size of the two corporate entities and of the potential premiums over market value. If no decision has been made for the takeover yet on either side, and Mr. Buffett, who made the initial decision to negotiate for Berkshire Hathaway, wasn’t even aware of the possibility of a deal, then materiality of this information is certainly questionable. It is not knowledge that a takeover will occur, but rather the possibility that a takeover might happen. The more remote the possibility is, the less likely it is material. Mr. Buffett’s statement also notes that he was initially negative on the deal, again reinforcing the notion that there was only a possibility of a takeover, and that this information was not material because it was such an uncertain outcome. Mr. Buffett’s letter and his assertions about no decision being made about a takeover can therefore be viewed as a nice, and likely deliberate, defense for Mr. Sokol that is intended to forestall any S.E.C. investigation. It is also an effort to forestall any future scandal by coming clean on the issues and facts. In the face of questions about the materiality of any information Mr. Sokol had when he bought Lubrizol shares, it is unlikely the S.E.C. will pursue a civil enforcement action against him. Indeed, if Mr. Sokol even thought he was doing wrong he likely would not have traded so openly in these shares – why would he risk his career and wealth for the smaller gains here? That is not a defense to insider trading, but does raise questions about whether the S.E.C. could prove a case in which there is no apparent effort to hide the trading or role in the transaction. But Mr. Sokol’s conduct is unlikely to meet any test of corporate best practices. We don’t know how often Mr. Sokol’s recommendations for a takeover transaction were accepted in other circumstances, although he claimed that it was rare. But by purchasing these shares when he knew that Bershire Hathway might soon be considering a takeover of Lubrizol, Sokol bought himself a free option. If there was no takeover, he could just sell his shares at the market price. If there was a takeover, he would profit to the tune of millions. Mr. Sokol had the ability to handicap the price of the option because he knew how strongly Mr. Buffett valued his advice based on prior decisions about takeover candidates. While this may not be illegal, it appears unseemly. An insider trading charge also requires the person misusing the information breach a fiduciary duty to the source. Berkshire Hathaway’s “Code of Business Conduct and Ethics” states that “A conflict can arise when a Covered Party takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.” Mr. Sokol’s purchase of Lubrizol shares looks to have created such a conflict by calling into question his objectivity, and so could be the basis for showing a breach of fiduciary duty. Yet Mr. Buffett went out of his way to say he did not ask for Mr. Sokol’s resignation, implying that Mr. Buffett did not see the need for Mr. Sokol to leave the company because of these trades. Mr. Buffett states that Mr. Sokol’s resignation was a surprise but it was delivered via a letter from Mr. Sokol’s assistant. It appears odd for Mr. Sokol — who, based on the praise given in Berkshire Hathaway’s most recent letter to shareholders, likely had a warm relationship with Mr. Buffett — to submit his resignation by letter with no warning. Mr. Sokol’s reasons as stated in his letter were “as I have mentioned to you in the past, it is my goal to utilize the time remaining in my career to invest my family’s resources in such a way as to create enduring equity value and hopefully an enterprise which will provide opportunity for my descendents and funding for my philanthropic interests.” Essentially this can be translated into: I want to start a business that I will own. It’s a little different than “I want to spend more time with my family” letters typically seen when executives are forced out, but Mr. Sokol’s language reflects the type of letter submitted when the departure is a hasty one. It is hard not to think that Mr. Buffett, who runs a famously tight operation and is probably the most respected investor in the world, was happy with this situation. He had an executive who, at a minimum, did a dumb thing. People do dumb things and Mr. Sokol is a valuable executive, but in today’s climate any hint of insider trading just doesn’t look good. The mistake may have brought other issues to the forefront and pushed Mr. Sokol to resign. Mr. Buffett has made it clear he will not speak further on the matter. So, this is all unconfirmed speculation that may never be confirmed or disproved. How will Mr. Sokol’s resignation affect the Lubrizol acquisition? The answer likely is not at all, at least to the extent that the takeover will still occur. Berkshire Hathaway has an agreement to acquire Lubrizol that is still in place. The decision to acquire Lubrizol was made by Mr. Buffett, and even if he changed his mind now, he could not back out and likely would not do so for reasons of reputation, even if Berkshire Hathaway could. While Lubrizol may be operated in different ways once it is acquired because of Mr. Sokol’s absence, the acquisition is still on course. Steven M.

Sokol said he thought he did nothing illegal when, as a top lieutenant of Warren E. Buffett, he bought shares of a company while orchestrating Berkshire Hathaway’s acquisition of it. Mr. Buffett agrees. But neither is the ultimate arbiter. The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to formally investigate Mr. Sokol’s purchases of stock in the company, Lubrizol, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. Securities lawyers say rules surrounding insider trading are murky, making it difficult to handicap whether Mr. Sokol could face legal liability. “The decision whether to bring a case against Sokol will turn on a close analysis of the facts,” said Richard L. Scheff, a lawyer at Montgomery, McCracken, Walker &amp; Rhoads. “It will also turn on his state of mind as to why he was trading in Lubrizol when he was.” A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment. Mr. Sokol did not return requests for comment. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Mr. Buffett disclosed the trading in a news release on Wednesday announcing Mr. Sokol’s resignation from Berkshire. Mr. Sokol accumulated about $10 million shares of Lubrizol, a chemical maker, in January, just days before he suggested an acquisition of the company. Two months later, Berkshire agreed to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion. The announcement of the deal increased the value of Mr. Sokol’s stock by $3 million. The news of Mr. Sokol’s trading in Lubrizol comes at time when federal authorities have cracked down on insider trading. The hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam is on trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan in the biggest insider trading case in a generation. Earlier this week, the Justice Department brought criminal charges against a longtime Food and Drug Administration employee, accusing him of trading on confidential drug information. Central to the regulators’ decision to bring a case is whether Mr. Sokol traded stock on material nonpublic information in violation of a duty of trust or confidence owed to the company or its shareholders — the legal definition of insider trading. Did Mr. Sokol trade on information that was nonpublic? In December, Mr. Sokol asked bankers at Citigroup to reach out to Lubrizol about a possible acquisition by Berkshire. Citigroup relayed his interest to the Lubrizol chief executive, who “indicated that he would inform his board of Berkshire’s possible interest,” according to a Lubrizol securities filing. A few weeks later, Mr. Sokol bought about $10 million worth of Lubrizol stock. Securities lawyers say regulators could take the view that such information — that is, investment bankers approaching Lubrizol about a potential deal with Berkshire — was confidential, or nonpublic. Did Mr. Sokol trade on nonpublic information that was material? This is a close call, say legal experts. The Supreme Court recently said that information was material if it would have “significantly altered the total mix of information made available” to a “reasonable investor.” An average investor would probably have viewed the news that Berkshire had approached Lubrizol as relevant in a decision to buy shares in the company. News of potential acquisitions — particularly those by Mr. Buffett — move stocks. But Mr. Sokol, securities lawyers say, has a defense on this point. Even though he bought Lubrizol stock after initiating a potential transaction, the possibility of a deal actually happening was remote. “Dave’s purchases were made before he had discussed Lubrizol with me and with no knowledge of how I might react to his idea,” Mr. Buffett said in his release. “In addition, of course, he did not know what Lubrizol’s reaction would be if I developed an interest.” Mr. Buffett added: “Furthermore, he knew he would have no voice in Berkshire’s decision once he suggested the idea; it would be up to me and Charlie Munger, subject to ratification by the Berkshire board, of which Dave is not a member.” Did Mr. Sokol violate a duty to Berkshire or its shareholders? Mr. Buffett said in his release that he felt that Mr. Sokol’s purchases were in no way unlawful. When Mr. Sokol approached Mr. Buffett about Lubrizol, he said that he owned stock in the company. “It was a passing remark and I did not ask him about the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings,” Mr. Buffett said in his letter. But a regulator could argue that Mr. Sokol had violated his duty to Berkshire by breaching the company’s insider trading policy, said Steven M. Davidoff, a securities law professor and a columnist for The New York Times. Berkshire’s insider trading policy states that executives “who have access to confidential information are not permitted to use or share that information for stock trading purposes or for any other purpose except the conduct of the company’s business. All nonpublic information about the company should be considered confidential information.” Did Mr. Sokol know that his actions were unlawful, or that there was a high likelihood they were unlawful? The legal term scienter — or having knowledge of wrongdoing — is a critical element of any insider trading case. Mr. Sokol said in a TV interview on Thursday that he did not have inside information when he bought the shares. A crucial question on this issue, lawyers say, is whether Mr. Sokol bought Lubrizol stock knowing that he was going to suggest the deal to Mr. Buffett. “I don’t believe that I did anything wrong,” Mr. Sokol said on CNBC. “I can understand the appearance issue, and that’s why we made it public.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/the-perception-of-the-sokol-situation/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">The Perception of the Sokol Situation<date>March 31, 2011, 9:24 am</date><text>Nati Harnik/Associated PressDavid L. Sokol Perception is more important than reality. After watching David L. Sokol on Thursday morning on CNBC as he tried to explain some potentially questionable trades he made in Lubrizol before Berkshire Hathaway bought the company, I was struck by what appeared to be a remarkable lack of appreciation for the way the public would perceive his actions. Mr. Sokol clearly appeared to believe he had not done anything wrong or broken any rules when he bought shares of Lubrizol on Dec. 14, just a day after he instructed Citigroup to set up a meeting on behalf of Berkshire Hathaway to potentially orchestrate an acquisition of the company. I have met Mr. Sokol before, found him to be an honest man and take his word that he thought he had acted completely appropriately. But the facts paint an unattractive picture that creates a public perception problem — even if the reality of the situation is more innocent (I don’t know if it is or isn’t). DealBook Column View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links CNBC Interview With Sokol DealBook: The Abrupt Departure of David Sokol At the time Mr. Sokol personally bought shares of Lubrizol, he had already begun trying to set in motion the gears of an acquisition by instructing Citigroup to put together a meeting with Lubrizol’s chief executive. Mr. Sokol, of course, had no way to know whether Lubrizol would engage in talks or whether Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway’s board would be interested in acquiring the company. But in the court of public opinion that doesn’t matter. His intent was to recommend the deal to Mr. Buffett. And even though he had no control over Mr. Buffett’s ultimate decision, he was one of a select few who were in a position to influence such a transaction. Perhaps most striking, Mr. Sokol said on Thursday morning that if he could do it again, he would have bought shares of Lubrizol but not subsequently suggested that Mr. Buffett buy the company. Putting aside the legality of the trade — and several lawyers I have spoken with believe the S.E.C. will scrutinize this matter seriously — the transactions demonstrate poor judgment. Mr. Buffett once said: “Contemplating any business act, an employee should ask himself whether he would be willing to see it immediately described by an informed and critical reporter on the front page of his local paper, there to be read by his spouse, children and friends.” That is a good rule to live by. 11:27 a.m. | Updated After publishing my column, I received an e-mail asserting that Mr. Sokol “broke the spirit of the law,” and wondering how I could accept his defense. Let me clarify my point. Do I believe that Mr. Sokol thought he hadn’t done anything wrong? Absolutely. Do I also believe that Mr. Sokol is naïve if he doesn’t understand how his trading could be problematic? Absolutely. These two points are not mutually exclusive. If anything, the interview demonstrated that he did seem to understand the spirit of the rules. Perhaps the most troubling part is that Mr. Sokol was out for himself, rather than for Berkshire. If he could have done it again, Mr. Sokol said he would have still bought shares in Lubrizol, but not recommended it as an acquisition target to Mr. Buffett — for which he said Berkshire would have been the loser.

Buffett’s carefully cultivated image risks being tarnished. Warren E. Buffett is an old-school capitalist with a rock star’s aura, a global celebrity who is revered like a small-town hero. Yet that carefully cultivated image — the envy of nearly every top executive — risks being tarnished by a disclosure that he knew one of his right-hand executives had bought shares in a company before Mr. Buffett’s company announced a deal for it. Mr. Buffett is certainly not the typical chief executive, and the questions surrounding him concern an apparent failure to act that had corporate governance experts and analysts scratching their heads on Thursday. The scrutiny stems from a meeting in January, when the deputy, David L. Sokol, approached Mr. Buffett about possibly buying a specialty chemicals manufacturer. During the discussion, Mr. Sokol, once seen as a potential successor to Mr. Buffett, made a brief admission to his boss: he owned stock in the takeover target. At that point, most corporate chieftains would have asked questions, directed the executive to seek legal advice or even put the idea of a deal on ice, experts said. But Mr. Buffett did none of those things — even though his company, Berkshire Hathaway, like most large companies, has policies that restrict employees from using or sharing confidential information for “stock trading purposes.” “It just seems odd to me that it didn’t throw up some red flags,” said Greggory Warren, a senior stock analyst at Morningstar. “As much as they don’t like to have their hands in what managers are doing, there are occasions like this where they have to.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Sokol's Legal Exposure DealBook: Buffett and the Lubrizol Trades Mr. Buffett assumed that Mr. Sokol had held the stock for years, not days, which would make the timing of the deal less suspicious. “It was a passing remark and I did not ask him about the date of his purchase or the extent of his holdings,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement on Wednesday announcing Mr. Sokol’s resignation. Mr. Buffett did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. In the wake of the disclosure, Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, analysts and corporate governance experts called for tighter controls at Berkshire. They questioned Mr. Buffett’s trusting manner, saying he should have pushed Mr. Sokol to disclose the extent of his stake in Lubrizol, the chemicals maker. Morningstar analysts said in a report on Thursday that Mr. Sokol’s Lubrizol trades “tarnish Berkshire’s reputation.” Mr. Sokol acquired a roughly $10 million personal stake in Lubrizol in January, just days before he pitched a takeover of the company to Mr. Buffett. Berkshire agreed in March to buy Lubrizol for $9 billion, earning Mr. Sokol an estimated $3 million profit. Thomas Russo, a partner at investment firm Gardner Russo &amp; Gardner, which owns Berkshire shares valued at some $300 million, said the episode would probably prove to be a wake-up call for the Omaha-based Berkshire. “They will likely have to introduce slightly more controls to eliminate the headline risk we have seen,” he said. “That is a good thing, especially as the operations of Berkshire fall into more hands.” But Berkshire has made no indication that it plans to overhaul its conflict of interest policy or tweak its internal controls. Even so, the questions about Mr. Sokol’s stock ownership already has the company on the defensive. “Neither Dave nor I feel his Lubrizol purchases were in any way unlawful,” Mr. Buffett said in the statement. Charles T. Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and Mr. Buffett’s longtime business partner, also expressed support for Mr. Sokol. “Few people understand how good he is, how really good he is,” Mr. Munger said in an interview. “He’s like a guy on a baseball team that could play six of the nine positions.” Still, in a company with a culture that has long emphasized ethics, the news about Mr. Sokol’s trades may cause waves within Berkshire. In a July 2010 letter, Mr. Buffett instructed his managers to “zealously guard Berkshire’s reputation.” “We can afford to lose money — even a lot of money,” Mr. Buffett said. “But we can’t afford to lose reputation — even a shred of reputation.” Berkshire’s conflict of interest policy requires all directors, chief executives and chief financial officers to “disclose any material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to such a conflict to the chairman of the company’s audit committee.” The company also circulates a list of stocks that executives are not allowed to buy. “I don’t think I did anything inappropriate,” Mr. Sokol told CNBC on Thursday. “I bought stock in a company that I thought was a good company.” The departure of Mr. Sokol also calls into question the future of the company’s management team, shuffling the cast of Berkshire executives who could succeed Mr. Buffett as chief. Although Berkshire has built up a fairly deep bench in recent years, Mr. Sokol was seen as the front-runner. Jay Gelb, an analyst with Barclays Capital, called Mr. Sokol’s resignation an “unfavorable development” for the company’s stock, which was down more than 2 percent on Thursday. “Mr. Buffett may be the only one who can manage the company with as much success as in the past,” Mr. Gelb said in a report. Some rising stars at Berkshire might also hesitate to assume the burden of filling Mr. Buffett’s shoes. Other protégées, analysts say, might be lured away by bigger paydays at hedge funds and the like. Of course, Berkshire pays well, too. Mr. Sokol earned roughly $24 million over the last three years as chairman of MidAmerican Energy, a Berkshire subsidiary. Mr. Buffett, 80, has said he has no immediate plans to retire. Yet the contest to replace him has been among the most watched succession races in corporate history. In a February regulatory filing, Berkshire said its board had identified four Berkshire subsidiary managers who were capable of being chief executive. With Mr. Sokol’s departure, it is now down to three. Mr. Buffett wants to split his role into a few positions: a chief executive spot and two or more top managers who will run Berkshire’s $158 billion investment portfolio. The leading candidate for one of the investment jobs is the company’s current chief investment officer, Todd Combs, a former hedge fund manager. As for the chief executive spot, the new favorite is Ajit Jain, who runs Berkshire’s reinsurance operations. Mr. Jain joined Berkshire in the 1980s, after stints at I.B.M. and McKinsey &amp; Company. Mr. Buffett has been quick on past occasions to heap praise on Mr. Jain. Also in the mix are Tad Montross of General Re, Matthew Rose at Burlington Northern Santa Fe, Tony Nicely of Geico and Greg Abel, chief executive of MidAmerican. The managers are hardly under the thumb of Mr. Buffett, who keeps in touch with his deputies but is famous for writing them a letter every two years. “At Berkshire, managers can focus on running their businesses; they are not subjected to meetings at headquarters nor financing worries nor Wall Street harassment,” Mr. Buffett has said. The managers can “call me when they wish.” That hands-off approach, however, may face pressure to change in the wake of Mr. Sokol’s resignation. Mr. Sokol, before mentioning a potential bid for Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett, had bought 2,300 shares of the company, which he then sold a week later. Mr. Sokol accumulated another 96,060 Lubrizol shares, then worth nearly $10 million, on Jan. 5, 6 and 7. When Mr. Sokol brought the idea to takeover Lubrizol to Mr. Buffett on or around Jan. 14, he mentioned his stake in the company. But it was not until an unspecified day in mid-March, shortly after the deal was announced on March 14, that Mr. Buffett learned the extent of Mr. Sokol’s investment in Lubrizol. The news came not from Mr. Sokol, but Marc Hamburg, senior vice president and chief financial officer at Berkshire. Some corporate governance experts said Mr. Buffett should have pushed for more details. ‘You would expect the people at Berkshire to discuss this explicitly,” said David F. Larcker, an accounting professor and director of the Corporate Governance Research Program at Stanford’s graduate business school. Still, he added that Berkshire should not abandon its “culture of trust” in favor of “endless rules.” “When you’re doing a lot of transactions, every once in a while something is going to be unusual.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/sokol-resigns-from-berkshire-hathaway/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Abrupt Exit for a Top Deputy to Warren Buffett<date>March 30, 2011, 5:36 pm</date><text>Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News David L. Sokol 10:15 p.m. | Updated David L. Sokol has abruptly resigned from Berkshire Hathaway, the company run by the billionaire Warren E. Buffett, raising major questions about the future stewardship of the conglomerate. Mr. Sokol, 54, was long considered to be a leading candidate to take over from Mr. Buffett, now 80. The question of succession has been a concern to Berkshire’s investors and the many avid followers of Mr. Buffett, who has said he has no plans to step aside anytime soon. The company has given few clues about its plan other than to say it has identified four current Berkshire managers who could become the next chief executive. Now that game plan may have to be tweaked. The resignation also raises deeper questions about Mr. Sokol’s stake in a company that Berkshire is acquiring. In a statement on Wednesday announcing the departure, Mr. Buffett said that Mr. Sokol had bought thousands of shares in the company, Lubrizol, a maker of lubricants, two months before Berkshire announced a $9 billion deal for the company. Shares of Lubrizol have risen 27 percent since the deal was announced two weeks ago.

Mr. Sokol could not be reached for comment. The disclosure about Mr. Sokol’s stake in Lubrizol appears to be a rare mark on Berkshire’s squeaky-clean image. Meyer Shields, an analyst who follows Berkshire at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus, said Mr. Sokol’s departure went “deep into the question” of Berkshire’s culture and raised the issue, not addressed in Wednesday’s statement, of whether Mr. Sokol had bought into other companies before a Berkshire acquisition. “This is a company that has spent a lot of energy building its reputation, and as a result it makes it more vulnerable to news like this,” Mr. Shields said. Class A shares of Berkshire fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. Still, regulators have not announced any plans to scrutinize Mr. Sokol’s shares in Lubrizol, and he has not been accused of any wrongdoing. A spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, which investigates allegations of insider trading, declined to comment. Mr. Sokol’s resignation shocked some Berkshire Hathaway employees, according to people at the company who were not authorized to speak publicly. Even Mr. Buffett acknowledged that his statement was “unusual.” The departure immediately recasts the field of candidates in the race to be the next chief executive of Berkshire. Yet there is a bench at Berkshire for Mr. Buffett to draw from. One leading candidate to run Berkshire is Ajit Jain, the head of the company’s reinsurance operations. In his February letter to investors, Mr. Buffett praised a number of other Berkshire managers, including Tad Montross of General Re, Matthew K. Rose at Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Tony Nicely of Geico. In late November, Berkshire hired Todd Combs, manager of a hedge fund in Connecticut, as chief investment officer and a potential successor to Mr. Buffett. (Mr. Buffett has said the plan is to divide the chief executive and investment jobs.) Mr. Combs was hired to oversee a sizable portfolio that would probably grow as he became comfortable with it and Berkshire’s operations. Mr. Buffett praised Mr. Sokol, saying his “contributions have been extraordinary.” Mr. Sokol had run several Berkshire subsidiaries, including MidAmerican Energy and NetJets, which sells fractional ownerships of private jets. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett said that he did not ask for Mr. Sokol’s resignation, which was a “total surprise to me.” Mr. Sokol had twice before mentioned resigning, but Mr. Buffett was able to persuade him to stay, he said. Mr. Buffett said he had spoken with Mr. Sokol the previous day and “received no hint of his intention to resign.” Mr. Sokol’s assistant delivered the resignation letter late Monday. Mr. Buffett said he did not attempt to talk Mr. Sokol out of the decision. Mr. Sokol told Mr. Buffett: “As I have mentioned to you in the past, it is my goal to utilize the time remaining in my career to invest my family’s resources in such a way as to create enduring equity value and hopefully an enterprise which will provide opportunity for my descendants and funding for my philanthropic interests. I have no more detailed plan than this because my obligations from Berkshire Hathaway have been my first and only business priority.” The resignation, however, comes under a cloud of suspicion about the stake in Lubrizol. Mr. Sokol purchased 2,300 shares of Lubrizol on Dec. 14, which he then sold on Dec. 21, according to Mr. Buffett. On Jan. 5, 6 and 7, Mr. Sokol bought 96,060 additional shares, Mr. Buffett’s statement said. It was not until mid-January that Mr. Sokol “brought the idea for purchasing Lubrizol to me,” Mr. Buffett said. “Dave’s purchases were made before he had discussed Lubrizol with me and with no knowledge of how I might react to his idea.” Mr. Buffett added, “Though the offer to purchase was entirely my decision, supported by Berkshire’s board on March 13, it would not have occurred without Dave’s early efforts.” It is unclear whether Mr. Sokol’s resignation and the disclosures about his Lubrizol stake would jeopardize the deal. Mr. Sokol was thought to be spearheading the deal, which is scheduled to close in the third quarter of this year, pending approval by Lubrizol’s shareholders. And some legal experts cast doubt on the possibility that he would face insider trading charges. A former lawyer with the S.E.C., who asked not to be identified in order to preserve business relationships, said that for this case to qualify as insider trading, Mr. Sokol would have to have been in possession of material nonpublic information at the time he bought or sold the stock. He would also have had to breach a duty to his employer, Berkshire Hathaway. In this case, Mr. Sokol made a “passing remark” to Mr. Buffett about his stake in the company in mid-January, when Berkshire was first considering the deal. Although Mr. Sokol’s departure appears linked to the Lubrizol stock purchase, Alice Schroeder, the author of “The Snowball,” the best-selling Buffett biography, noted that Mr. Sokol’s tough management style had antagonized employees. Ms. Schroeder posted an e-mail from Mr. Sokol to employees in which he effectively “threatened to shut down the company if people don’t stop criticizing him,” as she described it.

Buffett, right, drew the rapt attention of his audience in New Delhi on Friday. With him was Ajit Jain, the Indian-born head of Berkshire Hathaway’s reinsurance business. NEW DELHI — The billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett capped off a weeklong visit to India by doing one of the things he does best, after investing — doling out folksy sayings and sensible advice to an appreciative crowd. While Mr. Buffett’s first trip to India comes years, or even decades, after many Western investors and businesses have put down roots in this country, the delay does not seem to have dampened his reception. In recent days, he traveled from the technology hub of Bangalore to New Delhi, meeting with students, politicians, businesspeople and India’s wealthy, and seeming to win new admirers everywhere he went. “The greatest man on the planet,” one audience member yelled Friday, as Mr. Buffett moved to the front of a ballroom in a five-star hotel here. Mr. Buffett has “completely charmed all who thronged to get a word of wisdom,” The Times of India wrote earlier in the week. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, spent Friday night with hundreds of new insurance customers at a town hall-style meeting, where he gave advice on topics as diverse as government bonds (don’t buy them now), parenting (“You start out as your child’s hero and you don’t get a second chance”) and social networking stocks like Facebook (“I wouldn’t buy them, but I wouldn’t short them”). India is among his top four or five investment destinations, he said Friday, and he hinted he was scouting for candidates. “I’ve been dropping my phone number around as I cover the city,” Mr. Buffett said. “I hope someone rings me Monday morning with good news.” Still, he added, “My advice to anyone with a good business is to keep it.” Mr. Buffett’s newfound interest in India is at odds with much of the rest of the world. Foreign direct investment in the country dropped by more than 31 percent in 2010, even as it rose in other emerging markets. Headline-grabbing corruption scandals and the huge Indian tax bill of Vodafone, the British telecommunications company, are scaring investors, analysts say. Still, companies from BMW to Levi Strauss continue to expand in India, hoping to sell products to the country’s growing number of consumers with disposable income. Mr. Buffett’s company recently entered India’s insurance market, albeit tentatively, as an insurance agent. Berkshire Hathaway started selling car insurance policies online in India in a partnership with Bajaj Allianz, the Indian insurance company. Regulations in this country prevent foreign insurers from selling their own policies unless they have become a minority partner in an agreement with a local company. But there are no limits on being an agent. “We’ve been looking at the India space for a long time,” Ajit Jain, the Indian-born head of Berkshire Hathaway’s reinsurance business, said during an interview this week. Online insurance sales are rare here, with most policies handled by a string of in-person visits. Eventually, Berkshire Hathaway hopes to reduce the overall cost of insurance in India by relying on the Internet, Mr. Jain said. Right now, though, it is starting with an investment of just $5 million. “It’s a small step that can serve as a springboard to a giant leap,” he said. Berkshire Hathaway has been mum about how many new customers it has signed on in India, but one representative said the company had “30 times” the number who came to Friday’s meeting with Mr. Buffett. The ballroom where Mr. Buffett spoke holds about 1,000 people. On Friday, it was decorated with giant posters sporting Buffett quotes like “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked” and “Never ask a barber if you need a haircut.” Attendees got gift bags printed with the title “Wit, Wisdom &amp; Warren” and were treated to plenty of all three. At one point, Mr. Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway kept about $10 billion in cash on hand just in case “Ben Bernanke runs off to South America with Lindsay Lohan,” a remark that of course drew laughter. “We have to be prepared for anything.” Earlier Friday, Mr. Buffett, 80, met with India’s prime minister, Manmohan Singh, 78, as well as insurance regulators and planning commissioners. Mr. Buffett did not give details about the conversations but said Friday that he felt Indian markets would continue to open to foreign investment. At least one businessman at Friday’s event paid Mr. Buffett a lofty compliment, noting that his pledge to give away most of his fortune showed he has a “Gandhian approach to wealth.” This was quite possibly the first time the billionaire stock-picker was compared to Mahatma Gandhi. Mr. Buffett proved so popular on Friday that planned handshakes with the audience at the end of the meeting with customers had to be canceled. A throng of mobile phone-wielding men surrounded him, snapping shot after shot of themselves and Mr. Buffett, together in the same frame, frightening his handlers. Instead of mingling with the crowd, the Oracle of Omaha was muscled away backstage, not to be seen again.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/buffetts-first-trip-to-india/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett's First Trip to India<date>March 22, 2011, 10:58 am</date><text>After his trip to South Korea, Warren E.

Buffett in Banglore, India, on Tuesday. NEW DEHLI — Warren E. Buffett’s annual shareholder meeting is legendary, drawing thousands to an event that is considered the Woodstock for capitalists. So as Berkshire Hathaway expands into India, it is fitting that one of its best selling points is an audience with the Oracle of Omaha. Mr. Buffett, who is in India this week with Bill Gates to convince India’s dozens of billionaires to donate their riches to charity, will also hold a gathering for hundreds of the country’s car owners. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The cost of entry: a Berkshire policy. Car owners who purchase insurance through a newly created Web site for the Indian market will be able to attend the meeting. Car insurance in the country typically runs about 2,000 to 10,000 rupees a year, or roughly $44 to $222. In India, Berkshire is selling the policies of another company, Bajaj Allianz, which itself is a joint venture between an Indian business group and the German insurance giant. Berkshire incorporated its Indian unit in the last several weeks. “For the time being and perhaps for sometime, our activities in insurance here will be at the agency level rather than at the underwriting level,” he told reporters in Bangalore on Tuesday, according to Reuters. But the new venture is banking on the Buffett brand. The site heavily emphasizes the billionaire investor’s association with the company, including a prominent profile of Mr. Buffett, which notes he is “probably the most successful investor that the world has ever seen.” Renowned for his financial wisdom and insightful advice, he is today the third richest man in the world. At the heart of Warren Buffett’s business holdings is the legendary Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and automobile insurance is a core business for the Berkshire group. Berkshire Hathaway has not disclosed how many people will attend or how many policies have been sold. But the company has booked the largest room in New Delhi’s Taj Palace Hotel, which holds up to 1,000 people. Mr. Buffett has played the role of insurance salesman before. On the home page of Berkshire Hathaway, a message highlights Geico as a way to save “real money.” Of course, the main focus of the trip is to drum up charitable donations. On Thursday, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Gates, the founder of Microsoft, are to meet with Indian billionaires as part of a broader effort to convince rich people around the world to give away half their wealth. At a press conference afterward, they are to be joined by Melinda Gates, the wife of Mr. Gates, and Azim Premji, a philanthropist and chairman of the Indian technology company Wipro. On Tuesday, Mr. Buffett arrived in Bangalore, India’s technology capital, to visit TaeguTec, a cutting tools company in which Berkshire indirectly has a stake. Speaking to reporters, he said that he would like to invest more in India, but he was hampered from doing so by the country’s limits on foreign investment in insurance. That and other subjects will likely come up in his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom he is supposed to meet later in the week. Mr. Buffett is accompanied on his trip by Ajit Jain, a close adviser and Indian native who heads Berkshire’s reinsurance business.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/buffett-sees-buying-opportunity-in-stricken-japan/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Buffett Sees 'Buying Opportunity' in Stricken Japan<date>March 21, 2011, 5:25 am</date><text>Major Japanese stock indexes plunged last week in days of frantic trading, with the Nikkei 225 stock average ending the week down more than 10 percent. But at least one prominent investor says the market has gotten it wrong. Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and one of the world’s wealthiest investors, told Reuters on Monday that the fall in the market represented a buying opportunity because Japan would bounce back. “It will take some time to rebuild, but it will not change the economic future of Japan,” Mr. Buffett said during a visit to Daegu, South Korea, after which he was to meet with Lee Myung-bak, the South Korean president. “If I owned Japanese stocks, I would certainly not be selling them.” While Japanese markets and businesses were closed on Monday for the Spring Equinox Holiday, investors around the world were closely watching the efforts of the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric Power to end the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Mr. Buffett’s remarks were confirmed by a Daegu official, Bae Young-chul. Mr. Buffet also said he expected the Japanese disasters to affect the world economy for a while, but that the global impact would be limited. “Frequently, something out of the blue like this, an extraordinary event, really creates a buying opportunity,” Reuters quoted him as saying. “I have seen that happen in the United States, I have seen that happen around the world. I don’t think Japan will be an exception.” Mr. Buffett is not alone in his optimism. “I saw lots of buying last week by overseas investors,” said Yoji Takeda, director of Asian equities at RBC Investment (Asia) in Hong Kong. “I tend to agree with Mr. Buffett for the long term,” he said. “I suppose the economy will be weaker over the short term but reconstruction spending will eventually help.” Even without the damage and fear inflicted by the nuclear accident, which followed the earthquake and tsunami, Economy Minister Kaoru Yosano has said the cost of rebuilding the damaged northeastern coast of Honshu, the largest of Japan’s islands, could be more than 20 trillion yen ($247 billion). In a report Monday, the World Bank said it might take Japan as long as five years to rebuild at a cost of up to $235 billion. Already, reconstruction-related businesses are booming. Shares of Daiwa House Industry, Japan’s biggest home construction company, and other builders and contractors have soared since disaster struck on March 11. Mr. Takeda said shares might have been oversold in the market panic last week because of overblown fears about the nuclear plant. “I think the radiation scare is overplayed,” he said. “I’ve heard of people fleeing Tokyo, and that’s too much.” Su-hyun Lee contributed reporting from Seoul.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/will-buffett-deal-spark-a-chemical-reaction/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Will Buffett Deal Create a Chemical Reaction?<date>March 14, 2011, 3:06 pm</date><text>The specialty chemicals business might not seem to be a great candidate for a wave of consolidation right now.

On Monday, he pulled the trigger, agreeing to buy Lubrizol Corporation, a chemical maker specializing in lubricants, for $9 billion in cash. Berkshire will also assume Lubrizol’s $700 million in debt. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release The deal is among the biggest that Berkshire, a serial acquirer whose holdings include the railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the business jet fleet operator NetJets, has ever done. It also answers the question that always arises after Mr. Buffett publishes his missives each year: What will Berkshire buy next with its vast war chest of $38.2 billion in cash and equivalents? In line with Mr. Buffett’s tendency to strike quickly and decisively, Berkshire is offering $135 a share in cash. That represents a 28 percent premium to Lubrizol’s Friday closing price and a roughly 18 percent premium to its highest-ever closing price. Shares in Lubrizol jumped 27.73 percent on Monday, closing at $134.68. “We feel that Berkshire is paying an attractive but reasonable price,” analysts at Hilliard Lyons wrote in a research note. The deal is Berkshire’s fourth-largest on record, trailing the $26 billion acquisition of Burlington Northern, according to Thomson Reuters. In recent years, Mr. Buffett has been increasing Berkshire’s presence in industrials, having previously bought the Israeli metal-working company Iscar and a majority stake in the Pritzker family’s Marmon Holdings. In many ways, Lubrizol fits the Berkshire mold. The maker of lubricant additives is large and generates consistent earnings, with $732 million in profits last year atop $5.4 billion in revenue. Its business is relatively simple, centered on making components for both industrial uses, like automotive lubricants, and household products, like lotions and dishwashing liquid. Mr. Buffett has expressed a keen desire to invest in the United States, with his most recent investor letter promoting the abundance of opportunities at home. But Lubrizol draws about 65 percent of its revenue outside North America. Lubrizol, which is based in Wickliffe, Ohio, has nearly 6,900 employees. Its management has been in place for years as well: Chairman and chief executive, James L. Hambrick, has spent the majority of his career at Lubrizol, joining in the 1970s while still in school. Mr. Buffett has repeatedly emphasized the need for a strong, homegrown leadership team, as he demonstrated in deals like Burlington Northern and MidAmerican Energy Holdings. David L. Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican, was named to the top spot of another Berkshire company, NetJets, and is now regarded as a potential successor to Mr. Buffett. “Lubrizol is exactly the sort of company with which we love to partner — the global leader in several market applications run by a talented C.E.O., James Hambrick,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. “Our only instruction to James — just keep doing for us what you have done so successfully for your shareholders.” Mr. Buffett first expressed interest in Lubrizol in December, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were intended to be private. At the time, the company had not been looking to sell itself, and its directors were surprised by the overtures. Lubrizol’s board began discussing the matter in January. After Berkshire made a firm offer several weeks ago, largely along the terms announced on Monday, negotiations moved quickly and wrapped up in recent days, these people added. The deal is scheduled to close in the third quarter this year, pending approval by Lubrizol’s shareholders. Analysts said on Monday that Mr. Buffett is unlikely to face challengers, given the price and limited cost savings that rivals could realize in an acquisition. Lubrizol was advised by Citigroup and Evercore Partners.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/08/the-berkshire-hathaway-currency/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">The Berkshire Hathaway Currency<date>March 8, 2011, 8:26 am</date><text>Jason Reed/Reuters Warren E. Buffett at a dinner in Washington. Is Berkshire Hathaway a buy? Warren Buffett may think so, at least based on his comments in a recent regulatory filing about his $547.6 million stock-and-cash deal to acquire the part of the Wesco Financial Corporation not already owned by Berkshire. The Oracle of Omaha, in a letter, called the transaction “disadvantageous to Berkshire,” assuming a large number of Wesco shareholders opt for stock. “I believe the prospects for Berkshire shares over the next 10 years to be considerably better than the prospects for Wesco shares considering the economic prospects of the businesses each of the companies own,” Mr. Buffett wrote in a Jan. 21 letter to Carolyn Carlburg, who sits on a special committee for Wesco Financial. The letter, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg News, was released on Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Buffett has long been loath to use Berkshire Hathaway as currency when he thinks the shares are undervalued. In his annual letter last year, he lamented the use of stock in the purchase of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway for $44 billion, saying he enjoyed issuing the shares as much as “prepping for a colonoscopy.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “The reason for our distaste is simple. If we wouldn’t dream of selling Berkshire in its entirety at the current market price, why in the world should we ‘sell’ a significant part of the company at that same inadequate price by issuing our stock in a merger?” Mr. Buffett wrote in the letter. “If an acquirer’s stock is overvalued, it’s a different story: using it as a currency works to the acquirer’s advantage.” He similarly raised a stink last year when Kraft made a play for Cadbury with cash and stock. At the time, Mr. Buffett said he considered Kraft’s shares to be undervalued — and using stock in the acquisition would harm investors. Kraft acquiesced, somewhat, upping the amount of cash in the deal. Indeed, Mr. Buffett’s take on Berkshire as deal currency can be bullish or bearish indicator. The last major all-stock purchase Mr. Buffett made was in 1998, when Berkshire bought General Re. Over the next couple of years, Berkshire’s stock sank. In 2006, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway used $5.1 billion of cash to acquire PacifiCorp. Two years later, Berkshire’s Class A stock peaked at around at around $147,000 a share. It shares have yet to return to those former highs and are currently trading around $127,630.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/buffett-hints-at-next-deal/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Warren Buffett Hints at Next Deal<date>March 2, 2011, 11:24 am</date><text>Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, explains why Berkshire will have more luck buying private businesses than public companies, in this video interview with CNBC’s Becky Quick.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/01/business/01views.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Securing Returns at Berkshire<date>Published: February 28, 2011</date><text> Warren Buffett is finding it ever more difficult to beat the market, and recruiting his potential successors isn’t getting any easier. It might be heresy to suggest imposing a fee structure similar to that of a hedge fund at Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company he runs. But it could be the best way to secure future returns. Mr. Buffett is optimistic about the United States and Berkshire while simultaneously conceding the constraints of his company’s immense size. Consider Berkshire’s cash balance. The $38 billion on the books could easily swell to $60 billion by the end of this year given current cash flows and the expected redemption of some investments made during the crisis in Goldman Sachs and General Electric. Berkshire’s book value per share has underperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index for two consecutive years and four of the last eight. Mr. Buffett’s preferred measure of success probably understates Berkshire’s intrinsic value. But with $158 billion of stock, bond and cash investments, it’s no surprise the company’s performance is slouching toward the market’s performance more regularly, and probably more frequently so in the good times. That could prove daunting to any future leaders of Berkshire. Even if Mr. Buffett, who is now 80, runs the show for another decade, the board needs to plan for alternative outcomes. A new investment manager, Todd Combs, may deliver great things, but has never managed more than $400 million. And while Mr. Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger have accumulated wealth through Berkshire stock, newcomers can’t expect anything as promising. That’s how changing Berkshire’s reward system to something close to a hedge fund’s might help, apart from Mr. Buffett’s misgivings of such structures. If history is any guide, shareholders might still do very well. Had Mr. Buffett accepted an arrangement paying him a 2 percent management fee and 20 percent for investment gains since 1965, there would have been five occasions when Berskhire’s five-year performance lagged the S.&amp; P. 500 index, something that has never actually happened. But over the 45-year span, Berkshire still would have bested the market, net of fees, with a compound return of 14 percent, compared with 11 percent for the index. Or consider a more conservative alternative. Berkshire’s book value per share has improved by an annualized compound rate of 20 percent under Mr. Buffett. Taking a management fee of 1 percent and 10 percent of any returns above the S.&amp; P.’s performance would have reduced the annual return to Berkshire shareholders only to about 18 percent. In his annual letter to shareholders, Mr. Buffett this year recalled how he failed to allocate capital properly in the early days, before “eventually I came to my senses.” Berkshire may need another light-bulb moment about how to use its lucre to ensure its long-term future under a new leader. A Failed Incorporation Incorporation shopping just got the slap in the face that it deserved. The retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch called off a vote on reincorporating in Ohio amid concerns from investors that the state was less friendly to shareholders. Arbitraging corporate domiciles happens infrequently because it’s usually intended to deliver more benefits to managers than to owners. Abercrombie’s reversal should keep the practice rarer still. There’s no question that corporate governance in the United States has its deficiencies. But Delaware has created a formidable legal system where investors feel relatively comfortable that their interests are held in high standing. That’s why the state claims 13 times the number of incorporated companies as the next biggest, Maryland. So it was curious to see Abercrombie try to persuade its shareholders to move its state of incorporation to Ohio. For one, it’s been incorporated in Delaware for decades. What changed? For starters, the rival retailer J. Crew had just succumbed to a controversial management buyout. And it so happens that Ohio’s laws offer managers more leeway to steer the course of a deal, including a buyout, than Delaware’s laws do. Abercrombie naturally said that had nothing to do with its proposal to move. It stated other motives, like reducing taxes. But shareholders didn’t buy it. Rather than face a humiliating defeat, the company called off the vote indefinitely. It’s embarrassing for a company to misread the desires of its shareholders. But if Abercrombie’s experience discourages others with flimsy arguments for incorporation shopping, then some good has come from this.

Buffett. Warren E. Buffett does not put a title on his annual letter. But if he did, this year’s dispatch might be headlined “God Bless the U.S.A.” In the face of persistent worries about the American economy, the country’s most famous — and closely followed — investor struck a patriotic tone in his annual report to shareholders of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, writing that “money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.” Mr. Buffett said Berkshire spent more than $5 billion last year on property and equipment in the United States – more than 90 percent of the company’s total expenditure – and that the overwhelming part of the company’s future investment would be at home. “The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential is far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wonders for over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive and effective,” he wrote. “Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and 1941, America’s best days lie ahead.” Dispensing financial observations in a folksy manner, the yearly dispatch from the 80-year-old Mr. Buffett has become something of a state of the union address for Wall Street and, more broadly, for the global economy. But the letter also serves as an update for Mr. Buffett’s most important constituency – the shareholders in Berkshire, an investment holding company. Mr. Buffett wrote that Berkshire had net income of $13 billion last year, about 61 percent higher than in 2009. The company also reported a 13 percent rise in book value. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which peaked in late 2007 at more than $148,000 apiece, closed Friday at $127,550. They rose about 29 percent in 2010, more than double the performance of the broader stock market. Mr. Buffett also highlighted smaller numbers in trumpeting the thrifty culture at Berkshire, which operates from modest offices in Omaha, Neb. He and his business partner, Charlie Munger, “treat your money as if it were our own,” he wrote to his shareholders. “At Berkshire’s ‘World Headquarters’ our annual rent is $270,212,” he wrote. “Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech equipment – you name it – totals $301,363.” Beyond the flag-waving, the letter provides fodder for investors and business executives who look to Mr. Buffett for sage advice. In a two-page discussion of “intrinsic value” – a favorite security analysis concept of Mr. Buffett’s and his investment hero, Benjamin Graham – he emphasized the importance of having the right chief executive in place. “The difference in outcome can be huge,” Mr. Buffett said. “A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or Montgomery Ward’s C.E.O.’s in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.” Those looking for clear insights into Mr. Buffett’s succession plans, one of Wall Street’s favorite parlor games, will be disappointed. He praised the head of his large insurance business, Ajit Jain (“even kryptonite bounces off Ajit”); lamented the retirement of one potential successor, Lou Simpson (“one of the investment greats”); and praised a new hire, the unheralded hedge fund manager Todd Combs (hopefully “a two-year-old Secretariat”). But there was no specific mention of a succession plan. Mr. Buffett has said that when he dies his job will be split into three positions: a chairman, a chief executive and a chief investment officer. Though his letter was largely free of negativity, Mr. Buffett used the hiring of Mr. Combs – and his relatively modest compensation arrangement – to take a swipe at the hedge fund industry. “The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have received huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their limited partners losing back their earlier gains,” he wrote. Mr. Buffett also mocked fund consultants who “like to require style boxes” — or investment categories — “such as ‘long-short,’ ‘macro,’ ‘international equities.’ At Berkshire our only style box is ‘smart.’” Mr. Buffett addressed one of Berkshire’s most closely watched holdings on Wall Street, the $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs made during the depths of the financial crisis. He explained that Goldman has the right to repurchase his preferred shares, which have sharply increased in value, on 30 days notice. Goldman, he wrote, “has been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will give Goldman the green light before too long.” Mr. Buffett attributed much of the year’s success to his acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, calling it the highlight of 2010. The $26 billion deal, he said, has increased his company’s earnings power by more than 30 percent. But Mr. Buffett also trumpeted the benefits of rail travel beyond profits. “Railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor,” Mr. Buffett said. “Our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil.

Berkshire Hathaway is, perhaps more than anything else, a giant deal machine, and Warren E. Buffett signaled in his latest investor letter that he’s eager to make another big acquisition. So how have his last big deals — the railroad operator Burlington Northern and the manufacturing conglomerate Marmon Holdings — fared? Pretty well. Mr. Buffett singled out Burlington Northern, for which he paid $26 billion last year for the 77.4 percent he didn’t already own, for hefty praise. Here’s how he sees the benefits of owning a majority stake in the railroad operator, which earned $3.6 billion last year, on $15.1 billion in revenue: The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s working out even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal” earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share count by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this transaction have turned out very well. At the time the Burlington Northern deal was announced, Mr. Buffett trumpeted his decision as nothing less than a huge bet on the United States’ economic future (if not also realizing a long-deferred childhood dream of owning a railroad set). It was also his biggest-ever deal, one for which he “stretched to the last nickel.” And given that the Oracle of Omaha still sings the praises of America as a land of economic opportunity, Burlington Northern’s ability to move goods more cheaply than the trucking industry can means that he sees a bright future ahead for the rails: Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means our railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits. Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full share of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better situated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our checks will clear. Then there’s Marmon, a collection of 130 industrial operations created by the Pritzker family five decades ago. Mr. Buffett agreed on Dec. 25, 2007, to buy a majority stake in Marmon for $4.5 billion, as part of the family’s decision to break up its financial empire. So far, Berkshire has done well by the deal: Marmon has posted consecutive gains in annual profit, reporting $813 million in earnings last year on nearly $6 billion in revenue. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink In his letter, Mr. Buffett outlined a timetable by which he planned to take over Marmon. Sometime soon, Berkshire will pay the Pritzkers $1.5 billion to buy an additional 17 percent stake, taking its ownership to 80 percent. And in two or three years — when specifically will be determined by the Pritzkers — Berkshire will own all of Marmon. “Frank Ptak runs Marmon wonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership,” Mr. Buffett wrote. One can only wonder what Berkshire will buy next. Buffett-watchers had largely assumed that Burlington Northern was the “elephant” deal that the company had long sought. But with $38.2 billion in cash and equivalents on hand, Mr. Buffett looks well prepared to embark on another hunting trip. “We’re prepared,” he wrote. “Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.” And for those who need a reminder about Mr. Buffett’s buying criteria, he helpfully provides a list of what he looks for: Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are “turnaround” situations) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt Management in place (we can’t supply it) Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it) An offering price (we don’t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction when price is unknown)</text></article><article index="13" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/long-after-fall-countrywides-mozilo-defended-his-legacy/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Long After Fall, Countrywide's Mozilo Defended His Legacy<date>February 17, 2011, 4:20 pm</date><text>Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink More than two years after Countrywide Financial nearly collapsed under the weight of souring subprime home loans, Angelo R. Mozilo passionately defended the mortgage lender that he founded before a government panel. “Countrywide was one of the greatest companies in the history of this country,” Mr. Mozilo told Congressional examiners in September, more than two years after Bank of America bought the firm during the throes of the financial crisis. That bold declaration was one of many made by Mr. Mozilo in an hourlong interview with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. The private testimony, released recently by the government panel responsible for rooting out the causes of the crisis, depicts an emboldened former chief executive, defiant in the face of criticism that his company fed the mortgage bubble. Mr. Mozilo told the commission he was “proud of what we accomplished.” Regulators have taken a different view of Countrywide’s legacy. In October 2010, Mr. Mozilo agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle federal charges that he misled investors about Countrywide’s risky loan portfolio. The settlement was the largest penalty levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a senior executive of a public company. As part of the deal, Mr. Mozilo, who did not admit or deny wrongdoing, also agreed to forfeit $45 million in “ill-gotten gains.” “Mozilo’s record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite — a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasing risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies, and a deteriorating business model,” Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C. enforcement director, said on Oct. 15. Three weeks earlier, Mr. Mozilo was trumpeting his record. In the interview with commission examiners, he compared Countrywide to Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett. He told the examiners that Countrywide’s stock grew “25,000 percent over 25 years — a much better performance than Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. This is documented.” He is right, to a point. From 1982 to August 2007, Countrywide’s stock price gained nearly 25,000 percent, according to the research firm Thomson Reuters. Berkshire’s investors experienced similarly strong gains over the same period. But Mr. Mozilo failed to acknowledge what came next for shareholders. Countrywide plummeted more than 90 percent, to around $4, in February 2008. At the nudging of government officials, Bank of America bought the lender for $4 billion, or roughly $4.25 a share, in July 2008. Mr. Mozilo lauded the deal, telling the commission that the sale “did not cost the taxpayers a dime” and saved more than 50,000 jobs. Bank of America, however, is still paying for the acquisition. The firm recently paid more than $2.5 billion to buy back troubled Countrywide mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. Repurchase claims by private investors are still outstanding. Mr. Mozilo and his business partner, David Loeb, who died in 2003, started Countrywide in 1969 with $500,000. Within a few decades, the company had transformed itself from a conservative home lender based in New York to the largest mortgage lender in the United States. As of 2006, Countrywide had 800 consumer branches, 54,000 employees and about $200 billion in assets. The company’s ascent began in the early 1990s, soon after government data revealed that lenders were disproportionately rejecting minority borrowers for home loans. Countrywide, seeing an untapped market, moved to offer more loans in low-income and minority communities. Mr. Mozilo described the shift as a “long, uphill battle.” “When I first brought the loans into the office, they said: ‘You’re nuts, you’re crazy, don’t do this. There’s a reason why we’re rejecting these people,’ ” Mr. Mozilo told the commission. The loan officers, he said, “had very static, inflexible guidelines.” So he put the staff through “sensitivity training” and hired more black and Hispanic employees. Countrywide soon started approving one loan for every two applications reviewed, according to Mr. Mozilo. Previously, it had been approving one loan for every four applications. The new loans “did perform,” Mr. Mozilo said. But that performance did not last. In 2006, Mr. Mozilo described some of the company’s riskier loans as “poison,” according to internal Countrywide e-mails released by the S.E.C. in 2009. “In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic” product, Mr. Mozilo wrote in one e-mail. Still, as he saw it, Countrywide was helping to break down the racial and economic barriers to homeownership. This approach “went a long way to avoiding a serious social problem down the line,” Mr. Mozilo, the son of a butcher from the Bronx, said in testimony to the commission. “We wanted to make a difference,” he said, claiming that Countrywide had helped create 250,000 jobs and put 25 million people in homes. “This is an accomplishment of which he is rightfully proud,” Mr. Mozilo’s lawyer, David Siegel, a partner at Irell &amp; Manella in Los Angeles, said in an e-mail on Wednesday. Mr. Siegel said the rapid expansion of credit in the last two decades “was a mission promoted by our government, including by both Republican and Democratic administrations, because it was the right thing to do and smart for our country.” Mr. Mozilo, in the final minutes of his commission testimony, made a similar assertion, saying Countrywide “was one of the most admired companies in America, financial or otherwise,” and claiming that it “probably made more difference in society, in the integrity of our society, than any company in the history of America.”</text></article><article index="14" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/getting-a-glimpse-into-hedge-funds-holdings/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Getting a Glimpse Into Hedge Funds' Holdings<date>February 15, 2011, 7:14 am</date><text>American hedge funds reported their quarterly holdings on Monday, offering the public a rare — albeit delayed — insight into the stocks held by top money managers. The regulatory filings, known as 13Fs, display position level detail of large investors at the end of the fourth quarter of the year. As always, it is a mixed bag. For example, Appaloosa Management remains bullish on financial stocks while Trian Partners is pulling back on the industry. Here is a list of some of the most closely watched money managers and their recent moves, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 13F filings on Feb. 14. SAC Capital Advisors The giant hedge fund run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen increased holdings in a number of companies during the fourth quarter, including Apple. SAC has significantly increased holdings in the 99 Cents Only Stores, from 41,000 shares at the end of the third quarter to roughly 2.3 million by year’s end. Mr. Cohen also nearly quintupled his shares in Berkshire Hathaway, to about 201,000 shares. At the same time, the fund significantly trimmed its holdings in General Electric and Time Warner. Greenlight Capital David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who famously shorted Lehman Brothers before the firm collapsed, opened new positions in his portfolio with shares in Sprint Nextel (60 million shares), BP (3.3 million shares) and the fertilizer company Potash (379,000). He disposed stakes in Ralcorp Holdings and Foster Wheeler. Appaloosa Management David Tepper, whose bet on financials has paid off significantly, made a modest new move into food-related companies, buying more than 10 million of shares of Dean Foods, 300,000-plus shares in Supervalu and more than a hundred thousand in both Safeway and Kroger. Trian Partners Bucking what amounted to a mini-trend in fourth-quarter hedge fund activity, Nelson Peltz shed the financial companies Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp. Mr. Peltz, who pushed the fast food chains Arby’s Restaurant Group and Wendy’s International to merge, opted to buy 1.5 million shares of Kellogg’s.</text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/buffett-closes-out-his-bank-of-america-stake/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Closes Out Its Bank of America Stake<date>February 14, 2011, 7:09 pm</date><text>Lucas Jackson/Reuters Warren E.

But if he did, this year’s dispatch might be headlined “God Bless the U.S.A.” In the face of persistent worries about the American economy, the country’s most famous — and closely followed — investor struck a patriotic tone in his annual report to shareholders of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, writing that “money will always flow toward opportunity, and there is an abundance of that in America.” Mr. Buffett said Berkshire spent more than $5 billion last year on property and equipment in the United States – more than 90 percent of the company’s total expenditure – and that the overwhelming part of the company’s future investment would be at home. “The prophets of doom have overlooked the all-important factor that is certain: Human potential is far from exhausted, and the American system for unleashing that potential – a system that has worked wonders for over two centuries despite frequent interruptions for recessions and even a Civil War – remains alive and effective,” he wrote. “Now, as in 1776, 1861, 1932 and 1941, America’s best days lie ahead.” Dispensing financial observations in a folksy manner, the yearly dispatch from the 80-year-old Mr. Buffett has become something of a state of the union address for Wall Street and, more broadly, for the global economy. But the letter also serves as an update for Mr. Buffett’s most important constituency – the shareholders in Berkshire, an investment holding company. Mr. Buffett wrote that Berkshire had net income of $13 billion last year, about 61 percent higher than in 2009. The company also reported a 13 percent rise in book value. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which peaked in late 2007 at more than $148,000 apiece, closed Friday at $127,550. They rose about 29 percent in 2010, more than double the performance of the broader stock market. Mr. Buffett also highlighted smaller numbers in trumpeting the thrifty culture at Berkshire, which operates from modest offices in Omaha, Neb. He and his business partner, Charlie Munger, “treat your money as if it were our own,” he wrote to his shareholders. “At Berkshire’s ‘World Headquarters’ our annual rent is $270,212,” he wrote. “Moreover, the home-office investment in furniture, art, Coke dispenser, lunch room, high-tech equipment – you name it – totals $301,363.” Beyond the flag-waving, the letter provides fodder for investors and business executives who look to Mr. Buffett for sage advice. In a two-page discussion of “intrinsic value” – a favorite security analysis concept of Mr. Buffett’s and his investment hero, Benjamin Graham – he emphasized the importance of having the right chief executive in place. “The difference in outcome can be huge,” Mr. Buffett said. “A dollar of then-value in the hands of Sears Roebuck’s or Montgomery Ward’s C.E.O.’s in the late 1960s had a far different destiny than did a dollar entrusted to Sam Walton.” Those looking for clear insights into Mr. Buffett’s succession plans, one of Wall Street’s favorite parlor games, will be disappointed. He praised the head of his large insurance business, Ajit Jain (“even kryptonite bounces off Ajit”); lamented the retirement of one potential successor, Lou Simpson (“one of the investment greats”); and praised a new hire, the unheralded hedge fund manager Todd Combs (hopefully “a two-year-old Secretariat”). But there was no specific mention of a succession plan. Mr. Buffett has said that when he dies his job will be split into three positions: a chairman, a chief executive and a chief investment officer. Though his letter was largely free of negativity, Mr. Buffett used the hiring of Mr. Combs – and his relatively modest compensation arrangement – to take a swipe at the hedge fund industry. “The hedge-fund world has witnessed some terrible behavior by general partners who have received huge payouts on the upside and who then, when bad results occurred, have walked away rich, with their limited partners losing back their earlier gains,” he wrote. Mr. Buffett also mocked fund consultants who “like to require style boxes” — or investment categories — “such as ‘long-short,’ ‘macro,’ ‘international equities.’ At Berkshire our only style box is ‘smart.’” Mr. Buffett addressed one of Berkshire’s most closely watched holdings on Wall Street, the $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs made during the depths of the financial crisis. He explained that Goldman has the right to repurchase his preferred shares, which have sharply increased in value, on 30 days notice. Goldman, he wrote, “has been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will give Goldman the green light before too long.” Mr. Buffett attributed much of the year’s success to his acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, calling it the highlight of 2010. The $26 billion deal, he said, has increased his company’s earnings power by more than 30 percent. But Mr. Buffett also trumpeted the benefits of rail travel beyond profits. “Railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor,” Mr. Buffett said. “Our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Berkshire Hathaway annual letter (PDF) Annual report to shareholders DealBook: How Buffett’s Most Recent Big Deals Have Done DealBook: Buffett Finds a Friend, Sometimes, in the Fed He said that the railroad would need to invest in its infrastructure in order to expand its business, and that Berkshire was ready to spend on that. “However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our checks will clear,” he said.

Berkshire Hathaway is, perhaps more than anything else, a giant deal machine, and Warren E. Buffett signaled in his latest investor letter that he’s eager to make another big acquisition. So how have his last big deals — the railroad operator Burlington Northern and the manufacturing conglomerate Marmon Holdings — fared? Pretty well. Mr. Buffett singled out Burlington Northern, for which he paid $26 billion last year for the 77.4 percent he didn’t already own, for hefty praise. Here’s how he sees the benefits of owning a majority stake in the railroad operator, which earned $3.6 billion last year, on $15.1 billion in revenue: The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe, a purchase that’s working out even better than I expected. It now appears that owning this railroad will increase Berkshire’s “normal” earning power by nearly 40% pre-tax and by well over 30% after-tax. Making this purchase increased our share count by 6% and used $22 billion of cash. Since we’ve quickly replenished the cash, the economics of this transaction have turned out very well. At the time the Burlington Northern deal was announced, Mr. Buffett trumpeted his decision as nothing less than a huge bet on the United States’ economic future (if not also realizing a long-deferred childhood dream of owning a railroad set). It was also his biggest-ever deal, one for which he “stretched to the last nickel.” And given that the Oracle of Omaha still sings the praises of America as a land of economic opportunity, Burlington Northern’s ability to move goods more cheaply than the trucking industry can means that he sees a bright future ahead for the rails: Both of us are enthusiastic about BNSF’s future because railroads have major cost and environmental advantages over trucking, their main competitor. Last year BNSF moved each ton of freight it carried a record 500 miles on a single gallon of diesel fuel. That’s three times more fuel-efficient than trucking is, which means our railroad owns an important advantage in operating costs. Concurrently, our country gains because of reduced greenhouse emissions and a much smaller need for imported oil. When traffic travels by rail, society benefits. Over time, the movement of goods in the United States will increase, and BNSF should get its full share of the gain. The railroad will need to invest massively to bring about this growth, but no one is better situated than Berkshire to supply the funds required. However slow the economy, or chaotic the markets, our checks will clear. Then there’s Marmon, a collection of 130 industrial operations created by the Pritzker family five decades ago. Mr. Buffett agreed on Dec. 25, 2007, to buy a majority stake in Marmon for $4.5 billion, as part of the family’s decision to break up its financial empire. So far, Berkshire has done well by the deal: Marmon has posted consecutive gains in annual profit, reporting $813 million in earnings last year on nearly $6 billion in revenue. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink In his letter, Mr. Buffett outlined a timetable by which he planned to take over Marmon. Sometime soon, Berkshire will pay the Pritzkers $1.5 billion to buy an additional 17 percent stake, taking its ownership to 80 percent. And in two or three years — when specifically will be determined by the Pritzkers — Berkshire will own all of Marmon. “Frank Ptak runs Marmon wonderfully, and we look forward to 100% ownership,” Mr. Buffett wrote. One can only wonder what Berkshire will buy next. Buffett-watchers had largely assumed that Burlington Northern was the “elephant” deal that the company had long sought. But with $38.2 billion in cash and equivalents on hand, Mr. Buffett looks well prepared to embark on another hunting trip. “We’re prepared,” he wrote. “Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.” And for those who need a reminder about Mr. Buffett’s buying criteria, he helpfully provides a list of what he looks for: Large purchases (at least $75 million of pre-tax earnings unless the business will fit into one of our existing units) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections are of no interest to us, nor are “turnaround” situations) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing little or no debt Management in place (we can’t supply it) Simple businesses (if there’s lots of technology, we won’t understand it) An offering price (we don’t want to waste our time or that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily, about a transaction when price is unknown)</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/long-after-fall-countrywides-mozilo-defended-his-legacy/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Long After Fall, Countrywide's Mozilo Defended His Legacy<date>February 17, 2011, 4:20 pm</date><text>Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink More than two years after Countrywide Financial nearly collapsed under the weight of souring subprime home loans, Angelo R. Mozilo passionately defended the mortgage lender that he founded before a government panel. “Countrywide was one of the greatest companies in the history of this country,” Mr. Mozilo told Congressional examiners in September, more than two years after Bank of America bought the firm during the throes of the financial crisis. That bold declaration was one of many made by Mr. Mozilo in an hourlong interview with the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. The private testimony, released recently by the government panel responsible for rooting out the causes of the crisis, depicts an emboldened former chief executive, defiant in the face of criticism that his company fed the mortgage bubble. Mr. Mozilo told the commission he was “proud of what we accomplished.” Regulators have taken a different view of Countrywide’s legacy. In October 2010, Mr. Mozilo agreed to pay $22.5 million to settle federal charges that he misled investors about Countrywide’s risky loan portfolio. The settlement was the largest penalty levied by the Securities and Exchange Commission against a senior executive of a public company. As part of the deal, Mr. Mozilo, who did not admit or deny wrongdoing, also agreed to forfeit $45 million in “ill-gotten gains.” “Mozilo’s record penalty is the fitting outcome for a corporate executive who deliberately disregarded his duties to investors by concealing what he saw from inside the executive suite — a looming disaster in which Countrywide was buckling under the weight of increasing risky mortgage underwriting, mounting defaults and delinquencies, and a deteriorating business model,” Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C. enforcement director, said on Oct. 15. Three weeks earlier, Mr. Mozilo was trumpeting his record. In the interview with commission examiners, he compared Countrywide to Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett. He told the examiners that Countrywide’s stock grew “25,000 percent over 25 years — a much better performance than Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway. This is documented.” He is right, to a point. From 1982 to August 2007, Countrywide’s stock price gained nearly 25,000 percent, according to the research firm Thomson Reuters. Berkshire’s investors experienced similarly strong gains over the same period. But Mr. Mozilo failed to acknowledge what came next for shareholders. Countrywide plummeted more than 90 percent, to around $4, in February 2008. At the nudging of government officials, Bank of America bought the lender for $4 billion, or roughly $4.25 a share, in July 2008. Mr. Mozilo lauded the deal, telling the commission that the sale “did not cost the taxpayers a dime” and saved more than 50,000 jobs. Bank of America, however, is still paying for the acquisition. The firm recently paid more than $2.5 billion to buy back troubled Countrywide mortgages from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing finance companies. Repurchase claims by private investors are still outstanding. Mr. Mozilo and his business partner, David Loeb, who died in 2003, started Countrywide in 1969 with $500,000. Within a few decades, the company had transformed itself from a conservative home lender based in New York to the largest mortgage lender in the United States. As of 2006, Countrywide had 800 consumer branches, 54,000 employees and about $200 billion in assets. The company’s ascent began in the early 1990s, soon after government data revealed that lenders were disproportionately rejecting minority borrowers for home loans. Countrywide, seeing an untapped market, moved to offer more loans in low-income and minority communities. Mr. Mozilo described the shift as a “long, uphill battle.” “When I first brought the loans into the office, they said: ‘You’re nuts, you’re crazy, don’t do this. There’s a reason why we’re rejecting these people,’ ” Mr. Mozilo told the commission. The loan officers, he said, “had very static, inflexible guidelines.” So he put the staff through “sensitivity training” and hired more black and Hispanic employees. Countrywide soon started approving one loan for every two applications reviewed, according to Mr. Mozilo. Previously, it had been approving one loan for every four applications. The new loans “did perform,” Mr. Mozilo said. But that performance did not last. In 2006, Mr. Mozilo described some of the company’s riskier loans as “poison,” according to internal Countrywide e-mails released by the S.E.C. in 2009. “In all my years in the business, I have never seen a more toxic” product, Mr. Mozilo wrote in one e-mail. Still, as he saw it, Countrywide was helping to break down the racial and economic barriers to homeownership. This approach “went a long way to avoiding a serious social problem down the line,” Mr. Mozilo, the son of a butcher from the Bronx, said in testimony to the commission. “We wanted to make a difference,” he said, claiming that Countrywide had helped create 250,000 jobs and put 25 million people in homes. “This is an accomplishment of which he is rightfully proud,” Mr. Mozilo’s lawyer, David Siegel, a partner at Irell &amp; Manella in Los Angeles, said in an e-mail on Wednesday. Mr. Siegel said the rapid expansion of credit in the last two decades “was a mission promoted by our government, including by both Republican and Democratic administrations, because it was the right thing to do and smart for our country.” Mr. Mozilo, in the final minutes of his commission testimony, made a similar assertion, saying Countrywide “was one of the most admired companies in America, financial or otherwise,” and claiming that it “probably made more difference in society, in the integrity of our society, than any company in the history of America.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/getting-a-glimpse-into-hedge-funds-holdings/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Getting a Glimpse Into Hedge Funds' Holdings<date>February 15, 2011, 7:14 am</date><text>American hedge funds reported their quarterly holdings on Monday, offering the public a rare — albeit delayed — insight into the stocks held by top money managers. The regulatory filings, known as 13Fs, display position level detail of large investors at the end of the fourth quarter of the year. As always, it is a mixed bag. For example, Appaloosa Management remains bullish on financial stocks while Trian Partners is pulling back on the industry. Here is a list of some of the most closely watched money managers and their recent moves, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 13F filings on Feb. 14. SAC Capital Advisors The giant hedge fund run by the billionaire Steven A. Cohen increased holdings in a number of companies during the fourth quarter, including Apple. SAC has significantly increased holdings in the 99 Cents Only Stores, from 41,000 shares at the end of the third quarter to roughly 2.3 million by year’s end. Mr. Cohen also nearly quintupled his shares in Berkshire Hathaway, to about 201,000 shares. At the same time, the fund significantly trimmed its holdings in General Electric and Time Warner. Greenlight Capital David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager who famously shorted Lehman Brothers before the firm collapsed, opened new positions in his portfolio with shares in Sprint Nextel (60 million shares), BP (3.3 million shares) and the fertilizer company Potash (379,000). He disposed stakes in Ralcorp Holdings and Foster Wheeler. Appaloosa Management David Tepper, whose bet on financials has paid off significantly, made a modest new move into food-related companies, buying more than 10 million of shares of Dean Foods, 300,000-plus shares in Supervalu and more than a hundred thousand in both Safeway and Kroger. Trian Partners Bucking what amounted to a mini-trend in fourth-quarter hedge fund activity, Nelson Peltz shed the financial companies Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp. Mr. Peltz, who pushed the fast food chains Arby’s Restaurant Group and Wendy’s International to merge, opted to buy 1.5 million shares of Kellogg’s.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/14/buffett-closes-out-his-bank-of-america-stake/?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Closes Out Its Bank of America Stake<date>February 14, 2011, 7:09 pm</date><text>Lucas Jackson/Reuters Warren E. Buffett no longer owns stock in Bank of America. Warren E. Buffett‘s investment company, Berkshire Hathaway, sold off its remaining five million shares in Bank of America last quarter, according to regulatory documents filed on Monday. Berkshire bought 8.7 million shares of Bank of America, the largest American lender, in the second quarter of 2007, a move that was reported widely at the time. By the next quarter, Berkshire increased its holdings to 9.1 million shares. Well after Berkshire made its investment, Mr. Buffett said he thought Bank of America paid a “crazy price” to acquire Merrill Lynch in the midst of the financial crisis, according to an interview released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last week. Bank of America bought Merrill for $18.5 billion, a purchase completed in January 2009. The bank agreed to buy the securities firm in September 2008 on the same day that Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.

The stock sales come as Mr. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, moves to split his current role into two jobs: one as head of operations and the other as head of investments.

Buffett, has agreed to buy the remaining shares of Wesco Financial Corporation, one of its largest subsidiaries, for $547.6 million in stock and cash, the companies announced Monday. The ties between the companies run deep. The relationship started in the early 1970s when Berkshire indirectly invested roughly $30 million in Wesco; Berkshire has owned an 80.1 percent share since 1983. Wesco, which is based Pasadena, Calif., is run by Charles T. Munger, Berkshire’s vice chairman and Mr. Buffett’s longtime business partner. In many ways, Wesco is a small version of Berkshire. While it focuses mainly on insurance, Wesco operates other businesses, including a furniture rental company and a steel service center. Mr. Munger, like Mr. Buffett, is known for his folksy investment wisdom, which he doles out at the annual meetings of Berkshire and Wesco and has collected in a book, “Poor Charlie’s Almanack.” “This book is something of a publishing miracle — never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site,” Mr. Buffett wrote of Mr. Munger’s book in his letter to Berkshire shareholders last year. The deal would mean an end to Wesco’s highly anticipated yearly meeting. But Mr. Munger, 87, promises to hold an “Afternoon With Charlie” if the deal is consummated by early June, according to the deal announcement. The event would give investors in both companies a chance to ask him “about business, economics and life,” albeit not about Wesco, the announcement said. The deal has been expected for months. Berkshire announced its plans to buy the remaining 19.9 percent of Wesco’s common stock in September. At the time, Wesco’s board formed a committee of independent directors, which concluded that the purchase was fair and in the best interests of shareholders. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/business/06berkshire.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Berkshire Hathaway Posts 8% Decline in Profit<date>Published: November 5, 2010</date><text>OMAHA (AP) — Berkshire Hathaway posted an 8 percent decline in third-quarter income Friday as a result of losses on its derivatives portfolio, but the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad and many other operating companies performed well.The company, run by Warren E. Buffett, said it earned nearly $3 billion, or $1,814 per Class A share, during the quarter, down from $3.24 billion, or $2,087 a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 21 percent, to $36.3 billion from $29.9 billion. The biggest factor in the decline was a $95 million loss on Berkshire’s derivatives, some of which are tied to equity markets and credit-default swaps. Last year’s third-quarter profit was helped by a mostly unrealized $1.1 billion gain as the value of derivative contracts tied to equity indexes soared. Mr. Buffett has said Berkshire’s operating earnings are a better measure of how the company is performing because those figures exclude the value of derivatives and investment gains or losses. Berkshire, based in Omaha, said its operating earnings rose 36 percent, to $2.8 billion in the quarter, over last year’s $2.06 billion. On that basis, Berkshire earned $1,692 a share, exceeding the $1,676 a share estimated by three analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The Burlington Northern railroad added $706 million, helped by increases in industrial, agricultural and consumer product shipping. The railroad’s revenue grew 22 percent, to $4.4 billion. Berkshire said results at Fruit of the Loom, Iscar tools and Forest River RVs improved.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27views.html?ref=berkshirehathawayinc">Fox-Cablevision Fight Over Fees Carries a Risk<date>Published: October 26, 2010</date><text> Television’s royalty is in the middle of another unsavory tiff. One content king, Rupert Murdoch, is squaring off against a member of the distribution ruling class, Cablevision, led by James Dolan. The cable operator’s 3.1 million New York-area subscribers have lost access to Fox Broadcasting as the two companies tussle over retransmission fees. Such fights are common but the stakes are becoming higher because so much programming can be found online. Each new quarrel gives customers a reason to pull the plug, which would hurt both sides. Cablevision says Fox wants to charge it a little more than twice the $70 million it pays to carry stations that broadcast popular programs like N.F.L. football, “Glee” and “American Idol.” Considering that Cablevision pays $140 million for the MSG channels that the Dolan family controls, the valuation hardly seems unreasonable. But as the one who bills consumers, Cablevision is understandably tiring of being cast as the villain. Mr. Murdoch seemed to be in ideal negotiating position. Fox carries the World Series, and with the Yankees and nearby Phillies apparently coasting to a rematch of last year’s major media market matchup, he figured he had the Dolans over a barrel. Both teams lost over the weekend, however, to far-flung rivals in Texas and California. It might still be un-American not to broadcast the World Series, but advertisers and East Coast fans would be harder to come by considering the teams that are playing. That makes it less likely that Cablevision subscribers will defect to competitors even as they rolled into a second week without access to Fox channels, and the companies took the fight to regulators. But that doesn’t mean Mr. Dolan, who has gone toe to toe before with broadcasters, is off the hook, or that Mr. Murdoch still isn’t overplaying his hand. Not only can viewers get Fox with a simple high-definition antenna, but online TV ventures from Hulu, Netflix, Apple and Google have grown in popularity. Fox even shows programs on Fox.com while Major League Baseball has a cheap, live streaming service. It’s still a big leap for consumers to turn off their cable. But it wasn’t long ago that yanking out a telephone landline also seemed unthinkable. The content and distribution oligarchs need to rule more compassionately lest they find their business models overthrown before long. Being Like Buffett   Only six months to showtime for Todd Combs. Mr. Combs, the hedge fund manager handpicked by Warren Buffett to manage a portion of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment portfolio, arrives as a virtual unknown. But the shareholders who regularly descend on the company’s annual meeting in Omaha will expect that to change by next April’s gathering. By then, Mr. Combs will need to master more than just financial performance. He at least seems to have that aspect of the job under control. At Castle Point Capital Management, Mr. Combs managed just $400 million in his long-short fund, only a fraction of what he eventually will inherit at Berkshire, which has about $100 billion to invest. Still, Mr. Combs in July told investors his fund had gained 28 percent since its November 2005 inception, compared with a 49 percent fall in a financial services sector fund used as a benchmark. Mr. Combs also seems to have something of a handle on the folksy riffs demanded of a value-minded thinker potentially in line to replace Mr. Buffett. In his July letter to investors, Mr. Combs evoked Darwin by pointing out the extinction of all but one of the original Dow Jones industrial average’s early components. Where Mr. Combs remains unproven is in front of a huge crowd. And unlike at most companies, this skill has come to be expected at Berkshire. Mr. Buffett and his octogenarian cohort, Charlie Munger, hold court each year at the annual meeting. At the latest gathering, Mr. Munger said he “would make Paul Volcker look like a sissy” when it came to financial reform. And Mr. Buffett strummed a ukulele while belting out “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad” to commemorate his $26 billion Burlington Northern acquisition. This Vaudevillean patina has helped elevate the billionaires and their values above the fray of greed that plagues others in the same tax bracket. But it’s not a suit that fits everyone. For Mr. Combs, showmanship may be required if he truly wants to become the Oracle of Omaha’s apprentice.

Buffett? That is the suggestion from the folks over at Insider Monkey. Todd Combs, the hedge fund manager Mr. Buffet designated as the heir apparent to manage investments at Berkshire Hathaway, was not the only one apparently considered for the job. As DealBook reported, finding a successor for the position of chief investment officer was not an easy task. Before Mr. Combs emerged, the Chinese hedge fund manager Li Lu was the most discussed candidate for the position. But Mr. Li, who instead decided to remain at his own fund, was said to be only one of several better-known fund managers who decided not to entertain the Berkshire position. According to Insider Monkey, there were two contenders who took themselves out of the race: Mr. Li and “another individual whose identity is kept secret.” So who was this mystery person? The financial blog is betting that it was Mr. Einhorn. Among the reasons for this guess, the publication cites the fact that, like Mr. Buffett, Mr. Einhorn is originally from the Midwest, and that he serves as chairman of Greenlight Re, a reinsurance company (“Right in Warren Buffett’s alley”). Insider Monkey says, however, that Mr. Buffett was probably unable to afford to Mr. Einhorn: Warren Buffett makes less than $500,000 a year, including the fringe benefits such as company-paid around the clock security. So whoever taking over this job is expected to make that or less, or in other words, measly sums compared to the going rate in the hedge fund industry.

BYD will pay 201.2 million yuan ($30 million) for its stake in Tibet Shigatse Zhabuye Lithium High-Tech Co., with Tibet Jinhao Investment Co. taking a 4 percent stake and BYD 18 percent, BYD said in a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Tibet Shigatse Zhabuye Lithium, based in Shigatse, Tibet, is a miner of lithium, boron and salts, it said. It has assets worth 431 million yuan ($64.3 million), the statement said. The acquisition is aimed at improving the competitiveness of BYD’s rechargeable battery business. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, has backing from Mr. Buffett’s MidAmerican Energy Holding, the utility division of the investor’s conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway.

Berkshire said it would offer a combination of cash and its Class B share to acquire the remaining 19.9 percent of Wesco, which is led by Mr. Buffett’s partner and Berkshire’s vice chairman, Charlie Munger. The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it would discuss the deal with Wesco’s independent directors. The proposed terms were not disclosed. More from The Associated Press: Berkshire officials in Omaha, where the 79-year-old Mr. Buffett is based, did not immediately respond to a message. And Mr. Munger did not immediately respond to a message left at his office at Wesco in Pasadena, Calif. On Thursday afternoon, Wesco’s shares were trading up $35.22, at $359.97.

Berkshire Hathaway has sold billions in options since 2004, betting that stock markets would rise over 15 or even 20 years. But a new law requiring most derivatives users to post collateral on trades could diminish potential gains to the point where Mr. Buffett could lose interest in keeping his bet. Options prices have been rising amid concern that Mr. Buffett might buy back the options he sold, traders said. Even if rulemakers water down the financial reform law, banks may push Berkshire Hathaway to post collateral now that it no longer carries pristine triple-A credit ratings. Berkshire Hathaway has prided itself on not putting up collateral on most of its options portfolio, even in 2008 when option values rose, triggering more than $5 billion in paper losses on the contracts he had sold.

Buffett has no immediate plans to retire. Yet the 80-year-old investor is believed to be grooming several possible successors at Berkshire Hathaway, The Wall Street Journal reported. Li Lu, a Chinese hedge-fund manager who was once a student leader of the Tiananmen Square protests, is considered one of the top candidates for filling Mr. Buffett’s shoes. The Journal reported: Mr. Li, 44 years old, has emerged as a leading candidate to run a chunk of Berkshire’s $100 billion portfolio, stemming from a close friendship with Charlie Munger, Berkshire’s 86-year-old vice chairman. In an interview, Mr. Munger revealed that Mr. Li was likely to become one of the top Berkshire investment officials. “In my mind, it’s a foregone conclusion,” Mr. Munger said. Among other possible successors to Mr. Buffett’s legacy is David L. Sokol, chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings at Berkshire and also chairman of NetJets, the private jet company also owned by Berkshire. However, The Journal noted that Mr. Buffett has said that he may split the investment duties from those of the role of chief executive when he steps down. Mr. Sokol has been seen as the contender for the C.E.O. role, while Mr. Li may be in line to fill Mr. Buffett’s shoes in the investing arena, the newspaper said. Mr. Li has already brought some investment ideas to the table. He was responsible for introducing Mr. Munger to BYD Company, a Chinese battery and car maker that Berkshire Hathaway invested in, The Journal said. According to the newspaper, the BYD bet has already generated a six-fold return on Berkshire’s investment. Meanwhile, Mr. Li’s own investment performance hasn’t been too shabby either. His hedge funds have posted a 26.4 percent annualized return since 1998, The Journal reported.

International Dairy Queen, the ice-cream company owned by the billionaire investor’s Berkshire Hathaway, has asked a court to stop a southern California rival from selling a frozen yogurt with a name similar to Blizzard, its biggest-seller, Reuters reported. Yogubliz had on May 17 filed a lawsuit seeking an order that would “eliminate any doubt” its sale of Blizzberry and Blizz Frozen Yogurt products did not infringe any Dairy Queen trademark and was not likely to confuse customers. The Downey, Calif.-based company said it sued after receiving a letter from Dairy Queen lawyers threatening litigation if it did not stop using “Blizz” and surrender its “Blizzberry” trademark, effectively putting it “out of business.” But in a 30-page response filed Monday in Los Angeles federal court, Dairy Queen said Yogubliz was causing confusion with the Blizzard, a soft-serve ice cream also blended with candy, cookie pieces and other mix-ins.

Buffett. The total bill for dining with him is a record $2,626,311. The bidding turned fast and furious in the last half-hour of an annual charity auction on eBay for lunch with Mr. Buffett, as more than a dozen bids pushed the final price up from $1.9 million. The winning bid exceeds the previous record of $2.11 million in the 2008 auction and it is well above last year’s luncheon tab of $1.68 million. So far, the winning bidder has not been identified. The winning bidder, and up to seven other people, will dine with Mr. Buffett at Smith &amp; Wollensky, a leading Manhattan steakhouse. All told, the auction attracted 77 bids since it began on Sunday with a $25,000 minimum bid. One bidder was observed on Friday as regularly topping the high bids by $100, but it is yet not known whether this person was the winning bidder. The proceeds from the auction will go to the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit organization that offers meals and assistance to the poor and homeless. The previous record bid for lunch with Mr. Buffett was made in 2008 by a Chinese investment fund manager, Zhao Danyang. Last year, a Canadian wealth management firm, Salida Capital, won the blue-plate special. Mr. Buffett is the third-richest person in the world, with a $47 billion fortune that he built up at Berkshire Hathaway, his insurance and investment company. So it seems appropriate that eBay would say this auctioned item comes with free shipping — of Mr. Buffett, we suppose.

Buffet now exceeds $1.9 million with just over half an hour to go in the auction. There is still time to bid on lunch with the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett, but it will certainly be a pricey meal. By 4 p.m. Eastern time on Friday, the bidding in the annual charity auction for a chance to dine with Mr. Buffett had reached $1,500,100. Last year, the auction drew a winning bid of $1.68 million for lunch with Mr. Buffett and it drew a record bid of $2.11 million in 2008. So far, there have been 62 bids since the auction on eBay began on Sunday. The bidding closes at 10:30 on Friday night. The winning bidder, and up to seven other people, will be able to dine with Mr. Buffett at Smith &amp; Wollensky, a top Manhattan steakhouse. The proceeds from the auction will go to the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit organization that offers meals and assistance for the poor and homeless. Mr. Buffett amassed a $47 billion fortune, the third-largest in the world, through Berkshire Hathaway, his insurance and investment company. For at least $1.5 million, you can ask him how to become really rich — and enjoy a steak as well.

Buffett in an annual charity auction, pushing the bidding at this point far ahead of last year’s level, Reuters reports. The auction on eBay for lunch with Mr. Buffett generated 40 bids as of 5:20 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, with the highest bid rising from $200,100 on Tuesday and $51,000 on Monday. The names of bidders are being kept confidential by eBay, which began the auction on Sunday night. The auction ends on Friday at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. More from Reuters: Proceeds from Mr. Buffett’s auction will benefit the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit organization that offers meals, healthcare, child care, housing and job training for the poor and homeless. Mr. Buffett’s 10 prior annual auctions for Glide have raised more than $5.9 million, including a record $2,110,100 in 2008 and $1,680,300 last year. Bids typically soar in the last hour or two of Mr. Buffett’s auctions. Last year, the top bid had reached just $456,789, with fewer than 12 hours remaining before the auction ended. This year’s winning bidder and up to seven others will eat a steak lunch with the 79-year-old Mr. Buffett on a date to be agreed at the Smith &amp; Wollensky steakhouse in New York. Mr. Buffett built an estimated $47 billion fortune through Berkshire Hathaway, his insurance and investment company. In 2006, he pledged most of his wealth to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities.

Buffett always tries to make sure that anyone who’s willing to make a seven-figure donation just to have lunch with the billionaire investor gets their money’s worth, so the meals often last more than three hours. So far, so good. ”Nobody’s asked for their money back,” Mr. Buffett told The Associated Press. The Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive said he hopes the annual lunch auction will again draw multimillion-dollar bids to benefit the Glide Foundation, which provides social services to the poor and homeless in San Francisco. But that’s hard to predict, especially with more international interest — three of the past four winners came from outside the United States. ”Some of these people I’d never heard of before they made the bid,” Mr. Buffett told the news service. This year’s auction kicked off Sunday evening with a $25,000 minimum bid on eBay, but the final price of the meal won’t be set until the auction closes Friday at 9:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time. The date of the lunch will be determined later, once the winner is known and agrees with Mr. Buffett on a time. As of early Monday morning, no bids had been submitted. The owners of the Smith and Wollensky restaurant in New York contributed $10,000 to Glide and will again host the lunch. The “power lunch” is billed as “the chance of a lifetime to experience first hand the one-and-only Warren Buffett.” “He is, quite simply, a legend, and he will sit down with you and up to seven of your friends for lunch,” the description on eBay reads. Last year, Canadian investment firm Salida Capital paid $1.68 million to dine with Mr. Buffett. And that price represented a discount over the record $2.11 million a Chinese investment fund manager paid in 2008, which was the most expensive charity item eBay had ever sold.

Buffett and regain a key credit rating. Swiss Re, which had to take a costly convertible loan from Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway last year after bets on risky assets backfired, said its excess capital rose to more than $12 billion, improving its chances of recapturing its coveted AA credit rating and repaying Mr. Buffett. “This level of excess capital gives us increased confidence that we can regain the AA rating,” Swiss Re’s chief financial officer, George Quinn, said. “We’ll also be able to redeem the Berkshire Hathaway investment and still retain a very significant buffer above the minimum level required for AA.” Shares in Swiss Re traded 5.5 percent higher in early morning trading, outperforming a 0.7 percent rise in the STOXX 600 European insurance index, which was held back by a 2.7 percent fall in Axa after Europe’s second-largest insurer gave disappointing first-quarter numbers.
