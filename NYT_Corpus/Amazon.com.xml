Speaking at Barnes &amp; Noble’s store in Manhattan’s Union Square, William Lynch, the company’s chief executive, set the new Nook directly up against Amazon’s recently released Kindle Fire, promoting what he described as the Nook’s advantages in memory and multimedia capability. “The Kindle Fire, and they do a lot of things well, is a vending machine for Amazon services,” Mr. Lynch said. “We’re going to partner with the world’s most popular music services. We’re going to let the consumers choose.” The new tablet, which is lighter and faster than other Nook devices, offers access to popular apps including Netflix, Hulu Plus and Pandora. The unveiling of the new tablet set up what is sure to be a heated competition between Barnes &amp; Noble, Amazon and Apple, maker of the iPad, for the quickly expanding group of consumers who will shop for color tablets this holiday season. Amazon’s Kindle Fire retails for $199 and will start shipping next Monday. Barnes &amp; Noble executives emphasized that its devices have no ads that interrupt the reading experience. That provides an advantage over other e-readers and tablets that do have advertising, said Michael Norris, a senior analyst with Simba Information, which provides research and advice to publishers. “We’ve done research, and the ads are considered annoying, irritating and obtrusive,” Mr. Norris said after watching Barnes &amp; Noble’s presentation. Barnes &amp; Noble also revealed an expanded display area for Nook devices in the back of its Union Square store. “It’s the same kind of experience as Apple,” said Leonard Riggio, the chairman of Barnes &amp; Noble, as he stood in the display area after the news conference. “It makes the product and category much more important.” Barnes &amp; Noble’s revenues for its Nook devices will reach $1.8 billion this year, Mr. Lynch said.</text></article>

His sketches are archived on the Bucks blog and on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com. Initial public offerings get a lot of coverage, and why not? Everyone loves the idea of taking hard-earned money and using it to gamble in the hope that they’ll end up owning the next Amazon or Google and not Pets.com or Demand Media. What often gets lost when we get all excited about a hot new I.P.O. is the pesky fact that most of the time buying an I.P.O. is a great way to lose money. Wall Street Roulette BusinessWeek did a little math on the 25 hottest offerings of 2010 and 2011. The results don’t look so good. There’s a lot of red: after the initial “pop” — the jump from the offering price to the open — 20 of those 25 tanked. Many have fallen 50 percent from their first day opening price in the stock market (one high-profile example: Demand Media, down 68 percent since its January debut), a few more than 80 percent. But those were just the “hot” offerings of the last two years. What about the rest of the I.P.O.’s? What happened to their prices after that first day of trading? The total for all 333 I.P.O.’s from 2010/11 for which Bloomberg has data is minus 11.1 percent. The Odds Aren’t in Your Favor And in case there is any doubt, almost every study I can find on the performance of I.P.O.’s shows the same thing: Looking at 1,006 I.P.O.’s that raised at least $20 million from 1988 to 1993, Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor, showed that the median I.P.O. underperformed the Russell 3000 by 30 percent in the three years after going public. The same analysis showed that 46 percent of I.P.O.’s produced negative returns. Another study focused on I.P.O.’s issued in 1993 and their performance through mid-October 1998. The average I.P.O. returned just one third as much as the S&amp;P 500 Index. Over half traded below their offering price and one third went down more than 50 percent. A study by what was then U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray looked at 4,900 I.P.O.’s from May 1988 to July 1998. By July 1998, less than one third of the new issues were above their initial offering. Even more startling, almost a third were no longer traded (that is, they went bankrupt, got acquired or were no longer traded on an active market). Of 1,232 I.P.O.’s issued from 1988 to 1995, 25 percent closed on the first day of trading below the initial offer price. Adding insult to injury, “extra hot” I.P.O.’s, the ones that rose 60 percent or more on their opening day, performed the worst over the long term and underperformed the market by 2 to 3 percent a month during the next year. So the math says it’s a bad idea — but we keep doing it. Maybe it is the word “hot” that gets us excited. Groupon sure is “hot”: “That was some concerns before the road show,” said David Schwartz, a fund manager for DAZ Capital. “But I’ve been in this business since 1986, and I can tell you when a deal is really hot and this is a hot deal.” Winning the Lottery I remember standing in a long line in 2006 for an open house for a new Toll Brothers community being built in Las Vegas. The person in front of me and the one behind me were both real estate agents on the phone with what I assume were clients, imploring them to get down there right now because this “deal was HOT!” Hot is not a word that you should use when you’re considering investing your hard-earned money. Can you imagine Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger getting all “hot” about their next deal? In fact, I can think of nothing “hot” about investing correctly. Of course, there are I.P.O.’s that do well. Think of all the money you would have made if you had just invested in Amazon or Google at the I.P.O. price. Those instances seem to happen frequently enough for us to ignore the fact that the odds are against us. Sounds a bit like the lottery. Normally when you invest money, you actually need it for rather important things like sending your children to college. So you do at least a little research. I.P.O.’s in general are hard to research, and Groupon has been no exception. You have the chief executive, Andrew Mason, saying things like, “With a market measured not in billions but in trillions of dollars, we’re just getting started.” And on the other hand, you have a new company in an industry it almost invented, with no profits. Sounds like a tossup to me. There is nothing wrong with using money to gamble on a tossup. Who knows, you may be right. Just do everyone a favor and stop pretending that it’s an investment. It’s a lottery.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/for-amazon-prime-readers-a-lending-library/?ref=amazoninc">For Amazon Prime Readers, a Lending Library<date>November 3, 2011, 9:29 am</date><text>With less than two weeks to go before the new Kindle is in the hands of the masses, Amazon is aiming to stoke sales with more benefits. Wednesday night it announced a new program that loans eligible customers a free e-book every month. The program, the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library, is open to Kindle users who are also members of Amazon Prime, the $79-a-year fast shipping and video-streaming service. Customers can keep a selection for as long as they want but it will disappear if they choose another book the next month. Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg NewsJeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, with the Kindle Fire, which goes on sale later this month. Amazon touts “over 100 current and former New York Times best-sellers,” but a quick check of the 20 top Times sellers listed in Amazon’s Kindle Store show none in the lending library. Traditional publishers are obviously leery of this program. The full list of 5,156 available titles, sorted by their best-selling status, begins with Suzanne Collins’s popular “Hunger Games” and includes efforts by Anthony Bourdain and Michael Lewis, along with a host of volumes that may be familiar only to ardent Kindle readers: “Dixie Divas” by Virginia Brown, “101 Ways to Find a Ghost” by Melissa Martin Ellis, and “Already Gone” by John Rector. Amazon was rumored to be starting an all-you-can-eat program that would allow Prime subscribers an unlimited number of e-books for a set fee, but that seems delayed at best as the retailer tries to overcome publishers’ reluctance. Recently,  Amazon allowed libraries to begin lending e-books readable on the Kindle.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/amazon-lights-the-fire-with-free-books/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Lights the Fire With Free Books<date>November 3, 2011, 1:19 pm</date><text>Today, Amazon unveiled something radical: the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. You get to download one Kindle book a month, with no due dates, free, if you’re an Amazon Prime member and a Kindle owner. O.K., whoa. Emile Wamsteker/Bloomberg NewsJeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, with the Kindle Fire. The Fire goes on sale later this month. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample First of all, Amazon Prime used to be a free-shipping service. You pay $80 a year, and you get two-day free shipping on anything you buy from Amazon. It was fine, I guess, for people who bought enough stuff from Amazon to make it worth the fee. But then something really weird happened. Amazon decided to compete with Netflix’s movie-streaming service. It started licensing more and more movies and TV shows — now 13,000 of them, which is rapidly approaching Netflix’s library size. The price? Free, if you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber. What does free shipping have to do with streaming movies? Beats me. But it must have been a delightful surprise to people who’d signed up for Prime. And now this. Free books, including New York Times bestsellers, for the Kindle. If you’re an Amazon Prime member. Free shipping, free movies, free books, for $80 a year. What, exactly, is Amazon up to? There has to be some master plan, because Amazon is spending itself silly to pull this off. Because the offer is limited to owners of Kindles — it doesn’t work if you use the Kindle service on an iPad, for instance — it is intended to sell more Kindles. Obviously, the notoriously e-terrified book publishers wouldn’t sign off on Amazon’s free-book deal without a lot of reassurance — and a lot of payments. And sure enough, Amazon says that these free Kindle books aren’t really free. It’s paying publishers for the right to distribute them. “Titles in the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library come from a range of publishers under a variety of terms,” Amazon says. “For the vast majority of titles, Amazon has reached agreement with publishers to include titles for a fixed fee. In some cases, Amazon is purchasing a title each time it is borrowed by a reader under standard wholesale terms as a no-risk trial to demonstrate to publishers the incremental growth and revenue opportunity that this new service presents.” Wow. Amazon is actually buying e-books to give you for free. Wait, this reminds me of something — I’ve heard this business plan before. Oh, right, I know. It’s what Amazon is doing with its new iPad rival, the Kindle Fire. (It comes out later this month, and yes, I’ll review it soon.) The Kindle Fire has all kinds of interesting features; it’s basically a tablet for consuming all things Amazon: books, music, TV, movies. But the best feature by far is the shockingly low price: $200. It’s 80 percent of an iPad, for 40 percent of the price. Look, we know what tablets cost, no matter what electronics company makes them: $500 and up. Amazon must be selling the Fire at a loss, to get more people to buy books, music, TV and movies. They’re giving away the razors and selling a lot more blades. It’d be fascinating to see the spreadsheet for this plan, wouldn’t it? It reminds me of when Microsoft killed Netscape Navigator in the early days of the Web by whipping up a rival Web browser, Internet Explorer, and giving it away for free. A loss leader in a big, digital way. The difference is that nobody seems to mind that Amazon’s taking a page out of that playbook: using its substantial cash flow to give customers free stuff, in hopes of generating even more cash flow. Microsoft was seen as evil and manipulative at the time — but so far, Amazon still seems like a good, well-loved company. It hasn’t become a player in the religious wars that rage between fans of Apple, Google and Microsoft. And it hasn’t self-destructed through baffling corporate shenanigans like Netflix. Now, the Amazon Kindle Library doesn’t have all the books in the world, of course. It’s starting out with only 5,000 titles, although there’s a lot of good stuff there: The “Hunger Games” trilogy, “Fast Food Nation,” “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” “Moneyball,” “Liar’s Poker,” “Kitchen Confidential,” “Water for Elephants,” and so on. You can have one book at a time. All of your notes and bookmarks are saved in case you ever buy the book or borrow it again. Crazy, no? I’m not sure what free shipping has to do with free movies and now free books. I’m not sure why more people aren’t skeptical of a huge corporation giving stuff away; there’s a “too good to be true” aspect to it. But I do know this: Amazon Prime is looking like a better deal every day. Darned near irresistible, in fact. And I also know this: Amazon is thinking outside the business-school box. Way outside. And you gotta love anyone who comes along to shake things up.</text></article>

Whoops. Moments after the retailer reported Tuesday that operating income for the quarter had fallen 71 percent from 2010, the high-flying stock sank $25 in after-hours trading. Add the $10 that Amazon had lost before the earnings report, and its market cap shriveled in one day by about $16 billion. If the past was weak, Amazon was cautious about the future, too. Despite the new Kindle Fire tablet's selling so well that it was already increasing production, Amazon said it might lose as much as $200 million in the fourth quarter. ''There are times when investors shoot first and ask questions later,'' said Scott Devitt, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. He remains a believer. ''Does the company still have a strong ability to grow? I think the answer is yes.'' Revenue for the third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, came in largely on target. As customers swarmed to boxes of dried cherries, ''Pirates of the Caribbean,'' downloads of the Sims video games, diagnostic code readers for cars and the latest ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' -- all Amazon best sellers in their categories -- sales rose 44 percent to $10.88 billion. Amazon has been stressing recently, as it has so often over its 16-year history, that it is investing for the future, not seeking immediate profit. With revenue rising about 40 percent each quarter, it simply needs more capacity. In a highly competitive and fragile retailing environment, that is an enviable problem to have. This year, Amazon is adding 17 warehouses to the 52 it already has. It is rapidly expanding its data centers as it develops its Web storage business. And every $199 Fire Amazon sells will be at a loss -- another drag on income. The profit will come later, the company hopes, as Fire owners buy videos, music and e-books. When Amazon executives ''think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the totality,'' Tom Szkutak, the chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. Three months ago, the company said third-quarter operating income would be down as much as 93 percent. That worst-case situation did not come to pass. But Wall Street, which pushed the stock to a new high this month, was overly optimistic. Thirty-one analysts estimated an average revenue of $10.93 billion for the quarter, with earnings per share of 24 cents, according to Yahoo Finance. The actual results were 14 cents a share. In the third quarter of 2010, Amazon earned 51 cents a share. The fourth quarter will be the subject of intense interest as analysts try to gauge how the Fire is selling. It generally got rave reviews in its late September introduction as the first viable competitor to Apple's iPad. Amazon's chief executive, Jeffrey A. Bezos, said as part of the earnings release that, ''based on what we're seeing with Kindle Fire preorders, we're increasing capacity and building millions more than we'd already planned.'' Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital is estimating that Amazon will sell 21 million Kindle devices next year, including the stripped down e-reader, the Fire and a new tablet with a bigger screen. Kindle sales have been a guessing game ever since their introduction four years ago. Amazon declines to release numbers. Amazon's torrid growth more than 15 years after its founding makes it an object of envy and fear across the retail world. Viewed from a public relations point of view, however, it has been having a difficult time recently. First came the lengthy fight with the state of California over whether Amazon would collect sales tax. Even more damaging was a long article in The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa. It revealed that workers in Amazon's local warehouse were collapsing from heat stress as they struggled to ship books and CDs so quickly that the customers would never even consider going to a land-based store. It was a striking snapshot of the underbelly of the Internet economy: Amazon arranged with the local ambulance service to have vehicles stationed outside the warehouse on peak heat days. As workers fell down on the job, they were whisked away to the hospital, the newspaper said. Cetronia Ambulance Corps confirmed The Call's reporting and then stopped talking. Amazon declined to answer questions but has not succeeded in putting the matter behind it. This week, Amazon posted a note on its site revealing that there were ''multiple'' temperature problems at the warehouse -- ''low temperature events'' as well as ''high temperature events.'' The note was not completely clear, but it seems that workers in wintertime left the building during fire alarms and then were not immediately let back in. The retailer said it had ''a new set of procedures'' for the winter and had installed air-conditioning for the summer. ''It's safer to work in the Amazon fulfillment network than in a department store,'' it said, citing government survey data on nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses. Amazon's relentlessness has made it a very successful company. But some in the tech world are beginning to wonder if there is a point at which you can become too driven, even if it is supposedly in the service of your customers. As Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land wrote in an open letter to Mr. Bezos at the height of the tax controversy: ''Don't make me hate you.'' Paul Saffo, an expert on Silicon Valley culture, says that traditional companies are owned by their shareholders but digital companies are in effect owned by their customers. Apple is the most celebrated example of this passion, but Amazon also evokes strong feelings. People shop there because they like what it stands for, or what they think it stands for. ''Amazon is not just a place you buy stuff,'' Mr. Saffo said. ''You have an emotional attachment to it. So if Amazon thinks things like collecting taxes and how it treats its warehouse workers are not an issue for their customers, they're in for a surprise.''

Who Will Occupy Main Street?<date>October 26, 2011, 7:00 am</date><text>Thinking Entrepreneur An owner’s dispatches from the front lines. Lots of people enjoy saving money by shopping online. The prices are often lower, and in many cases there is no sales tax and little or no shipping charge. But while free market forces prevail, there are growing problems with the after-effects of this market shift to Internet sales. It is becoming commonplace for customers to go into a store, examine a product, get educated by a sales clerk, and go home to order the product online. Instead of feeling bad for taking the time of someone who is trying to make a living, many people feel righteous about it. They say things like, “I’m not going to get ripped off.” Or they simply don’t think about it at all. I have a friend who owns a shoe store, and he tells me that people come in all of the time, try on some shoes, spend half an hour with a member of the sales staff, and when they have made a choice they announce that they are going to order the shoes online — as if it is something to boast about. Boasting to your friends is one thing; boasting to someone who has just spent time trying to help you is rude at best. Wasting a sales representative’s time with no intention of buying is a problem that goes back hundreds or thousands of years. I mentioned this to my scholarly friend, Robert — I have only one scholarly friend; if you have two, they argue all the time — and he told me that this is covered in the Talmud. I did a little research and found that, according to the book “Values, Prosperity, and the Talmud: Business Lessons from the Ancient Rabbis,” by Larry Kahaner: “One of the most important rules prohibits customers from showing interest in a product if they have no intention of buying. The practical aspect was that it wasted the sellers time when he could have been spending it with a customer who was truly in the market.” O.K. I understand that this appeal to guilt — Jewish guilt, Catholic guilt, any brand — is not going to convince a lot of people to behave differently. Many will simply say it’s not their problem, even though they would not like people visiting them on the job and wasting their time. But it is their problem, or it will be. What happens if your local retail stores become a showroom for online stores to such an extent that it forces them out of business? Are you perfectly happy not touching and trying out products? It has already happened with the closing of hundreds of Borders book stores. This is not a level playing field — and I say this as someone who has both retail outlets and substantial online sales. And it’s not just the retailers that get hurt. Think of all the sales tax that those stores used to generate. Zappos does about $1 billion in sales every year. If Chicago represents 2 percent of the company’s business, that would be $20 million in annual sales. That represents about $2 million dollars of sales tax that the city no longer gets — and no longer gets to use to pay for police, firefighters, teachers and street repairs (with a few dollars left over for graft and corruption, of course). And Zappos is only one company. How much more is being lost on sales by Amazon (which owns Zappos) and all of the other online retailers? The loss of sales tax, as well as the loss of the real estate and payroll taxes that those closed stores used to pay, is damaging your city and state. This is a zero-sum game. You may think that if a local store can’t compete with Zappos or Amazon, that’s the store’s problem. And you may be right. But why do the rules favor Zappos and Amazon? Not forcing them to collect sales tax has given them an unfair advantage that ultimately will force all of us to pay higher taxes to local governments. Right now, the problem is being masked by the fact that we are coming out of a recession (I think! I hope!). There is an assumption that this is the main reason sales tax revenue is off. But I would bet that there is more revenue being lost from the Internet sales tax loophole than from the soft economy. This is a simple problem with no simple solution. But I would like to offer some insight into the beat-the-retailer mentality. Saving money online can be a pleasure. But these local stores employ your friends and neighbors, spend millions of dollars in your community, and are hardly taking advantage of anyone. Have you ever seen the bottom lines of most large retailers? Five or 6 percent is probably about the average. And the small local store? I laugh when people tell me what a “gold mine” a particular store must be. I always ask, “Are you the store’s accountant?” I talk to small-business groups all of the time. Whether it is the local frame shop, furniture store, luggage store, florist, shoe store, bicycle shop, or eyeglass store, many are struggling. If they are doing well, they are not doing that well. Most stores are not ripping people off. They are trying to make a living, give service, support employees and pay taxes — and they are getting challenged by large companies that can buy cheaper but don’t necessarily provide better value. Here is the bottom line: The sales tax loophole is going to have to be fixed, whether you like it or not. The cities need the revenue. And people will continue to shop at stores with no intention of buying, whether the store owners like it or not. Perhaps some people will start to think twice about it. At least, they don’t need to rub it in the face of the store staff. It’s nothing to brag about, really. Jay Goltz owns five small businesses in Chicago.</text></article>

Analysts are predicting yet another revenue blowout, up 44 percent compared with last year. Amazon’s torrid growth more than 15 years after its founding makes it an object of envy and fear across the retail world. It is now a $100 billion company, about 12 times the value of Sears. Viewed from a public relations point of view, however, the quarter was pretty much a disaster, at least until the announcement of the Kindle tablet on Sept. 28. First came the lengthy fight with the state of California over whether Amazon would collect sales tax. Even more damaging was a long article in The Morning Call of Allentown, Pa. It revealed that workers in Amazon’s local warehouse were collapsing from heat stress as they struggled to ship copies of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” or “Pirates of the Caribbean” so quickly that the customers would never even consider going to a land-based store. It was a striking snapshot of the underbelly of the Internet economy: Amazon arranged with the local ambulance service to have vehicles stationed outside the warehouse on peak heat days. As workers fell down on the job, they were whisked away to the hospital, the newspaper said. Cetronia Ambulance Corps confirmed the Call’s reporting and then stopped talking. Amazon declined to answer questions. But it garnered some ill will. American Rights at Work, a pro-union organization, said its “activists” had sent 23,000 letters to Amazon’s chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos. Earlier this week, Amazon posted a note on its site revealing that there were “multiple” temperature problems at the warehouse — “low temperature events” as well as “high temperature events.” The note was not completely clear, but it seems that workers in wintertime left the building during fire alarms and then were not immediately let back in. I asked Amazon why they were having so many fire alarms but got no immediate answer. The retailer said in its note that it had “a new set of procedures” for the winter and had installed air conditioning for the summer. “It’s safer to work in the Amazon fulfillment network than in a department store,” it said, citing government survey data on nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses. Amazon’s relentlessness has made it a great company. But some in the tech world are beginning to wonder if there is a point at which you can become too driven, even if it is supposedly in the service of your customers. As Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land wrote in an open letter to Mr. Bezos at the height of the tax controversy: “Don’t make me hate you.” Paul Saffo, an expert on Silicon Valley culture, says that traditional companies are owned by their shareholders but digital companies are in effect owned by their customers. Apple is the most celebrated example of this passion, but Amazon also evokes strong feelings. People shop there because they like what it stands for, or what they think it stands for. “Amazon is not just a place you buy stuff,” Mr. Saffo said. “You have an emotional attachment to it. So if Amazon thinks things like collecting taxes and how it treats its warehouse workers are not an issue for their customers, they’re in for a surprise.”</text></article>

Random House and the Hachette Book Group also said on Wednesday that they were in the planning stages of creating their own portals for authors that would offer sales and other relevant information. Sophie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for Hachette, said the company’s portal would be introduced sometime in 2012. Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, said a date had not yet been set, but that the site would provide sales data in all formats, in addition to marketing tools and related information. The new services may help publishers strengthen their relationships with authors who have expressed frustration at the difficulty of getting up-to-date sales information. In the absence of data from their publishers, many writers turn to Amazon, which last year began giving them access to data from Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 75 percent of print sales. This has helped forge stronger ties between Amazon and authors at a time when publishers are already feeling competitive pressure from Amazon’s plans to accelerate its own book publishing program. Carolyn K. Reidy, the president and chief executive of Simon &amp; Schuster, said that the portal was not a response to Amazon, but rather an effort to accede to authors’ requests to have immediate access to their sales figures, without being forced to ask their editors or agents to provide the information. “There isn’t any place where they can go and get all of their sales figures,” Ms. Reidy said, adding that the project was years in the making. “We realized that we can give them the knowledge we have.” For authors desperate to know how many copies their books have sold, there are few attractive options. Checking a book’s sales rank on Amazon only reveals how a book is selling compared to other books on Amazon. While book publishers say that they openly share information with authors and agents, they will sometimes hesitate to do so if a book is not selling well. Authors who use Simon &amp; Schuster’s site are instructed not to share the data with anyone other than their literary agents. The site also features links to publishing news and instructional tips on using social media, blogs and videos to promote their books. Agents and authors said they welcomed the news. “It’s a growing move toward transparency that the business has been going toward anyway,” said Christy Fletcher, a literary agent. “There’s much more equilibrium. Now everyone’s getting the same information.” Dave Cullen, the author of “Columbine,” a nonfiction book published in 2009 by Twelve, part of Hachette, said he had become accustomed to haranguing his publisher for sales data. While his publisher was patient and accommodating, Mr. Cullen said, he frequently wondered why he could not check the same information himself. “Some of this is the publishers trying to be competitive,” Mr. Cullen said. “And some of it is that they’re opening their eyes. Publishers didn’t realize the frustration that authors have.”</text></article>

In the traditional publishing world, an editor works intimately with a writer to sharpen the writing, to mold works that provoke and challenge readers. In the new publishing model, the writer works more or less on her own. Editorial suggestions and changes tend to be superficial, if they exist at all. This new method of delivering written work may benefit some writers. It may disadvantage many publishers and literary agents. But it is disastrous for all readers.

Superheroes are the prize — or perhaps the victim.Amazon, seeking to make its coming Kindle Fire tablet as appealing as possible, negotiated a deal with DC Comics for the exclusive digital rights to a hundred popular graphic novels. Among the series: Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, the Sandman and Watchmen. Barnes &amp; Noble, with a tablet of its own to nurture, did not like this one bit. Two weeks ago it removed all the copies of the physical volumes from its 1,300 stores, saying it would not carry any book if it were denied the right to sell the digital version. Books-a-Million, the third-largest bookseller with 231 stores, followed suit last week, making the same argument. Booksellers of all sorts used to pride themselves on never removing any book from their shelves, but that tradition — born in battles over censorship — is fading as competitive struggles increase. Last year, in a sort of foretaste of the present conflict, Amazon temporarily removed the “buy” buttons for the publisher Macmillan as part of a struggle over e-book pricing. This time, the stakes are once again high. The two chains are desperate to avoid becoming showrooms for Amazon’s digital warehouse, which would quickly send them to the bookstore graveyard like their former colleague Borders. DC Comics must stay relevant in a world where many of its young male fans read everything on mobile devices — not the most congenial medium for comics. And Amazon must preserve and extend its dominance. In online comics forums and other places where the issue is being debated, everyone is unhappy with someone. Amazon is being accused by some of throwing its considerable weight around to the detriment of readers and the larger culture. DC Comics is being criticized by others of placing greed over its fans. Barnes &amp; Noble is alternatively being accused of throwing its own weight around and of cutting off its nose to spite its face. Even the comics’ writers are getting some heat. As Amazon seeks over the next few years to expand its tablet line, these collisions over content are likely to become routine. “It looks like content providers and online purveyors have a few more rounds to go before the Wild West is tamed,” said Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant. DC Comics, a division of Warner Brothers, says it is being misunderstood. But on its own Web site, it said the books would be available “exclusively to Amazon’s newly announced Kindle Fire,” with no qualification. Even the possibility that fans could have access to the books on their iPads through the Kindle app seemed disallowed. DC now says the books will be available on other e-readers through the Kindle app. “Just because we’re starting with Amazon, this is not the be-all and end-all of our digital strategy and distribution,” said Jim Lee, co-publisher of DC Entertainment, the parent company of DC Comics. He added, however, “We are not at liberty to discuss exactly when” the comics would be available on other e-readers, citing the company’s nondisclosure agreement with Amazon. Amazon declined to comment about the deal. DC executives seemed surprised at the speed with which they had alienated some of their devout fans. Some threatened piracy, like NinjaZilla, a poster on a comics forum who wrote: “What will me and my poor iPad do? I’m so sorry DC! Because it is not like I can download all those comics for free, oh wait yes I can, and now I guess I will and maybe I will download every comic DC produces while I am at it!” Mr. Lee said, “We say to our fans, have a little patience.” A lot of patience might be required. DC says it took two years of work with Amazon to complete the process of converting the comics into something that could be read and appreciated on the Kindle Fire. Independent bookstores, which are rarely offered exclusives by publishers, argue that they are bad for consumers. “A competitive retail market where products are available from lots of different places creates greater choice and a competitive pricing environment,” said Oren Teicher, chief executive of the American Booksellers Association. “Choice is better than no choice.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/technology/amazon-rewrites-the-rules-of-book-publishing.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Rewrites the Rules of Book Publishing<date>Published: October 16, 2011</date><text>SEATTLE — Amazon.com has taught readers that they do not need bookstores. Now it is encouraging writers to cast aside their publishers.Amazon will publish 122 books this fall in an array of genres, in both physical and e-book form. It is a striking acceleration of the retailer’s fledging publishing program that will place Amazon squarely in competition with the New York houses that are also its most prominent suppliers. It has set up a flagship line run by a publishing veteran, Laurence Kirshbaum, to bring out brand-name fiction and nonfiction. It signed its first deal with the self-help author Tim Ferriss. Last week it announced a memoir by the actress and director Penny Marshall, for which it paid $800,000, a person with direct knowledge of the deal said. Publishers say Amazon is aggressively wooing some of their top authors. And the company is gnawing away at the services that publishers, critics and agents used to provide. Several large publishers declined to speak on the record about Amazon’s efforts. “Publishers are terrified and don’t know what to do,” said Dennis Loy Johnson of Melville House, who is known for speaking his mind. “Everyone’s afraid of Amazon,” said Richard Curtis, a longtime agent who is also an e-book publisher. “If you’re a bookstore, Amazon has been in competition with you for some time. If you’re a publisher, one day you wake up and Amazon is competing with you too. And if you’re an agent, Amazon may be stealing your lunch because it is offering authors the opportunity to publish directly and cut you out. “It’s an old strategy: divide and conquer,” Mr. Curtis said. Amazon executives, interviewed at the company’s headquarters here, declined to say how many editors the company employed, or how many books it had under contract. But they played down Amazon’s power and said publishers were in love with their own demise. “It’s always the end of the world,” said Russell Grandinetti, one of Amazon’s top executives. “You could set your watch on it arriving.” He pointed out, though, that the landscape was in some ways changing for the first time since Gutenberg invented the modern book nearly 600 years ago. “The only really necessary people in the publishing process now are the writer and reader,” he said. “Everyone who stands between those two has both risk and opportunity.” Amazon has started giving all authors, whether it publishes them or not, direct access to highly coveted Nielsen BookScan sales data, which records how many physical books they are selling in individual markets like Milwaukee or New Orleans. It is introducing the sort of one-on-one communication between authors and their fans that used to happen only on book tours. It made an obscure German historical novel a runaway best seller without a single professional reviewer weighing in. Publishers caught a glimpse of a future they fear has no role for them late last month when Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire, a tablet for books and other media sold by Amazon. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company’s chief executive, referred several times to Kindle as “an end-to-end service,” conjuring up a world in which Amazon develops, promotes and delivers the product. For a sense of how rattled publishers are by Amazon’s foray into their business, consider the case of Kiana Davenport, a Hawaiian writer whose career abruptly derailed last month. In 2010 Ms. Davenport signed with Riverhead Books, a division of Penguin, for “The Chinese Soldier’s Daughter,” a Civil War love story. She received a $20,000 advance for the book, which was supposed to come out next summer. If writers have one message drilled into them these days, it is this: hustle yourself. So Ms. Davenport took off the shelf several award-winning short stories she had written 20 years ago and packaged them in an e-book, “Cannibal Nights,” available on Amazon. When Penguin found out, it went “ballistic,” Ms. Davenport wrote on her blog, accusing her of breaking her contractual promise to avoid competing with it. It wanted “Cannibal Nights” removed from sale and all mentions of it deleted from the Internet. Ms. Davenport refused, so Penguin canceled her novel and has said it will pursue legal action if she does not return the advance. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 19, 2011 An article on Monday about Amazon.comâs foray into publishing misstated the actions of the publisher Penguin after Kiana Davenport, an author under contract to write a novel for its Riverhead Books imprint, published a collection of short stories as an e-book available on Amazon. Penguin canceled Ms. Davenportâs novel and said it would sue if she did not return the advance for the book; it has not filed a lawsuit against her.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/questions-for-amazon-on-privacy-and-the-kindle-fire/?ref=amazoninc">Questions for Amazon on Privacy and the Kindle Fire<date>October 14, 2011, 3:19 pm</date><text>The dream of every retailer is to know exactly what its customers are thinking. Are they comparison-shopping? Just looking? Will a discount help close the deal? Or is price no object? Amazon’s coming tablet, the Kindle Fire, is equipped with a Web browser that, thanks to the wonders of cloud computing, is partly housed on Amazon’s servers. That will give the retailer opportunities to track customer behavior all over the Web, gathering data and marketing intelligence as it goes. Representative Edward Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Bi-Partisan Privacy Caucus, has concerns about the Fire’s potential implications. On Friday he sent Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, a letter asking for more information about how the retailer intends to gather Internet data. This is the first request the caucus has ever made of Amazon. Among the congressman’s questions: What information is Amazon planning to collect? Does it plan to sell, rent or otherwise make available this customer information to outside companies? How will it convey its privacy policy to users? Will customers be asked to opt-in to having their browsing tracked, or will they have to opt out? Amazon declined to comment. When it introduced the Fire two weeks ago, the retailer drew a bold line between activity on its own site and on the rest of the Internet. The first is individually tracked (with the user’s permission) but the second would not be. All browsing activity would be aggregated and not linked to individual users’ identities. This could get very blurry, however. For instance, if you use the tablet to buy a novel by Umberto Eco, Amazon might promote another book by Mr. Eco to you. But if you use the tablet to post reviews of Italian restaurants on Yelp, Amazon would merely collect that data, bundle it with the fact that a lot of customers in your community seemed to be favorably reviewing Italian restaurants, and then strike a deal with one restaurant to offer discounts, which it would e-mail to you. Some customers might feel tracked; others might not even notice. “Consumers may buy the new Kindle Fire to read ‘1984,’ but they may not realize that the tablet’s ‘Big Browser’ may watching their every keystroke when they are online,” Mr. Markey said. “As the use of mobile devices, especially tablets, becomes ubiquitous, we must ensure that user privacy is protected and proper safeguards are in place so that consumers know if and when their personal information is being used and for what purpose.” Users can also turn off the cloud side of the Fire’s browser, although the device presumably would then suffer some slowdown — defeating at least part of the point of having the tablet in the first place.</text></article>

According to numerous music executives, Google is eager to open the store in the next several weeks. It would most likely be connected to Google's existing cloud service, Music Beta, which lets people back up their songs on remote servers and stream them to mobile phones and other devices, said these executives, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private and continuing. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment, and the labels also had no official comment about Google's plans. Google may be hoping to announce its store before Apple opens its latest cloud music program, iTunes Match, which was unveiled in June and is expected to be operational by the end of October. But it was unclear whether Google would be able to close the necessary deals with labels and music publishers in time to open a full-service store. Its earlier negotiations with music companies, for a so-called smart locker service - a Web storage system that lets people link their digital music collections to a vast central database - broke down over financial terms and the music companies' complaints that Google was not doing enough to curb piracy. Now Google is aiming for a more extensive service, but the labels and publishers do not feel that all of their concerns have been addressed. ''We want to make sure the locker doesn't become a bastion of piracy,'' one senior label executive said. To operate the most efficient kind of locker service, a company like Google needs special licenses from the music copyright holders. Having failed to get licenses from the labels and publishers, Google opened a scaled-down version of Music Beta in May, and its executives publicly criticized the labels for blocking the deals. Music Beta was announced five weeks after Amazon opened a similar unlicensed service, Cloud Drive. Apple got licenses for iTunes Match, which will instantly link a user's songs to Apple's master collection. With an unlicensed service, users must upload each song individually, a process that can take hours or even days.

Discover cardholders can now use their cash back bonus points to pay directly for purchases on Amazon.com. As an added incentive for Discover users to shop on Amazon, they can now automatically earn double cash rewards on items bought on Amazon through the end of the year. (Discover cardholders earn up to 1 percent cash back automatically; they can earn 2 percent, on up to $250 in purchases, under the promotion.) To pay with points, a cardholder links a Discover card to an Amazon account. Then, at checkout, the cardholder can select the option to pay with a cash back bonus. Cardholders can use all or part of their available bonuses to pay for purchases, and have any remaining balances charged to their Discover cards. Each dollar in cash back bonus is worth a dollar in spending on Amazon. Some other cards also allow users to pay directly with rewards points on Amazon, including American Express, through its Membership Rewards program, and the Amazon.com Rewards Visa card.

In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web: • According to researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, revoking high-occupancy-vehicle, or H.O.V., lane privileges for solitary drivers of hybrids has only slowed and thickened traffic on Bay Area freeways. To encourage adoption of partial zero-emissions vehicles like the Nissan Leaf and Prius Plug-In Hybrid, California banished solitary drivers of older hybrid vehicles from the lane in July. (Green) • Jalopnik noted on Monday that Amazon and Best Buy were selling a Blu-Ray version of “Senna,” the 2010 documentary about Ayrton Senna, the three-time Formula One champion, for nearly $700. The Amazon purchase page for the item says that it is out of stock. On the British version of the e-commerce site, a box set including a 1:12 scale model of Senna’s JPS Lotus racecar, a DVD and a photography supplement is listed for £262.49, or about $410. (Jalopnik) • Edmunds reported Monday that American sales of so-called advanced-drive vehicles, or cars and S.U.V.’s with hybrid, plug-in and other nonconventional propulsion systems, dropped in September by 15.1 percent relative to their levels a year ago. Meanwhile, sales of conventional gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles rose by 10.1 percent over their levels in September 2010. The report attributed the decline to the price premium associated with hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles at a time of waning consumer confidence. (Edmunds) • Amid the European debt crisis, sales of Chrysler vehicles are buoying Fiat, its corporate parent, Bloomberg reports. Sales of Fiat-brand vehicles have been declining in part, the report said, because the parent’s American subsidiary has benefited from resources, including the attention of senior management, that otherwise would have been dedicated to revitalizing Fiat’s aging model lineup.

The automaker expects to sell 1,000 units of the model and offers distinct trim levels for both manual and automatic transmission builds. The manual, for example, receives specially branded Recaro seats and 19-inch bronze alloy wheels, while the automatic is fitted with black leather seats with red stitching and 18-inch gunmetal alloys.

What if Colin Firth were reading it? Audible, an audio book division of Amazon.com, said last week that it would introduce a line of audio books read by famous actors, including Naomi Watts (“Summer,” by Edith Wharton), Dustin Hoffman (“Being There,” by Jerzy Kosinski), Annette Bening (“Mrs. Dalloway,” by Virginia Woolf), Samuel L. Jackson (“A Rage in Harlem,” by Chester Himes) and Kim Basinger (“The Awakening,” by Kate Chopin). The actors helped select the books they will read, making choices because they wanted “to inhabit a character that has always fascinated them, show a different side of themselves from what audiences have seen on camera or tell a personally beloved story,” said a statement from Audible. More books in the series are expected to be introduced throughout 2012. Sales of digital audio books have boomed in recent months, industry statistics show. In 2010, sales of downloaded audio books totaled $81.9 million, a 39 percent increase from $59 million in 2009, according to the Association of American Publishers, an industry group. Some audio books that have sold especially well have featured a celebrity behind the microphone. Little, Brown &amp; Company, a division of Hachette Book Group, published “Bossypants,” a memoir by Tina Fey, who read the audio book. The audio book has sold more than 150,000 copies, said Anthony Goff, the publisher and director of Hachette Audio. Ms. Fey’s reading of the book — and the intimacy of spending hours one-on-one with a celebrity — have played a huge part in its success, he said. “Celebrity narrators are great for bringing new fans to the format, never mind if they talk the audio up on their publicity tours,” Mr. Goff said in an e-mail. “That can really move the meter on sales.”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/02/business/deal-sites-have-fading-allure-for-merchants.html?ref=amazoninc">Deal Sites Have Fading Allure for Merchants<date>Published: October 1, 2011</date><text>Like businesses across the land, the Madison Avenue spa Wellpath tried to drum up customers by running heavily discounted coupons on deal-of-the-day Web sites. But the Internet coupon fad is shrinking faster than fat from a weight-loss laser.Coupons for the spa drew women from around the metropolitan area eager to see their bulges melt and their wrinkles removed. Once. “Then they would get another coupon and go do it with someone else,” Wellpath’s director, Jennifer Bengel, said. “There was no loyalty.” Just a few months ago, daily deal coupons were the new big thing. The biggest deal maker, Groupon, was preparing to go public at a valuation as high as $30 billion, which would have been a record amount for a start-up less than three years old. Hundreds of copycat coupon sites sprung up in Groupon’s wake, including DoubleTakeDeals, YourBestDeals, DealFind, DoodleDeals, DealOn, DealSwarm and GoDailyDeals. Deal sites were widely praised as a replacement for local advertising. Now coupon fatigue is setting in. Groupon’s public offering has repeatedly been put off amid stock market turmoil and internal missteps; the company says it is back on track, but some analysts say it may never happen. Dozens of copycats are closing, reformulating or merging, including Local Twist in San Diego, RelishNYC and Crowd Cut in Atlanta. Facebook and Yelp, two powerhouse Internet firms that had big plans for deals, quickly backed off. Even the biggest Web retailer, Amazon.com, has had trouble gaining traction in oversaturated New York, where it started offering deals with great fanfare a month ago. There are at least 40 active coupon sites for the city, according to LocalDealSites.com. Shopping coupons have a long history, and they will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in local merchants’ efforts to attract customers. But what has become apparent is a basic contradiction at the heart of the daily deals industry on the Internet. The consumers were being told: You will never pay full price again. The merchants were hearing: You are going to get new customers who will stick around and pay full price. Disappointment was inevitable. Some entrepreneurs are questioning the entire premise of the industry. Jasper Malcolmson, co-founder of the deal site Bloomspot, compares the basic deal offer with lenders’ marketing subprime loans during the housing boom. “They were giving these mortgages to every consumer regardless of whether he could handle it,” Mr. Malcolmson said. “But sooner or later you find that you can’t make great offers to people if they’re not making you money.” He recently revamped Bloomspot to focus on merchant profitability. During the first dot-com boom, entrepreneurs tried to develop group-buying sites. They never really worked. Then a group of outsiders far from Silicon Valley stumbled upon the idea and, to their amazement, it caught fire. Groupon was begun in Chicago in late 2008 by a group of musically and theatrically inclined young men and women who never seemed to have contemplated the Internet riches that quickly came their way. “We were used to small audiences, like blogs that we were the creators and the only readers of,” said Daniel Kibblesmith, a Groupon copywriter. “Now it seems like an audience we can’t wrap our heads around.” Last December, Google offered $6 billion for Groupon. That was astonishing enough, but then Groupon snubbed the search giant, a declaration that it was really worth much more. Its valuation began to rise by about a billion dollars a week. Deal mania commenced, a boom within the larger Internet boom. If a bunch of part-time artists could do it, so could everyone. All you needed was a desk and a deal to present to the world. “A lot of people saw an opportunity to get rich quickly,” said the Forrester analyst Sucharita Mulpuru. “It was a very 1999 mentality.” By the time Groupon issued its financial documents in June, the first step to going public, the phenomenon seemed a little less promising. Contrary to what the company had maintained, it was not profitable in the traditional sense. Eighty percent of subscribers to Groupon’s daily e-mails never bought a deal. Thirty billion dollars suddenly seemed a stretch. “They’re in over their heads,” Ms. Mulpuru said. Groupon’s legally mandated quiet period prevents it from responding to criticism of the business model, beyond a joking explanation on its official blog that it is “prohibited from saying anything to the press that may make the company look ‘good,’ ‘successful,’ or ‘not currently on fire.’ ” Merchants do derive benefits from doing a daily deal. Deals increase brand awareness, and of course there are some consumers who do indeed come back again at full price. But the cost is high: most coupon sites offer deals at 50 percent off and then take half the money the customer pays, sending the other half to the merchant. Da Pietro Hair Studio on East 78th Street did a promotion with a second-string deal company and ended up begging it to stop running the ad. “I said, ‘No more. We don’t want your clients,’ ” said the salon’s manager, Rosanna Kabashi. Even worse from the merchants’ point of view, the popularity of the coupon sites fed a relentless bargain-hunting mentality among customers that did not use them. “Every day, we get an e-mail or phone call saying, Can we match someone else’s price?” said Ms. Bengel of Wellpath. “We’re not Wal-Mart.” And the long-term reputation of the merchant may be at risk, according to a new study by researchers at Boston University and Harvard that analyzed thousands of Groupon and Living Social deals. The researchers found that fans of daily deals were on average hard to please. After they ate at the restaurant or visited the spa, they went on Yelp and grumbled about it. This pulled down the average Yelp rating by as much as half a point. “Offering a Groupon puts a merchant’s reputation at risk,” said John Byers, a professor of computer science at Boston University who worked on the project. “The audience being reached may be more critical,” he said, “than their typical audience or have a more tenuous fit with the merchant.” Even Amazon, the retailing juggernaut, has found quick riches are elusive. Its response in New York has been tepid. A subscription to The New York Observer had 84 takers, as did a “Sex and the City” tour. A Latin cooking class attracted 61 people, an Asian bistro 109. Kevin Walters, manager of the Creole Restaurant and Music Supper Club on Third Avenue in Manhattan, said he was “very, very surprised” to sell only 77 deals through Amazon. “It should have been huge,” he said. Amazon declined to comment. Despite the lackluster response, Mr. Walters will probably try another coupon. “I’m in East Harlem,” he said. “If the rest of the economy is shaky, then East Harlem is depressed. One way or another, I need to get people here.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/why-magazine-publishers-like-the-fire/?ref=amazoninc">Why Magazine Publishers Like the Fire<date>September 30, 2011, 7:02 am</date><text>Magazine publishers see tremendous potential in the Fire and hope that the device can do for their business what the Kindle did for books: bring droves of new customers into a business that is having difficulty retaining its traditional print readers. With another player besides Apple – particularly one that is as large and influential with consumers as Amazon is – magazine companies could suddenly find they have a useful bargaining chip when it comes to negotiating with Apple. The Fire also allows publishers to start getting a higher price for their magazines. The magazine business has long sold subscriptions on the cheap – many for as little as a dollar an issue – while advertising subsidized much of their costs. But as much as it lamented the practice and tried to raise prices, it found consumers were resistant. Prices of many magazines on the Amazon Fire are set higher than print editions. And by offering buyers a newsstand, publishers can avoid having to worry that their magazines are getting lost in a jumble of other media. This has long been a complaint of theirs with Apple, which is set to introduce its own newsstand next week. “When you’re lost in the middle of 100,000 apps, you only have people who find you when they’re looking for you,” said Bob Sauerberg, president of Condé Nast. “This helps with getting consumers in. They pick what they want, and we sell them more of what interests them. And everybody is happy.” Tablet versions of magazines are still in their very early days, and so far the sales figures don’t tell a complete picture about how strong consumer demand is. But across the board, publishers have said they like what they are seeing: small but relatively strong subscription and single issue sales that suggest more and more readers are beginning to adopt the tablet as their medium for magazine reading. Hearst, publisher of many leading women’s magazines like Cosmopolitan and O The Oprah Magazine, has found the Barnes &amp; Noble Nook to be a particularly encouraging bright spot. Sales on that device have in some cases surpassed those on the iPad. But in a sign of how much remains unsettled in the tablet magazine marketplace, Time Inc., the country’s largest magazine publisher, has yet to reach an agreement with Apple or Amazon to sell subscriptions. Time Inc., publisher of Sports Illustrated and People, continues to try to resolve issues including how revenue will be split with Amazon.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/is-the-kindle-starting-to-look-more-like-an-ikindle/?ref=amazoninc">How the Kindle Moved From BlackBerry to iPad<date>September 30, 2011, 8:33 am</date><text>The New York Times The first-generation Kindle was inspired by early BlackBerry smartphones. Do you remember the first generation Amazon Kindle? Although it helped change the publishing industry, it wasn’t exactly the prettiest gadget. It was clunky, a strange shape, and looked more like a 1960s-era calculator than an e-reader from 2007. But there is a reason it looked so strange. A hardware designer who worked on the first generation Kindle recently told me that the inspiration for the design came from early BlackBerry smartphones. “Jeff Bezos would come into our design meetings and say he loved his BlackBerry and the ease with which he could find e-mails and respond to people,” the former Amazon designer explained. “That’s why the first Kindle was so boxy, had the funky square keyboard and that strange scroll wheel on the side; it was all inspired by Jeff’s BlackBerry.” The designer asked not to be named because he had signed legal agreements that prevented him from publicly disclosing involvement in the Kindle development, including attaching it to his resume. Since then however, the Kindle has come a long way. The latest versions of the Kindles that were announced this week all come without those bulky scroll wheels and the dozens of cluttered buttons. Now though, in many respects, they are starting to look more like iKindles, imitating the design of the Apple iPad. The New York Times The Kindle Fire, at left, next to the Apple iPad 2. The bezel and glass are the same. “The design of the Kindle — and other tablets — are all marching to the beat of Apple’s drum; you can’t get much more minimal than a black rectangle,” said Justin Ouellette, a user interface designer at Tumblr. “I think it’s very telling that the latest Kindle uses the exact same Gorilla Glass as the iPad.” Ryan Block, co-founder of the gadget site gdgt, noted in a blog post earlier this week that the hardware of the Kindle Fire is actually based on the Blackberry PlayBook tablet design. You might not know that from looking at the Kindle Fire because almost all tablets look relatively similar now. “We are talking about a screen, where the screen is the entire experience and it can only really look and act one way, and that is to look similar to the iPad,” Mr. Block explained in a phone interview Thursday. “At the end of the day, they are all going to look similar, because a tablet is just a piece of glass.” Mr. Block noted that companies trying to compete with the Apple iPad must attack on two fronts: price and software. “Price is huge,” said Mr. Block, who noted that Amazon would clearly entice customers with the low price of the Kindle. But the software has to work too. “When all of these tablets look like a screen, the software becomes the most important factor,” he said. Mr. Ouellette said companies could also take cues from Apple by also paying attention to minuscule design factors. “The weight, the thinness, the feel, the texture of the glass, are all really important to the overall experience,” he said. “These devices are meant to be used in a very intimate way.”</text></article>

Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, with the new  Fire tablet. Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, was on a roll. Moments earlier, he had unveiled the Kindle Fire, Amazon’s newest mobile device, a sleek and chic tablet with a full-color touch screen. By all accounts, the presentation had been a hit, setting off a wave of congratulatory Tweets. Now he was making himself comfortable in a private room for one-on-one interviews. He poured himself a cup of coffee and settled back to chat. Mr. Bezos deftly answered a handful of questions, none of which seemed to rattle his composure — not those about whether the Kindle Fire could challenge the iPad, nor even queries about recent articles exposing harsh working conditions at an Amazon distribution center. He pointed to Amazon’s previous statements on that issue, and when pressed for his own reaction, he just stared evenly for a few beats. Cool as a cucumber. But then things got interesting. The point was raised that although the Kindle Fire is built on Android, like many other tablets, there was no visible signifier that the tablet was at all powered by Google. No Google-branded e-mail, Web search, maps, anything. Mr. Bezos nodded, saying that to the average consumer, the Fire’s software would be “unrecognizable as Android.” “We used the open-source code directly and built on top of that,” he said. “So it’s really our own thing.” Mr. Bezos added that the company would be “happy to partner” with Google to ensure that the Fire software would work smoothly with new Android releases. But when pressed about whether his company had been in talks with Google during the development of the Fire, he grew uneasy. “You’d have to ask someone else,” he sputtered. “I don’t know.” An Amazon spokesman, Andrew Herdener, said on Thursday that the companies had not collaborated. Shari Doherty, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was happy that Amazon chose Android as the software for its tablet but declined to comment further about the Fire. Amazon was not required to work with Google to use its software, which Google gives away. But in this case Amazon had a reason to be secretive about its tablet plans — and Mr. Bezos may have a reason to be jittery when the subject of his company’s relationship with Google comes up. Amazon is jumping into the browser wars, putting it in competition with Mozilla, Microsoft and, of course, Google, which has been pouring resources into Chrome. But it is going a step further with its Silk browser by acting as a middleman between the Fire and the Web sites a user wants to visit, saying it will use its powerful cloud computing resources to speed up delivery of Web pages. Chris Espinosa, the eighth hire at Apple and a senior engineer at the company, tossed out a theory this week that Amazon wants to take a bite out of Google, using a tablet built on Google’s own software. “Fire isn’t a noun, it’s a verb, and it’s what Amazon has done in the targeted direction of Google,” he wrote in a post on his personal blog. “This is the first shot in the new war for replacing the Internet with a privatized merchant data-aggregation network.” Mr. Espinosa points out, as other savvy tech writers have in the days since the Fire was unveiled, that there are some serious security and privacy implications to the Silk browser. Because its users’ Web traffic is piped through Amazon’s servers, it may give Amazon unique insight into the Web clicks, buying patterns and media habits of Kindle Fire owners. “Amazon now has what every storefront lusts for: The knowledge of what other stores your customers are shopping at and what prices they’re being offered there,” Mr. Espinosa continued. “What’s more, Amazon is getting this not by expensive, proactive scraping the Web, like Google has to do, they’re getting it passively by offering a simple caching service.” Perhaps the data collected could be another way for Amazon to subsidize the cost of its hardware, allowing it to undercut rivals on price. Your average Internet service provider already has access to such data, and the mobile Opera Mini browser uses a similar technique. But Amazon is expected to sell as many as five million Kindle Fires right off the bat. This could make the Fire an interesting kink in Google’s plans to use Android to help it sell mobile advertising and build a dominant presence on mobile devices.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/will-amazon-buy-palm-for-its-patents/?ref=amazoninc">Will Amazon Buy Palm for Its Patents?<date>September 30, 2011, 12:27 pm</date><text>Paul Sakuma/Associated Press and Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesLéo Apotheker, left, Hewlet-Packard’s former chief, with the Palm Pre, and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, with the Kindle Fire. To protect Fire, will Amazon buy Palm? Shares of Amazon fell about 2 percent in the first hour of trading on Friday, amid speculation that the online retailer might be angling to buy Palm, the fallen mobile device business that Hewlett-Packard bought last year for $1.2 billion. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink According to technology site Venturebeat, which earlier reported on Amazon’s interest, the companies are engaged in “serious negotiations,” though there are other suitors. Palm, purchased last April, was supposed to form the foundation of H.P.’s mobile business. The company, which invented the first personal digital assistant, offered H.P. a line of smartphones and the webOS platform, a mobile operating system that competes with Google’s Android and Apple’s iOS systems. At the time, Todd Bradley, an executive vice president at H.P., said it would provide the “ideal platform to expand H.P.’s mobility strategy and create a unique H.P. experience spanning multiple mobile connected devices.” But the honeymoon didn’t last long. One year later, the unit was bleeding cash and H.P. was cooling on its personal computing business. As part of a larger overhaul, H.P. announced that it was abruptly shutting down its webOS device business “and exploring strategic alternatives for webOS software.” That business, which made up the bulk of H.P.’s “corporate investment” segment made $266 million in revenue in the third quarter, but reported an operating loss of $332 million. H.P. also notified analysts that fourth quarter financials will reflect about $1 billion in charges related to its webOS write-down. Though the rapid fall of Palm, seems to be yet another red mark on the technology giant’s scorecard, H.P. may wring some value out of Palm, if Amazon, or another mobile device maker, makes a bid. After this week’s splashy debut of Kindle Fire — Amazon’s highly anticipated touch tablet — there’s little doubt that the online retailer is getting serious about its mobile devices. While the Fire’s price point of $199 and its limited features, seems to position it as a non-direct competitor to Apple’s popular iPad, analysts say, Amazon may be looking to acquire patents as a defensive maneuver. And Palm, with its trove of patents related to mobile software and devices, could help Amazon stave off future litigation, from competitors like Apple, or Microsoft. “I don’t think anyone believes that Apple and Amazon will not have significant competitive skirmishes in the future,” said Jordan Rohan, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst told DealBook on Friday. “The value of I.P. related to mobile has gone up—even if there was no palm devices in the future, it would still be valuable.” Though its unclear just how valuable Palm’s trove of patents is, Mr. Bradley of H.P. noted last year, that it “possesses significant I.P. assets.” Intellectual property has been a key driver of several multi-billion dollar deals this year. With many technology giants jockeying for a larger piece of the mobile market, patents have been critical, to ward off litigation, or to push rivals to sign expensive licensing agreements. In July,  Apple and Microsoft led a group of technology companies in a $4.5 billion purchase of patents from Nortel Networks. Google, which lost in the bidding, went on a patent spree in the following weeks, buying a trove from I.B.M. and then later, paying $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, a holder of more than 17,000 patents. “There’s a war of intergalactic proportions brewing, and instead of an army, they’re coming armed with patents,” said Mr. Rohan. Still, from a strategic standpoint, the purchase of a company like Palm would be somewhat of a departure for Amazon, which has not historically been focused on buying companies to build out its consumer technology products. Though its moving towards building better mobile devices, its focus, unlike its competitors, seems to be on selling content, said Scott Tilghman, a Caris &amp; Company analyst. “Amazon is focused on driving consumption of its own media offerings and getting into other forms of mobility, specifically the smartphone space, doesn’t seem to be part of their core competency or their core business strategy.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/is-the-end-near-for-the-playbook/?ref=amazoninc">Is the End Near for the PlayBook?<date>September 29, 2011, 5:10 pm</date><text>OTTAWA _ A semiconductor analysts in London, John Vihn of Collins Stewart, said in a investment note on Thursday that Research in Motion may have stopped production of its BlackBerry PlayBook tablet and may stop the development of all tablets. It provoked a swift, but only partial, denial from RIM suggesting that Mr. Vihn may be at least partly correct. “Any suggestion that the BlackBerry PlayBook is being discontinued is pure fiction,” Marisa Conway, a spokeswoman for the company said in an e-mail. “RIM remains highly committed to the tablet market.” Indeed if other speculation about RIM is correct, it’s difficult to see how RIM could suddenly abandon the tablet business altogether in spite of the PlayBook’s miserable sales. In addition to putting RIM in the tablet business, the PlayBook provided the debut of the QNX operating system, which will replace the aging system now used for BlackBerry phones. The success of those QNX-based phones, which are expected next year, will be critical to reversing RIM’s declining fortunes. Earlier this year, some industry analysts were shown a nonworking prototype which appeared to be a PlayBook with a four-inch, rather than a seven-inch, display. The company offered little information at the time about the smaller device but there is speculation that it was an early version of a QNX phone. Given that the iPad is, in many respects, a supersize iPhone with different features, it seems reasonable that RIM may be following a similar path. If so, abandoning tablet development would also mean that RIM is giving up on the product line that is its last great hope. That seems unlikely. But Ms. Conway did not answer questions about Mr. Vihn’s conclusion that the PlayBook production line has been shut down. He came to that conclusion because of layoffs at a contract manufacturing plant that makes PlayBooks. When RIM released quarterly financial results earlier this month it was abundantly clear that unwanted PlayBooks were gathering dust in warehouses and that RIM had found itself stuck with an excessive number of components to be used in making them. RIM shipped only 200,000 PlayBooks, less than half of what analysts had expected, and acknowledged that relatively few of those had found buyers in stores. Whether or not PlayBook production has been halted until the backlog clears is not known. But efforts by the company to find buyers are already apparent. Several retailers, like Best Buy, are now offering $200 discounts on Playbooks, a large discount on the base model’s $500 price. RIM is subsidizing those clearouts and has insisted that the price cuts are temporary. But given Amazon’s decision to price the new Kindle Fire at $199, RIM will most likely find it difficult to find full-price PlayBook buyers again, even allowing for the device’s more sophisticated technology.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/technology/amazon-unveils-tablet-that-undercuts-ipads-price.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s Tablet, Kindle Fire, Undercuts iPad’s Price<date>Published: September 28, 2011</date><text>With a glossy 7-inch color touch screen and a dual-core processor, the Kindle Fire, a new mobile device introduced by Amazon on Wednesday, sure looks like a tablet, and one not so different from the Apple iPad.But Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, has another word for it. “I think of it as a service,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “Part of the Kindle Fire is of course the hardware, but really, it’s the software, the content, it’s the seamless integration of those things.” Amazon is counting on its vast online warehouse of more than 18 million e-books, songs, movies and television shows, as well as access to a selection of Android applications, to help it beat competitors like the iPad and the Nook from Barnes &amp; Noble. Previous Kindles were only e-book readers with black-and-white screens. The access to content is important as Amazon transforms its business into a digital retailer and responds to consumer demands for mobile devices, lest it wind up in a retail graveyard like Borders, a former peer. “It will appeal to a different set of customers who are magazine readers and cinema fans,” Mr. Bezos said. The other advantage Mr. Bezos is counting on is price: the Fire will sell for $199 while the cheapest iPad sells for $499. Amazon began taking orders for the Fire on its Web site on Wednesday; it will start shipping them Nov. 15. Mr. Bezos took the stage on Wednesday at a news conference held in Manhattan to show off the Kindle Fire. The tablet, which weighs less than a pound and can fit comfortably in the palm of a hand, builds on the company’s popular line of e-readers. Amazon is hoping it appeals to a broader audience that also wants to browse the Web and stream music, movies and video from a mobile device. The Kindle Fire also has access to a virtual newsstand that includes content from magazines like Wired, Vanity Fair and Cosmopolitan. Amazon custom-built the Fire’s mobile Web browser, called Amazon Silk, so that it loads media-rich Web pages faster by shifting some of the work onto Amazon’s cloud computing engine, called EC2. “It’s truly a technical achievement,” Mr. Bezos said. The Kindle Fire’s 8-gigabytes of memory is capable of storing 80 apps and either 10 movies, 800 songs or 6,000 books. The tablet also includes a free cloud-based storage system, meaning that no syncing with cables is necessary. The Kindle Fire is missing some things the iPad 2 has — most notably, a camera and a microphone for video calls. The Fire can send and receive data only over Wi-Fi, not cellular networks. The device’s $199 price tag is less than half that of many tablet computers on the market, including the HTC Flyer, which also features a 7-inch screen but sells for $499 at Best Buy. The Kindle Fire will also compete with the Color Nook e-reader, developed by Barnes &amp; Noble, which has enjoyed healthy sales at $249. Amazon can afford to charge less because it hopes to make up the difference by selling books, movies and popular television shows. Customers may also be more inclined to pay $79 a year for Amazon Prime, which gives them access to Amazon’s movie streaming service and free shipping, which in turn, encourages more shopping at Amazon.com. Because Amazon sells its family of Kindle devices through its own Web site, it does not need to share revenue with another retailer. And in most states, customers do not have to pay sales tax on those devices. “If you price your products in such a way that no one can compete with you, that has to be a good thing in the end,” said Scott Devitt, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. On Wednesday, Mr. Bezos also introduced two new touch-screen Kindles, and a slimmer monochrome-screen Kindle, that range in price from $79 to $149. Apple has secured a strong lead in tablets, selling more than 29 million iPads in the product’s first 15 months on the market. Mr. Bezos says that he expects shoppers will put both Kindles and iPads in their carts. By entering the magazine-selling business, Amazon has also planted a flag in a digital marketplace that has so far been dominated by Apple. With another player — particularly one that is as large and influential with consumers as Amazon — magazine companies could suddenly find that they have a useful bargaining chip when it comes to negotiating with Apple. The price of magazine subscriptions on the Fire are higher than what readers would pay in print. Condé Nast, publisher of magazines like GQ, Vanity Fair and Glamour, is selling most of its publications for $20 a year, nearly twice what it charges in print. 1 2 Next Page » Jeremy W.

    <article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/amazons-silk-browser-plays-another-role/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon's Silk Browser Plays Another Role<date>September 28, 2011, 7:22 pm</date><text>With access to books, movies, and other media, Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablet may look like another consumer toy. However, an important part of the product, an advanced Web browser, is at the heart of where business computing is going. The new Amazon browser, called Silk, seems to be the first of its kind built for the world of cloud computing, which uses the Internet to gain access to the extensive computing power in data centers. Silk takes into consideration both the computing power in the user’s device and the computing power in Amazon’s enormous data centers, then executes tasks for maximum efficiency. As Peter Vosshall, a Distinguished Engineer at Amazon, says in a video that Amazon released Wednesday, “it is split between what runs on your device and what runs in the cloud.” One early advantage of this product is likely to be fewer “handshakes,” or short identification steps, between the device and the Internet. After an initial signal, the authentication happens within Amazon’s powerful computers, which move signals faster than can travel through a wireless network. Templates used in the format of Web pages can also be preloaded, so things pop up faster. Longer term, Silk will monitor consumer behavior, and Amazon’s machines will predict from past behavior where a customer is likely to go next. If you often move from reading, say, The New York Times’s front page to the Bits blog, Amazon computers will request that page ahead of time and have it preloaded for when you do make that move. All this is possible now in part because Silk is only inside the Fire tablet, and connects to Amazon’s cloud. But in learning how better to manage cloud tasks — a little computing here in the hand, a lot of computing up there in the cloud — Amazon is gaining precious skills in newer forms of computer science brought on by the cloud era. For a long time, most programming problems were defined by how much processing power you had. That’s why you used to hear so much about powerful chips and now you don’t. With the advent of the cloud, the amount of processing power for most problems isn’t the issue; correctly apportioning tasks and making millions of servers work together is. It is easy to see Amazon taking these skills into the corporate world. It became an early leader in cloud computing by modifying its own in-house computing and storage systems for other companies. The Silk team is already advertising jobs in fields like distributed systems and security, which will be critical areas for increasing the capabilities of Silk beyond delivering media to things like sales data analysis.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/technology/anticipated-amazon-tablet-to-take-aim-at-apple-ipad.html?ref=amazoninc">Anticipated Amazon Tablet to Take Aim at Apple iPad<date>Published: September 25, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — One after another, like moths to a flame, technology companies have been seduced into entering the market for tablets. Apple made it look so irresistible, with 29 million eager and sometimes fanatical consumers snapping up an iPad in the device’s first 15 months.But neither Samsung nor Motorola nor Acer could beg or borrow any of Apple’s magic. Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, said it shipped only 200,000 of its PlayBooks in three months — about what Apple sells in three days. Hewlett-Packard, which flopped this summer with the TouchPad, was the latest to get burned. Now comes a final competitor, the best-placed challenger of all: Amazon.com. The retailer is on the verge of introducing its own tablet, analysts predict, a souped-up color version of its Kindle e-reader that will undercut the iPad in price and aim to steal away a couple of million in unit sales by Christmas. A competition between Amazon and Apple tablets will be a battle that pits the company that created the first popular e-reader (and set off a still-unfolding revolution in how books are consumed) against the company that created the first popular tablet (and set off a revolution in progress about how entertainment and other media are consumed). Both companies are riding high, racking up record revenues and seeing their stock market valuations cruise to new peaks. Each has ample resources to enjoy a pitched struggle for people’s attention and their wallets. Whichever company triumphs, said the Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente, “the consumer is going to be the winner.” “The fact that Amazon is making such a huge investment might make Apple come back into the market at a lower price point,” he suggested. “What’s to prevent them from slimming down the iPad?” Most tech companies like to keep their cards close to their vests, but Amazon, like Apple, strives to render the whole deck invisible. It has, though, scheduled a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday, and the speculation on technology blogs and among analysts is that the tablet will be unveiled. The original Kindle was not introduced until Nov. 19, 2007, which was rather late in the holiday season. It immediately went out of stock for five months. Amazon perhaps is learning from its mistakes. The Amazon tablet, analysts believe, will most likely sell for about $250, half the price of the basic iPad. Its screen will be seven inches as opposed to the iPad’s 10 inches. Unlike the current Kindle but like the iPad and iPhone, it will operate by touch. A second tablet, with a bigger screen, is expected next year. The competition will be asymmetrical. Apple sells movies, music and books in order to sell devices. Amazon sells devices in order to sell books, movies and music. Apple has never faced an opponent with such a vastly different strategy. Apple declined to comment on its strategy against Amazon. Few if any analysts expect Apple to seriously stumble, but that is not to say it will emerge unscathed. The Amazon tablet might be underpowered when set against the iPad, a Corolla to Apple’s Lexus, but that might not matter. “The No. 1 thing consumers do on tablets is e-mail,” said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst. “The No. 2 thing is look up stuff on the Web. Then playing games and watching video. Amazon will offer all the tablet that many consumers need.” She estimated initial sales of as many as five million devices. Amazon’s willingness to sell the Kindle e-reader at a loss — it dropped to $114 from $399 in less than four years — will doubtless be duplicated with its tablets. By concentrating on direct sales from its own Web site, Amazon does not have to share margins with another store. All that makes Amazon “a nasty competitor,” Ms. Epps wrote in a recent report, and leaves Apple vulnerable among those who want a tablet solely for entertainment and not for professional uses. Since that is about two-thirds of tablet users, Apple’s product strategists will finally have to take a competitor seriously, she concluded. Apple is not the only vulnerable one. The Amazon tablet will sell for the same price and offer many of the same things as Barnes &amp; Noble’s successful color Nook e-reader. The once-mighty book retailer is staking its future on making the transformation to digital; otherwise it will end up like its one-time competitor Borders, now vanquished. Amazon has 52 percent of the e-reader market against 21 percent for Barnes &amp; Noble, according to the data firm IDC. A small harbinger of the cutthroat struggle between the two booksellers came this summer in the unlikely form of a best-selling German historical novel, “The Hangman’s Daughter” by Oliver Potzsch. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/us/24iht-currents24.html?ref=amazoninc">The Fraying of a Nation's Decency<date>Published: September 23, 2011</date><text>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS — Amazon.com, the books-to-diapers-to-machetes Internet superstore, is a perfect snapshot of the American Dream, circa 2011. It grows by the hour, fueled by a relentless optimism that has made America America. First it sold books. Then it realized that buying printed words in bulk, sorting and shipping them was a transferable skill. It has since applied it to anything you could want. In 2011, for example, I have bought the following from Amazon: a hard drive, an electric shaver, a Bluetooth headset, a coffee machine and some filters, a multivoltage adapter, four light bulbs, a rubber raft (don’t ask), a chalkboard eraser, an ice cream maker, a flash drive, roller-ball pen replacements, a wireless router, a music speaker, a pair of jeans and a shoe rack — and, oh yeah, some books. (Disclosure: A book and a long-form article I have written are sold on Amazon.) Buying these things the traditional way would have meant driving around to many different stores and paying as much as twice the price for certain items. What’s more, Amazon knows me. It’s like family. It knows where I live, what I like, my credit card number. (Which, come to think of it, makes it closer than family.) In a moment rife with talk of American decline, my Amazon experiences provide fleeting mood boosts. They remind me that, for now at least, this remains the most innovative society on earth. And then my bubble burst. Thanks to a methodical and haunting piece of journalism in The Morning Call, a newspaper published in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I now know why the boxes reach me so fast and the prices are so low. And what the story revealed about Amazon could be said of the country, too: that on the road to high and glorious things, it somehow let go of decency. The newspaper interviewed 20 people who worked in an Amazon warehouse in the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. They described, and the newspaper verified, temperatures of more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, or 37 degrees Celsius, in the warehouse, causing several employees to faint and fall ill and the company to maintain ambulances outside. Employees were hounded to “make rate,” meaning to pick or pack 120, 125, 150 pieces an hour, the rates rising with tenure. Tenure, though, wasn’t long, because the work force was largely temps from an agency. Permanent jobs were a mirage that seldom came. And so workers toiled even when injured to avoid being fired. A woman who left to have breast cancer surgery returned a week later to find that her job had been “terminated.” The image of one man stuck with me. He was a temp in his 50s, one of the older “pickers” in his group, charged with fishing items out of storage bins and delivering them to the packers who box shipments. He walked at least 13 miles, or 20 kilometers, a day across the warehouse floor, by his estimate. His assigned rate was 120 items an hour, or one item every 30 seconds. But it was hard to move fast enough between one row and the next, and hard for him to read the titles on certain items in the lowest bins. The man would get on his hands and knees to rummage through the lowest bins, and sometimes found it easier to crawl across the warehouse to the next bin rather than stand and dip again. He estimated plunging onto his hands and knees 250 to 300 times a day. After seven months, he, too, was terminated. In a statement this week, Amazon acknowledged the complaints and said that it was working to address them, including by installing air-conditioners. The prevailing American story line right now is seething anger at politicians: that they’re corrupt, or heartless, or socialist, or dumb. But the Amazon story, and many other recent developments, suggest that the problem is significantly deeper. Far beyond official Washington, we would seem to be witnessing a fraying of the bonds of empathy, decency, common purpose. It is becoming a country in which people more than disagree. They fail to see each other. They think in types about others, and assume the worst of types not their own. It takes some effort these days to remember that the United States is still one nation. It doesn’t feel like one nation when a company like Amazon, with such resources to its name, treats vulnerable people so badly just because it can. Or when members of a presidential debate audience cheer for a hypothetical 30-year-old man to die because he lacks health insurance. Or when schoolteachers in Chicago cling to their union perks and resist an effort to lengthen the hours of instruction for children that the system is failing. Or when an activist publicly labels the U.S. military, recently made safe for open homosexuals, a “San Francisco military.” Or when most of the television pundits go on with prefabricated scripts to eviscerate their rivals, instead of doing us the honor of actually thinking. The more I travel, the more I observe that Americans are becoming foreigners to each other. People in Texas speak of people in New York the way certain Sunnis speak of Shiites, and vice versa in New York. Many liberals I know take for granted that anyone conservative is either racist or under-informed. People who run companies like Amazon operate as though it never occurred to them that it could have been them crawling through the aisles. And the people who run labor unions possess little empathy for how difficult and risky and remarkable it is to build something like Amazon. What is creeping into the culture is simple dehumanization, a failure to imagine the lives others lead. Fellow citizens become caricatures. People retreat into their own safe realms. And decency, that great American virtue, falls away. Join an online conversation at http://anand.ly</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/books/amazons-kindle-to-make-library-e-books-available.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s Kindle to Make Library E-Books Available<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>For years the availability of free e-books from libraries was something of an underground secret.But Amazon significantly increased the potential visibility of library e-books on Wednesday when it opened up its popular Kindle device to these books for the first time. “Libraries are a critical part of our communities,” Jay Marine, director of Kindle at Amazon, said in a statement. “And we’re excited to be making Kindle books available at more than 11,000 local libraries around the country.” The introduction of the Kindle, the biggest-selling e-reader, opens up library e-books to a wider audience, heightening the fears of publishers that many customers will turn to libraries for reading material. If that happens, e-book buyers could become e-book borrowers, leading to a potentially damaging loss of revenue for an industry grappling with a profound shift in consumer reading habits. Library e-books are already available on Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook, the Sony Reader, smartphones, laptops and other devices, but never on the Kindle, whose users had long complained that they were left out. “We do get asked the question frequently: ‘Can I use my Kindle to download your e-books?’ ” said John F. Szabo, director of the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System. “And the answer has been no.” The move by Amazon “is a big deal and it’s a big step forward in public libraries being much more central in the whole e-book growth,” said Steve Potash, the chief executive of OverDrive, a large provider of e-books to public libraries and schools. Connecting libraries with the Kindle, the most successful device and the largest e-book bookseller in the business, “is going to bring millions of readers to the public library,” he said. The publishing industry has been reluctant to criticize libraries and their e-book systems because of the cherished status libraries hold in communities. But some publishing executives said privately that they found the development troubling and were concerned it might lead to a further unraveling of the traditional sales model. As e-books have taken off with readers, libraries have been building their e-book collections to meet demand, successfully persuading many publishers to sell their titles to libraries in e-book format. Christopher Platt, the director of collections and circulating operations at the New York Public Library, said that to meet demand from Kindle users, the library has already moved more money into the e-book budget and changed its default lending period for e-books from three weeks to two weeks. “This is massive for libraries,” Mr. Platt said. “It opens up another avenue of access to the collections that we already have.” From January to September the number of e-books checked out increased by 75 percent over the same period last year, he added. About 67 percent of libraries nationally offer access to e-books, up 12 percent from two years ago, according to the American Library Association. Most libraries work through OverDrive, which acts as a middleman between publishers and libraries. There are usually rules attached to checking out e-books. Publishers have said that libraries must treat digital collections the same way they treat physical collections: if a library buys 10 copies of a certain book, for instance, then only 10 copies can be digitally checked out at one time. Library patrons appreciate not having to visit a physical library to access e-books, which can be downloaded remotely from home or on the road. That convenience has publishers worried that e-reader owners who used to buy digital books will begin instead to borrow them. At least two of the six major publishers, Macmillan and Simon &amp; Schuster, do not make their e-books available to libraries. “Our e-books are not currently available in libraries because we haven’t yet found a business model with which we are comfortable and that we feel properly addresses the long-term interests of our authors,” said Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon &amp; Schuster. “We are in an ongoing dialogue with our library customers, and holding meetings with the different vendors who are offering e-book distribution to libraries, so that we can stay abreast of all the possible options.” Publishers have also learned that once they have established e-book guidelines, changing them risks incurring the wrath of libraries. In March HarperCollins infuriated some librarians when it began enforcing a new restriction on its e-books, requiring that a book be checked out no more than 26 times before it expired. Erin Crum, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, said on Wednesday that there had been no change in the policy. Demand for library e-books will increase, publishing analysts said. Forrester Research estimated that roughly 15 million e-readers would be purchased in the United States this year. A recent study by the Codex Group revealed that the idea of downloading e-books from a library was “phenomenally popular” among owners of digital reading devices, said Peter Hildick-Smith, president of the Codex Group, a book market-research company. “The only thing holding digital public library growth back is low book-buyer awareness,” Mr. Hildick-Smith said.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/inside-amazons-very-hot-warehouse/?ref=amazoninc">Inside Amazon's Very Hot Warehouse<date>September 19, 2011, 6:12 pm</date><text>Amazon.com did not create the notion of buying things online, but it has done more than any other retailer to move the experience into the mainstream. It has exceeded its customers’ expectations so often it must constantly struggle to top itself. “At first people were incredulous that the mouse on their computer was connected to their doorbell,” the Amazon executive Russell Grandinetti said recently. “Now they say: ‘It’s been 12 hours. Where’s my stuff?’ ” All that stuff doesn’t magically fly to your house, even if the goal is to have it seem that way. The Morning Call, a daily newspaper in Allentown, Pa., delivered a grim picture last weekend about what it is like to work in the local Amazon warehouse, sorting material for delivery to millions of eager customers. In eastern Pennsylvania, like just about everywhere else, jobs are lacking, and Amazon is one of the few places that is hiring. Many workers are brought on by a staffing company as temporary workers (“Are you interested in working in a fun, fast-paced atmosphere earning up to $12.25 per hour?” the ad asks.) This transient status gives them little incentive to complain, even as the heat boiled upward over the summer. The result was an environment that, one employee told the paper, resembled “working in a convection oven while blow-drying your hair.” In a lengthy and heavily reported article, The Call said a warehouse employee contacted the Occupational Safety and Health Administration on June 2 to report that the heat index in the warehouse had reached 102 degrees, and that 15 workers had collapsed. The employee also said workers who were sent home because of the heat received disciplinary points. Eight days later, the paper said, an emergency room doctor at a local hospital saw enough Amazon employees suffering from heat-related injuries to call OSHA and report “an unsafe environment.” So many ambulances responded to medical assistance calls at the warehouse during a heat wave in May, the paper said, that the retailer paid Cetronia Ambulance Corps to have paramedics and ambulances stationed outside the warehouse during several days of excess heat over the summer. About 15 people were taken to hospitals, while 20 or 30 more were treated right there, the ambulance chief told The Call. OSHA, which investigated conditions at the warehouse, told Amazon that the way the warehouse was run had “the potential to adversely impact” employee safety and health. In a statement Monday, Amazon said, “the safety and well-being of our associates is our number one priority.” It stressed it took emergency actions during the various heat waves, including shutting down the warehouse three times, but did not specifically challenge any of The Call’s extensive reporting. Investors were undaunted; in the challenging Internet economy, this is the exact way they want companies to be run. On a down day for the market, the retailer’s stock rose $2.39 on Monday to a new high of $241.69, giving Amazon a market value of $110 billion.</text></article>

Vikas will be writing later today about the hurdles the entrepreneurs with start-ups in India (including convincing their parents they aren’t crazy.) If you’ve got a good start-up tale, e-mail us at IndiaInk@nytimes.com. “This time it is for real,” said Kishore Biyani, the founder and chief executive of the Future Group, referring to an earlier wave of e-commerce euphoria in the early 2000s. “This is the biggest thing to happen in India.” That rapid growth has drawn the attention of venture capitalists who poured $183 million into 20 e-commerce firms in the past 12 months, up from $61 million for 13 firms in the previous 12 months, according to Venture Intelligence, a research firm. The online shopping boom has also attracted the notice of American online retailers. Amazon, which has a software development office in Bangalore, is now building a warehouse and hiring employees for an Indian site, according to two industry officials. And earlier this year, Groupon bought an Indian Web site, SoSasta.com.</text></article>

When Binny Bansal and Sachin Bansal, the founders of India’s leading e-commerce firm FlipKart, which I wrote about in this story in Thursday’s paper, wanted to become entrepreneurs, they faced resistance from an unexpected source: their parents. Sachin Bansal, who is not related to Binny, told me in an interview that their parents, who are from Chandigarh, worried that their children were being rash by giving up coveted jobs at a successful American company, Amazon, for the dim hope of launching India’s answer to that online giant. “What if it doesn’t work out,” Mr. Bansal said the families reasoned, “you have wasted some time and it will look bad on your C.V.” The founders responded by making the case that if the company didn’t succeed, they could easily go back to a job writing software for a large Indian or foreign technology company in Bangalore. While the duo struggled in the early days, they won’t be sending out their curriculum vitae any time soon. Since they founded the company in 2007, FlipKart has become India’s leading electronic retailer and investors are falling over themselves to invest in it and other firms like it. Though the company does not earn profits, the Bansals say they will turn profitable soon. The Bansal families are, of course, not alone in voicing concern about their children’s future. Several Indian entrepreneurs have told me that one of their biggest challenges remains recruiting employees, because many programmers and other professionals in India are reluctant to take jobs with start-up firms. Unlike in Silicon Valley, where stock options and working in a new venture is considered exciting and alluring, many Indian programmers prefer to draw steady paychecks, often because of the pressure they face from their parents to find a secure job in a large company that won’t go bust or fade away. “One has to have very lucrative compensation packages,” said Mukesh Bansal, the founder of Myntra Designs, a Bangalore-based online retailer of clothes and shoes. He is not related to the FlipKart Bansals. “Senior folks are interested in employee stock option schemes but junior people don’t pay heed to it.” Kunal Bahl, a co-founder of SnapDeal, a deals site similar to Groupon, said Indian engineers and programmers have become somewhat more willing to work for start-ups in recent years, because of the success of firms like MakeMyTrip, which had an initial public offering on the Nasdaq stock exchange last year. “Thanks to MakeMyTrip’s I.P.O. there is a greater propensity for people to join businesses like ours when they know the path to an eventual outcome is clearer,” he said in a telephone interview. “Two years ago nobody asked about employee stock options programs.” Mr. Bahl, a former engineer for Microsoft, is himself a somewhat of an accidental entrepreneur. He started his company two and a half years ago after he was forced to leave the United States because his work visa expired. Now that he is here, he said he is recruiting people from wherever he can. “In India, we don’t have a 15 year Internet legacy,” Mr. Bahl said. “So we have to get people from other fields, maybe tech but not Internet.”</text></article>

On Tuesday, Bob Seger will release two live albums with his Silver Bullet Band on iTunes, his first major releases to be permanently available as downloads. Mr. Seger, who has sold more than 51 million albums, is one of a small number of superstars who have resisted the move to downloading because the “unbundling” of music online — making individual songs available, rather than only selling complete albums — has cut into CD sales and often resulted in lower profits; some acts also complain that for aesthetic reasons, their albums should not be broken up. Among the other artists that do not sell downloads for some or all of their music are AC/DC, Def Leppard, Kid Rock, Black Sabbath and Tool. The Seger albums going on sale on Tuesday are “Live Bullet,” originally released in 1976, and “Nine Tonight,” from 1981. But strictly speaking, they are not Mr. Seger’s first forays into online music. His last studio album, “Face the Promise,” was briefly available through iTunes in 2006, and a compilation album, “Early Seger Vol. 1,” is sold on the Amazon MP3 store.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/technology/california-votes-to-give-amazon-a-sales-tax-reprieve.html?ref=amazoninc">California Votes to Give Amazon a Sales-Tax Reprieve<date>Published: September 10, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — California lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a compromise bill Friday night giving Amazon.com a one-year reprieve from having to collect a sales tax from its customers in the state. Under the new measure, Amazon agreed to start collecting the tax in September 2012 unless there was federal legislation on the issue. Senator Richard J. Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, has proposed a national law requiring e-commerce companies to collect sales tax, but it has not gained much traction. Legislatures around the country, supported by struggling bricks-and-mortar stores, have been seizing on the sales tax issue as a means of raising much-needed funds. Amazon is fighting in the courts against a New York law compelling it to collect taxes, and has used the prospect of either opening or closing warehouses as a bargaining chip in negotiations with Texas and South Carolina. The deal with California might embolden other states, said Robert W. Wood, a tax lawyer here. “Other states needing money will look and say, ‘It wasn’t a smooth process, but California is going to come out ahead,’ ” Mr. Wood said. California lawmakers spent much of the summer trying to compel Amazon to collect the tax, but the Seattle-based retailer aggressively resisted, spending $5 million to gather a half-million signatures to take the matter to voters in a referendum next June. The battle pitted Democrats and the California Retailers Association against Amazon and Republicans, who called attempts to collect the tax a tax increase. Consumers are supposed to pay a use tax on material they buy online, but few do. Under the deal, the referendum will now be dropped. Amazon called the new measure “win-win legislation” that would allow it “to bring thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of investment dollars to California.” Lawmakers had hoped to collect $200 million in taxes from Amazon and other online retailers for the current state budget. That money will now have to be found elsewhere. Nevertheless, the legislators said they were pleased. Loni Hancock, a Democratic state senator from Berkeley, said: “We would have liked them to begin collecting the tax already, but this is a positive step forward.” She mentioned another benefit: avoiding a noisy referendum campaign that the state could easily have lost. Left unmentioned by either side was the possibility that Amazon might be trying to buy some time. If it moves several small subsidiaries out of the state, it could argue that it no longer has the physical presence in California that requires it to collect the tax. The measure now goes to Gov. Jerry Brown, who has not spoken publicly about it. The vote occurred Friday night, with only a few dissenters in either chamber.</text></article>

If Amazon cannot get a change in federal tax policy by next June, it will start collecting the tax in September 2012. Amazon has been resisting a measure passed by legislators at the beginning of the summer mandating that e-commerce companies with subsidiaries in the state collect the taxes. It has spent more than $5 million to gather 500,000 signatures to put the issue on the ballot next June. Democratic legislators tried this week to come up with a two-thirds vote in the state Senate that would have blocked the ballot measure. They failed. That left them, and Gov. Jerry Brown, with few options except to hope that voters would agree to pay more for online goods. Why Amazon would agree to surrender even a portion of its fiercely defended competitive advantage is a little mysterious. Some observers speculated that the company was merely buying time and would move its subsidiaries out of California, letting it once again sell in the state without charging the tax. The retailer, which is getting the most criticism in its history over the tax issue, declined to comment. It has repeatedly said it wants one federal law rather than individual tax provisions in every state. Amazon was supposed to start collecting the tax under a California law that took effect July 1 but chose to fight instead. If the provisional deal can be completed by the end of the legislative session on Friday, the referendum will be dropped. The official language of the deal, which was struck late Wednesday, has not been worked out, and participants cautioned that it all could still fall apart. Legislators do not return until January. “We’re waiting to see the exact words, but we’re hopeful,” said Bill Dombrowski, head of the California Retailers Association. The group was the driving force behind the July law, which was supposed to raise a badly needed $200 million in the current fiscal year.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/opinion/amazoncoms-tax-dodge.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon.com’s Tax Dodge<date>Published: September 6, 2011</date><text>Amazon.com’s no-holds-barred fight to avoid collecting sales taxes in California is an abdication of corporate responsibility. The online behemoth is battling to repeal a state law enacted in July that would force it to do what every brick-and-mortar retailer in California is obligated to do: collect a sales tax of 7.25 percent from its customers.Amazon, like other online retailers, has been shielded from collecting the tax in most states by a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that said only firms with a physical presence in a state could be required to collect the levy. Amazon has gotten around sales-tax collection in California and other states by setting up subsidiaries, which it says do not constitute a physical presence. The new California law requires all Internet retailers with affiliates or subsidiaries in the state to collect the tax. According to state estimates, this would generate some $200 million in annual taxes at a time when the state is desperate for revenues. In response, Amazon has severed links with thousands of its affiliates in the state. It has tried to buy off political leaders by promising investments and jobs if they back off. And it is now trying to hijack California’s dysfunctional politics by spending millions to get a referendum on the ballot next June that would ask voters to rescind the law. It claims to have enough signatures to get the referendum, but whether a vote on budgetary issues is even constitutional is questionable. Because of Amazon’s tactics, Democratic lawmakers are trying to pass the law again as a so-called urgency bill, which could not be challenged by referendum, by the end of the session this week. The company says it supports a national system to collect sales taxes from all retailers online and off, such as a measure that has been introduced in both houses of Congress. But, meanwhile, it is battling other states that are trying to collect sales taxes. True to form, antitax groups are lobbying hard in Amazon’s favor. But many brick-and-mortar retailers that are hurt by Amazon’s unfair tax exemption are pushing back against any repeal of this law. A national, uniform system of sales-tax collection is a good idea. But such a system does not yet exist, and cash-strapped states need the revenue now. California should not back down on its proper demand that Amazon collect taxes that are owed.</text></article>

But that money is proving much more elusive than it seemed just a few months ago.Amazon.com, the Seattle-based retailer that is the state’s chief target, is fighting back with all the resources of a company whose stock market valuation is nearly $100 billion. In an unusual move that opponents say is a violation of the state constitution, Amazon is taking directly to voters its argument that it should not be required to collect sales tax. Infuriated state lawmakers are responding with what some observers are calling “the nuclear option”: writing new legislation that goes after Amazon and other online retailers under an “urgency” clause. If they can get the new measure passed by a two-thirds vote before the end of the legislative session on Friday, it will trump Amazon’s efforts toward a voter referendum. To sway a few legislators, Amazon is making a counterproposal: if California drops the tax issue for a few years, the retailer says it will build two warehouses in the state and hire 7,000 workers. In a state with 12 percent unemployment, that might seem an attractive offer. “This is a game of chess with ultimately billions of tax revenues at stake across the country and strong competing values on either side,” said Tracy Westen, chief executive of the Center for Governmental Studies, a Los Angeles research group. “High drama for policy wonks.” At its heart, the standoff between Amazon and California is simple: the state passed a law at the beginning of the summer requiring online retailers with a physical presence in the state to collect sales taxes. Amazon denies that its subsidiaries in the state, which include a unit that designed the Kindle, constitute such a presence. The stakes go far beyond the $200 million the state is hoping to get from Amazon and other online retailers, money it has already put into its new budget. (Local communities stand to reap an additional $100 million.) Amazon fears that a defeat in California will sway legislators across the country, and that it will lose a critical pricing advantage. It is fighting a similar measure in New York in the courts. Opposing Amazon are traditional retailers as big as Wal-Mart and as small as the neighborhood bookstore — the few that are left. “Amazon is killing our business in bricks-and-mortar stores,” said Bill Dombrowski, head of the California Retailers Association, which was the driving force behind the original law. Amazon easily collected the half-million signatures necessary to put the issue on ballots next June. Since people will in essence be voting on whether to pay an additional 8 or 9 percent when they buy online, Amazon could easily triumph among voters who are watching their wallets. Democrats in the Legislature responded with an urgency bill, a rare tactic used only a few times a year. “We’re not doing this lightly,” said State Senator Loni Hancock, a Berkeley Democrat. “But it seems like Amazon doesn’t really care about the State of California or the people whose lives are affected by whether or not we have enough money for schools and roads and to keep the libraries and parks open.” Any Californian who buys a book or a DVD player from Amazon is supposed to pay a use tax when filing state taxes. In practice, however, few do. For years, the issue has been simmering. Then came the withering recession, and the economic calculus changed. In the two months since the law took effect, Amazon has declined to start collecting sales tax in California. Once it submits the signatures for the referendum and they are verified, the law will be suspended until the vote. Senator Hancock and other Democrats say they have stopped shopping at Amazon. “This is getting pretty acrimonious,” said the California treasurer, Bill Lockyer, who said he was also boycotting the retailer. “It’s snarly.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Look to the ‘Cloud’<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>Cambridge, Mass. AS the global economy struggles through a slow and painful recovery, governments around the world are wasting billions of dollars on unnecessary information technology. This problem has worsened in recent years because of what I call the “I.T. cartel.” This powerful group of private contractors encourages reliance on inefficient software and hardware that is expensive to acquire and to maintain. In one particularly egregious example of waste, the Defense Department last year pulled the plug on a personnel system devised by Northrop Grumman after spending approximately $850 million on it in 10 years.  When I joined the Obama administration as the chief information officer, we quickly discovered vast inefficiencies in the $80 billion federal I.T. budget. We also saw an opportunity to increase productivity and save costs by embracing the “cloud computing” revolution: the shift from hardware and software that individuals, businesses and governments buy and then maintain themselves, to low-cost, maintenance-free services that are based on the Internet and run by private companies. Examples of cloud computing companies include Web behemoths like Amazon and Google, which offer a variety of services (data storage or e-mail, for example), as well as companies like salesforce.com, which helps businesses manage customer relationships via social networks. Other services and applications include health care access, mobile energy management and storm recovery assistance. Most cloud-based services are either free for consumers or delivered via a monthly subscription service for businesses. According to the research firm Gartner, cloud computing will be a $149 billion industry by 2015. Like a large office building, cloud data centers are efficient: many different tenants occupy the same space, sharing the same critical infrastructure, yet each tenant still has its own secure, customizable space. For example, in preparation for the 2010 census, the Census Bureau used the cloud computing services of salesforce.com to expand its I.T. capabilities, saving the cost and time of purchasing, designing and installing a brand-new I.T. infrastructure.  Shortly after the Obama administration took office, we instituted a “Cloud First” policy, which advocates the adoption of cloud services by government agencies and mandates the transition of at least three projects for every agency to the cloud by next summer. Some agencies, like the General Services Administration, have embraced cloud computing; the agency has cut the I.T. costs on things as simple as its e-mail system by over 50 percent. But other agencies have balked. The State Department, for instance, has raised concerns about whether the cloud approach introduces security risks, since data is stored off site by private contractors. But cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing, because companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies. And government employees are so accustomed to using cloud services like Dropbox and Gmail in their personal lives that, even if their agencies don’t formally permit cloud computing, they use it for work purposes anyway, creating a “shadow I.T.” that leads to a more vulnerable organization than would a properly overseen cloud computing system.  The United States cannot afford to be left behind in the cloud computing revolution. In health care alone, a productivity increase of 1 percent in the next 10 years — much of which could be achieved with cloud-based services — represents a $300 billion value. Similar efficiencies could be realized in sectors like financial services, education and manufacturing. Consider the example of Japan, which has faced significant economic challenges for two decades. The government’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry estimates that the Japanese cloud computing market is likely to reach $20.1 billion by 2015 and is implementing a cloud initiative as a key tenet of its national economic strategy. Similar growth is predicted for India, where the cloud market is projected to grow to $3 billion by 2015 and create 100,000 jobs. As foreign governments prioritize investment in the cloud, the United States cannot hesitate because of hypothetical security threats that serve the entrenched interests of the I.T. cartel. One of the critical remaining issues concerning cloud computing is whether cloud data can and should flow between nations and what restrictions should be placed upon it. The next step should be the creation of a global Cloud First policy that forces nations to work together and resolve these critical issues. The United States, along with leading nations in Europe and Asia, has an opportunity to announce such an initiative at the World Economic Forum meeting in January.  The budget crisis will accelerate the move toward cloud services. Governments, businesses and consumers all have a lot to gain, but not everyone will have an equal say at the table. Public and private organizations that preserve the status quo of wasteful spending will be punished, while those that embrace the cloud will be rewarded with substantial savings and 21st-century jobs.

We received the news yesterday in the form of a press release from Sentinel, an imprint of Penguin Group (USA). It read, “The book, currently untitled, will go on sale nationwide on November 21.” “Currently untitled.” This seems to present an opportunity. Political memoirs usually make a point of choosing as inoffensive a title as possible. Of the current Republican candidates, Mitt Romney offers “No Apology: Believe in America.” Newt Gingrich’s latest is “To Save America: Stopping Obama’s Secular-Socialist Machine.” (Though with Gingrich, there is plenty to choose from: his literary output is so extensive that, stacked, they measure 15¼ inches, as Andrew Ferguson discovered.) Ron Paul, another prolific writer, recently came out with “Liberty Defined: 50 Essential Issues That Affect Our Freedom.” Rick Perry wrote “Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America From Washington”,  as well as an earlier book called, “On My Honor: Why the American Values of the Boy Scouts Are Worth Fighting For.” (Ross Perot contributed the foreword). Rick Santorum chose the Hillary Clinton-referencing “It Takes a Family: Conservatism and the Common Good.” The pizza mogul Herman Cain went emphatic: “This Is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House.” In fact, when Bachmann’s book comes out, Jon Huntsman will be the only major Republican candidate without one — though his father, Jon Huntsman Sr., did write “Winners Never Cheat: Even in Difficult Times,” with a foreword by Glenn Beck. It’s certainly tempting to suggest Bachmann follow Cain’s example and pen a book titled “This is Michele Bachmann!” However, she might better emulate a noncandidate (so far) to whom she’s often compared. The best recent political-memoir title by a long shot is “Going Rogue,” by Sarah Palin. It is our sincere wish that Bachmann outshines the aridity of the declared field and comes up with something as colorful and, well, roguish as Palin’s title. But what? Please offer your suggestions.</text></article>

Look to the ‘Cloud’<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>Cambridge, Mass. AS the global economy struggles through a slow and painful recovery, governments around the world are wasting billions of dollars on unnecessary information technology. This problem has worsened in recent years because of what I call the “I.T. cartel.” This powerful group of private contractors encourages reliance on inefficient software and hardware that is expensive to acquire and to maintain.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/us/28bcshort.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Spends Millions to Fight Internet Sales Tax<date>Published: August 27, 2011</date><text>When it comes to avoiding the requirement of collecting sales tax from its consumers, Amazon is not afraid to open its wallet.More than nine months before a proposed June 2012 referendum asking that California’s new Internet sales tax law be overturned, Amazon, the Seattle-based online retailer, has already spent $5.25 million, state records show, more than any company has spent in California this far from a vote in at least a decade. “The initiative and referendum process have been hijacked,” said Loni Hancock, a state senator from Berkeley, who wrote the law Amazon is trying to overturn and who is now pushing legislation that could block Amazon’s referendum effort. Even by California’s expensive campaign standards, the company’s early contributions are causing observers to take note. For example, the company’s $5.25 million investment dwarfs the $1.5 million that Pacific Gas and Electric spent nine months ahead of the vote on Proposition 16, a June 2010 initiative that would have made it more difficult for local governments to get into the electricity business. P.G.&amp; E. ultimately spent $46 million on that campaign. Political observers say that by spending more, earlier, Amazon is showing potential opponents that its ultimate campaign spending could soar even higher. “These types of sums can send a very strong discouraging signal to potential opponents,” said Dan Schnur, a veteran Republican political strategist who is now director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. While Wal-Mart and other deep-pocketed retailers have lined up in favor of the tax law, they may decide to forgo financing the opposition to Amazon’s referendum if they feel it faces long odds, Mr. Schnur said. Early polling has suggested that a vote would be close. A Los Angeles Times-University of Southern California poll released last month found 46 percent of voters favoring an online sales tax, with 49 percent opposed. Ned Wigglesworth, a political consultant coordinating the Amazon-financed More Jobs Not Taxes campaign, said he did not see “any significance” in the company’s historic giving and dismissed the notion that Wal-Mart could be scared away by $5 million in campaign contributions. Neither Amazon nor Wal-Mart representatives responded to calls and e-mails seeking comment. Meanwhile, in Sacramento, Ms. Hancock has begun a quixotic quest to keep California voters from weighing in on whether online retailers should be required to collect sales tax. On Thursday, she pushed a new bill through a legislative committee that election law experts said could prevent Amazon from putting a referendum on tax collection before the voters. According to the state Department of Finance, the state will lose $200 million it has already counted toward balancing the state budget if the online sales tax is not collected. “That means a lot of teachers that aren’t in classrooms and police that aren’t on the streets,” Ms. Hancock said. She says that her new bill is an “urgency statute,” which, under the state constitution, is not subject to voter referendum. According to the California Constitution, such laws must be passed by two-thirds majorities of both houses of the State Legislature, and must be “necessary for immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety.” Mr. Wigglesworth refused to comment on efforts in Sacramento to render his campaign moot. aglantz@baycitizen.org</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/amazon-said-to-strike-licensing-deal-with-sony/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Said to Strike Licensing Deal With Sony<date>August 26, 2011, 5:15 pm</date><text>Amazon surprised the music industry in March when it introduced a limited “cloud” streaming service without special licenses from record companies. The move drew a rare public rebuke from Sony, but behind the scenes Amazon began negotiating with the labels for the licenses it would need to compete with iCloud, the more extensive service from Apple that is expected to begin this fall. Now, after months of talks, Amazon recently signed its first such deal. The label? Sony, according to two people briefed on the negotiations, who spoke anonymously because the talks were private. Terms of the deal were not known. Amazon’s service, called Cloud Drive, allows users to store songs on remote servers and stream them back to their computers and phones. It beat similar efforts by Google and Apple to market, but because Amazon did not have licenses from the labels, Cloud Drive — and its related Cloud Player — had significant restrictions. For example, each user must manually upload his song library, a process that can take hours or even days; the more efficient “scan-and-match” system, which instantly matches a user’s songs to those in a master catalog, would require a license. Google was developing a more extensive service, but in May, after licensing talks with record labels broke down, the company introduced Music Beta, with restrictions similar to Cloud Player’s. Apple obtained licenses from labels and music publishers for iCloud, which was announced in June and is expected to become available in the fall. A spokeswoman from Sony declined to comment on the Amazon deal. A spokeswoman for Amazon would not comment on licensing negotiations, but said: “We remain focused on making Cloud Drive and Cloud Player the very best for customers and have been exploring ways to add even more value to the services.” The state of Amazon’s negotiations with the other three major labels — the Universal Music Group, EMI Music and the Warner Music Group — is not known.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/amazons-got-a-deal-for-new-york/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon's Got a Deal for New York<date>August 24, 2011, 6:20 pm</date><text>Amazon.com is rolling out its daily deals offerings in Manhattan and Brooklyn on Thursday, touting a 50 percent discount on tickets to a new Cirque du Soleil show and a 74 percent discount for one month of classes at Bikram Yoga Harlem. The online retailer is a late entry into this marketplace, which was essentially invented three years ago by Groupon, the Chicago start-up now awaiting its stock market debut. Mike George, vice president of AmazonLocal, maintained the Seattle online retailer was not influenced by Groupon or any of its dozens of imitators, including Living Social, which Amazon has invested in. “This is a very logical, natural extension of what we do now: helping our 144 million active customers buy anything they want,” he said. Nevertheless, the AmazonLocal pitches hew to Groupon’s formula pretty closely, although the sentence introducing the deals seems more tossed-off than Groupon’s hard-worked cleverness. In some ways AmazonLocal is an unusual venture for the retailer, which has risen to success by tightly controlling, and constantly improving, the relationship customers have with its flagship Web site. In selling coupons for restaurants and spas, Amazon will be sending customers to experiences it cannot directly control, and which sometimes end in disappointment for the merchant or the customer. When I used a coupon to get my hair cut recently, I wondered why the spa was so empty. After the work was done, I knew. One thing AmazonLocal can do, which Groupon and other deals sites cannot, is promote still more deals on Amazon itself. Under this part of the venture, which is due to be phased in over the next couple of months, AmazonLocal subscribers will be able to buy coupons for discounts on select items (certain watches or jewelry, for instance) on Amazon’s own sites. Amazon began offering deals in Boise on June 2. With the addition of New York as well as Charlotte, N.C., Austin, Orlando, Northern Virginia and Chicago’s northwest suburbs this week, it is now in 30 markets. Groupon is in 175 markets. Manhattan deals will be segmented into downtown, midtown and uptown. Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens and the Bronx are on their own for the moment.</text></article>

Exorbitant college textbook prices have given rise to a “textbook rebellion,” which may be coming to a campus near you. A coalition of students, parents, professors and organizations including the Student Public Interest Research Groups, have banded together to promote more affordable alternatives to the $200 textbook — an amount that is not uncommon for science, economics, accounting and math students, among other pricey majors. So if you see a big van pull up on your college campus, don’t be surprised if a giant yellow textbook — called Textbook Rebel — jumps out to do battle with Mr. $200 Textbook, as part of the cross-country tour organized by the Student PIRGs. “Our goal is to collect student signatures on a petition, which we we’ll use to get the word out to faculty and call on decision makers to take action,” said Nicole Allen, textbook advocate at the Student PIRGs. The coalition also hopes to raise awareness about cheaper alternatives like “open textbooks,” which are offered under a license that allows you to read free online, or to obtain a print copy for a fraction of the cost of traditional hard-copy competitors. Indeed, textbook prices increased 22 percent over the last four years, according to the Student PIRGs, or more than four times the rate of inflation. On average, students at four-year public colleges were estimated to spend $1,137 on books and supplies during the 2010-2011 academic year, according to the College Board. To ease the burden, a survey conducted by the Student PIRGs found that many students simply aren’t buying at least one of the required texts. But there are ways to save while the textbook rebels fight the good fight. Last August, I wrote a post that surveyed the various ways to save money on textbooks, from finding free texts online to renting books on campus. And in January, we took a closer look at the many comparison sites that do a lot of the legwork for you. Over the course of the last year, several new options emerged, some of which were created by recent graduates who were exasperated by the book-buying process themselves. Those are highlighted below: Amazon.com. You can now rent eligible Kindle textbooks and read them on your computer, no Kindle required, or on your smartphone. You can also customize the rental periods to any length between 30 and 360 days and pay for the specific chunk of time you need the book (and can add time if you need to). The books aren’t printable, but you do have access to margin notes and highlighted text, even after the rental has expired. Just keep in mind that digital textbooks aren’t always the best deal. Be sure to compare prices with other hard-copy rental options, as well as buying a used copy of the book, which you can typically sell again. SwoopThat.com.  Similar to Getchabooks.com (featured in this Bucks post), this Web site was created by four recent college graduates and aims at students at specific colleges — in this case, more than 2,300 schools.  After you plug in your college name and courses, the site serves up the list of books that you need and where to find them at the lowest cost. “Our algorithms help students find the cheapest places to buy all their books collectively, rather than one at a time,” according to the Web site. That calculation includes shipping. Jonny Simkin, one of the sites’ co-founders, said the site currently searches Amazon, Half, Alibris, Abebooks, Chegg, BookRenter, eBooks.com, and Cengage Brain. The site, he added, has partnerships with “all the major booksellers,” which are slowly being added to the site. SwoopThat also helps students sell their books by searching online vendors for the highest buyback price. In addition, the site also has an online exchange for each school that helps students buy and sell books with people nearby. “When a student enters their courses and views their book list, they can compare prices between other local students and the Web,” Mr. Simkin said, “and if they want to buy from a local student, they just arrange a meeting place on or near campus.” Affordabook.com. This site, also created by a former undergraduate, compares prices from 15 textbook retailers on the Web, including Amazon.com, Chegg, Half.com, Ebay and several others. “I was frustrated with the university bookstores and how they charge hundreds for textbooks that you can find online for a fraction of the cost,” said Vincent Thomas, who created the site about five years ago when he was a junior at Virginia Tech. LocalTextbook.com is essentially an online classifieds section for textbooks, which aims to help students buy and sell books with other people on their campus; that way, everybody saves money on shipping costs. Still, it does cost something: you need to pay $3 to list each book (or, you can earn credits by referring friends to use the service). Right now, the listings on the Web site — created by a college senior — are located on only five campuses in Ohio, but they hope to expand this year. Open textbooks. These books are much less expensive than traditional textbooks, but it’s basically up to your professors to select them — if they don’t, you’re out of luck. “Professors can save students thousands by assigning open textbooks,” Ms. Allen of the Student PIRGs said. “That is why our campaign focuses on getting the word out to professors, and letting them know this is out there.” These books can be read online free, while hard copies are typically a fraction of the cost of traditional books. You can download the book to your computer or phone, or print a printable PDF. Hard copies typically cost $20 to $40, according to the Student PIRGs, either in the bookstore or online. In addition, the “open“ license typically gives professors more flexibility to tailor the material to fit a particular course by removing unneeded chapters or adding new material. The Student PIRGs site has a catalog of open textbooks and publishers (Flat World Knowledge, which offers open books, is also part of the “rebellion” coalition). The Student PIRGs list their own book-buying tips here. Have you started book shopping?

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/finding-fake-reviews-online.html?ref=amazoninc">Ferreting Out Fake Reviews Online<date>Published: August 19, 2011</date><text>In tens of millions of reviews on Web sites like Amazon.com, Citysearch, TripAdvisor and Yelp, new books are better than Tolstoy, restaurants are undiscovered gems and hotels surpass the Ritz.Or so the reviewers say. As online retailers increasingly depend on reviews as a sales tool, an industry of fibbers and promoters has sprung up to buy and sell raves for a pittance. “For $5, I will submit two great reviews for your business,” offered one entrepreneur on the help-for-hire site Fiverr, one of a multitude of similar pitches. On another forum, Digital Point, a poster wrote, “I will pay for positive feedback on TripAdvisor.” A Craigslist post proposed this: “If you have an active Yelp account and would like to make very easy money please respond.” The boundless demand for positive reviews has made the review system an arms race of sorts. As more five-star reviews are handed out, even more five-star reviews are needed. Few want to risk being left behind. Sandra Parker, a freelance writer who was hired by a review factory this spring to pump out Amazon reviews for $10 each, said her instructions were simple. “We were not asked to provide a five-star review, but would be asked to turn down an assignment if we could not give one,” said Ms. Parker, whose brief notices for a dozen memoirs are stuffed with superlatives like “a must-read” and “a lifetime’s worth of wisdom.” Determining the number of fake reviews on the Web is difficult. But it is enough of a problem to attract a team of Cornell researchers, who recently published a paper about creating a computer algorithm for detecting fake reviewers. They were instantly approached by a dozen companies, including Amazon, Hilton, TripAdvisor and several specialist travel sites, all of which have a strong interest in limiting the spread of bogus reviews. “The whole system falls apart if made-up reviews are given the same weight as honest ones,” said one of the researchers, Myle Ott. Among those seeking out Mr. Ott, a 22-year-old Ph.D. candidate in computer science, after the study was published was Google, which asked for his résumé, he said. Linchi Kwok, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who is researching social media and the hospitality industry, explained that as Internet shopping has become more “social,” with customer reviews an essential part of the sales pitch, marketers are realizing they must watch over those opinions as much as they manage any other marketing campaign. “Everyone’s trying to do something to make themselves look better,” he said. “Some of them, if they cannot generate authentic reviews, may hire somebody to do it.” Web retailers are aware of the widespread mood of celebration among their reviewers, even if they are reluctant to discuss it. Amazon, like other review sites, says it has a preponderance of positive reviews because of a feedback loop: Products with high-star ratings sell more, so they get more reviews than products with poor ratings. But they are concerned about the integrity of those reviews. “Any one review could be someone’s best friend, and it’s impossible to tell that in every case,” said Russell Dicker, Amazon’s director of community. “We are continuing to invest in our ability to detect these problems.” The Cornell researchers tackled what they call deceptive opinion spam by commissioning freelance writers on Mechanical Turk, an Amazon-owned marketplace for workers, to produce 400 positive but fake reviews of Chicago hotels. Then they mixed in 400 positive TripAdvisor reviews that they believed were genuine, and asked three human judges to tell them apart. They could not. “We evolved over 60,000 years by talking to each other face to face,” said Jeffrey T. Hancock, a Cornell professor of communication and information science who worked on the project. “Now we’re communicating in these virtual ways. It feels like it is much harder to pick up clues about deception.” So the team developed an algorithm to distinguish fake from real, which worked about 90 percent of the time. The fakes tended to be a narrative talking about their experience at the hotel using a lot of superlatives, but they were not very good on description. Naturally: They had never been there. Instead, they talked about why they were in Chicago. They also used words like “I” and “me” more frequently, as if to underline their own credibility. How far a business can go to get a good review is a blurry line. A high-end English hotel, The Cove in Cornwall, was recently accused in the British media of soliciting guests to post an “honest but positive review” on TripAdvisor in exchange for a future discount of 10 percent. Nearly all the recent reviews of the Cove are glowing except for the one headlined, “Sadly let down by overhyped reviews.” The hotel said it was a loyalty scheme that was being misconstrued. TripAdvisor, though, posted a warning about the Cove’s favorable notices on its page for the hotel. The site declined to say how often it has had to post such caveats. Founded 11 years ago, TripAdvisor never expected to see so many positive reviews. “We were worried it was going to be a gripe site,” said the chief executive, Stephen Kaufer. “Who the heck would bother to write a review except to complain?” Instead, the average of the 50 million reviews is 3.7 stars out of five, bordering on exceptional but typical of review sites. Negative reviews also abound on the Web; they are often posted on restaurant and hotel sites by business rivals. But as Trevor J. Pinch, a sociologist at Cornell who has just published a study of Amazon reviewers, said, “There is definitely a bias toward positive comments.” Mr. Pinch’s interviews with more than a hundred of Amazon’s highest-ranked reviewers found that only a few ever wrote anything critical. As one reviewer put it, “I prefer to praise the ones I love, not damn the ones I did not!” The fact that just about all the top reviewers in his study said they got free books and other material from publishers and others soliciting good notices may have also had something to do with it. Even if you get a failing grade or two, all is not lost. Dot-coms like Main Street Hub manage the reputations of small businesses for a fixed fee. “A courteous response to a negative review can persuade the reviewer to change their reviews from two to three or four stars,” said Main Street’s chief executive, Andrew Allison. “That’s one of the highest victories a local business can aspire to with respect to their critics.” The result, he said: “It’s like Lake Wobegon. Everyone is above average.”</text></article>

But Mr. Ferriss said in an interview, “I don’t feel like I’m giving up anything, financially or otherwise,” by signing with Amazon. Amazon has been publishing books for several years, but its efforts went up several notches in visibility when it brought in the longtime New York editor and agent Laurence Kirshbaum three months ago as head of Amazon Publishing. “I hope we can do some exciting, innovative things,” Mr. Kirshbaum said on Tuesday. “But I don’t want to overpromise.” Or get his friends in the business worried. “Our success will only help the rest of publishing,” he said. Traditional publishers do not necessarily believe that. Some are downright nervous about the intentions of Amazon, with its deep pockets and a unparalleled distribution system into tens of millions of living rooms and onto electronic devices. Some independent bookstores have already said they do not intend to carry any books from the retailer, not wanting to give a dollar to a company they feel is putting them out of business. Mr. Ferriss’s first book, “The 4-Hour Workweek,” has been on The New York Times Advice best-seller list for 84 weeks, and his second, “The 4-Hour Body,” for 33 weeks. Both are published by Crown, a division of Random House. Amazon will publish his next work, “The 4-Hour Chef,” in the spring — as a hardcover, an e-book and an audio book. The 34-year-old Ferriss is a natural choice to be the first Amazon Publishing writer. He is adept at new media (270,000 Twitter followers), expert at publicizing himself (the readers of Wired magazine gave him the self-promoter of the year award in 2008), and a start-up investor who sees nothing but shiny promise in technology. “Amazon has a one-to-one relationship with every one of their customers,” the writer said. “You can just imagine the possibilities that opens up.” Mr. Ferriss said he had approached Amazon about a book deal. Crown did not get a chance to match the offer because in the writer’s view, it never could have. “The opportunity to partner with a technology company that is embracing publishing is very different than partnering with a publisher embracing technology,” he said. Mr. Ferriss has risen to mass popularity by explaining to readers how to get the most change in their lives for the least amount of effort. His books promise to help readers lose pounds through “safe chemical cocktails” and odd food combinations, gain muscle in a month with only four hours of gym time, produce 15-minute female orgasms, and sleep two hours a day and feel fully rested. At a moment of great restlessness in publishing, Amazon is offering its own appealing shortcuts to fame and fortune. E-book sales are rising significantly, prompting struggles over royalty rates. Publishers are reluctant to raise them but writers have a useful wedge in Amazon, where they can self-publish and, at least in theory, make more. Jeff Belle, the Seattle-based vice president of Amazon Publishing, said writers were increasingly approaching Amazon — if not to sign up a book, at least to see how their sales could be improved. “There are a number of high-profile authors who reach out to us regularly,” he said. Other retailers, including Barnes &amp; Noble and Borders chains, have made occasional forays into publishing classics, but they have amounted to little. Amazon has much deeper pockets and a long-term strategy. Victoria Barnsley, chief executive of HarperCollins UK, told the BBC this week that Amazon’s foray into book publishing “is obviously a concern.” The retailer, she added, was both friend and enemy mixed together: “They are also a very important customer of ours and they have done fantastic things for the book industry. I have mixed views about them but there’s no doubt they are very, very powerful now and in fact they are getting close to being in a monopolistic situation.” Richard Curtis, a New York agent and longtime observer of the publishing scene, takes a slightly more benign view. “I’m not so convinced that this is the end of the world the way so many doomsayers are saying,” he said. “There is lots of conventional business being done by conventional publishers on conventional terms, and the books are being published on conventional paper with conventional royalties. What we’ll see for a long time is an amalgam of the two approaches, digital and traditional.”</text></article>

What’s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week. Around The World: Is It Safe to Do Business in Britain? Well, my family and I just returned from our vacation in England, and here’s what we saw. The Downgrade: Reviewing the Reviewers Standard &amp; Poor’s downgrades our debt. The S.&amp;P. chief says to cut entitlements. Jared Bernstein agrees with him. Michael Moore says to arrest him. Ezra Klein thinks S.&amp;P. got it right: “Those of us in Washington who would like to see the government work have long wondered when the business community and other entities who need a functioning political system would begin exerting a countervailing force.” Economics of Contempt thinks S.&amp;P. got it wrong: “They are, to put it very bluntly, idiots, and they deserve every bit of opprobrium coming their way.” A blogger says “let’s take a moment to remember that this shift to AA+ from AAA represents a healthy step (however slight) in the direction of reality and away from the fantasy created by the scores of dimwits that have held seat in Washington, D.C., over the past many decades.” S.&amp;P. also cuts the ratings on 11,000 municipal bond issues. Anita Campbell explains the impact of the downgrade on small businesses. China puts the United States on eBay. Jeff Miller gives the new deficit super-committee two-to-one odds of success. The Downgrade 2: How About an Upgrade? Speaking of downgrades, the Points Guy explains how to upgrade to first class without paying for it. The Data: Even the Sun’s Issuing Warnings Stocks went on a frenzied ride last week (if we’re in a bear market, let’s hope it’s this kind of bear). The Fed promises low interest rates and buoys the dollar. Gold soars. The Pulse of Commerce Index remains idle in July. Small-business optimism dips again. Quarterly non-farm productivity falls (pdf). The trade deficit expands. Forecasters predict severe solar storms. Job openings are unchanged. But ADP bets on small businesses to beat the dismal job reports, and unemployment applications hit a four-month low. The education bubble shows signs of bursting. But hold on, Dan Rather’s still betting on the U.S.A. And Larry Kudlow says it’s no time for panic: “It seems to me that the economy can hold up. It’s not the kind of rapid growth I’d like to see. But it’s not the deep and dark recession that seems to be embodied in the stock market plunge.” Hale Stewart sees signs of a rebound. San Antonio businesses are showing higher optimism. Red Tape Update: Fed Trucking Rules Could Be an Opportunity The Veterans Administration is cracking down after an internal audit showed it had awarded millions of dollars’ worth of contracts to companies that weren’t actually owned by veterans or were otherwise ineligible. Some feel that new restaurant menu rules are a major headache for small businesses. New federal trucking regulations could increase opportunities for independent truck drivers and the Obama administration says the new standards will save $50 billion. A brave man defends tax breaks for private jets: “A host of measurements show companies using business aviation outperform those without aircraft across every key financial and non-financial measure of success.” Hidden taxes on travelers add up. Barry Fisler, office comedian, introduces you to his work. Women: Talking the Talk A female entrepreneur explains why it’s important to hire women for your start-up. One reason: “Women are more detail-oriented and comprehensive. In 2006, Louann Brizendine’s controversial book, “The Female Brain,” claimed that women speak three times the number of words that men do. At a start-up, this is an asset.” A 12-year-old girl lets the music do the talking. Jessica Bennett explains why it’s tougher for women than men: “Sure, we outpace the guys around us in high school, college, and post-graduate degrees. But there’s a crucial shift that we’re leaving out when we talk about the ‘new gender gap’ — that when women reach a certain age, most of these trends reverse themselves.” John Stamos teaches guys how to cuddle. Success Strategies: Are You Weird and Explosive? Terry Starbucker offers 10 sticky-note reminders for the busy leader, such as “measure what you manage, and keep raising the bar.” Robert Cringely is upset by people’s online behavior and proposes an Internet civility plan. A guy works out of a 78-square-foot office in Manhattan. Recent studies show that overconfidence is a significant factor in increasing productivity. James Altucheron offers six surefire ways to dominate. An Intuit blogger lists five small-business contests worth entering. If your company is weird and explosive you could be eligible for $500,000. Small-business owners are turning to pawn shops. NASA picks a few small companies to build spaceships. Retail: Consumers Are Getting Smarter Retail sales rose the most in four months. First Data’s latest Spend Trend report shows consumers spent less on credit cards in July, started shopping more at value retailers, and purchased fewer discretionary items. A blogger says, “New research shows that consumers are finally making progress in improving their overall financial condition. To put it simply they are getting smarter about money.” PC World reports that instant coupons are changing the way small businesses offer discounts. A daily deal start-up raises $35 million. Groupon’s founders get behind a start-up that negotiates group prices. A new study reveals the nation’s top 10 consumer complaints and another says that American shoppers will spend more on good service. American consumers spend less than 2 percent on goods made in China. A new lid enhances the flavor of coffee. Around the World Two: How to Riot-Proof Your Business While British businesses tally the cost of last week’s damage, certain business owners find themselves riot-proof. HP and Intel partner to introduce the “Make IT Happen” campaign for Indian small and mid-sized businesses. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund announces a $2 million grant to cultivate small and growing businesses. Start-up: The Start-up Generation Is Ready! Anika Anand says the start-up generation is ready to fix the economy. The world’s largest start-up is now in the … Philippines? Neil Barron explains how to develop products that people like: “Observe potential customers as they go about their daily work activities. Keep an eye out for their challenges and difficulties. What is not working well for them could be a great opportunity for you.” G.E. sinks $40 million into solar. A venture capitalist points us to free places to get start-up money from the government. CRN reports that some cloud start-ups are getting big funding infusions. An entrepreneur asks for help in deciding between Harvard and starting a company. Technology: EC2 Goes Down Again CRN lists 10 mobile apps you’d want if you were stranded on a desert island. Amazon’s EC2 goes down again. Small Business Computing lists the top six Wi-Fi Android apps for small business. The London rioters prove that Blackberry is still relevant. Forty-five thousand Verizon workers go on strike. Visa announces plans to accelerate the migration to EMV contact and contact-less chip technology. David Valdez offers an update on I.T. legislation being considered in Washington. The Week Ahead: Treasury International Capital releases post-downgrade long-term purchase numbers, which show domestic and international demand for United Sates Treasuries, on Monday at 9 a.m. Other numbers coming out this week include producer and consumer prices, leading indicators and housing starts. This Week’s Bests Way to Sleep Better With Technology Lifehacker’s Adam Dachis explains how technology helps him sleep better: “There are a few sleep-tracking tools that actually provide you with a pretty good picture of what’s happening while you’re unconscious. While these tools may not be as detailed as a sleep clinic, they can give you a good overview of how restful the night was and you can use this information to figure out what causes sleep problems for you and how you can have a more restful night.” New Way to Find Happiness Henri Juntilla offers seven steps to improve your happiness, for example: “Embrace Death. What is it that you really want to do with your life? What are some of the excuses, fears, and obstacles that are stopping you from doing that? And how do you think you can overcome those and start moving toward what it is that your heart truly wants? If you answer the above questions seriously, you may just find yourself strangely motivated to start taking action. There’s nothing like following your heart when it comes to feeling happy and joyful.” See the Silver Lining Pamela Slim says there are upsides to economic constraints: “The global economy just delivered us a handy set of economic constraints. There is less time to dilly-dally on the road to building a business. You need to take action today. There are fewer fat pockets of easy money. You need to identify and dig deeply into the profitable veins of the market. There is less tolerance for poor performance or mediocre employees. You must step up your game or be moved out.” Question: Do you agree that economic constraints can help you focus on what’s important in your business?

FOR years, neurotic book writers have checked their Amazon best-seller rankings by the hour. Am I 200,572 in popularity? Or up to 200,571? But now, the mind game has gone to the next level. Amazon has begun letting writers check weekly print sales figures from retailers around the country, by city and region. That’s a blow to the power of book publishers (and some agents), who pay thousands of dollars annually for such numbers. The publishers have tended to hold those close to the vest, partly because otherwise writers would call every 45 seconds for updates and drive everyone in the publishing process batty. But, still, it seems like an effort by Amazon to make writers less dependent on publishers. Take, for instance, a hypothetical writer — say, me, the guy pathetically sitting at his computer every Friday this summer waiting for Amazon to dispense sales numbers for my techno-thriller “Devil’s Plaything.” The statistics allow me to determine which major metropolitan areas to blame or credit for my self-esteem. I discovered that I had sold 1,371 copies in Los Angeles in the last eight weeks, 417 in Portland, and 47 in Nashville. And what of the Denver area? Four hundred and twenty-nine? My parents and in-laws live there. Couldn’t they have knocked on a few more doors? The book won’t sell itself in St. Louis (65), where my father-in-law must know someone from childhood. Would it help if I rewrote the first chapter to mention Missouri? I concede: Amazon’s not trying to torture authors, but cozy up to us. The sales numbers, compiled by Nielsen BookScan, are part of a program called Author Central that also allows authors to post promotional videos, photos, blogs and event notices. Amazon started giving the sales figures privately to authors in December, expanded the program in April to include eight weeks worth of sales data and, it says, plans further perks soon. Amazon also includes a map of the United States, each region color-coded for sales density. The map rivals the interactive maps on CNN on election night. Strong support from the Eastern Seaboard could put you on the best-seller list. Phoenix thinks you should concede and take up a trade! It’s part of Amazon’s broader courtship of authors, leading, in some cases, to publishing deals. Amazon has recently started new imprints for print books and even hired Laurence Kirshbaum, former head of Time Warner Books, to run one of them. And for e-books, Amazon is offering better royalty rates to writers who sign up with it, rather than with traditional publishers. Some in publishing fear these moves, worrying that Amazon will turn into Godzilla, with traditional publishers serving as the city underfoot (it already has brick-and-mortar book stores squished in its toes). Unsurprisingly, Russ Grandinetti, vice president for Kindle content at Amazon, disagrees. Most of its business comes from traditional publishers, he says, and befriending writers simply prompts them to add more content and, in turn, enhance their sales and Amazon’s retail experience. As to whether the sales figures might also turn writers into statistic-obsessed loons, Mr. Grandinetti laughs: “I’m responsible for a lot of things. You’ll have to take responsibility for that one.”</text></article>

One day after Philip Levine was named the next poet laureate, his books have quickly sold out in bookstores and online retailers, making it nearly impossible to immediately acquire copies of some collections of his poems. On the Amazon.com “Movers and Shakers” list, which tracks books that are growing the most quickly in popularity, two by Mr. Levine were at the top of the list: “What Work Is,” a collection of poems that won a National Book Award, and “The Simple Truth,” a collection that won a Pulitzer Prize. Both books are backordered and not available to ship for at least six days. Other books are backordered for at least one to three weeks. Bookstores, which have also reported a large number of requests for Mr. Levine’s work, tend to not keep large numbers of poetry books in reserve since sales are generally so modest. A spokeswoman for Knopf said the publisher is rushing to print more copies of his books and expects to meet all of the demand within 10 days. Mr. Levine, who is 83, has written some 20 collections of poems. For at least one recent collection, “News of the World,” the e-book edition is available immediately.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/amazon-releases-web-based-kindle-app-and-store/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Releases Web-based Kindle App and Store<date>August 10, 2011, 3:43 pm</date><text>screenshot via Amazon Apple has a knack for turning friends into frenemies. Amazon quickly became a frenemy last year when Apple instituted a new rule in the iTunes App Store requiring publishers, including book sellers, to pay Apple 30 percent of revenues from the sale of books sold through the App Store. To ensure companies did not try to usurp these fees, Apple also refused to approve publisher apps that took readers to external bookstores on the Web. Digital Media Staying entertained and informed when you are online. On Wednesday Amazon released a creative loophole to this problem with a new product called Kindle Cloud Reader. The new reader is a Web app that works within a browser using the interactive Web programming language, HTML5. The Kindle Cloud Reader offers the full functionality of a downloadable application, including offline reading. Most importantly for Amazon, the Kindle Cloud Reader also allows customers to buy books directly from within a browser without having to adhere to any of Apple’s rules. Amazon said in a press release that the Web application had been designed specifically for the Apple iPad’s touch interface, too. As a result, the reader feels extremely similar to the downloadable Kindle app available in the iTunes App Store. Readers can adjust font size, highlight text, swipe a finger to change pages and sync their current page number to other devices. The Kindle Cloud Reader bookstore is seamless and simple, too. Readers can purchase a book from directly within the browser and begin reading it instantly. With a few tricks people can also display the app at full screen on an iPad, completely hiding the Web browser navigation. Amazon’s latest Web-based app is already adding discourse to the debate over the future of the Web. As downloadable applications have mushroomed over the last few years, publishers and app makers have questioned if consumers will primarily interact with media content on tablets and smartphones through downloadable apps. Or, as Amazon is demonstrating with the Kindle Cloud Reader, if HTML5 Web sites that look and feel like applications will become dominant online. “We are definitely seeing the emergence of HTML5 as a tool to break out of the walled garden. This is an important milestone in the Web versus App debate,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst with the research firm IDC, in an e-mail message. Mr. Hilwa noted that Apple’s restrictions on magazine and book publishers had forced companies like Amazon to explore Web-based applications to circumvent the App Store restrictions and would do more to “lift the fortunes of HTML5 as way of delivering apps.” The Kindle Cloud Reader is currently available on the iPad and through Safari and Chrome Web browsers on a Mac or PC computer. Amazon said on its Web site that the “Kindle Cloud Reader would be available on additional web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, the BlackBerry PlayBook browser, and other mobile browsers, in the coming months.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/29/business/media/in-deal-with-nbc-amazon-seeks-to-widen-its-video-streaming-service.html?ref=amazoninc">In Deal With NBC, Amazon Seeks to Widen Its Video Streaming Service<date>Published: July 28, 2011</date><text>Amazon, the online retailing giant, announced a deal with NBCUniversal for access to part of Universal Pictures’ film library on Thursday, its second such pact in the streaming video space in as many weeks.The attention around its content acquisitions suggests a budding rivalry with Netflix and a strategy of stocking up on films and TV shows for the tablet computer that the company is developing. Much like Apple, Amazon wants to have an assortment of content available for owners of the forthcoming device. The NBC deal gives Amazon nonexclusive access to films like “Elizabeth,” “Babe” and “Billy Elliott.” Last week, Amazon and CBS announced a similar deal that lets Amazon stream about 2,000 episodes of older TV shows like “The Tudors” and “Medium.” In both cases the content is available through Amazon Prime, a $79-a-year membership service that gives buyers free two-day shipping. The five-month-old streaming service is available at no additional cost for members. Amazon is just one of the Internet companies that is seeking to compete more directly with Netflix, which has about 25 million subscribers, many of whom stream films and TV shows, but which may look vulnerable this summer and fall as it imposes a price increase for some subscribers. Netflix acknowledged in its earnings letter to shareholders this week that both Amazon and Hulu Plus, the subscription arm of Hulu, are in the marketplace, but noted that it has “vastly more streaming content” than Amazon and has many more customers than either service. “So far, we haven’t detected an impact on our business from Amazon Prime,” the letter from Netflix stated. For media companies, the suitors are welcome. At the time of the Amazon-CBS deal, Anthony DiClemente of Barclays Capital said that he believed CBS was in talks with other online distributors for similar deals, citing Microsoft, Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, as potential partners. Given that multiple online distributors are bidding for such content, “we remain of the belief that digital media distribution is an incremental boon to core film/TV studio economics, as media content owners like CBS continue to benefit from the simple laws of supply and demand,” Mr. DiClemente wrote in an analyst note.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/technology/amazons-earnings-beat-expectations-even-as-profits-fall.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s Earnings Beat Expectations, Even as Profits Fall<date>Published: July 26, 2011</date><text>For Amazon.com, down is the new up.The Internet retailer said Tuesday that its second-quarter profit dropped by 8 percent, which might seem like bad news. But the decline was not nearly as much as Amazon, or analysts, had expected, and the profit was being sacrificed for what the company said was a good cause — new investments in technology and warehouses. Revenue continued to be strong, rising 51 percent. Three months ago, Amazon predicted that second-quarter profits might fall by as much as two-thirds. But the company is apparently selling so many things to so many people that it can make sizable investments and barely feel the pain. In after-hours trading, investors celebrated by pushing the stock up $13.57, to $227.75. Amazon shares have quadrupled in recent years. “Low prices, expanding selection, fast delivery and innovation are driving the fastest growth we’ve seen in over a decade,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said in a statement. So what if expenses soared and profit margins shrank? Amazon has never emphasized profit as some short-term investors might have wished. It took years to turn a profit because it was working so hard to achieve a dominant position in Web retailing. That distinction was achieved long ago; now it is once again spending heavily to solidify and extend its position — mostly by building two kinds of storage centers, for physical goods and for data. Three weeks ago, Amazon announced it would open a 900,000-square-foot warehouse in Plainfield, Ind., its fourth in Indiana. The next day it announced its fourth warehouse in Arizona, this one a 1.2 million-square-foot behemoth in Phoenix. The original 2011 plan was to open nine new fulfillment centers. Thomas J. Szkutak, the company’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts Tuesday afternoon after the results were announced, that the total had risen to 15, “and we’re actually planning on a few more than that.” He said the number of pre-2011 centers was “in the low 50s.” The Seattle-based company is also expected to follow the success of its Kindle e-reader by introducing a multipurpose tablet this fall. The tablet will allow users to read the electronic books they bought from Amazon, listen to the music they bought from Amazon and watch video they bought from Amazon, all on one device. The company reported that net income for the quarter fell to $191 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $207 million, or 45 cents a share, in the second quarter of 2010. The comparison would have been worse, but the latest quarter’s results were helped by a $15 million investment gain. Revenue rose to $9.91 billion. Favorable foreign exchange rates contributed $477 million to the 2011 sales results. Analysts had expected second-quarter earnings of 35 cents a share on revenue of $9.373 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. During the conference call, at least one analyst offered his congratulations. When Amazon reported in April that its net income in the first quarter was down an unexpected 33 percent from 2010, it simultaneously squelched expectations for the second quarter. Two bad quarters are the beginning of a trend, but investors bid up the stock price about 10 percent in the last three months. The market value of Amazon at Tuesday’s close was $100 billion. Amazon recently achieved a milestone with regard to its original business, bookselling. In May, less than four years after the introduction of the Kindle, the company said it was selling more e-books than physical books. Last week, as if to punctuate the quickening transition to digital, came the news that the Borders chain of bookstores was liquidating. When Amazon began mailing books to Internet buyers in 1995, Borders reigned as the Amazon of the era; it was smart, dominant and feared. But despite Borders’s selling many copies of “The Innovator’s Dilemma,” Clayton Christensen’s classic work on how successful companies ignore disruptive technologies at their peril, it seems as if no one at the chain may have read it. Borders essentially ignored the Internet, and the Internet mowed it down. Mr. Bezos has always been determined not to be out-innovated. The new tablet will put the company into direct competition with Apple and its iPad, plus a clutch of would-be iPads from other companies. “Their e-book success is enormous but their success with digital video and music is not so enormous,” said Bill Rosenblatt of GiantSteps Media Technology Strategies, a consulting firm. “They need to do something to address the fact that people are using media consumption devices that handle everything.” It will be an uphill battle to take on Apple and the others, Mr. Rosenblatt said, but he would not count Amazon out. In the meantime, the retailer once again warned that profits would suffer because it was investing in the future. It said Tuesday that operating income could decline in the third quarter by as much as 93 percent.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/us/25iht-EDUCBRIEFS25.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon to Start Renting Out Electronic College Textbooks<date>Published: July 24, 2011</date><text>Amazon, which started selling books over the Internet in 1995, and which today says it has the world’s biggest selection of items for sale, is entering the rental market for electronic college textbooks. The company announced last week that electronic versions of textbooks would be available for rent for periods of between 30 and 360 days. Once books are rented, the lending period can be extended by as little as a day. “Tens of thousands of textbooks are available for the 2011 school year,” according to a press release from Amazon, from publishers including John Wiley &amp; Sons, Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis. Amazon claims that rentals can save students up to 80 percent compared with the original price. Student notes and annotations can be stored by Amazon, even after the rental period expires, to use when the textbook is either re-rented or bought, according to a company statement. The electronic textbooks can be downloaded to and read on Kindle, Amazon’s portable electronic reader. With Kindle reading software for PC, Mac, iPad and various smartphones, the textbooks will also be accessible to customers using other platforms. Elsevier, a publisher that specializes in scientific text books, is one of the major textbook publishers involved with the new rental option, through which it will offer some 3,000 electronic titles. “Elsevier sees eBook Rentals as a valuable new e-distribution model,” Ammy Vogtlander, Elsevier’s vice president for Web strategy and business development, said in a statement. — CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE   South Korea plans to open 10 language schools abroad South Korea plans to open 10 new foreign-language schools abroad, according to a government spokesman. Hyeju Kim, who directs the language policy division at the Culture Ministry, said the aim was to “make a model that can teach Korean language and introduce Korean culture to non-Koreans systematically and effectively.” The schools, which are to open in September in France, China, Thailand, Russia, Vietnam, Nepal, Bangladesh, Uzbekistan and Cambodia, will be run by Sejong Hakdang, Korea’s national language foundation. According to the Ministry, the schools will follow Sejong Hakdang teaching guidelines and will use a standardized textbook, ensuring uniform teaching quality. The schools will be partially funded by the Korean Government and partially by student tuition fees, Ms. Kim said. — CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/the-amazon-android-tablet-conundrums/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon's Tough Decisions on Its Android Tablet<date>July 14, 2011, 12:30 pm</date><text>Illustration by Nick Bilton/The New York Times Waiting for Amazon to sell a full-fledged tablet feels like waiting for the grass to grow: we know it’s going to happen, but it’s taking an awfully long time. As we have reported over the last year, Amazon has been readying a color screen tablet that will run the Google Android operating system. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, has even acknowledged that a tablet project is in the works, saying earlier this year that the company was actively working on a “multipurpose tablet device.” According to a person who works with Amazon and asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly by the company, Amazon has struggled with a number of issues while building its upcoming tablet. The company’s choice to pick Android in the upcoming tablet, for example, was not an easy one. Internally, executives at Lab 126, the division of Amazon which makes the Kindle e-reader line, debated the pros and cons of an Amazon tablet running Android versus Amazon building its own operating system based on the existing Kindle platform. One of the goals with the Kindle tablet is to enable Amazon to deliver its own rich media services, including its cloud music and streaming video products to Kindle customers. Yet the Android platform already offers the same services through Google and other third party companies. Executives worried that putting Android on an Amazon tablet would be like opening a new music and video store on a city street already packed with dozens of other music and video stores. In the end, Amazon realized that if it created its own operating system for its upcoming tablet, it would need to entice developers to build apps on yet another platform. Developers are eager to build for Apple, as evidenced by the over 100,000 apps that are available  for the iPad, and they build for Android, which has hundreds of thousands of apps available for tablets and mobile phones. Hewlett-Packard, with its webOS, and Research in Motion, also with its own operating system, are having a harder time winning developer’s time and they have far fewer apps. If the Kindle wants to compete with Apple and its highly popular iPad, Amazon realized that it needed to offer services and products beyond just video, music and books. It also has to give customers access to games, social applications and other third party products. Amazon also ran into trouble with the touchscreen technology it planned to use in the upcoming tablet. Last year, the company purchased Touchco, a multitouch project that grew out of the Media Research Lab at New York University. Touchco uses a technology called interpolating force-sensitive resistance, which is extremely inexpensive, costing as little as $10 a square foot. But engineers have had trouble integrating the technology into the Kindle e-readers because it can reduce the intensity and crispness of the screen. Amazon has also been working hard to offer a device that is competitively priced compared to other tablets. The person who works the company said Amazon planned to offer its Kindle tablet at a lower price than the Apple iPad, which costs from $500 to $830 depending on memory size and 3G abilities. To do this, Amazon is building its tablet with the bare necessities inside. Limiting memory capacity, peripherals and choosing to skip a built-in camera in the device, the person said. According to an Amazon executive with close ties to Mr. Bezos, who could not be named because of his senior role in the company, Mr. Bezos made a decision after the iPad was introduced to try to lure customers onto the Kindle platform by offering less expensive devices. This can be seen with the company’s price reduction of the Kindle e-reader over the last year. The third-generation Kindle now starts at $140, compared to the original, which sold for $400. Amazon also hopes to entice customers to its new tablet by offering competitive wireless 3G pricing. Although Apple originally offered unlimited access to AT&amp;T’s wireless 3G on the iPad, the company discontinued this pricing option months after the iPad was introduced. Apple customers have complained that the current 3G pricing options for the iPad were too expensive.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/technology/amazon-takes-sales-tax-war-to-california.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Takes Sales Tax War to California<date>Published: July 13, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon, the world’s largest online merchant, has an ambitious and far-reaching new agenda: it wants to rewrite tax policy for the Internet era.Amazon said this week that it would push a voter initiative in California that could eliminate sales tax for virtual sellers with only a modest physical presence in the state. Its move instantly escalated the company’s long-running battle with many states over collecting sales tax, taking the question directly to voters. And it has sharply intensified its dispute with physical retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Target, which have vowed to fight the measure. Some political science and business professors say the conflict could take on the polarizing nature of Proposition 13, a decades-old referendum that limited property tax increases and remains a lightning rod in the state. Political experts say Amazon’s proposed referendum is likely to gather the signatures necessary to appear on the ballot as early as next February. Nancy F. Koehn, a retail historian at the Harvard Business School, said the initiative highlighted the evolution of Internet retailing into a “major highway of commerce.” Internet shopping “is no longer a small, out-of-the way quirky tributary of shopping,” she said, adding: “It’s the fastest-growing distribution channel in America. This is a referendum on how we’re going to treat it.” She said that what happened in California could catch on in other states and have a domino effect. Ms. Koehn, who opposes the idea of exempting online retailers from sales tax, said the stakes were amplified by the fact that state budgets, already under duress, needed the hundreds of millions of dollars in potential tax generated by online retailers. “Do we really want online retailers big and small to walk through a gaping door that says ‘You don’t have to pay sales tax’?” she said. “I don’t think we want to send the message that companies can fund a political campaign for a referendum and maybe your customers won’t be subject to sales tax.” Amazon argues that such sales tax, even if it raises revenue, ultimately hurts investment and job growth. “Californians deserve a voice and a choice about jobs, investment and the state’s economic future,” Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice president of global public policy, said in a statement about the referendum. The referendum is a response to a California law, passed last month, that requires Internet retailers to pay sales tax if they have affiliates or subsidiaries in the state. State officials estimate Amazon will owe $83 million in taxes this year, nearly half of the $200 million the state estimates Internet retailers owe over all. Amazon says the law penalizes companies that have not traditionally been subject to sales tax. Big retailers are already organizing and financing opposition. They complain that Amazon has an unfair advantage because it does not collect sales tax from shoppers while other retailers must add in the extra cost, which in California starts at 7.25 percent. “They need to play by the same rules as everybody else,” said Danny Diaz, a spokesman for the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, a coalition of large and small retailers that is agitating for Amazon to pay sales tax. In a signal of how the political arguments might line up, William R. Harker, senior vice president of Sears Holdings, which owns Sears and Kmart, said in an interview, “At a time where our state and municipal governments are going through really a fiscal crisis, taking steps to collect taxes that are already on the books is to me the fiscally responsible thing to do.” The question of how to tax out-of-state retailers is a longstanding one, dating back to the popularity of catalog shopping. Courts have ruled that companies without a physical presence in a given state are exempt from collecting sales tax there. Individual consumers are supposed to declare what they owe in so-called use tax when they file taxes, but most people do not. 1 2 Next Page » Stephanie Clifford contributed reporting from New York.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/12/technology/amazon-backs-end-to-online-sales-tax-in-california.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Backs End to Online Sales Tax in California<date>Published: July 11, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon said Monday that it would back a California ballot initiative that would roll back a new state law that forces more online retailers to collect sales tax. Amazon’s decision to support the proposed referendum pits the world’s biggest online retailer against the state government, which is looking for ways to raise additional revenue to cover budget shortfalls. The California legislature last month passed a law, now in effect, requiring online retailers to collect sales tax just like merchants physically located in the state. The law was intended to close a loophole that let online retailers sell their wares but not collect and pay sales tax to the state. Two weeks ago, Amazon, hoping it could comply with the new law and still avoid collecting taxes, severed ties with thousands of California businesses whose Web sites linked to products on its site. California officials say that move does not free it of this year’s tax obligation, estimated at $83 million. “At a time when businesses are leaving California, it is important to enact policies that attract and encourage business, not drive it away,” said Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice president of public policy. He also called Amazon’s antisales tax position “a referendum on jobs and investment in California.” Evan Westrup, a spokesman for Gov. Jerry Brown, said Monday that, “Amazon should be spending less time punishing its affiliates, threatening lawsuits and collecting signatures and more time doing what every other retailer does in California every day.” The collection of online sales tax by states facing budget deficits is an issue that threatens to spill across the country. Amazon has been at loggerheads in various states. The company has severed ties with affiliates in some states, including Illinois, and is in the process of closing a warehouse in Texas. Amazon currently collects sales tax in New York, even though it says it does not have a physical presence in the state. But it is challenging the state’s law as unconstitutional. Legally, Californians are still responsible for sales tax even when retailers do not collect it. When filing their tax forms, residents are supposed to declare what they owe in so-called use tax. Most don’t, and the state argues that the growth of online shopping is leading to an ever greater loss of revenue. The state Board of Equalization, California’s tax collector, estimates the unpaid taxes at $1.15 billion in the last fiscal year, and estimates it will grow to almost $1.2 billion this year and $1.27 billion in 2012. At the heart of the issue is what constitutes a company’s physical presence. The new California law expands the definition of physical presence to potentially include Amazon subsidiaries, like an office in Cupertino that designs the Kindle book reader and another in Studio City that handles online advertising. Under the law, if Amazon fails to pay any taxes owed to California, it would be required to pay penalties and interest, like any other tax scofflaw. Its first payment would be due by Oct. 31.  Amazon says it supports a simplified sales tax structure that would be applied evenly across the country, which would require cooperation from federal and state governments. Some state officials say the issue is about more than just tax revenue. They say it’s about fairness to local retailers competing against Amazon but with the added cost to consumers of sales tax. Supporters of the proposed initiative must now gather around 505,000 signatures to qualify it for the ballot, according to the secretary of state. A vote could occur during the next statewide election in February 2012. “Where does Amazon plan to collect these signatures — in front of bricks and mortar retailers that collect sales tax everyday?” asked Mr. Westrup.</text></article>

Next up: Wag.com, which sells pet supplies. Wag.com sells 10,000 pet items like food, litter, toys, clothing and grooming supplies. Wag.com, introduced Wednesday, sells 10,000 pet items like food, litter, toys, clothing and grooming supplies. Quidsi, which was acquired by Amazon.com for $500 million last year, also runs Diapers.com for baby supplies, Soap.com for drugstore items and BeautyBar.com for cosmetics. The sites, especially Wag.com, bring to mind Pets.com, a company that came to epitomize the last tech bubble. It also delivered pet supplies and, like the other bubble-era failures Kozmo.com and Webvan.com, lost money on each customer because it spent so much on inventory, warehouses and shipping. But technological developments in the last decade and an emphasis on reining in costs have changed the e-commerce model, say Vinit Bharara and Marc Lore, Quidsi’s founders. Quidsi obsesses about logistics and built warehouse technology like robots that choose the size of box an order requires and fill it from the warehouse. And Quidsi only offers free shipping above a certain price. The economics of selling pet food online have also improved, Mr. Lore said. People buy more organic pet food now, which costs more per pound, so shipping costs as a percent of revenue are lower. Still, shipping bulky items at low prices “has always been expensive and it still is,” Mr. Bharara said. To make up for that, Quidsi focuses on nurturing long-term customers. “That pays out much more in the long run than the transient connection you may acquire when you make a ton of money by delivering one product to one customer once,” he said. For instance, Diapers.com and the other sites pride themselves on a large selection, easy shopping and customer service perks like round-the-clock representatives available by phone and overnight or two-day shipping. As a result, the sites have built an impressive audience since Diapers.com started in 2005. Meanwhile, their competition has shrunk. Walmart.com remains a competitor, but Amazon bought Quidsi and Drugstore.com was gobbled up in March by Walgreens. Since buying Quidsi, Amazon has let the company continue to operate mostly on its own in Jersey City, but Quidsi has benefited from things like Amazon’s lower shipping rates, Mr. Lore said. Quidsi tried to make Wag.com easy to navigate, Mr. Lore said. For instance, once pet owners indicate what type of pet they have, they only see products for dogs or fish on the site. Customers can shop across all Quidsi’s site and make the purchase from the same online shopping cart. Quidsi plans to keep expanding. It is building Yoyo.com to sell toys and other sites to appeal to busy mothers, Mr. Lore said.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/amazon-com-fights-california-tax-collectors/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon.com Fights California Tax Collectors<date>June 30, 2011, 7:43 pm</date><text>Californians will have to start paying sales tax on their purchases from Amazon.com starting Friday after Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation earlier this week requiring online retailers to collect the tax. Paul Sakuma/Associated PressA United Parcel Service driver delivers packages from Amazon.com in Palo Alto, Calif. At least, that is what California’s tax authority says. The law had said that an online retailer needed to collect taxes on purchases if it had a physical presence, or a nexus, in a particular state. Any retailer with an office or warehouse qualified. Amazon had no such facility in California. So the state changed the law. California legislators passed a bill that broadened the definition of a nexus. A company’s affiliates and subsidiaries would qualify as a physical presence. Amazon quickly responded on Wednesday by cutting off thousands of affiliates, those third-party Web sites that display links to Amazon products. It is a step Amazon has taken in a number of other states. The company said that that law did not apply to its business and that it had no plans to collect taxes starting Friday, or any other day. “This legislation is counterproductive and will not cause our retail business to collect sales tax for the state,” Mary Osako, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. The stakes are high for Amazon, which until now has avoided collecting sales tax in California since the company’s founding in 1994. By not collecting taxes, Amazon can have a price advantage over its rivals, most of whom collect sales tax from customers. States with tight budgets are increasingly looking at Amazon and other online retailers as potential sources of tax revenue. Amazon, in fact, is engaged in battles on the issue across the country. Until recently, Amazon avoided the issue in California, the most populous state, by building its facilities elsewhere. The responsibility for paying the tax was therefore left to its customers, who are supposed to declare on their state tax form any purchases they make. The reality, however, is that most people never volunteer the information. California estimates that it is missing out on close to $1.2 billion from all sources, including online retailers. The new law is supported by many big bricks-and-mortar retailers, who complain that Amazon has an unfair advantage by not collecting the tax. California’s new law goes further by including related companies, or subsidiaries in its definition of a nexus. Several Amazon subsidiaries have offices in California like A9, which works on search technology, and Lab126, which designs Kindle digital book readers. Amazon has argued that considering subsidiaries a physical presence for another company is unconstitutional. Amazon did not respond to an e-mail asking whether it planned to file a lawsuit. Ms. Osako said that Amazon had no plans to close those offices. Betty T. Yee, a member of the California Board of Equalization, the state authority for sales tax collection, said that it expected the state would collect an additional $200 million annually from the new law. However, she expects Amazon to fight the law in court. “The state is going to be very vigilant,” Ms. Yee said.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/us/24ttramsey.html?ref=amazoninc">Let’s Make a Deal, Amazon Tells Texas<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>In the middle of a fight with Texas tax collectors over book sales in the state, Amazon offered Thursday to invest $300 million in five or six warehouse and distribution centers in the state, employing 6,000 people, if lawmakers would let the company operate for four-and-a-half years without collecting sales taxes.Texas has granted sales tax rebates to companies on goods and services they buy, but has apparently never allowed one to stop collecting taxes from its own customers. The Texas Retailers Association blasted the proposed Amazon deal as a carve-out that would leave the state’s brick-and-mortar stores at a disadvantage to the giant Internet retailer. Gov. Rick Perry wants the deal and has contacted lawmakers to promote it, a spokesman said. And the statutory change that it would require is in the hands of House and Senate negotiators who are putting the last touches on a piece of legislation critical to balancing the state budget. Lawmakers have balked, and what might have been a team effort between the governor and the state’s top tax collector, Comptroller Susan Combs, is complicated by an earlier skirmish over Amazon and Mr. Perry’s veto of legislation that would have moved technology procurements into Ms. Combs’s shop. Last year, Ms. Combs hit Amazon with a $269 million tax bill, saying its distribution center in Irving establishes a legal footprint that requires it to collect sales taxes from Texas customers. The company disagrees, and Mr. Perry, asked about the case earlier this year, took Amazon’s side and said he wouldn’t have billed the company. Online, mail order and other direct sellers without physical operations in the state, or “nexus,” don’t have to collect sales taxes from their Texas customers. During the regular legislative session, lawmakers approved a change to the sales tax laws that would have established nexus for any company owning more than 50 percent of an affiliate or subsidiary in the state. It wouldn’t even have to be related to the company’s main business. An out-of-state mail order company with nothing in Texas but a bait shop on the coast would be on the hook for collecting sales taxes. Mr. Perry vetoed the bill, saying the state should wait until there had been more talk “about interstate commerce and the structure of state sales taxes in the 21st century” before changing the law. Lawmakers were already in special session when he announced his veto. Representative John Otto, Republican of Dayton, responded by adding the sales-tax provision to a critical fiscal bill needed to balance the 2012-13 state budget. That raises the question of whether Mr. Perry will veto the fiscal bill to kill the provision. In the meantime, Amazon made its tax proposition. Mr. Perry likes it because it would, in the words of Mark Miner, his spokesman, “create more jobs than the Caterpillar deal or Toyota” — two earlier headline-grabbing economic deals in Texas. Amazon made a similar deal, under similar circumstances, with South Carolina last month. In Texas, in its latest iteration of the proposal, the company agreed to create 6,000 full-time jobs with full health care benefits over the next three years and to invest $300 million in new warehouse and distribution centers over that same period. In return, the state would agree to let Amazon go four and one-half years without collecting sales taxes from its customers in Texas. “Collecting” is the key word, because Amazon’s customers still owe the money whether the company collects it or not. Under state law, sales taxes are collected from customers by sellers and turned over to the state. In the proposed deal, Amazon agreed to print the amount of tax due on customer invoices and e-mail confirmations, but it would be up to the customers to then, of their own volition, pay the state what they owed. The deal, as proposed, would expire at the beginning of 2016. Curiously, Ms. Combs said the Amazon deal would cost the state nothing. On the one hand, she has got a pending tax case against the company that says its failure to remit sales taxes costs the state about $70 million annually. And Mr. Otto’s bill would have brought in $16 million over the next two years, by Ms. Combs’s official estimate. But giving the company a break for the next two years is a freebie, apparently. “Our current revenue estimate does not assume that Amazon will either voluntarily or be compelled to collect taxes during the 2012-13 biennium, so there is no loss to the estimate from the agreement,” a Combs spokesman said via e-mail. He left out whether the deal would make it harder to collect the $269 million in back taxes. rramsey@texastribune.org</text></article>

Invests in 10 Home Energy Start-Ups<date>June 23, 2011, 8:29 am</date><text>Fred Prouser/Reuters Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of General Electric, discusses his company’s ecomagination project in Los Angeles in 2007. General Electric, the huge global conglomerate, has entrepreneurial aspirations. On Thursday, the company announced $63 million of investments in 10 home energy companies as part of its so-called ecomagination Challenge. The initiative, announced last July, is a $200 million commitment to invest and develop partnerships with promising clean technology start-ups. The company along with its venture capital partners — Emerald Technology Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, RockPort Capital, the Carbon Trust and Foundation Capital — have so far deployed $134 million. “It allows us to connect to these incredible, innovative companies,” said Mark L. Vachon, the vice president of G.E.’s ecomagination effort. “We can help get these ideas faster into the commercialization process.” Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink For General Electric, which spent $1.5 billion in 2009 on clean technology research and development, the program is a low-cost way to identify promising start-ups with potentially breakthrough technologies. So far, it has made 22 investments and one acquisition, FMC-Tech, a power grid technology company. The latest batch of investments includes GMZ Energy, a company that helps convert heat to energy, and Hara, an energy management software maker. Kleiner Perkins, an early backer of Google and Amazon, participated in both financing rounds. While it is still unclear what these investments will yield, G.E. announced on Thursday that it was planning to expand the program. It will open a similar ecomagination Challenge in China later this year that will represent about $100 million in financial commitments. In addition, it is partnering with the Carbon Trust to establish a $5 million seed fund in Europe for clean technology start-ups. According to Mr. Vachon, General Electric may eventually apply the ecomagination Challenge strategy (of investing in a broad swath of early stage companies with venture captial firms) to other parts of the company. “This platform has a lot of applications, it could work with other parts of G.E.’s portfolio,” Mr. Vachon said. “We’ll start with China, and that will certainly keep us busy for awhile.”</text></article>

But it lacked one major feature: mobile access. Now Sony has made Qriocity available on Android phones through an app, making it a competitor to subscription services like Rhapsody and to the new cloud music programs from Amazon, Google and Apple. Sony’s two-tiered pricing plan for Qriocity (pronounced “curiosity”) is unchanged. For $4 a month, users can listen to music through programmed channels and have access to a “scan and match” music locker, which, like Apple’s new iCloud, gives users access to songs without the sometimes laborious process of uploading them. At Qriocity’s $10 premium level, music is available “on demand,” meaning that any song a listener chooses can be listened to at any time. One drawback, however, is that unlike many other subscription services, Qriocity can only be used when listener has an Internet connection; it does not store cache, or temporary data, on a device to be listened to offline.</text></article>

We think we’re hot stuff, with our touch-screen tablets, video cellphones and Internet movie downloads. But mark my words: we’re in the Paleozoic era of consumer technology.Our grandchildren will listen to our technology tales — spotty cellphone coverage, 24-hour movie viewing windows, three-hour battery life — and burst out laughing the minute they’re out of earshot. Take e-book readers, like the Kindle and its rivals. “Come on, Grandma. You really couldn’t read Kindle books on a Nook, or vice versa? What a dumb system!” “Tell us again why you couldn’t read Harry Potter books on e-readers?” “Grandpa, what do you mean ‘monochrome’?” This week, though, e-book readers just took their first slimy steps out of the primordial soup. Both Barnes &amp; Noble and Kobo, its far less advertised rival, introduced nearly identical readers that are clearly intended to embarrass the industry leader, the Amazon Kindle. They’re called the All-New Nook ($140) and the Kobo Touch Edition ($130). Yes, Barnes &amp; Noble actually calls it, and capitalizes it, “All-New NOOK.” Not only is that cloying and annoying, like you’re doing their advertising for them (see also: the exclamation point on Yahoo!), but it’s going to look really silly when it’s no longer new. What are they going to call the next models? The Even Newer NOOK? The All-New All-New NOOK? The Newest NOOK Imaginable? These two readers have the same latest-generation, six-inch E Ink screen as the latest Kindle: supercrisp black type against very light gray. But they’re smaller, because they do away with the Kindle’s thumb keyboard. Instead, they have the infrared-sensor E Ink touch screens that debuted on much more expensive Sony e-readers. Good call. How often do you use the keyboard anyway? Maybe about 0.01 percent of the time — when you’re typing a book’s name while shopping, or when annotating something you’re reading. The rest of the time, the keyboard just makes the Kindle bigger. And on an e-book reader, size is, so to speak, huge; after all, you’ll be holding it for hours. In weight, the Kobo is the winner. Among its competitors — the Kindle, and the touch-screen Nook and Sony Reader — it’s the lightest. It weighs seven ounces, which makes it only slightly less likely to blow away on the beach than an actual paperback book. The Kobo is also the least expensive brand-name model, apart from the Kindle with Special Offers ($114), which displays ads on its screen saver and in the bottom inch of the home screen. The All-New Nook is only slightly heavier, but it’s thicker and 0.3 inch wider, which, in blazer-pocket terms, may as well be a football field. That porkiness serves a good purpose: the battery goes for two months on a charge (Wi-Fi turned off). That’s twice the life of its rivals, and almost good enough to avoid being laughed at by grandchildren. When you hold an e-reader, most of what you’re touching is the back. Both the Kobo and the Nook have slightly rubberized hard-plastic backs. The Nook’s back panel contains a shallow oval indentation, sort of a finger well. Its soft rim provides a secure, supremely comfortable grip for your fingers. The Kobo’s back is sculptured in a quilted pattern, like a queen-size mattress for hamsters. Each has built-in memory for 1,000 books, plus a memory-card slot. Barnes &amp; Noble’s engineers have somehow managed to eliminate most of those flashes that occur every time you turn a page on an e-reader using E Ink. On the All-New Nook, you get that flash only once every six page turns. The rest of the time, each page briskly cross-fades into the next. True, that once-every-six flash is more distracting than ever. But for the previous five pages, you’ve had a completely immersive, seamless reading experience. It’s fantastic. The Nook’s advantages over the Kobo also include excellent control over the typeface (six fonts), font size, line spacing and even page margins. The Kobo offers only two fonts and no spacing or margin controls. It’s also slower than the Nook; sometimes you tap twice, wondering if your first tap even registered. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: June 8, 2011 An earlier version of this column incorrectly reported that the new Nook and Kobo readers were the first to have infrared-sensor E-ink touch screens.

    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/07/icloud-may-not-be-a-threat-to-file-sharing-services/?ref=amazoninc">Apple iCloud May Not Be a Threat to Online-Storage Services<date>June 7, 2011, 7:29 am</date><text>10:25 a.m. | Updated to add a comment from Drew Houston, the chief executive of Dropbox, an online storage service. A herd of start-ups officially learned they had a new rival when Apple introduced its iCloud online storage service on Monday. Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated PressSteven P. Jobs did not discuss whether people would be able to store all kinds of file formats in iCloud during his presentation on Monday. People will be able to store documents, presentations, photos, digital books and apps in a Web-based locker and get access to them from their Internet-connected devices, Apple said. It is a niche that has plenty of competition, as I discussed in an article in Monday’s paper. The rival companies are all trying to help people get into  documents saved on their computers, smartphones and tablets without having to e-mail files to themselves. The question is whether Apple, with its huge base of customers and deep pockets, will squash the companies already in the niche, like Dropbox, Box.net and Cx.com. The technology giants Microsoft and Amazon also have similar online storage services. Maybe Apple will kill them all. But an early look at iCloud, which is supposed to be available sometime in the fall, makes this unlikely. Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, showed off iCloud on Monday at his company’s annual developer conference in San Francisco, by talking about how it automatically stores files. He also spoke about how the service makes updated versions of those files available on any device a user owns, a process known as synchronization, or syncing for short. The audience at the conference – largely Apple fanatics and developers who build on top of its products – applauded Mr. Jobs’s presentation. But left untouched was the issue of whether people would be able to store all kinds of file formats in iCloud, and not just Apple’s. Mr. Jobs demonstrated the service using Apple’s word processor, Pages, along with Numbers and Presentations. Apple’s calendar, contacts and e-mail are also compatible. There was no mention of Microsoft Office software like Word and Excel or Adobe Acrobat. If it doesn’t work with those applications, iCloud would have limited utility for many people. Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box.net, an online storage company, pointed out in a blog post on Monday after the announcement that the shortcoming would be particularly problematic for business customers, who often use a variety of file formats. “The first issue with iCloud is that it will be optimized to work with other Apple products,” he wrote. “The de facto difficulty with Apple (speaking as a customer and amateur pundit) is that they are laser-focused on their own ecosystem.” He continued: “This is fine in the consumer world, where we tend to have considerable flexibility in selecting our own software and hardware. But in the enterprise we’re typically using devices, platforms, operating systems, and software that come from an array of vendors — and not always of our choosing.” Apple said consumers would be able to store documents in iCloud that use Apple’s iCloud Storage APIs, or technical specifications. Maybe other major companies will make their products available using those rules, but Apple only announced those specifications on Monday. Apple also declined to disclose a price for iCloud other than to say that 5 gigabytes of storage would be free. Music, apps and books purchased from Apple will not count against the threshold, nor will photos in Apple’s new Photo Stream service. Competitors to iCloud typically provide a free tier of storage. A paid version with extra storage can cost up to $20 a month. Dropbox, for example, offers 2 gigabytes of storage free of charge, but charges $10 a month for 50 gigabytes and $20 for 100 gigabytes. Amazon’s Cloud Drive is free for up to 5 gigabytes and $20 a year for up to 20 gigabytes, although it has other payment plans. Songs bought through Amazon do not count against the storage limit. Users get 20 gigabytes for free for a year if they buy an MP3 album. ICloud does not appear to provide a way for users to share documents, at least not at this stage. Sharing files with colleagues or family is a main component of the rival storage services. For example, users of Dropbox can choose to make a particular file available to others so they can edit the document together. Drew Houston, chief executive of Dropbox, dismissed the idea that iCloud would upend companies like his. Although he did not mention it, Apple had a previous so-called “cloud” storage service, MobileMe, which shared many of iCloud’s capabilities, but never really caught on. iCloud, Mr. Houston said, is “a step forward for Apple, and the service will evolve, but when iCloud arrives later this year it won’t let people access and share all of their files everywhere the way tens of millions of people already do with Dropbox today.” He added, “Furthermore, there’s a big world beyond Apple, and our users love that Dropbox works just as well with your Android phone or PC as with your iPad or iPhone.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/05/googles-new-chromebook-explained/?ref=amazoninc">Google's New Chromebook Explained<date>June 5, 2011, 7:40 am</date><text>The Samsung Series 5 Chromebook (starting at $429), on sale June 15. Update Sunday, June 5 7:52 p.m.: Clarified that, while Chromebooks do have a hard drive, that drive is used by the OS, not for a user’s data storage. Also changed wording to indicate that data is not in Google’s possession, necessarily, but whichever cloud-based service a user is using. So Google’s made a new laptop? Not exactly. Samsung and Acer have made new laptops called Chromebooks that run on Google’s Chrome OS. They’ll be available starting June 15 at Amazon.com and Best Buy. Chrome OS? So, not Windows or Mac. Not Windows or Mac. Chrome OS is a new operating system. How does Chrome OS work? Is it majorly different from the other major operating systems? Chrome OS is actually pretty different. It is basically a browser — and nothing more than a browser. Everything happens in the browser. There’s no “desktop,” and there’s no hard drive for you to use. This makes no sense to me. It is pretty radical. Try thinking of it this way: If you use the Web not just for browsing sites but also for your e-mail, and your word processor (think Google Docs), and your photos, and your banking and a whole host of other things, then do you really need all the extra stuff that an OS like Windows and Mac has? O.K. I mean, I’m sort of with you here, but walk me through this. What happens when I turn on a Chromebook? And what happens after that? When you turn on a Chromebook, it very quickly (more so than traditional-OS-based PCs) brings you to a login screen. From there, you can enter your username and password for your Google account (if you have Gmail, it is the same account). If you do not have a Google account, you can log in as a guest. Once you do that, you’ll see a browser. The browser is Google’s own Chrome browser, which Windows and Mac users have been able to use for about two and a half years. There are no other programs or applications to use. The browser is it. So where are my files? Well, Chromebooks do have a slot for an optional memory card, and a rudimentary file manager to access saved data there, but the Chromebook’s hard drive is for the OS, not for storing your files. The assumption is that your files will be stored in the cloud. If you have word-processing documents, you can store those in, say, Google Docs, or Microsoft’s SkyDrive. Your e-mail messages no longer live in an Outlook or Mail application, but on Gmail or Yahoo Mail. Photos are on Picasa or Shutterfly or Flickr. But there are no other programs? Not really, no. What there are Chrome Apps, which are kind of like jazzed-up Web sites. So, for example, there is a Google Docs Chrome App, but it is not very different than simply accessing the Google Docs site. There are also games as Chrome Apps, so you can play Angry Birds or Missile Command, but don’t expect heavyweight gaming experiences like Call of Duty. So all this assumes I have an Internet connection. Yes. Chromebooks will be sold either with Wi-Fi only, or with Wi-Fi and wireless-data from Verizon. Wait. So if I’m in a situation where I don’t have an Internet connection, is the Chromebook useless? Not exactly. Some Chrome apps work offline. Google is saying that Google Docs and Gmail will work offline as well. All games that are Chrome Apps work offline. But make no mistake about it, without a (good) Internet connection, Chromebooks are pretty hobbled. That seems like it could be a pretty significant downside. It very well could be. There are some advantages to this model, however. Like with any cloud-based system, your data is not tied to one machine. You can access it from any computer that is online. Your Chromebook will be updated automatically, in the background, so you will always have the latest version of the OS. Chromebooks are faster to start up than traditional PCs, and if your Chromebook should become damaged or go missing, your data is safe, since it was never on the machine itself, but stored by Google on a server farm somewhere. Yes, but still: No Internet connection means a really compromised computing environment. Absolutely. It will most likely give many people pause before buying one. And my files — I am never actually in possession of them, right? The Cloud has them? Yes. Should I be nervous about that? Not really, but some people may not like the idea that all their data is being maintained by someone else. Tell me about the hardware. Initially, there will be two Chromebooks. The Acer Chromebook will have an 11.6-inch display, weigh 2.95 pounds and start at $349 for the Wi-Fi-only model (3G pricing has not been announced yet). Samsung’s Chromebook (called the Series 5) has a 12.1-inch display, will weigh 3.26 pounds and will cost $429 for the Wi-Fi-only model and $499 for the Wi-Fi and 3G model. But with the 3G models, I’ll have to buy a data plan, right? Actually, no. Buyers of 3G Chromebooks will get 100 megabytes of data a month free for two years from Verizon Wireless. If you want, you will be able to buy additional data packets on a month-by-month basis for $10 to $50, depending on the amount of data. That’s nice of them. But let me understand something: Chromebooks are going to cost between $350 and $500, right? Yes. And how much do netbooks cost? Well, just as an example, Best Buy is selling 15 netbooks from $200 to $530 right now. And those netbooks, what are they running on? Windows 7. Do they have hard drives? Yes. They range in capacity from 160 to 320 gigabytes. Are they heavy? Not really. They weigh between 2.4 and 3.1 pounds. Do they have really small screens? Kind of — 10.1 inches is pretty common. Though there are some 11.6 models out there. If you move into the “laptop” category, you can find models with 14-inch screens in the same price range as netbooks. So, with these netbooks and laptops that cost the same or less, and weigh the same or less, and come with screens bigger and smaller than Chromebooks, I could still do all those cloud-based things you were talking about, but I could also have a full-fledged computer as well? Yes. So I would want a Chromebook because …? Good question.</text></article>

At the company’s recent announcements, for example, billboards and products were shrouded in black sheets and protected by Apple employees until after Steven P. Jobs, the company’s chief executive, unveiled his latest wares. Yet on Tuesday, in an unusual move for the company, Apple pre-announced what it plans to showcase next week at the annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. The company said it would unveil new software for its desktop operating system and for its mobile iOS devices. The company also said it would unveil iCloud, a new cloud computing offering. But why did Apple go from clandestine product secrecy to sounding a trumpet a week before its product unveiling? John Gruber at Daring Fireball, who is usually pretty good at the speculation game, wrote, “I think to continue setting expectations that there will be no new hardware products announced.” I asked people on Twitter to share their thoughts. Some said it was to lower expectations of next week’s announcement, though many wondered whether the event could include announcements of the next generation iPhone. Others believe it could be a move to pressure companies like Amazon and Google, who currently reign supreme with their cloud computing products. There were also those that said this is just another Apple marketing strategy to generate buzz in the media a week before the event. You can see some of the responses below. What do you think? Why did Apple pre-announce the subject of next week’s keynote address? Please share your thoughts in the comments below. @nickbilton I reckon they’re putting a lot on iCloud and don’t want coverage marred by lack of an iPhone announcement.

    <article index="8" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/amazon-to-try-again-on-lady-gaga-album-special/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon to Try Again on Lady Gaga Album Special<date>May 26, 2011, 8:47 am</date><text>Amazon stumbled on Monday when it offered Lady Gaga’s new album in the MP3 format at 99 cents, a surprise one-day promotion that proved so popular it stalled the company’s servers. But on Thursday it is trying the promotion again, and promises that it will be prepared. Amazon will offer Lady Gaga’s new album in the MP3 format at 99 cents on Thursday. “Clearly customers are really excited for Lady Gaga’s new album — we saw extraordinary response to Monday’s promotion — far above what we expected. She definitely melted some servers,” Craig Pape, Amazon’s director of music, said in a statement. “So we’re doing it again, and this time we’re ready.” The promotion is expected to push opening-week sales of Lady Gaga’s album, “Born This Way” (Interscope), above its early estimates of about 750,000 copies, to 850,000 or possibly more than a million. In the last five years, only two albums have sold more than a million copies in a week: Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter III” in 2008, and Taylor Swift’s “Speak Now” last year. Amazon’s Lady Gaga deal has been widely interpreted in the music industry as a way for the company to compete with Apple’s iTunes store, the dominant music retailer on the Web, and to promote its new Cloud Drive service, which allows customers to store their music on Amazon’s servers and stream it over the Internet. But the company received a barrage of customer complaints on Monday when its servers failed. Amazon introduced its Cloud Drive service in March, and earlier this month Google announced its own cloud music service. Apple is in negotiations with the major record labels and music publishers for its service, which music executives say could be introduced as early as next month.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/business/media/24gaga.html?ref=amazoninc">Lady Gaga Fans Swamp Amazon for a Cut-Rate Copy of a New Album<date>Published: May 23, 2011</date><text>Lady Gaga has made herself a paragon of pop ambition and a spokeswoman for equal rights, but on Monday she became an unwitting symbol for something else: the pitfalls of cloud computing.“Born This Way” (Interscope), her new album, arrived with a blitz of marketing, and Amazon surprised the singer’s fans by offering a one-day sale of the MP3 version of the album for 99 cents, a full $11 less than its price at iTunes, the Web’s dominant music retailer. The discount was widely seen as a way for Amazon to promote its new Cloud Drive service, which allows users to store music files on remote servers and stream them over the Internet to their computer or smartphone. But Amazon may have underestimated the zeal (or thrift) of Lady Gaga’s fans. By early afternoon the company’s servers stalled, and many users were unable to download or listen to the album in full. Frustrated customers quickly took to Twitter and to Amazon’s user review page for “Born This Way.” “Very disappointed,” a customer wrote in a one-star review of the album. “I guess next time I will pay full price and get the album immediately on iTunes.” Amazon’s only public comment on the matter was a Twitter message, sent about 1:15 p.m. Eastern time: “We’re currently experiencing very high volume. If you order today, you will get the full @ladygaga album for $.99. Thanks for your patience.” Most music companies see cloud services — which promise that all your music will be available on all your devices at any time — as the next frontier for the industry. And for the retailers and technology companies that will operate them, such services have become in important battleground. Google unveiled its own cloud service, Music Beta, this month, and Apple was said to be close to introducing its own. Amazon offers customers five free gigabytes of space on its Cloud Service and increases it to 20 gigabytes for customers who buy an album. “What Amazon is trying to do is build up as much share as possible before Apple comes in,” said Russ Crupnick, an analyst with NPD Group, a market research firm. Some analysts and music executives said the problem could affect confidence in an unfamiliar technology. Last month a variety of Web sites, from start-ups like GroupMe.com to The New York Times, were affected by a failure on servers that Amazon rents for cloud computing. “It’s perhaps not a fatal flaw that this happened, but it certainly creates a challenge for them,” said Matthew Eastwood, an analyst at IDC, a firm that researches technology. “There is not a lot of forgiveness for things like this in the market. People will tend to move on and find other suppliers.” Amazon introduced its MP3 store in 2007, but it has struggled to compete with iTunes. Late last year the NPD Group estimated that iTunes’s share of the digital download market was 66.2 percent and Amazon’s was 13.3 percent. Amazon often sells albums through one-day promotions for $4 or $5. Music executives have said that Amazon usually accepts the loss if it sells an album for less than the wholesale price charged by the labels, which is typically around $7 an album but may be more for a priority release. Amazon declined to comment beyond its Twitter message, and a representative of Lady Gaga’s record label, Interscope, did not respond to e-mails requesting comment. Other industry observers questioned whether Amazon’s error with Lady Gaga downloads would have a lasting effect on such a popular store. “People are having a headache for one dollar,” said Tamara Conniff, a former editor of Billboard who is the founder of TheComet.com, a music news and opinion site. “They’d be willing to try it again for another dollar. Full price is another story.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/technology/20amazon.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s E-Book Sales Pass Print Books<date>Published: May 19, 2011</date><text>In the latest chapter in the unfolding tale of the book evolution from ink to pixels, Amazon.com said Thursday that its customers now buy more e-books than print books.Since April 1, Amazon sold 105 books for its Kindle e-reader for every 100 hardcover and paperback books, including books without Kindle versions and excluding free e-books. “We had high hopes that this would happen eventually, but we never imagined it would happen this quickly,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, in a statement. “We’ve been selling print books for 15 years and Kindle books for less than four years.” But people should not exile their bookshelves to storage quite yet, many analysts warned. Over all, e-books account for only about 14 percent of all general consumer fiction and nonfiction books sold, according to Forrester Research. “E-book reading is a big deal and it’s going to continue to be even bigger,” said James L. McQuivey, a digital media analyst at Forrester. “But we are not to the point where e-books are a majority of unit sales and certainly not a majority of revenue.” Amazon’s latest milestone was unsurprising to industry observers. The company said last July that sales of e-books outnumbered hardcover books and it said in January that the same was true for paperbacks. For Amazon, though, the milestone is proof that it has successfully leapt from a print business to a digital one, a transition that has challenged most companies that sell media. It also sets the stage for Amazon to introduce an Android tablet computer, which is expected this year. E-book reading would most likely be a centerpiece of the device, which would have significantly more functionality than a Kindle to compete against the iPad. “Just as music helped the iPod to increase the relevancy of the iPad and the iPhone, books can do the same for Amazon’s tablet,” said Jordan Rohan, an Internet analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Amazon declined to comment on the reports that it is making a tablet. Amazon credited the surge in e-book sales in part to its newest, lowest-priced Kindle with ads, which was introduced in April for $114 and is now Amazon’s best-selling Kindle. Even if e-books overall do not outsell print books outside of Amazon, the online bookstore is certainly a strong indicator of a trend. E-book sales in March were $69 million, an increase of 146 percent from the year before, the Association of American Publishers said Thursday. Sales of adult hardcover books grew 6 percent while paperback sales decreased nearly 8 percent. E-books have become vastly more accessible to consumers in the last year. Across the industry, publishers have been rapidly digitizing their catalog of books, making older titles available in e-book form for the first time. Even smaller independent houses that had resisted selling e-books have changed their position and discovered a new way to sell their older books — traditionally a large part of many publishers’ revenues. Still, David Shanks, the chief executive of Penguin Group USA, cautioned that the Amazon announcement could be misleading. “There are many, many places around the country that sell all physical and no e-books,” Mr. Shanks said, adding that there is still “tremendous” demand for print books in bookstores, and at Wal-Mart, Target, airport stores and supermarkets, among other retailers. Russ Grandinetti, vice president for Kindle content at Amazon, said that e-book sales had helped the publishing industry overall. “Even though some digital sales may be substitutions from print, one of the great impacts that the digital business has is people spend more minutes a day reading. They make reading more of a habit, and that’s good for the total book business,” he said. Though Amazon has dominated e-book sales so far, the market is still evolving. Publishers said that Amazon’s share of the e-book market has decreased significantly in the last two years as Barnes &amp; Noble has made gains with its Nook devices and new competitors have entered the e-book market, like Apple and Google. Amazon did not disclose the number of books sold or how its revenue and profit break out for print books and e-books. In addition to standard-price e-books, from $12.99 to $14.99, Amazon sells the majority of its 950,000 Kindle books for less than $9.99 and some cost as little as 99 cents. Thursday’s announcement includes Kindle Singles, which are shorter pieces of writing, like a Fortune magazine article, and “no doubt helped them reach that ratio,” said Michael Norris, a senior analyst for Simba Information. “They’re taking print sales away from others while their own devices are taking print sales away from them,” said Mike Shatzkin, chief executive of the Idea Logical Company, which advises book publishers on digital change. “That’s the real import of those numbers. It’s one more nail in the coffin of brick and mortar stores.”</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/books/susan-orlean-writes-animalish-as-an-e-book.html?ref=amazoninc">Susan Orlean Writes ‘Animalish’ as an E-Book<date>Published: May 18, 2011</date><text>PINE PLAINS, N.Y. — Last Friday Susan Orlean was on the verge of some serious animal acquisitions. Her latest herd of 12 Black Angus cattle was scheduled to be dropped off within days. And the local post office could call at any minute to report that four rare and eye-catching Swedish flower hens were ready for pickup, having been shipped overnight from Florida.She was still thinking, too, now that you mention it, about that donkey that her husband had promised as last year’s birthday gift. “Donkeys are just so cute,” said Ms. Orlean, clad in jeans and caramel-colored ankle boots and settling into an ample sectional sofa in the living room of her airy, low-slung house of wood, stone and glass just north of here, in Columbia County. “You could train them to pull a cart. Or you could put a little kid on them! Purely for entertainment. Here, you can have livestock as pets.” When you live on a 55-acre property with a pond, looking out on the Taconic Mountains, a menagerie of animals feels like a natural part of the package. At last count Ms. Orlean, along with her husband, John Gillespie, and their 6-year-old son, Austin, had one dog, three cats, eight chickens, four turkeys, six guinea fowl, one fish and two snow-white ducks; she offered to duck-sit the last two for her neighbor last year and has kept them ever since. They also make excellent material. Ms. Orlean, the author of “The Orchid Thief” and a “cultural biography” of Rin Tin Tin scheduled for release later this year, was eager to talk about her newest project: a combination of her lifelong obsession with animals and her more recent side job as a technology fanatic. “Animalish,” an essay in e-book form, will be published on Thursday exclusively by Amazon as one of its Kindle Singles, snippets of original, long-form writing in both fiction and nonfiction. Kindle Singles fall into a quickly emerging and still-undefined category in publishing. They are somewhere between a long article or essay and a book, anywhere from 5,000 to 30,000 words, available to download instantly for a price that ranges from 99 cents to $4.99; “Animalish” is $1.99. Similar ventures have popped up recently. Jon Krakauer drew widespread notice for Byliner.com last month when it published his 22,000-word e-book about Greg Mortenson and the questions raised over his book, “Three Cups of Tea.” (Mr. Krakauer’s book, “Three Cups of Deceit,” is now available on Amazon.) In January, a group of journalists introduced the Atavist, another online home for long-form journalism and nonfiction books. Authors of Kindle Singles typically keep 70 percent of the revenues, while the remaining 30 percent goes to Amazon — a much more attractive revenue split than mainstream publishers offer. Ms. Orlean said she wanted to experiment with the form because she had done so much writing and thinking about her interest in animals, but didn’t see all of the material as suitable for an essay in The New Yorker, where she has been a staff writer since 1992. Her fascination with animals began early, when as a child growing up in Ohio she scanned newspaper classifieds to find puppies and horses for sale. As a college student at the University of Michigan, she acquired a dog, Molly, who later accompanied her to Manhattan. Cooper, a Welsh springer spaniel, was the first dog she and Mr. Gillespie bought together, followed last year by Ivy, an excitable spaniel spotted with red-and-white fur. They got Ivy from a breeder after a family who was hit by hard times could no longer afford to keep the dog and reluctantly returned her to the breeder. “It was a moment where the recession really became real,” she said. These days her collection of animals is for amusement and occasional nourishment. On the countertop in her kitchen was a glass bowl filled with eggs from ducks, chickens and guinea fowl, next to an old-fashioned egg scale that she found on eBay. Out in the chicken coop next to the house, her turkeys, which are shades of red, white, blue and black, broke away from the chickens, ducks and guinea fowl, gobbling in unison and obediently following her down a path through the woods, where she has a free-standing studio for her writing. While Ms. Orlean has mastered the old media (long-form pieces in The New Yorker, best-selling books released by major publishers), she has also established herself as a devotee of the new media, blogging and tweeting at an enthusiastic pace. “It’s especially funny because I used to think that I was kind of old-fashioned,” she said. “The subjects I write about, the spirit in which I write, seemed in a way rather traditional. And I thought, the new world is coming and this is the way I want to write and I’m not sure how I’ll fit into the new world as it changes.” On Twitter Ms. Orlean has amassed 137,000 followers, and posting tweets has become a habit that loosely coincided with the move by her and Mr. Gillespie — a former investment banker — to this house, 100 miles north of Manhattan, four years ago. “If I lived in the city and went into an office and was around people all the time, and had that ongoing casual neighborhood relationship with people, would Twitter be as interesting?” she said. “Maybe not as much.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/what-googlemusic-beta-means-to-you/?ref=amazoninc">What GoogleMusic: Beta Means to You<date>May 11, 2011, 5:30 pm</date><text>Beck Diefenbach/ReutersGoogle’s Music: Beta service stores your music library in the cloud. Wednesday, Google announced Music: Beta, a new cloud-based music service that will be available over the Web and on Android devices (initial users will be by invitation only, which you can request by going to the Music: Beta Web page). As was reported Wednesday, your music will be stored online, for instant retrieval from any Web-enabled or Android device you have. So what does this mean to you? Well, let’s start with a few assumptions. First, that you have music on your PC, and second, that your music is managed by iTunes. This has worked well for many people for many years, but iTunes does have some limitations, which Music: Beta (and, earlier, Amazon’s Cloud Drive) is directly addressing. One of the limitations of iTunes is that your music can’t move around very easily. If you add something to your iTunes library on your PC, it can only get to, say, your iPhone by syncing the two devices via a cable. On the flip side, if you buy a song on your iPhone, it doesn’t get onto your PC (and, therefore, whatever other devices you are syncing to it, like another phone or a tablet) until you do that same hard-wired sync. Oh, and if you have been using iTunes and have an Android smartphone or tablet, you’ve always had to rely on third-party apps like DoubleTwist to get your music onto Android devices, so Google’s move here, among other things, provides built-in music-management where previously there hadn’t really been any. But Music: Beta’s main selling point is that it copies your music collection to Google’s remote servers. Once your music is on Google’s servers, it’s available to any Internet-connected device that can access it, from other PCs to Android smartphones. Real-world example: Right now, as I type this, I cannot listen to the iTunes library that I have on my home PC. I have iTunes on this computer here at work, and I have an Internet connection, but it can’t connect to my music at home. Music: Beta solves this problem. All I do is access my music that’s now stored in the cloud and I can enjoy all my music right here at my desk. Well, almost all my music. There is a catch: If you bought songs and albums on the iTunes Music Store before January 6, 2009, those tracks are copy-protected, and won’t be uploaded to Google’s servers (Apple removed copy protection on all music for sale after that date). If you’ve bought music from other vendors, like Amazon’s Music Store, you’re in luck, since all those songs have been sold without copy protection. Now you can, in fact, remove copy protection from pre-2009 iTunes music. There are two ways—the hard way and the expensive way (neither of those sound attractive, do they?). The hard way is to make CDs of all your copy-protected music and then re-import them into iTunes. Doing so will take off the copy protection. The expensive way is to pay Apple to remove the copy protection on each protected file. That will cost you 30 cents per song, 60 cents per album and 30 percent the cost of a music album. That can add up. Music: Beta does more than just allow PCs to play music from home. It is also available as an Android app, so smartphones and tablets that run the operating system will have direct access to the same library. Add a song or make a playlist on one device and all of them have it, instantly. Now Google does not sell music. When you want something new to listen to, you’ll do what you’ve usually done: buy tracks on iTunes Music Store or Amazon or another vendor. But then Music: Beta will automatically upload those songs to the cloud, keeping your online library of music up-to-date. What you can’t do is take that online library and redownload it to another device (this is something you actually can do with Amazon’s Cloud Drive service). What happens in the cloud, stays in the cloud. But Music: Beta will let you keep some of your music on your device locally, so that you can listen to it when you don’t have an Internet connection. If you’re an Android user, this is a pretty big deal, assuming Google can get the service to work cleanly and easily. The search giant hasn’t always had immediate success with consumer products and services, but there has been a steady drumbeat of migrating personal media collections to the cloud, for easy and universal playback, and clearly Google is looking to get ahead of that curve. Another knock-on effect of today’s Google announcement? What it does, if anything, to Apple. The company’s been rumored to be working on a cloud-based version of iTunes, and if there are now options from both Google and Amazon, Cupertino may not be far behind. Or not. As with all things Apple, I’ve learned to stop guessing. P.S. I’ll have a closer, hands-on look at Music: Beta soon and will post my findings then. Stay tuned.</text></article>

I’ve watched the first seasons of “Ally McBeal,” “The X-Files,” “Veronica Mars” and “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” Torrential downpours have kept me couch-bound, so I’ve also been able to catch up on a few movies I missed in the theaters: “The Runaways,” “Hot Tub Time Machine” and a few classics like “The Graduate.” Normally, I might have obtained those shows and movies in an ahem, less-than-legal way, like using a BitTorrent client to download the content from the Web. But lately, I’ve been short on the necessary patience needed to figure out what, exactly, I feel like watching. That’s because while the upside to using torrent sites to nab movies and shows to watch is that it is available for no cost, the downside is that it requires a little extra time to sift through clutter online to find what you want and wait for it to download. As a result, I’ve noticed that my illicit activities have come to a halt, as it’s simply much easier to browse through the catalogs on Netflix Instant, Amazon, iTunes and elsewhere. Will others follow suit? Have they already? This question was raised in a recent blog post on TorrentFreak, a site that covers news related to BitTorrent and other filesharing sites. “Netflix is taking away one of the main piracy motivators (lack of availability) for a group of people,” Ernesto, the site’s moderator, wrote. “Netflix shows that people are willing to pay for access to movies online, even when plenty of pirated copies are available.” Ernesto pointed to Netflix’s recent earnings report, which revealed that the company now boasts more subscribers than any other video service in the United States. Netflix’s steaming service has been growing rapidly, and the company is looking to capitalize on that growth by acquiring original content like an upcoming series from David Fincher and Kevin Spacey. Of course, as many commentors to the blog post on TorrentFreak point out, not every user is abandoning torrents for legitimate streaming sites. The selection available on services like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu is rarely the freshest that Hollywood has to offer. And most of the streaming services we enjoy in the United States aren’t available in other countries, leaving many to seek out alternative ways to find the films and shows they want to watch online. But it begs the question of whether the tide is beginning to turn. Have you noticed a change in your own downloading and viewing habits? Is it because of Netflix? Do you think others will follow suit? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/technology/27amazon.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Income Falls 33%; Revenue Rises 38%<date>Published: April 26, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon.com’s expansion of its online retailing and cloud computing businesses has eroded profits.The building binge of warehouses and data centers sacrificed Amazon’s short-term profits to lift business over the long term, the company said on Tuesday when it released its first-quarter earnings statement. It also said that it had no intention of slowing the spending. The effect of the expansion, along with an uncertain economy, could be seen in Amazon’s second-quarter financial forecast. The company gave a profit outlook that was far from specific but below analysts’ expectations. It said its second-quarter profit, excluding certain costs, would fall as much as 65 percent or as little as 9 percent. Meanwhile, Amazon said revenue would rise 35 percent to 47 percent, or $8.85 billion to $9.65 billion. Thomas J. Szkutak, Amazon’s chief financial officer, explained the wide range by saying during a conference call that “there is uncertainty, so we are making sure to give an appropriate conservative range.” In after-hours trading, Amazon’s shares fell about 1 percent. They had dropped 1.7 percent, to $182.30, in regular trading before the earnings announcement. Amazon reported that first-quarter net income fell 33 percent, to $201 million, or 44 cents a share, from $299 million, or 66 cents in the period a year ago. Revenue climbed 38 percent, to $9.86 billion, from $7.13 billion. Net income was below the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 61 cents a share and revenue of $9.52 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Amazon is undergoing a major expansion this year that calls for adding at least nine warehouses after adding 13 warehouses last year. If growth in customer orders continues, however, it will add even more fulfillment centers, Mr. Szkutak said. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive, was not on the call. The company, based in Seattle, said that sales of books and music during the quarter rose 15 percent, to $3.96 billion. Sales of electronics and other merchandise grew 59 percent, to $5.59 billion. As usual, Amazon boasted about its Kindle digital book reader but did not provide any specific sales numbers. Data centers are crucial to its digital music storage service, introduced late last month. Consumers can use the service to back up files from their computers and then gain access to them from a computer, laptop or smartphone. Adding data center capacity is especially important for Amazon’s Web hosting service, which stores data for a large number of businesses. Last week, after the first quarter ended, the hosting service suffered an embarrassing failure. The glitch, which the company said was fixed on Monday, took down a number of Web sites, including Foursquare, Reddit and Quora. Amazon is still looking into the cause, Mr. Szkutak said. Youssef H. Squali, an analyst with Jefferies &amp; Company, said of Amazon’s spending on infrastructure, “this is the right strategy longer term but it makes for a stressful stock to own.” Given the potential for growth overseas, he said that Amazon’s expansion could go on for several years. And, Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst with Caris &amp; Company, said that Amazon’s profit shortfall relative to expectations and its disappointing guidance were not particularly worrisome. The company is growing quickly, he pointed out, and it therefore needs to invest in its business by building. “We see that as a good problem to have,” Mr. Aggarwal said. Japan’s earthquake and subsequent disasters bit into Amazon’s business in the first quarter, reducing operating income by $20 million. Japan accounts for up to 15 percent of the company’s business, according to analyst estimates. Sales in Japan are picking up, Mr. Szkutak said, but they continue to be weak as the country tries to rebuild. Meanwhile, analysts expect high gasoline prices in the United States and in other countries to increase Amazon’s shipping costs.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/technology/23cloud.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Malfunction Raises Doubts About Cloud Computing<date>Published: April 22, 2011</date><text>As technical problems interrupted computer services provided by Amazon for a second day on Friday, industry analysts said the troubles would prompt many companies to reconsider relying on remote computers beyond their control.“This is a wake-up call for cloud computing,” said Matthew Eastwood, an analyst for the research firm IDC, using the term for accessing services and information in big data centers remotely over the Internet from anywhere, as if the services were in a cloud. “It will force a conversation in the industry.” That discussion, he said, will most likely center on what data and computer operations to send off to the cloud and what to keep inside the corporate walls. But another issue, Mr. Eastwood said, will be a re-examination of the contracts that cover cloud services — how much to pay for backup and recovery services, including paying extra for data centers in different locations. That is because the companies that were apparently hit hardest by the Amazon interruption were start-ups that, analysts said, are focused on moving fast in pursuit of growth, and less apt to pay for extensive backup and recovery services. Amazon set up a side business five years ago offering computing resources to businesses from its network of sophisticated data centers. Today, the company is the early leader in the fast-growing business of cloud computing. In business, the cloud model is rapidly gaining popularity as a way for companies to outsource computing chores to avoid the costs and headaches of running their own data centers — simply tap in, over the Web, to computer processing and storage without owning the machines or operating software. Amazon has thousands of corporate customers, from Pfizer and Netflix to legions of start-ups, whose businesses often live on Amazon Web Services. Those reporting service troubles included Foursquare, a location-based social networking site; Quora, a question-and-answer service; Reddit, a news-sharing site; and BigDoor, which makes game tools for Web publishers. The problems companies reported varied, but included being unable to access data, service interruptions and sites being shut down. Amazon has data centers around the world, but the current problems have come from its big center in Northern Virginia, near Dulles airport. Amazon’s Web page on the status of its cloud services said on Friday that matters were improving but were still not resolved. A company spokeswoman said the updates would be Amazon’s only comment for now. Big companies, that have decided to put crucial operations on Amazon computers are apt to pay up for the equivalent of computing insurance, analysts say. Netflix, the movie rental site, has become a large customer of the Amazon cloud. Most of its Web technology — customer movie queues, search tools and the like — runs in Amazon data centers. Netflix said it had sailed through the last couple of days unscathed. “That’s because Netflix has taken full advantage of Amazon Web Services’ redundant cloud architecture,” which insures against technical malfunctions in any one location, said Steve Swasey, a Netflix spokesman. BigDoor, a 20-employee start-up in Seattle, was knocked down by Amazon’s travails. It had backup and recovery services with Amazon, said Keith Smith, the chief executive, but only at Amazon’s data center in Virginia. “There’s always a trade-off,” Mr. Smith said, noting the expenses and developer time that would have been required to do more. By Friday evening, most services at BigDoor, which makes game and rewards features for online publishers, were back up, but its Web site was still down. The long-term toll to cloud computing, if any, is uncertain. Corporate cloud computing is expected to grow rapidly, by more than 25 percent a year, to $55.5 billion by 2014, IDC estimates. Major technology suppliers are aggressively promoting different cloud offerings — some emphasizing a utility-style service, like Amazon, and others focusing more on selling big companies the hardware and software to more efficiently juggle computing workloads. The latter use the cloud technology, but companies own and control them — so-called private clouds. The Amazon interruption, said Lew Moorman, chief strategy officer of Rackspace, a specialist in data center services, was the computing equivalent of an airplane crash. It is a major episode with widespread damage. But airline travel, he noted, is still safer than traveling in a car — analogous to cloud computing being safer than data centers run by individual companies. “Every day, inside companies all over the world, there are technology outages,” Mr. Moorman said. “Each episode is smaller, but they add up to far more lost time, money and business.” The Amazon setback, he said, should prove to be a learning experience. “We all have an interest in Amazon handling this well,” said Mr. Moorman, whose company is a competitor in the cloud business.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/amazon-cloud-failure-takes-down-web-sites/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Cloud Failure Takes Down Web Sites<date>April 21, 2011, 4:40 pm</date><text>10:28 a.m. | Updated to reflect status of the problem on Friday. A widespread failure in Amazon.com’s Web services business was still affecting many Internet sites on Friday morning, highlighting the risks involved when companies rely on so-called cloud computing. The problems, which began early Thursday morning, affected sites including Quora.com, Reddit.com, GroupMe.com and Scvngr.com, which all posted messages to their visitors about the issue. Most of the sites have been inaccessible for hours, and others were only partly operational. The Web companies use Amazon’s cloud-based service to serve their Web sites, applications and files. Amazon’s customers include start-ups like the social networking site Foursquare but also big companies like Pfizer and Nasdaq. Amazon, which is a leader in this business, lets these companies rent space on its servers and take advantage of its big data centers and computing power. But that gives the companies little control if the servers fail. “We don’t think the cloud is enterprise-ready,” said Jimmy Tam, general manager of Peer Software, which provides data backup for businesses. “Are you really going to trust your corporate jewels to these cloud providers?” Executives at the Web companies that are Amazon customers said that while they knew of the risk, the failure was still frustrating. They said they were investigating options to avoid similar problems in the future. “Clearly you’re not in control of your data, your information,” said Campbell McKellar, founder of Loosecubes, a Web site for finding temporary workspace that was not available Thursday. “It’s a major business interruption. I’m getting business interruption insurance tomorrow, believe me, and maybe we get a different cloud provider as a backup.” Other Web companies said cloud computing was a necessity. “The benefits of the cloud are significant,” said Jeff Janer, chief executive of Springpad, a service that people use to save items online, which went offline as a result of Amazon’s problem. “Amazon as a resource for a company like ours makes an awful lot of sense. We’re just all keeping our fingers crossed that they get back as quickly as possible.” The problems also affected some functions of the Web site of The New York Times, including the ability to comment on articles. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. The company was updating the status of its Web services online and confirmed disruptions at a data center in Northern Virginia. The page said it was unknown when the services would be restored.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/coming-to-your-kindle-library-books/?ref=amazoninc">Coming to Your Kindle: Library Books<date>April 20, 2011, 11:17 am</date><text>Reading e-books from the library is easy — unless you own a Kindle. Amazon’s dedicated e-reader is not compatible with library e-books, leading many new e-reader buyers who are interested in borrowing e-books from the library to purchase a Nook from Barnes &amp; Noble instead. But Amazon said on Wednesday that it would change its policy later this year, creating a new feature that would allow Kindle customers to borrow e-books from more than 11,000 libraries across the country. Amazon will work with OverDrive, a large provider of e-books to public libraries and schools. “We’re excited that millions of Kindle customers will be able to borrow Kindle books from their local libraries,” Jay Marine, director of Kindle at Amazon, said in a statement. E-book use in libraries has been growing at a rapid pace, particuarly in the last year as more consumers have purchased e-readers. The New York Public Library said last month that e-book use was 36 percent higher than it was one year ago. But some publishers are squeamish about allowing their books to be borrowed from libraries by users who can easily download the books from home. Two major publishers, Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan, have still not allowed their e-books to be available in libraries. HarperCollins angered librarians last month when it announced a new policy requiring that e-books be checked out only 26 times before they expire, rather than allowing an unlimited number of times.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/technology/12amazon.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon to Sell Cheaper Kindle Supported by Ads<date>Published: April 11, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon is shaving another $25 off the price of its Kindle e-reader, this time with the help of advertisers. The newest Kindle is $114. Amazon will sell its e-book reader at the lower price by showing ads as screen savers and at the bottom of the home screen, and by selling special offers, similar to Groupon and other daily deal sites. The ads are the latest step in Amazon’s transition from e-commerce retailer to full-fledged digital media company. By selling ads that will show up next to digital content, Amazon is laying further groundwork that could enable it to someday sell tablet computers that would compete with Apple and Google Android tablets. Amazon is also showing how far it is willing to go to remain a front-runner in the e-reader price wars. The new Kindle is $35 less than Barnes &amp; Noble’s least expensive Nook and $66 less than Sony’s least expensive Reader. It is also several hundred dollars cheaper than an Apple iPad. “This is really about having a Kindle that’s more affordable,” said Jay Marine, director of Kindle at Amazon. The device, known as “Kindle with Special Offers,” will have the same hardware as the most recent, $139 Kindle, with Wi-Fi, a one-month battery life and an 8.5-ounce body. But instead of the typical Kindle screen savers, like images of authors, Amazon will show ads from brands like Buick, Procter &amp; Gamble and Visa. The ads will also show up on the home screen, but they will not appear inside e-books. Amazon will give users a say in which ads they see, borrowing a page from the playbooks of Hulu and TED.com. People can vote, either online or on a Kindle app called AdMash, for their favorite of two ads, like a close-up of a model’s face versus a photo of a jar of cream for Olay. They can also tell Amazon whether they want to see more or fewer ads with landscapes or illustrations, for instance. Readers will also be able to get discounts through their Kindles. Amazon will open the offers to advertisers, but to start, the deals are all from its site, like $10 for a $20 Amazon.com gift card or 50 percent off a Roku streaming player from Amazon. By entering the daily deal business, Amazon is competing with Groupon and with LivingSocial, the group-buying service in which it is an investor. Mr. Marine said that Amazon’s service was separate from LivingSocial’s. The ads and offers appear to be another significant step toward Amazon building its own tablet and competing more directly with the iPad, said James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research who studies digital media and consumer electronics. Amazon opened an Android app store last month and has been hiring Android software developers. An Amazon tablet could tie together the seemingly disparate parts of the company’s business, Mr. McQuivey said, including e-commerce, e-books, video and audio. “I can so easily see them selling a tablet in the future at a dramatically reduced price,” he said. “To me, this is a way for them to test that out and to start talking to advertisers.” When asked whether the new Kindle was a move toward a tablet, Mr. Marine said, “I don’t want to speculate.” He also declined to say when the Kindle would have a color or touch screen, both elements of the Apple iPad and Android tablets made by Motorola, Samsung and others. By incorporating ads in the Kindle operating system — as screen savers and in the menu, where readers will find the list of offers — Amazon is also creating a new kind of ad that could be used for new business models. Publishers, who have been searching for new ways to market e-books to replace intriguing covers and bookstore displays, could give away sponsored e-books. Amazon could also build a group-buying service among Kindle owners. Buick’s Kindle ads will show photographs of four of its cars and text that relates to reading, like a reference to a car owner’s manual, said Craig Bierley, director of advertising and promotions for General Motors’s Buick division. Because reading books is an intimate experience, he said he hoped people might pay more attention to the ads. “The Kindle for many people is really a centerpiece of their entertainment, so their level of engagement with the device, and hopefully with the advertisers on it, will be higher,” Mr. Bierley said. That type of engagement is the holy grail in advertising these days, said Bobby Calder, chairman of the marketing department at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. Still, books are one of the last ad-free zones, and by showing ads on an e-reader, Amazon risks alienating some users, he said. “There’s been research that shows that if you put an ad in an environment where people are highly engaged, that kind of intrusiveness can really backfire,” he said. People could buy the less expensive Kindle and then avoid the ads by turning off Wi-Fi. Mr. Marine said Amazon did not think customers would do that because they would value the offers on the new Kindle, which is now available for order and expected to ship May 3. “We think the response is going to be really positive because it doesn’t touch the reading experience,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/business/media/04cache.html?ref=amazoninc">Playing Catch-Up in E-Books<date>Published: April 3, 2011</date><text>PARIS — When Bertelsmann, the German media giant, boasted of a financial resurgence last week, one of the strongest growth stories came from one of its most traditional businesses: the book publisher Random House. Random House said sales of digital books had more than tripled last year, lifting overall revenue 6 percent. E-books, Random House said, accounted for 10 percent of U.S. sales. So much for the good news. Outside the United States, however, the digital book business is still in its infancy. During a news conference in Berlin, Markus Dohle, chief executive of Random House, predicted that Europe would catch up with the United States in two to five years. For that to happen, some big problems will have to be solved. Too few e-reading devices have found their way into European consumers’ hands, and too few titles are available to them in digital form. While booksellers like FNAC in France and Thalia in Germany have introduced e-book readers, the Amazon Kindle is conspicuously absent from much of Europe. The company has introduced an international version of the device, but outside Britain, where Amazon recently opened a Kindle Store, there are virtually no local-language books available for European Kindle users. Some European publishers have balked at licensing their works for digital sale via Amazon, fearing cannibalization of physical sales, as well as the U.S. giant’s reputation for hardball negotiations over pricing. Other devices that allow book reading, like the Apple iPad, are more widely distributed in Europe. But few European publishers have licensed their works for sale on Apple’s digital store. Meanwhile, European legislative and regulatory developments are further clouding the picture. Last week, the French Senate approved a measure under which publishers could set the retail price of e-books, so that a title would cost the same whether it was sold by, say, Apple or a French-owned e-book store. The proposal would extend into the digital realm a pricing system that governs the sale of ink-on-paper books in France and several other European countries, preventing booksellers from offering discounts. Publishers say single-price rules support independent booksellers and encourage them to stock a diverse range of titles, rather than filling their shelves with cut-price bestsellers. These systems have deep cultural roots, and regulators have generally tolerated them, despite frowning on price-fixing in other forms. But there are signs that the European Commission is going to be stricter about the pricing of digital books. Last month, commission officials raided the offices of a number of European publishers, saying they had “reason to believe that the companies concerned may have violated E.U. antitrust rules.” Publishing executives say the regulators are scrutinizing the so-called agency model of pricing, under which publishers set the retail prices of e-books, with the online retailers taking a commission. Amazon prefers to buy books from publishers on a wholesale basis and then set its own retail prices. But it reluctantly adopted the agency model in the United States recently. If European regulators do not like the agency model, it is hard to imagine that they could live with the proposed French law. In addition to allowing publishers to set retail prices, it would apply to any digital retailer operating in France, even Web sites based elsewhere in Europe. That, according to some publishing executives, sounds like a violation of E.U. e-commerce rules, which are intended to encourage cross-border business. Working out these seeming contradictions could take years. In the meantime, the European e-book market may continue to lag behind. If European books remain unavailable via legitimate digital outlets, the threat of piracy will grow. Publishers, politicians and regulators need only look at the music industry to see what that means.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/technology/personaltech/31smart.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s Appstore Offers More Options for Android Users<date>Published: March 30, 2011</date><text>Android phones and tablets are in many ways as good as Apple devices, but Apple owners have always had a big advantage — namely, the iTunes App Store, which makes it easy to find good software, read reviews from others and even get suggestions on apps that other users bought.Your lamentations have been heard, Android owners. Amazon has created the store for Android apps that Google could not. The Amazon Appstore, which had its debut last week, sells only Android apps for now and does not yet serve AT&amp;T customers. But for Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile customers, the service is a step forward, even considering its shallow selection and the recent upgrade of the Android Market. First, the basics. You can reach the Appstore through Amazon.com’s Web site. If you want to get it on your device, you must first go to the Appstore section of the site and send yourself a text message or an e-mail with a link that, when clicked, installs the software. On a Droid 2 and a Samsung Galaxy tablet, this was a seamless process, but the software would not load on a Sprint EVO 4G. Discussion forums on Amazon suggested the problem was common. Those who visit Amazon’s Appstore on their devices get a better shopping experience than they would get at Google’s Android Market. The Appstore’s home page features links to best-selling and new apps, which helps cut through the clutter of the more than 150,000 Android software programs. The mobile Android Market also includes top paid or free apps (as it does on its Web site). The Appstore frequently offers better supporting information than you would find on the Android Market. Many developers have included multiple photos on Amazon, but just a few for the same programs on the Android Market. Amazon’s descriptions are frequently better, too. For a game like Angry Birds, for instance, Amazon’s merchandisers explain its narrative in great detail, compared with a single paragraph on the Android Market — or, for that matter, competing app stores like AppBrain and GetJar. Parents may especially like the Appstore. Using the Market app that is installed on Android phones, children can stumble onto a wide range of software meant for adults, including sexually-oriented apps and those with vulgar language. But Amazon, like Apple, does not sell mobile software that it deems offensive. Last week, for instance, Amazon offered neither Dirty Jokes nor Fantastic Sex Positions, which were both available on the Android Market. Amazon declined to say whether it had rejected the apps, or whether the developers simply had not submitted their software to the Appstore, but as of last week, a search for “sex” in the Appstore returned three fairly tame apps. Other users will find solace in the fact that like Apple, Amazon tests each software program it sells, to ensure an app works well and has no malware. Google’s Android Market takes a less aggressive approach to malware, deleting apps only after they have been shown to corrupt devices. And it does not hold developers accountable for offering software that simply does not work well. Browse the descriptions of a handful of more obscure apps, and you’ll find many complaints from users that they won’t function on a particular device. At least in the short term, users will find one big disadvantage to Amazon’s diligence. Only about 4,000 apps have made it through Amazon’s testing and merchandising process, and until that number grows, shoppers will find notable omissions. Of my top 10 Android apps and the 10 that made honorable mention, half were missing from the Appstore, including very popular ones like Epicurious, FlightTrack, Weather Channel, Quickoffice and, strangely, all but one obscure Google app. For a company that made its name by promoting the vastness of its product selection, it’s not a great start. The online version of Amazon’s Appstore falls short of its mobile version — and the Android Market — in at least one other important respect. When owners of Android tablets open the Appstore from their device, they see only software that works for that device. On the Web, they must sift through an app’s description to see if it works on a tablet. The Android Market, meanwhile, features a section for tablet apps that, while fairly shallow, is better than what Amazon offers. If that hardship inflicts any real pain on Amazon users, they can find solace in the Appstore’s daily promotion, in which users can download a free app that would otherwise cost money. Last week’s giveaways included the new version of Angry Birds, Angry Birds Rio, that is selling for $1 in Apple’s store, as well as other popular ones, like Doodle Jump and Shazam. The Appstore scores points in other ways. Customer service, for instance, takes a step forward for Android users, who can expect a reply when they send Amazon a note. Customers of iTunes and the Android Market, by contrast, must seek help from the developers themselves. Too frequently, this means either searching endlessly for an e-mail address that doesn’t exist, or sending a message into deep space. Does that compensate for the relative dearth of apps? Not alone. But along with the app giveaways, the deeper product descriptions and the screening for offensive or harmful apps, it is an advantage that cannot be ignored. In the short term, if I hear about a good app, I’ll check Amazon first, since it is easier to shop there than the Android Market, AppBrain or GetJar, other online competitors. If Amazon makes good on its “Earth’s biggest selection” claims — and finds a way to serve AT&amp;T customers as well — many Android users will have little reason to shop elsewhere. Quick Calls The Classic Car Guide, which is free on Apple, includes photos, market prices and recent transaction data for popular and obscure cars, and links to Craigslist or eBay offers as well as local auctions. An Android version is coming soon. If you don’t quite trust Wikipedia, try Britannica Concise Encyclopedia 2011 ($20 for Apple, Android and BlackBerry), which includes more than 25,000 entries and 2,700 images. Sports Illustrated’s Front Row, free for Apple and Android, offers photo galleries from major sporting events. The quality is what you would expect from the longtime standard-bearer of sports journalism. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: April 2, 2011 The App Smart column in the Personal Tech pages on Thursday, about Amazonâs new Appstore for Android apps, misstated the capabilities of a rival, the mobile version of Android Market. The mobile version includes listings of top paid and free apps; it is not the case that the feature is absent.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/technology/personaltech/31pogue.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon’s Cloud Player Provides Music From Everywhere<date>Published: March 30, 2011</date><text>For years now, the most popular music system — Apple’s — has worked like this. You buy song files from the iTunes store. They download to your computer. If you want to listen to them on the road, you connect your iPod or iPhone to that computer and copy the files to it.Amazon, whose online music store competes with Apple’s, has two problems with that arrangement. First, your music library is messily scattered. When you buy a new song at home, you can’t listen to it at work, at least not without copying it manually. You might buy a song on your phone, but it won’t be on your computer until you do a sync. And if your music library is big, you can fit only a portion of it onto your phone. Second, Amazon wishes more people would buy music from its store instead of iTunes. This week, the online retailer took the wraps off a slick suite of software and services that solves both problems, and offers some sweet incentives for you to consider it. Amazon’s big idea is that instead of sitting on your computer, your music collection will sit online ( or “in the cloud,” as hipsters insist on saying). That way, you can listen to it from any computer — at home, at work, at a friend’s — by logging into a special Web page called the Amazon Cloud Player. You can also listen to anything in your music collection on an Android phone. No copying or syncing of music is ever required; all your songs are always available everywhere, and they don’t hog any storage on the phone itself. The Cloud Player is a simple, clean, polished music-playback page that looks vaguely like iTunes. It’s dominated by a list of your songs, which you can sort and search. The album art shows up. You can drag songs into playlists. You can play back a song, album or playlist, complete with Shuffle and Repeat functions. You can download songs to your computer (they go directly into iTunes or Windows Media Player). Sound quality is excellent (the streaming is the full 256 kilobits a second of the original files, if you’re into that sort of statistic). There’s a free Uploader app that lets you send your existing music files from your Mac or PC to that same online library, so those songs, too, are available from anywhere. The app is clever enough to preserve your songs and playlists the way you organized them in iTunes or Windows Media Player. (Just note that it recognizes only MP3 and AAC files — not ring tones, audio books or WAV files. Copy-protected songs need not apply.) The app for Android phones is similar. It offers two big buttons: one for listening to your online music collection, and another for playing the music files that are actually on the phone. There’s no way to mix and match — to create a playlist containing some songs from each source, for example. Amazingly enough, all of this is absolutely free. Well, sort of. Songs are pretty big files. That, after all, is one huge advantage of Amazon’s cloud idea: moving those hefty music files to the Internet frees up space on your computers and phones. To get you started, Amazon offers everyone five gigabytes of free space online — enough room for about 1,200 MP3 songs. You can buy more storage; it costs $1 a gigabyte a year. If you have a 50-gigabyte song collection, for example, you’ll pay $50 a year. That can get awfully steep at the high end (like $1,000 for 1,000 gigabytes) — high enough to make “pay $15 a month for unlimited music” sites like Rhapsody look awfully appealing. The storage is good for more than music files, though. Part II of the Amazon announcement is the Cloud Drive, an online hard drive a lot like the Apple iDisk or Microsoft SkyDrive. On this virtual drive, you can store anything at all: photos, Office documents — anything you might like to back up or to retrieve later from any other computer. Even if you never use any of Amazon’s music features, having this five-gigabyte drive online is a pleasant surprise, free to anyone who wants it. (You can view the photos and play the music you’ve stored there, but otherwise, it’s just a place for parking files, not opening them.) Amazon takes the sting out of its storage prices with some special offers. For example, if you buy an album from Amazon’s music store, your Cloud Drive gets bumped up to 20 gigabytes for the year — no charge. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/amazon-introduces-a-digital-music-locker/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon Introduces a Digital Music Locker<date>March 29, 2011, 12:42 am</date><text>Amazon.com plans to introduce a service that will let people upload their digital music to the Web and access it from browsers on any computer and from Android phones. The service, known as a music locker, was made available to Amazon account holders early Tuesday. Amazon will offer a Web-based hard drive backup service called Cloud Drive, where people can store documents, photos, videos and music. It will also offer Cloud Player, which will let people listen to, download and make playlists from the music they store on Cloud Drive from any Web browser or from an app on Android devices. Cloud Player will automatically upload songs bought on Amazon and scan iTunes or Windows libraries to find other music to upload. Amazon is racing Google and Apple, both of which are interested in offering similar services. One key difference is that Google and Apple reportedly want to automatically make all the music that a user owns available to stream on other devices, while Amazon will require that people upload music, except songs they buy on Amazon, to access it elsewhere. The dream of these companies, along with many start-ups, is for people to be able to listen to their music from any computer or phone. But they have all run into the same problem: music labels and publishers would prefer that listeners buy a new copy of a song everywhere they want to listen to it. Several experts in digital music say that the music locker business is still legally ambiguous. For example, though some companies let people upload their music and listen to it elsewhere without any outcry from the labels, others, like MP3tunes, have been sued by music labels. Another issue: it is impossible for Web companies to tell whether a song was bought legally or downloaded illegally. Amazon says it has sidestepped the problem, because its users would upload their songs, in MP3 or A.A.C. format, to the cloud-based service, just like backing them up on an external hard drive or a Web-based computer backup service. “We don’t need a license to store music,” said Craig Pape, director of music at Amazon. “The functionality is the same as an external hard drive.” Companies including Google and Spotify have been forced to delay introducing certain services while they negotiate with the music labels and publishers. Several executives at major labels expressed concern about such a service from Amazon and whether it would violate the terms of their current licensing agreements with the company. They agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because their agreements with Amazon are confidential. Amazon is offering five gigabytes of free storage and 20 gigabytes free if a customer buys an album from Amazon. Ben Sisario contributed reporting.</text></article>

In an effort to propel itself into the business of filling orders for large retailers, eBay has agreed to buy GSI Commerce, an online services company, for $2.4 billion. The acquisition, announced on Monday, shows how the 16-year-old eBay is taking on rivals like Amazon.com while trying to thwart upstarts like Groupon. With GSI, eBay can expand beyond its network of small power sellers to connect with large retailers. GSI helps manage the Web sites and online marketing campaigns for Toys ''R'' Us, Aeropostale and Kenneth Cole, among others, and its services include payment processing, order management and customer service. GSI's seven warehouses, for example, can stock a retailer's merchandise and ship and track product. Managing orders for large retailers would be a major departure for eBay, which has long avoided the complexities of stocking merchandise, shipping and processing returns. Instead, sellers on its namesake marketplace have had to handle the job for themselves or turn to competitors like Amazon. John Donahoe, the company's chief executive, said the deal, eBay's largest since its $2.6 billion purchase of Skype in 2005, is a reaction to the shifting retail landscape. ''What we see happening today is that commerce is changing rapidly,'' he said in a telephone interview on Monday. ''The boundary between offline and online commerce is coming down at a stunning rate,'' creating a ''multichannel environment'' that is changing the way retailers do business and how they reach their customers, he said. EBay has had a mixed record in acquisitions - while PayPal has been a success, the company sold Skype in 2009 after it failed to gain much traction with eBay users. The company is offering $29.25 a share in cash, a 51 percent premium over the closing price of GSI's shares on Friday. ''There is no doubt that this is a shot across the bow of Amazon,'' said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's. ''Unfortunately, for eBay, they are always going to be dogged by some extent by the Skype experience.'' Jordan Rohan, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said that by integrating GSI's services with eBay's PayPal payments service and its Bill Me Later online credit service, eBay can compete with Amazon, which also offers fulfillment services for small businesses. ''EBay can now cross-sell the services that GSI provides to the thousands of power sellers on eBay,'' he said, ''They are paying a reasonable price to be more competitive with Amazon.'' The tension between eBay and Amazon has escalated in recent months as they battle for United States market share. Last year, Amazon's total revenue grew 40 percent, to $34.2 billion, while sales for eBay rose 5 percent, to $9.2 billion. GSI had revenue of $1.4 billion in 2010. Unlike Amazon, which sells a lot of its own inventory, Mr. Donahoe said eBay had defined its mission as connecting buyers and sellers. ''We do not compete with our customers,'' he added. Mr. Donahoe said that GSI would be able to take advantage of eBay's expertise in mobile commerce (a segment that is on track to record $4 billion in gross merchandise sales this year) and that eBay would be able to promote its PayPal service on the sites of retailers that use GSI. Eventually, eBay's core marketplace could also serve as an outlet for GSI's large retailers if they need to get rid of surplus inventory. ''Over a period of time, we will also make it easier for GSI to list on eBay; it could be through listings, flash sales or their own stores,'' he said. Local retail markets, Mr. Donahoe added, represent a ''huge opportunity'' and eBay plans to increase its efforts there as well. Late last year, eBay bought Milo, a local shopping search engine, for $75 million. Yet with companies like Groupon - which is said to be considering a $25 billion public offering - dominating the intersection between the Web and local merchants, eBay faces challenges on that front as well. Kerry Rice, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said eBay might have to make a major acquisition in local online retailing.</text></article>

What do you do when an e-book on the Kindle for Android app freezes? A. If your Android phone constantly locks up on one particular e-book, it might be because the book didn’t fully download or the file itself is corrupted. Kindle books that look as if they are missing pages probably didn’t download properly either. (Amazon also reports some problems with garbled Kindle files on Android phones running the Cyanogen modification of the system, but if you are running the version of Android that came with the phone, a corrupted file is more likely.) To fix the problem, try deleting the troublesome book and downloading it again. Fire up the Kindle app on the phone, go to the Home screen and press down on the problematic book’s icon until the on-screen menu appears. Select the “Remove from device” option. Next, tap the Menu button and choose Archived Items. Look on the Archived Items list for the title of the book you just deleted from the phone. Tap the title and download a new copy of the book. Amazon suggests keeping a consistent wireless connection, leaving the Kindle app open until the download finishes. If the book still causes problems after you download it again, contact Amazon’s Kindle Support department and report the issue.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/amazon-opens-an-android-app-store/?ref=amazoninc">Amazon to Open Android App Store as Apple Sues<date>March 22, 2011, 3:05 am</date><text>Amazon’s app store will give away a paid app every day as a promotion, beginning with Angry Birds Rio. 6:53 a.m. | Updated Adding confirmation of lawsuit and comments from the companies. Amazon.com is entering the mobile app business with an Android app store that is scheduled to open Tuesday. The store’s name has already prompted a lawsuit from Apple. The Amazon Appstore, which will be accessible at Amazon.com/appstore and through a mobile app, will sell applications for Android phones and tablets. It will also encroach on Google’s territory by providing Android users with a new way to buy apps that cuts Google out of the equation. The store, which Amazon initially announced in January, prompted a trademark infringement suit on Friday from Apple, which claims ownership of the App Store name. “We’ve asked Amazon not to copy the App Store name because it will confuse and mislead customers,” Apple said in a statement late Monday. Amazon said it had a policy of not commenting on litigation. Because Android is an open platform, unlike Apple’s, other companies can open stores that sell Android apps. But Amazon is perhaps a more formidable competitor than others because people are used to buying things through the site and its mobile apps — and many have stored their credit card numbers on Amazon for years. Amazon will provide a few things that Google’s Android Market does not, said Aaron Rubenson, category leader for the Appstore at Amazon, by throwing its marketing and e-commerce expertise behind the new service. “We spent years building shopping features that help customers find the products that are relevant to them from amidst a massive selection,” Mr. Rubenson said, “and we’re excited to apply those capabilities to the apps market.” For instance, it will use the recommendation algorithm that Amazon uses on its Web site to suggest certain apps, so if someone shops for March Madness gear on Amazon.com, the Appstore would recommend basketball apps. It will also offer a paid app for free every day, beginning with Angry Birds Rio. And users can test apps on the Web site before buying them. The recommendation engine may be most important. There are so many apps that Apple, Google and others have struggled to suggest the right ones to users. For a long time, Google’s Android Market was quite difficult to search, but Google recently introduced a new and improved Android Market. A Google spokesman declined to comment on Amazon’s Android app store. For app developers, the biggest difference between Amazon’s app store and others is that Amazon will set the prices the apps will sell for. Developers will suggest a price, but Amazon could sell them for a different price — potentially less than the sale price on the Android Market. Amazon will pay developers the greater of either 70 percent of the sale price, which is the standard revenue-share percentage for app stores, or 20 percent of the price the developer suggests the app sells for. Unlike Google, Amazon will review apps before they are sold, but will only block them if they don’t work or if they put the customer’s data at risk, Mr. Rubenson said. That is somewhere in between the policies of Apple, which has blocked apps for other reasons, and Google, which doesn’t review them and faced the consequences this month when malware snuck into the Android Market. As for whether the Kindle, Amazon’s e-reader, could eventually run the Android operating system, Mr. Rubenson said there is “nothing that we’ve announced.” Amazon is, however, considering selling apps for platforms other than Android.</text></article>

Ms. Hocking, a 26-year-old Minnesota native who writes young-adult paranormal and dystopian novels, began self-publishing her books last year. Since then, she has sold more than 900,000 copies of nine books, mostly in electronic form, she wrote on her blog. On Amazon.com, her e-books sell for $2.99 or $.99, well below the price of a typical newly released book from a major publisher. It is a lucrative model for the author: for a book priced at $2.99, Ms. Hocking keeps 70 percent of the revenue, and 30 percent goes to the online retailer. She is represented by the literary agent Steven Axelrod, who declined to comment. The auction could be completed by the end of Monday or Tuesday, one person close to the bidding said. Ms. Hocking has been held up as an example of an author who has shrewdly circumvented the established publishing industry, selling her novels through retailers like Amazon.com and BN.com and promoting them on her Facebook page and Twitter feed. Her books have landed on the USA Today best-seller list. But she has dismissed suggestions that her success is easily replicated. “Self-publishing and traditional publishing really aren’t that different,” she wrote in a widely circulated blog post early this month. “One is easier to get into but harder to maintain. But neither come with guarantees. Some books will sell, some won’t.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/18fri3.html?ref=amazoninc">Amazon v. the States<date>Published: March 17, 2011</date><text>It never made sense to exempt online retailers from collecting sales tax. It’s ridiculous now when so many states are in deep fiscal trouble. Illinois estimates that it is losing more than $150 million a year in uncollected taxes; California is losing an estimated $300 million a year. That would cover more than half the planned cuts for the University of California system. It’s good news that states are using new legal tools to force Internet retailers to do what every other retailer must do. It is disappointing to see Amazon.com fight back. Amazon and other Web retailers are shielded by a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that retailers could be required to collect sales tax only in states where they had some physical presence. Amazon has kept itself off the hook in several states using warehouses owned by subsidiaries. That strategy is now being challenged. In October, Texas sent a $269 million bill to the company for four years’ worth of taxes, citing Amazon’s Texas warehouse, owned by a subsidiary. In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley is reportedly reconsidering a deal cut by her predecessor that would allow Amazon to set up a warehouse there and exempt it from collecting sales taxes. Last week, Illinois passed a law forcing online retailers to collect sales tax if they have local affiliates — local businesses, blogs or nonprofits — whose Web sites sent business their way in exchange for a cut. New York, Rhode Island and North Carolina have adopted similar laws, and New Mexico, Minnesota and Vermont are considering their own legislation. After Amazon threatened to terminate its affiliate programs in California and Hawaii, governors in both states vetoed similar bills. The California Legislature is trying again. Amazon isn’t giving up. It is disputing the tax charge in Texas and said it will close the warehouse there. It challenged the New York law in state court and lost but is now appealing. It has terminated affiliate programs in Rhode Island and North Carolina and said it will sever its affiliate links in Illinois in April. Collecting state taxes is not an unreasonable burden for online retailers. Amazon already collects taxes in five states, including New York, and it also collects taxes on behalf of physical retailers that sell through Amazon. The best outcome would be for Congress to pass legislation requiring all retailers, online and off, to collect sales taxes everywhere they are due. In the meantime, states should not give in to Amazon’s pressure tactics.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/technology/14amazon.html?ref=amazoninc">Struggling States Try to Get Amazon to Collect Sales Tax<date>Published: March 13, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Across the country, state officials struggling with big budget shortfalls are trying to get Amazon.com to take on a role it does not want: tax collector.Amazon’s skirmishes with states over whether it should collect sales taxes have been an ongoing battle. But the fighting has recently escalated, coinciding with the economic woes that have left a number of states struggling with multibillion-dollar deficits, and looking for money wherever they can find it. Last Thursday, Gov. Pat Quinn, Democrat of Illinois, signed a law that compels online retailers that work with affiliates in his state to collect sales tax on purchases by residents. Affiliates are partner sites that earn commissions by advertising or linking to an online retailer’s products, sending traffic that way. Lawmakers in California, Hawaii, New Mexico, Minnesota and Vermont have introduced similar legislation. Amazon, based in Seattle, is fighting back. It vehemently opposes the legislative efforts, and in letters to state officials, has called the provisions unconstitutional and counterproductive. “We play by the same rules as other retailers, as the national chains collect online only for states where they have physical stores,” Paul Misener, Amazon’s vice president for public policy, said in a statement. Meanwhile, last fall, Texas officials sent Amazon a tax bill for $269 million, after determining that the retailer’s Dallas-area warehouse, owned by a subsidiary, qualified as a local address under state tax rules. Amazon had argued for years that without stores and offices in the state, it had no obligation to collect sales tax there. The dispute is to be decided in a coming administrative hearing. In retaliation for Texas’s move, Amazon said last month that it would close the warehouse next month and cancel plans to build another. “It’s a time-honored custom to not pay taxes,” said Susan Combs, the Texas comptroller. “A lot of people try not to, but it’s up to the state to make sure that there’s tax fairness.” The new laws are intended to help fill state coffers as lawmakers are being forced to cut funding to education, Medicaid and public safety. The changes are also promoted as leveling the playing field between online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores, which must tack on an extra 8 percent in most states, give or take, to the price of every transaction. A state can compel companies to collect taxes only if they have a physical presence in the state, or a nexus, as the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North Dakota in 1992. Absent a nexus, online retailers and mail-order companies can sell products without collecting the tax. What many people fail to realize, however, is that the tax is still due. Residents are supposed to self-report what they owe in their annual state tax filing, but most people do not. State officials have long lamented the shortfall and sought ways to collect a bigger portion by using a mix of education and threats. California, for instance, expects to be shortchanged $1.15 billion in 2010 from e-commerce and catalog sales, according to estimates from the state Board of Equalization. The only way to close that gap is for online retailers and others to start collecting sales tax, said Betty T. Yee, a member of California’s Board of Equalization. “There seems to be a groundswell of activity by other states that suggest that the time is right,” she said. Eliminating the tax gap would provide more than enough money to offset proposed cuts to California’s universities or to its programs for the developmentally disabled. But Ms. Yee said any law would most likely be challenged in court and would therefore be unlikely to lift state revenue for some time. Amazon collects sales tax in only five states — Kansas, Kentucky, New York, North Dakota and Washington — where it has offices or another physical presence. It avoids collecting in several other states where it has warehouses by assigning their ownership to a subsidiary. Until the tax dispute in Texas, Amazon had encountered few problems with that arrangement. Now, though, as Amazon seeks to open warehouses in South Carolina and Tennessee, it is also pressing for specific legislation to exempt it from collecting sales tax, using the jobs created by the facilities as leverage. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Right about now is when their big annual rebate checks arrive from American Express.Amex has a couple of different Costco-branded credit cards. The ones currently available to new customers earn 2 percent back on all travel purchases, 3 percent on all restaurant charges and at least 3 percent on gasoline (at any station, not just Costco ones) up to certain annual spending limits. Plus, you get 1 percent cash back for spending everywhere else. The check arrives attached to the bill for February, but it comes with a catch: You have to go to Costco to redeem it. You can just collect cash, turn around and walk out. But Costco is clearly hoping that most people will see the check as a good excuse to go shopping right then and there. And that’s what most people seem to do. I have this card and love it. But I’ve also begun to question the value of the time it takes for an expedition to one of these stores. And if you shop at Sam’s Club or BJ’s, Costco’s competitors, you may be wondering, too. After all, the older you get, the more valuable your time seems. And going to Costco, even though it’s just a couple of miles from my home, is generally a two-hour round trip by the time the driving, the shopping, the waiting in line, the loading of the car and the unloading back home are done. In 2007, meanwhile, Amazon.com introduced a service called Subscribe &amp; Save. The premise is simple: If you agree to get a recurring shipment of an item, Amazon will cut 15 percent off its normal price and send it to you every one, two, three or six months without charging the standard shipping rate. So I subscribed to toilet paper, which makes for a great story and good fun for children when three months’ worth arrives and become a temporary tower or a fort on the living room floor. Ever since the toilet paper subscription (and later, the paper towel one) started coming, I’ve wondered what it would be like to subscribe via Amazon to everything I get at Costco and never set foot in the place again, except to cash my check each year. So this year, $304.50 refund check in hand, I went to Costco with a list of items that most households need to replenish every so often. I recorded the prices. Then, I compared them with identical items at Amazon, looking in particular for the ones among the 40,000 or so that are now available for subscription. My guess is that many Costco customers would find that any savings they gain by shopping there is eliminated and then some when they consider the value of the time spent going to and fro many times a year. That’s time they would win back if they subscribed to those same items at Amazon and then never had to think again about running out of them. My Costco list included the following: Huggies diapers, Tide powder, Bounty paper towels, Swiffer refills, Clorox wipes, Ziploc sandwich bags and enough Duracell batteries to power multiple electronic devices for many months. There was also Dove soap, Lubriderm lotion, Tampax, Mach 3 Turbo razor blades and enough house brand ibuprofen to kill off hundreds of headaches, among other things. Then, I spent some time on Amazon’s site and recorded the per unit price for each of these items. Almost all were available at the discounted subscription price, which manufacturers help Amazon pay for (so excited are they by the idea of a recurring pipeline into people’s homes and wallets). Setting up Amazon subscriptions for the first time probably takes about as much time as a round trip to Costco. But, according to Doug Herrington, vice president of consumables for Amazon, many people start with just a few items. “They add over time,” he said. “They start with one big schlep factor, like toilet paper or diapers.” Over time, you may need to adjust your delivery dates So what does that 15 percent discount get you? My sample basket of goods, enough for a three-month supply for a family of four, cost $251 at Amazon. At Costco, it was $208, representing a 17 percent savings. Costco was tied or cheaper on every item, occasionally by a lot. Amazon, for instance, isn’t competitive on large containers of cleaning liquids of various sorts, since it’s just too expensive to ship those sorts of things. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Instead, I gave it a brief mention in my column this weekend. So here’s where you come in. How would you attempt to break down the analysis? Is an Amazon subscription greener, since the company has no stores where it has to keep the lights and the heat on? Or is it better to drive to Costco a few times each year to stock up, thus avoiding all the cardboard boxes that often come with Amazon purchases? Doug Herrington, vice president of consumables at Amazon, tried to frame it this way: It’s the difference between your several-thousand-pound vehicle lumbering up the road to a warehouse store vs. letting your small package carpool with others on a U.P.S. truck. But you know what he wants you to think. So which choice do you think is greener?</text></article>

I’d always wondered how much money I was really saving by shopping at Costco and whether it was worth the two hours it generally takes round trip. I’d gotten more interested in figuring this out in the last year or two as I’ve experimented with Amazon.com’s Subscribe &amp; Save program, which allows you to sign up for automatic delivery of household staples at regular intervals. For me, at least, the savings at Costco (or Sam’s Club or BJ’s) over Amazon don’t equal the value I place on the time it takes to shop at Costco. You may feel differently, if you’re able to shop for fresh foods there (I mostly don’t) in addition to cleaning supplies and other products that won’t spoil, or you have a large family. (Also, if you want to comment about the environmental impact of Costco vs. Amazon, you can do so in a separate post. ) So how do you do the math on whether a warehouse club membership is worth it?</text></article>

My wife says, ''Let's watch a movie,'' and I say, ''Sure, satellite, Netflix, Xbox Live, Sony's PlayStation Network or how 'bout the old-fashioned DVD, or the Blu-ray player?'' And she gives me an exasperated look that says: ''I had any number of suitors. Pick a medium and let's watch.'' Yet the options keep growing. Today, Amazon.com joined the increasingly aggressive suite of contenders for our attention by ramping up its own movie offerings. Members of the company's Prime Service ($79 a year for unlimited two-day shipping) can now tap into a library of 5,000 movies they can stream for free. The movies come from 16 studios and include a few recent notable titles, like ''The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,'' and a few old big-name titles, like ''Amadeus'' and ''Chariots of Fire,'' as well as shows like Ken Burns's ''National Parks,'' for when you have no other way to kill 400 hours. Movies as a complement to free shipping? Sounds odd, right? Like the Postal Service tossing in a Jay-Z single or a bucket of popcorn with the stamps. So what gives with this unusual coupling? And what does it say about the intensifying competition for our attention? To the first question, Amazon can hope to achieve two aims by offering free movie downloads to its Prime members. One is that it sweetens a service that creates loyalty for Amazon as a retailer. After all, if you've already paid it for shipping, you're more inclined to visit it to buy the toaster or book or loafers. Second, Amazon is trying to create attention for its movie download business, which sells downloads on a per-title basis ($3.99 for a new release), and which in general hasn't gotten near the recognition of competitors like Netflix. (Netflix's cheapest service is $96 a year.) By offering free movies to Prime shipping customers, it begins to associate itself as an entertainment portal in the minds of people already using it regularly. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/business/media/17borders.html?ref=amazoninc">Borders’ Bankruptcy Shakes the Publishing Industry<date>Published: February 16, 2011</date><text>After Borders, the 40-year-old retail chain that helped define the age of the book superstore, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, the struggling book industry was left wondering what was next — and maybe even who was next.The troubles of Borders are rooted in a series of strategic missteps, executive turnover and a failure to understand the digital revolution — problems in many ways of Borders’ own making. But as those in the volatile industry digested the news that most saw coming, they were acutely aware of the bigger picture: that in a fast-evolving bookselling environment there is slim margin for error. “The book retailing industry is very challenging right now,” said Michael Souers, an analyst for Standard &amp; Poor’s. “We’ve had significant transformation. Bookstores have gradually been losing their prominence, and the U.S. market is oversaturated in terms of the number of retail stores. So that trend will likely continue as e-books gain more prevalence in the market.” Borders was once seen as the brainier of the large chains, beginning in 1971 as a used bookstore in Ann Arbor, Mich. In the 1990s, that image began to fade as the chain expanded wildly and helped wipe out many mom-and-pop independent stores. Now the company is set to close some 200 stores and shed much of its staff in the coming weeks. The stores slated for closure are scattered throughout the country, including three outlets in Manhattan, 35 in California and 15 stores in the Chicago metropolitan area. The company currently operates more than 650 stores and employs 19,500 people. Borders said that its stores would remain open during the bankruptcy process and that its rewards program would remain in effect. The company said it would continue to honor gift cards and coupons. In its filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Borders listed $1.29 billion in debt and $1.27 billion in assets. As of the filing, Borders owed $272 million to its 30 largest unsecured creditors — including $41.1 million to the Penguin Group USA. Publishers, mourning the loss of valuable shelf space, said they hoped the bankruptcy filing would be a chance for the bookseller to reinvent itself. But they were also skeptical that the company’s deep-rooted problems could be overcome. Borders told publishers on Wednesday that it was working on a long-term plan for its revival. “It has become increasingly clear that in light of the environment of curtailed customer spending, our ongoing discussions with publishers and other vendor-related parties, and the company’s lack of liquidity, Borders Group does not have the capital resources it needs to be a viable competitor and which are essential for it to move forward with its business strategy to reposition itself successfully for the long term,” Mike Edwards, the company president, said in a statement. One area in which the chain has struggled is its online business. Borders, which was hurt by pressure from Amazon.com, Barnes &amp; Noble and big-box stores like Wal-Mart, badly lagged behind Barnes &amp; Noble in establishing a viable online book business. In 2001, it linked its online store to Amazon, but waited until 2008 to restart its own e-commerce site. Shake-ups at the top of the Borders corporate structure contributed to an overall sense of instability in the last several years. When other stores were downsizing or eliminating their music and DVD sections, Borders delayed scaling back its own. Borders also opened stores overseas, a move that analysts said stretched the company thin. “They overexpanded,” said Michael Norris, senior analyst with Simba Information, which provides research and advice to publishers. “They just had the mentality of, ‘If we open a new store, the growth will happen.’ ” As e-reading began to take off, Barnes &amp; Noble created its own signature product, the Nook, to compete against the Amazon Kindle. Borders, in contrast, carried at least six devices, including the Kobo, the Velocity Micro Cruz tablet, the Sony Pocket Edition and the Franklin AnyBook, an audio-only reader shaped like a remote control. None of them have gained significant traction with consumers, compared with the more popular Kindle and Nook. For the last five years, Borders stock has drifted downward and the number of employees reduced to 19,500 from 35,000. Its same-store sales were down more than 12 percent in the third quarter of 2010, with a loss of $74.4 million. In conversations with publishers last year, top executives at Borders said they were confident the troubled company could revamp, even suggesting that some stores would be outfitted with wine bars to offer a more social atmosphere. The executives also said they believed there was a strong possibility that Borders could eventually merge with Barnes &amp; Noble. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/weekinreview/13brustein.html?ref=amazoninc">Why Innovation Doffs an Old Hat<date>Published: February 12, 2011</date><text>Just as the average human carries around the remnants of a prehistoric tail and a useless appendix, the tools we use also bear marks of the evolutionary process from which they arose.Digital cameras produce a reassuringly retro but artificial shutter snap when you push the button to take a photograph; cellphones have keyboards with layouts originally meant to keep typewriters from jamming; and blue jeans have pockets that are a throwback to a time when watches dangled from chains. Add to that list Amazon’s e-reader, the Kindle, which will now supplement its “location numbers” with page numbers that correspond to physical books. The change, announced last week, does have a practical purpose — especially for book clubs, whose digital readers presumably will no longer have trouble looking up the same page as analog readers. But there is also a sense of absurdity here. E-books, by definition, do not have pages. Depending on which size font someone uses, she may have to advance the screen many times before “turning a page.” Then there are the questions of how to approach books with many physical editions, or texts that exist only in digital space. But decisions like Amazon’s are not based on practicality alone. “The location numbers on a Kindle are rational, and they make sense for the medium — but they don’t correspond to the emotional expectations of what a book is,” said Adam Greenfield, managing director of Urbanscale, a New York-based urban design practice, and author of “Everyware: The Dawning Age of Ubiquitous Computing.” Designers in all fields are regularly confronted with versions of this choice: whether to incorporate cues to keep people grounded in what has come before, or scrap convention completely. In transportation, for instance, the power of steam engines was initially described in relation to that of horses, a practice that has continued to the present day. Automobile designers have incorporated visual cues suggesting carriages; for example, adding nonfunctional spokes on wheels. Today, electric cars, which can operate with unsettling silence, are being designed to make more noise, largely for safety reasons. Such design is also common in the digital world. The basic interface for personal computers was designed as a desktop with a series of folders and a trash can in the corner because it allowed users to work in the way they were used to doing in the physical world. But referencing the past can serve to dampen the imagination of designers working on disruptive products, said Bill Moggridge, the director of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the author of “Designing Interactions,” a history of digital design. “The tendency is to use a form of conservatism,” he said. “You just make it look like what was there before. But if you want to create something truly innovative, the utility of that starts to fade.” This tension is palpable in many efforts to create new digital media experiences. The Daily, Rupert Murdoch’s publication designed specifically for tablet computers, incorporates video and interactivity into what is essentially a newspaper. At the same time, it is designed to show up on a reader’s digital doorstep once a day, a concept that seems as old-fashioned as pocket watches when compared with Web sites that are updated continually. Apple, probably the best symbol of the march into a new digital era, also encourages designers to incorporate analog references in its devices. On the iPad, users enter appointments into a calendar that is encased in an on-screen leather ledger, scrawl notes on what looks like a legal pad and advance through digital books by swiping their fingers across the screen, prompting an animation that actually looks like a page being turned. Such superfluous references to the past are known as skeuomorphs (from the Greek words for tool and form), and Apple’s fondness for them on the iPad has provoked criticism from some designers. “It drives a lot of designers batty because it is so skeuomorphically heavy,” said Craig Mod, a designer for Flipboard, a magazine for the iPad. Amazon, by contrast, has faithfully recreated the experience of book reading by building on its innovations with the Kindle, said Mr. Mod. Because the screen is not backlit, and the battery can last for a month, and it is small and light enough to get lost in a pile of papers, the Kindle does seem like a fresh take on the idea of a paperback book, he said. Of course, there are tradeoffs. Shopping for books in the device’s store consists of scrolling through listings of titles, an experience that feels more akin to searching a database than browsing in a bookstore. But if this means that Amazon’s customers are less likely to judge e-books by their covers, at least some readers would consider that to be true progress.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/page-numbers-for-kindle-books-an-imperfect-solution/?ref=amazoninc">Page Numbers for Kindle Books an Imperfect Solution<date>February 8, 2011, 4:45 pm</date><text>Since the dawn of the Kindle, there’s been one quirky little feature that has baffled or thrilled the multitudes: page numbers. The Kindle e-book reader has always displayed its own “location numbers” rather than page numbers. Why? Because page numbers make no sense on an e-book. If you make the type larger or smaller, the page numbering would change. A 100-page book becomes 200 pages long when you double the type size. Amazon’s Kindle will have page numbers that correspond to real books. Or what should happen when you read the first 15 pages of a book on your Kindle, and then continue on your iPod Touch? Obviously, only a fraction as much text appears on the small screen, so the page numbering wouldn’t match. That’s why Amazon invented “location numbers” that correspond to the bits of text on the screen, consistently on any screen and at at any time size—not paper page numbers. (Otherwise, you’d get citations like: “’I regret that I have but one life to give for my country,’ says Nathan Hale on page 384 when viewed using the Arial font, 14-point size on the 13-inch MacBook Air screen.”) Seemed logical enough at the time. Unfortunately, this system causes headaches for anyone who has to make specific citations: a student writing a paper, for example, a teacher giving reading assignments, or someone trying to follow along at a book club. Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook books use a different system. Its page numbers correspond to the physical pages of the book, solving one problem but introducing others. Amazon has finally tackled this problem, as you’ll see in the next Kindle software update. (It’s available now as an Early Preview.) Kindle books will give you the option of either system: “location” numbers that remain attached to the same passages no matter what the screen or type size, and page numbers that reflect where you are in the printed book. The real page numbers, of course, may display some weirdness—you might swipe your finger to “turn the page” on your iPhone, but the page number won’t change. Or you may adjust the type size and see the page number change (because the displayed page number corresponds to whatever word is at the top left of the screen). All of this requires some rejiggering of the existing e-book files; Amazon has already converted “tens of thousands” of books and will soon update its Kindle reading apps for iPhone, Android and so on, to take advantage of the new feature. Bottom line: enough criticizing the Kindle or the Nook for the way they handle page numbers. Neither solution is perfect—“locations” or page numbers—because the problem is unsolvable. The best we can hope for is a choice — and now the Kindle offers one.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/kindle-books-get-page-numbers-and-social-features/?ref=amazoninc">Kindle Books Get Page Numbers and Social Features<date>February 7, 2011, 7:28 pm</date><text>Kindle e-books are about to become more social. They will also be getting a small change that will make many Kindle owners rejoice: page numbers. Amazon.com announced the new features Monday in a company blog post, and said they would be included in a coming software upgrade. Until now, Amazon’s e-books have had no page numbers, making it difficult to read along in a college class or a book club, for instance. The page numbers, which have already been added to many Kindle books and will come to Kindle apps in a few months, correspond with those in print books, which Amazon took pains to note is not the case with all e-books. One of the promises of e-books has been the ability to interact with other readers or online materials while reading, though e-book companies are still in the early days of making that a reality. Kindle readers will soon be able to share their notes and highlights with others and view popular highlights and notes by people they follow. Again, there are potential uses in classrooms or book groups. Amazon wants the Kindle to be social in other ways, too. When people finish reading a book, for instance, they will have the option to share it with friends or rate it. The new software update will also include a different layout for newspapers and magazines, so readers can more quickly scan headlines and pick stories to read. That change comes on the heels of the hype over iPad magazine and newspaper apps, like The Daily, Pulse News Reader and Flipboard, though Amazon’s new layout is not as flashy or unique as those. The new features will be available on the latest generation Kindle and Kindle 3G. Kindle owners will automatically receive it when it’s available (Amazon did not say when that will be) or they can download it now.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/media/02cable.html?ref=amazoninc">Comcast Deal and Amazon Speculation Stir Talk on Online Streaming<date>Published: February 1, 2011</date><text>The increasing importance of Internet rights for television channels and shows has been vividly demonstrated twice in the last few days.Comcast and Time Warner announced an unusually comprehensive pact on Tuesday that covers the online streaming of channels like TNT, TBS, CNN and the Cartoon Network. Meanwhile, media analysts were aflutter about the possibility of Amazon’s starting an online video subscription service that could rival Netflix. Amazon has declined to comment. The blog Engadget published an Amazon.com screen capture on Saturday that suggested that Amazon was preparing an all-you-can-eat video streaming service, which like Netflix could give customers access to a variety of TV shows and films. Barclays analysts said in a note to investors on Monday that they anticipated a service “similar to Netflix’s current platform.” “While its content portfolio would initially likely be less robust than Netflix’s licensed content, we believe Amazon has the scale to become a viable over-the-top distributor over time,” the note stated, before reiterating that such services were largely supplemental to entrenched cable and satellite distributors. Deals like the one between Comcast and Time Warner are devised in part to blunt online upstarts. The companies said the contract was a step forward for their vision of “TV Everywhere,” a concept that holds that people who pay for a cable television subscription once should be able to watch television on any screen, be it a big-screen TV or an iPad. But that concept requires complicated new contracts between programmers like Time Warner and distributors like Comcast. “TV Everywhere” has been slow to materialize, so the announcement on Tuesday was a breakthrough of sorts. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said the agreement “really solidifies our partnership in this effort and really pushes forward the concept of giving consumers more access to quality on-demand content on any device they choose.” The rights for online streaming were part of a larger agreement between the companies. Details were not disclosed, but the agreement also renews Comcast’s traditional carriage of some of Time Warner’s channels. Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, said the contract was for multiple years. On the on-demand side, the agreement covers many of Turner’s TV shows and movies in a variety of places, including Comcast’s streaming Web site, Comcast’s on-demand system on television sets, Turner’s own Web sites, and on tablets and mobile phone screens. Significantly, the contract will cover out-of-home streaming of Turner channels and TV shows by Comcast customers in the future. Comcast already has similar pacts for streaming content with HBO, another part of Time Warner. A Comcast app that allows customers to stream certain TV shows was already visible in the iPad app store on Tuesday night. What remained unknown on Tuesday was whether Comcast was paying a substantial amount for the streaming rights. “They haven’t wanted to pay substantially more for television video-on-demand rights in the past,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst for BTIG. He said of Comcast, “Have they had a change of perspective on paying for additional on-demand rights? Or is this deal about Time Warner just wanting to seed the market because it’s been 18 months and ‘TV Everywhere’ has moved more slowly than investors had hoped?”</text></article>

Revenue rose 36 percent, to $12.95 billion, but analysts had forecast $13.01 billion.Amazon’s fourth-quarter operating profit margin was 3.7 percent, compared with 5 percent a year earlier, a sign of how much Amazon and other retailers had to discount to attract customers during the holidays, analysts said. “Top line still seems to be really strong, but to meet this demand, they’re having to invest in fulfillment and distribution, and that’s taking a little bit of a short-term margin toll,” said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners. For the first quarter, Amazon said it expected revenue of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion. Wall Street expected revenue of $9.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Excluding amortization, the forecast is $400 million to $525 million. Mr. Sena said analysts expected $580 million. Net income in the fourth quarter was $416 million, or 91 cents a share — up from $384 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast 88 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Amazon shares lost 9.2 percent, to $167.50 in late trading after the earnings report, after rising more than 5 percent, to end at $184.45 in regular trading.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/ted-starts-an-e-books-line/?ref=amazoninc">TED Starts an E-Books Line<date>January 26, 2011, 11:05 am</date><text>The conference superstar TED is getting into the e-book business. The popular conference will begin publishing e-books. TED, known for exclusive events and online videos of speeches by celebrities like Al Gore, Bono and Malcolm Gladwell, plans to publish its own short e-books, beginning with three that went on sale Wednesday. “We’ve been dreaming for a long time about whether we could do something in books,” Chris Anderson, the curator of TED, said on Tuesday. “In the last year, seeing the explosion in popularity of digital reading has really sparked a new way of thinking about it.” A TEDBook will be longer than a long magazine article but shorter than a typical book, clocking in at 10,000 to 20,000 words, “in a way that matches modern attention spans,” the publisher said. Each book will be sold for $2.99 on Amazon.com. Since e-books began to take off, publishers have begun experimenting with shorter books and single essays or stories, with mixed success. Without concerns about printing and physical distribution, they have found it simpler to sell electronic content in a significantly shorter length than that of the usual print book. Penguin Book Group, Simon &amp; Schuster and HarperCollins have all sold individual short stories or essays online for prices ranging from 99 cents to $7.99. “When you’re in a digital world and you can author a book at a shorter length than you could in print, then all bets are off and it absolutely makes sense,” Mr. Anderson said. “In the world of print, you really couldn’t put this opportunity in front of people in a meaningful way because it would be a very thin book and people wouldn’t take it seriously.” The first books to be published by TED are “The Happiness Manifesto: How Nations and People Can Nurture Well-Being,” by Nic Marks; “Dangerism: Why We Worry About the Wrong Things, and What It’s Doing to Our Kids,” by Gever Tulley; and “Homo Evolutis: Please Meet the Next Human Species,” by Juan Enriquez and Steve Gullans. Mr. Anderson said that Amazon takes a 30 percent cut of revenue and the rest is split evenly between TED and the author. Eventually, TED will publish one book each month, he said.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/opinion/23pubed.html?ref=amazoninc">A Necessary Clash of News and Advertising<date>Published: January 22, 2011</date><text>Views from readers, responses from the staff and thoughts from Arthur S. Brisbane, the public editor.• I am writing to draw your attention to a recent two-page spread (“A Year Later, Haunted but Hopeful, Haiti Struggles Back,” Jan. 4). As I glanced at the incredible front-page photograph of a young Haitian girl holding her prosthetic leg, I was struck by the glee on her face despite the loss of her limb in the earthquake. Wanting to read the full article, I opened to Page A6 and was immediately dumbstruck by the juxtaposition of the continuation of the article next to a full-page color advertisement on Page A7 for “Escape Winter at Atlantis” — from $399, wine, sushi, martinis, with care-free, debt-loving Americans splashing their way down a water slide. The unfortunate placement of the color advertisement next to the black and white photos of the devastating personal stories of loss and survival following the earthquake in Haiti was disturbing and shocking. While I understand that The Times is under financial pressure and that such advertising is necessary, this demonstrates poor judgment and a lack of sensitivity, and suggests that nobody is looking at the big picture. TRICIA ZIMIC Maplewood, N.J. Brian Fidelman, deputy director, news design: News and advertising are separate departments, on different floors and with different staffs. The content of advertising does not dictate how or where we present the news. There are exceptions, of course. If an ad for Brand X is on the same page as a story about Brand X, we will make an effort to move one of them. But the certainty of that happening is dependent on a number of factors: the flow of news that day, the geometry of the page and the advertisement, and even the size of the paper (which has an impact on where color pages fall). The determining factor in the story placement is where it best serves readers: Is a story in the section where it belongs? If it runs with a related story, is there room for both? Is there enough space for a photograph that goes with the story? In other words, while we make efforts, we’re not always successful. Arthur Brisbane: Ms. Zimic’s letter exposes an awkward reality underlying the basic premise of a newspaper: that it aspires to truth-telling in its news coverage while selling advertising that aspires to put the best possible face on a service or product. To put it bluntly, the basic business proposition is a stark conflict of purposes. For this reason, newspaper managements (including The Times’s) recognize the need to keep the news department and advertising department separate, and even limit communication between the two. Although the effect, as in this case, can be extremely jarring, I believe that readers should take it as a good thing that the ad department and the news department appeared to be blissfully disinterested in each other’s work product on that day. Fairness and Links Is it against Times policy to promote one business at the expense of another in its reporting? If it is, The Times should not link to Amazon whenever a book is mentioned online. (I have just finished reading a post by Stanley Fish in which he links to Amazon’s page for Martha Nussbaum’s new book. Paul Krugman also does this frequently on his blog.) By automatically linking to Amazon, The Times is favoring one retailer of books over all others. I own an independent bookstore, and you are sending business to our competition for no reason having to do with journalism. These links are not purely informational, they are commercial; if you want purely informational links, they are available at publishers’ Web sites. I have to believe that this is against Times policy, and I hope you will act to correct it. MICHAEL HERRMANN Concord, N.H. Philip B. Corbett, standards editor: The guidelines on links for reporters and editors suggest that for commercial products, it’s best when possible to link either to the company (or publisher’s) site, or to a comparison-shopping site where a reader has options. This avoids the problem of seeming to favor one merchant over another. We do not routinely link to Amazon or any other seller from book reviews, etc.; our online “best-seller” lists have a “buy” button that offers several options. Arthur Brisbane: My assistant, Joseph Burgess, and I have checked to see whether this link to Amazon was an aberration and found that a number of blogs on NYTimes.com at times have incorporated links to Amazon, including prominent blogs like Conscience of a Liberal, On the Ground, Economix and The Caucus. It’s commendable that bloggers use links to enable readers to learn more about the subject at hand. But as the reader suggests, and as Times policy requires, it is important to avoid creating a commercial preference for Amazon. I hope The Times will vigilantly observe its policy in the future, as bookstores provide something — a real-world browsing environment — for which there is no online substitute. Playing by Airline Rules In the “On the Road” column of Dec. 28 (“Blizzard, and Inflexibility, Knock Out Air Travel”), Joe Sharkey interviews G. Bruce Hedlund, “who, like all major airline pilots, cannot mention his airline by name in interviews.” Mr. Sharkey does not suggest that he didn’t know what it was, just that the interviewee could not “mention” it. A very brief Internet search reveals that it is American Airlines. The same search reveals that Mr. Hedlund has spoken out publicly many times, and therefore is well known. What possible justification is there for letting him play peekaboo with his credentials? Is there a policy here, and is there any reason why a reader should not find this sort of thing extremely annoying? KEN DORAN Madison, Wis. Joe Sharkey, freelance business travel columnist: There are longtime restrictions on flight crews’ naming their airlines in interviews that haven’t been set up by the company P.R. No pilot or flight attendant I know will talk on the record unless it’s agreed that they will not be identified by airline. They get in trouble for doing so. On the other hand, once they’re assured they’re not going to be called on the carpet by management, they can be pretty candid, as there are no restrictions on what they can say. I regularly speak to lots of pilots and flight attendants, but when I want to quote one on the record, not naming the airline is always the condition they set. If the comment were specific to the airline-employer, I would not agree to this, but in generic air-travel comments I see no problem. Arthur Brisbane: It’s exasperating that the airline companies dictate such a policy; perhaps that’s one reason there are so few lovable airlines. I would encourage The Times, and other news organizations, to push back against this. E-mail: public@nytimes.com</text></article>
