Last winter, the Department of Agriculture deregulated Monsanto's genetically modified alfalfa, despite concerns about cross-pollination of non-genetically modified crops. It then defied a court order banning the planting of genetically modified sugar beets pending completion of an environmental impact study.

Sacrificing the environment for profits didn't stop with Bush, and it doesn't stop with genetically modified organisms. Take, for example, the Keystone XL pipeline extension. XL is right: the 36-inch-wide pipeline, which will stretch from the Alberta tar sands across the Great Plains to the Gulf Coast, will cost $7 billion and run for 1,711 miles - more than twice as long as the Alaska pipeline. It will cross nearly 2,000 rivers, the huge wetlands ecosystem called the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, the country's biggest underground freshwater supply. If Keystone is built, we'll see rising greenhouse gas emissions right away (tar sands production creates three times as many greenhouse gases as does conventional oil), and our increased dependence on fossil fuels will further the likelihood of climate-change disaster. Then there is the disastrous potential of leaks of the non-Wiki-variety. (It's happened before.) Proponents say the pipeline will ease gas prices and oil ''insecurity.'' But domestic drilling has raised, not lowered, oil prices, and as for the insecurity - what we need is to develop wiser ways to use the oil we have. They say, too, that the pipeline could create 100,000 new jobs. But even the Amalgamated Transit Union and the Transport Workers Union oppose the pipeline, saying, ''We need jobs, but not ones based on increasing our reliance on Tar Sands oil.'' Sounds as if union officials have been reading the writer and activist Bill McKibben, who calls the pipeline ''a fuse to the biggest carbon bomb on the continent,'' and NASA scientist Jim Hansen, who says the oil Keystone will deliver ''is essentially game over'' for the planet. Game over? No problem, says the State Department, which concluded that the project will have no significant impact on ''most resources along the proposed pipeline corridor.'' The Sierra Club quickly responded by calling the report ''an insult to anyone who expects government to work for the interests of the American people.'' I do expect that, and I am insulted. President Obama can deny Keystone the permit. A truly environmentally friendly president (like the one candidate Obama appeared to be) would be looking for creative ways to leave fossil fuels underground, not extract them. Perhaps he doesn't ''believe in'' global warming at this point, like many Republicans? When government defends corporate interests, citizens must fight. McKibben has helped organize protests at the White House against Keystone, and he's one of hundreds who've been arrested in the last couple of weeks. These people are showing that the role of government as corporate ally must be challenged. As it will be in the fight against carte blanche for genetically modified organisms: From Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, there will be a march from New York City to Washington to demand that genetically modified foods be labeled, something a majority of Americans want. This small, perfectly reasonable request has run into joint opposition from the biotech industry and (here we go again) the Food and Drug Administration. Why are most of us are filled with mistrust of the government? Maybe because we, like Gen Larkin, know it's so hard to be good under the capitalistic system.

Inquiry<date>Published: June 29, 2011</date><text>Global agribusiness company Monsanto posted a 77 percent jump in net income on Wednesday because of strong sales in its core seeds and genetic traits businesses.Net income for the third quarter ending May 31 rose to $680 million, or $1.26 a share, from $384 million, or 70 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had estimated earnings of $1.11 a share. Sales were up 21 percent, to $3.59 billion. Monsanto also raised its full-year earnings guidance to $2.84 to $2.88 a share, up from $2.72 to $2.82 a share. The quarterly results were clouded partially by Monsanto’s announcement that it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding its customer incentive programs related to its glyphosate products for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The company has been offering farmers who use Monsanto products cash incentives to help them battle weeds that have grown resistant to Monsanto’s glyphosate products, namely Roundup. Monsanto’s Roundup Ready corn, soybean and cotton seeds, which are engineered to be resistant to the herbicide, are popular with farmers, but they have contributed to the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds. Hugh Grant, the chief executive, declined to discuss details of the S.E.C. investigation but said the company was cooperating with a subpoena for documents. Glyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide, was once a main driver of revenue. But the company has been struggling with stiff competition as well as rolling out new products to try to increase sales even as it has shifted its focus to the seeds side of the company. Shares of Monsanto rose 5 percent, or $3.36, to $70.26 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Global agribusiness company Monsanto posted a 77 percent jump in net income on Wednesday because of strong sales in its core seeds and genetic traits businesses.</text></article>

Many thanks to the dozens of readers who offered comments, criticisms and questions about my article in Sunday’s paper about the world’s food system. Below, I respond to a few questions that represent concerns raised by more than one reader. Associated PressNorman Borlaug, a Green Revolution pioneer, with a wheat stalk in 1970. Q. How can you dismiss the environmental effects that the Green Revolution has had? The chemical and seed technology companies have a lot at stake in you believing that this is the only way to feed the world. Why aren’t people involved with farming without chemicals and biotechnology part of this conversation? There is certainly proof that organic can feed the world. Intensive agriculture depletes the soil, and do remember that there are as many obese people in the world as there are hungry, so we are obviously doing something wrong. In America we currently produce double the calories that each person needs. Hunger is not only about production, it is about distribution and politics. Rachel Berger A. I do not dismiss the environmental effects. I take them seriously, and outlined them at some length in this blog post. It is beyond question that producing food for seven billion people has done massive damage to the planet, and that creating a more sustainable agriculture, even as we ramp up food production to meet rising demand, is one of the urgent challenges of our time. As you say, how food is distributed and how people eat — too much in some places, too little in others — are major issues, although they were beyond the scope of my recent article. I also agree with those readers who point out that food waste is a big issue. But my reporting has not turned up “proof that organic can feed the world” — quite the contrary. Experts point out that organic production standards rule out the use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, and without added nitrogen, it would be mathematically impossible to feed the current world population, much less a future population of 10 billion. Vaclav Smil outlines the situation in this piece. Agronomists told me that the crucial task for them is to take as many good ideas as they can from organic agriculture and related movements and transfer those into the conventional food system. In my Sunday blog post, I discussed one attempt to do this, through a technique called conservation agriculture, but clearly more efforts are needed in this direction. Q. Perhaps the most significant unnamed driver of our looming food crisis is the massive use of grain, water, chemicals, and energy to produce meat and dairy products. For a start, please read the executive summary from the F.A.O.’s stunning report, “Livestock’s Long Shadow.” Shams, Kensington, Calif. A. Thanks for the link to what is indeed an interesting report. Several readers have raised the question of why I didn’t discuss the meat issue in my article. The point is well taken, in that rising meat consumption is a massive driver of demand in the food system. It is the reason China has a become a big importer of Brazilian soybeans, to cite just one among many examples of the environmental cost of meat. I dodged the subject in my piece partly because we have written so much about it in the Times over the years. But I avoided it for another reason, too. So far as I can determine, no one has come up with any public policy that would substantially lower the demand for meat and, at the same time, has a realistic prospect of being adopted. My analysis of this was influenced some years ago by a speech given in Des Moines by Sir Gordon Conway, then a senior scientific adviser to the British government. He started by acknowledging that lowering meat demand would ease many of the world’s food problems, but then he said, “I just don’t think it’s going to happen.” He pointed out that the world’s governments are likely to let consumer sovereignty prevail on this, as they have already for many decades, and the world’s consumers are not abandoning meat — they are moving in the other direction. It’s easy to see why politicians stay away from this topic. If they proposed policies that might actually reduce demand, such as high taxes on meat, they would probably get run out of town with pitchforks. Assuming the trend lines do not change, rising consumption of meat represents a demand on the food system that is going to have to be met, at least in the coming few decades. One can raise interesting speculations about the distant future; it really is hard to envision a planet of 10 billion people in the year 2100 eating the way that Americans eat today. I don’t really have a clue what happens between now and then; but take a look at Michael Specter’s recent New Yorker piece suggesting that we could wind up growing our meat in test tubes. In the meantime, if anybody has ideas for a public policy that can actually pass and would drastically curtail meat-eating, the floor is open for nominations. Q. I wonder if we, as a nation, have any sort of plan or strategy for how to deal with either the possibility of grain shortages here or the certainty of price spikes to come. Is anyone in Washington even thinking about this, or will we be left to what is euphemistically referred to as “market-based solutions,” i.e. price gouging, profiteering by speculators and growing domestic hunger? Keith, Portland, Ore. A. Keith, the experts I interviewed tend to agree with you that people in Washington need to be thinking not only about the national interest, but also about what constitutes ethical behavior in times of shortage. We are seeing the beginnings of this kind of thinking, but only the beginnings. During the price crisis in 2008, governments imposed export bans, essentially engaging in national hoarding that subsequent reports found had only worsened the situation. The year 2010 was not as bad, despite renewed price spikes, because the World Bank and other agencies leaned on governments to stay calm and not try to cut themselves off from the world market. Nowadays, many people are asking whether the world requires an emergency food stockpile beyond those that already exist in some countries, and how that would be managed and controlled. And how could the United States safeguard its interests — while recognizing that its grain exports are critical to food security for millions of people abroad? Q. India’s wheat production this year has been largest to date. This fact doesn’t fit with your theory. How do you explain this? Jagga, Chicago A. Your argument reminds me of those who say, “A big snowstorm fell in my town last winter, therefore global warming must not be real.” Scientists say that what matters is the long-term trends for the planet as a whole, not what happened in a given location in a given year. Q. What assurances do we have that the results of this work [on drought-resistant plants] will be freely available and remain in the public domain for all? For example it is not very hard to envision the more-than-likely scenario of a Monsanto or Bayer patenting a DNA sequence required to make a plant hardier to drought, applying the patent to both [genetically engineered and hybrid seeds] and demanding outrageous profit from a starving people. RichWa, Banks, Ore. A. There is indeed a possibility that patented innovations, like new drought-resistant seed varieties, will fail to reach many of the poor farmers who need them most because distribution to those farmers is unprofitable for companies. Yet much of the world’s most important crop-breeding research is still done in public institutions like the research centers on rice, wheat and corn that I mentioned in my article, and they make their work freely available to the world’s poor farmers. Also, interesting collaborations are starting to occur between public-spirited institutions like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and private entities like Monsanto, as I discussed in this blog post. As part of a Gates-financed project, Monsanto has donated a genetically engineered drought-tolerant corn for use by farmers in Africa, and many expect that this sort of thing will become more common in the future. A good comparison here might be the drug companies’ initial reluctance to make AIDS drugs available at low prices in poor countries. That eventually changed, as a result of activism by watchdog groups. Q. Tooooooooooooo many people. Family planning is the only answer. Scientella, Northern California A. You and many other readers wrote in to point out that the population explosion receives relatively little discussion. How far could the population growth curve be bent if the global community put more energy and money into family-planning programs and education for girls? Many policy experts believe it could be bent quite a lot. To all those readers who wonder why I didn’t discuss this in the food piece, it was simply beyond the scope of that article, which was meant to focus tightly on climate change and the future food supply. I was not saying that the population issue is unimportant. In fact, my colleague Celia W. Dugger and I collaborated on a front-page article about the population problem in the newspaper a few weeks ago, and we discussed the potential role of family-planning programs in some detail in a subsequent blog post. Other coverage on this issue is planned in The Times in coming weeks and months. A picture caption in an earlier version of this post misspelled the surname of a Green Revolution pioneer. He was Norman Borlaug, not Bourlag.</text></article>

Above, a Malawian with his village’s failed corn crop during a drought. In my article on Sunday about the future of the food system, I briefly mentioned the potential for improved agricultural output in Africa. The situation there is a prime example of a larger problem that concerns the world’s agronomists: the yield gap. That term is used to describe the enormous gulf between the crop yields obtained by the most successful farmers and the least successful. Farmers in the United States, for example, routinely grow five times as much corn per acre as small farmers in Africa. While Africa has the world’s largest concentration of below-potential agriculture, other areas also lag. They include parts of South Asia, such as rice farming areas in northeastern India, and the agricultural regions of many ex-Communist countries. Experts say that closing the gap must be a prime strategy for feeding the world. And there is no technological mystery about how to do it: the strategy of using high-yielding modern crop varieties and nitrogen fertilizer has already been proven, in the Green Revolution, to raise output for farmers. But getting these tools into the hands of poor smallholder farmers requires both political leadership and large public investment. China did it, transitioning from a famine-plagued country to one able to feed itself. To a considerable extent, India and Pakistan did it. But most African governments, chronically short of funds and often plagued by poor leadership, have not done it. The original Green Revolution bypassed Africa for other reasons, too. It worked best in the irrigated agriculture systems that had long prevailed in Asia, and for a handful of major cereal crops, primarily rice, wheat and corn. Irrigation is relatively uncommon in Africa, a continent dependent on rain to water its crops. Moreover, while the big grains have made inroads in Africa, the continent still depends on a slew of smaller crops as dietary staples, like cassava, savory types of bananas, sorghum, millet and so forth. These crops were not the target of much investment in the original Green Revolution. Nowadays, with a renewed focus on global food security, efforts are afoot to bring a new Green Revolution to Africa and other areas plagued by yield gaps. And the question is not simply: Can it be done? The better question is: Can it be done sustainably? For as I outlined in a blog post on Sunday, intensive agriculture causes many environmental problems, particularly in areas where heavy subsidies for nitrogen fertilizer lead to its overuse. Some of the nitrogen volatilizes into a major greenhouse gas, and some of it washes into rivers and helps create dead zones where the rivers meet the ocean. Perhaps even more worrisome, much of the intensive agriculture created by the Green Revolution is not sustainable over the long haul even on its own terms, since it depends on mining non-renewable resources. In parts of India, farmers are withdrawing groundwater at alarming rates; that is true in other areas, too, including parts of China and the United States. Those risks would be bad enough, but as I outlined in my article, a new one looms: climate change. No continent’s agriculture is more at risk from climate change than Africa’s. So the task on the continent is not just agricultural development, but making that agriculture more resilient in the face of rising risks from heat, drought and erratic weather of all kinds. In light of these challenges, many experts have begun to use the term “sustainable intensification” to describe what needs to happen. That essentially means that we need to close the yield gap in as many places as possible, especially in Africa, but in a way that is as sensitive as possible to environmental concerns and assuring the long-run durability of agriculture itself. “We’ve got to increase the amount of food, and we’ve got to do it without damaging the environment,” said Roy Steiner, a deputy director of global development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. “That’s not an easy thing to do.” As I mentioned briefly in my article, numerous entities are trying to tackle these problems. The United States has introduced an ambitious new program called Feed the Future to help 20 of the poorest countries improve their agriculture. Governments of other rich countries have pledged billions in aid, although as I reported, the money has been slow in coming. The World Bank has increased its lending for agricultural projects. The Rockefeller Foundation, the original instigator of the Green Revolution, is still involved in supporting agriculture in poor countries. “We’ve got to increase the amount of food, and we’ve got to do it without damaging the environment. That’s not an easy thing to do.” — Roy Steiner, deputy director, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation But perhaps the single most interesting new entrant on this stage is the Gates Foundation. When I interviewed Bill Gates, he told me that the decision he and his wife made in 2006 to invest in agricultural development was partly a function of the huge gift to their foundation that year by Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor. “Without his gift, what we ended up doing in agriculture would have been very modest,” Mr. Gates said. “The fact that we have a reasonably sized program — he gets a lot of the credit for that.” The Gates Foundation has posted its strategy and a list of its agricultural projects, and Mr. Gates gave speeches in 2009 (here — video and text are on separate tabs) and this year (here, also separate tabs) outlining the foundation’s approach. When he delivered this year’s speech in Washington, Julie Borlaug, the granddaughter of Norman E. Borlaug of Green Revolution fame, stood up in the audience to thank Mr. Gates for his work. Among the major recipients of money from the Gates and Rockefeller foundations is an entity called the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, which is working to develop more advanced tools and techniques. A separate project called Water Efficient Maize for Africa aims to get high-yielding, drought-resistant corn seeds into the hands of African farmers. Associated PressBill and Melinda Gates examine cassava seeds and roots from a demonstration plot in Abuja, Nigeria. Not only is the Gates Foundation paying to scale up flood-tolerant rice in India and nearby countries, it is working to bring variations of that crop to Africa. One of the foundation’s most interesting endeavors has been to help finance a World Food Program strategy of buying local crops within Africa, as a way to connect small farmers better to regional markets. The Gateses and their foundation have been attacked ideologically, for instance here and here, for some of their positions, including a refusal to rule out genetically modified crops as a potential answer to agricultural problems in Africa and Asia. The critics also fear that the Gates Foundation’s work will lead to more corporate control of agriculture in poor countries. Mr. Gates answered some of this criticism in his 2009 speech in Des Moines, declaring that technological approaches and environmental sustainability were not really in conflict. “I believe it’s a false choice, and it’s dangerous for the field,” he said then. Activist groups have also faulted the Gates Foundation because a separate entity that manages its investments has bought some shares of Monsanto, the big American agricultural company. (The Gateses explain the investment philosophy of their money-management arm here.) Anybody who has watched the Gates Foundation over the years knows that it has a long history of trying to work with corporations rather than going to war with them; in fact, the foundation pioneered a whole new approach that leverages foundation money and corporate interests in pursuit of social goals. That tactic has paid dividends for the Gateses in the field of public health, inducing drug companies like GlaxoSmithKline to take on projects to help some of the world’s poorest people. Wendy Carlson for The New York TimesA drought-resistant corn variety at a Monsanto greenhouse. It will be interesting to see what they manage to coax out of the Monsantos and Syngentas of the world. Already, Monsanto has donated rights to a gene-altered corn variety designed to resist drought so that it can be adapted for Africa. Natalie DiNicola, a vice president at Monsanto, told me that her company was one of 20 or so agricultural companies that had committed publicly to working with entities like the Gates Foundation, “all recognizing that we need a new vision for agriculture that’s going to be able to meet food security needs, conserve resources, and serve as a foundation for economic development.” Abroad, Mr. and Mrs. Gates have become as well-known for their charitable work as for Mr. Gates’s role in founding Microsoft. Indeed, one of the most interesting elements of their role as charitable entrepreneurs is that the Gateses have become, in effect, roving ambassadors for the United States. My colleague Hari Kumar interviewed a farmer in India, Anand Kumar Singh, who had been amazed by the resilience of the flood-tolerant rice financed by the Gates Foundation. Mr. Singh was among a group of farmers in Bihar state who met with Bill and Melinda Gates when they visited India a few months ago. “The world’s richest man and his wife sat on the ground with the poor farmers of Bihar and inquired about our agriculture and our lives,” Mr. Singh told Mr. Kumar. “I cannot forget that experience throughout my life.” The Gates Foundation has been working in agriculture for only five years, and the renewed international focus by the world’s governments on agricultural development is even shorter than that, dating essentially to the 2008 food crisis. Many agronomists I spoke with for my article are hopeful that these efforts will, in coming years, produce what some of them call a “greener revolution” in the agriculture of poor countries. “There are more pieces of the puzzle in place now,” said Robert Paarlberg, an agricultural expert at Wellesley College, “than at any time in previous decades.”</text></article>

On a warming planet, humanity faces a great challenge in feeding itself at reasonable cost in the coming century, as I explain in Sunday’s paper. An issue I raise only in passing in the article is that agriculture itself is one of the earth’s greatest environmental threats. To put a finer point on it, farming and livestock grazing are not just potential victims of climate change — they are major causes of it. Humans are cultivating almost 40 percent of the land surface of the earth, and nearly a third of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet comes from agriculture and forestry. Those emissions are linked not only to the factors that many people tend to think about, like the fossil fuels burned in transporting food; that, in fact, is only a minor source of emissions. Nitrogen fertilizer, though essential to producing food for seven billion people, is one large source of emissions, and not only because it requires natural gas to produce. After it is spread on farmers’ fields, a portion of it turns into a potent greenhouse gas that escapes into the atmosphere. (As many people know, some nitrogen also washes into rivers and streams, ultimately making its way to the ocean, where it contributes to dead zones at the mouths of many of our great rivers, including the Mississippi.) The biggest of all the ways that agriculture contributes to climate change, though, is the chopping down of forests to make way for farms and cattle grazing. The world’s forests are enormous stores of carbon dioxide, and when they are cleared, the vegetation that is burned or allowed to decay oxidizes into carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas. In recent years, changes in land use have accounted for some 25 percent of the carbon dioxide being emitted on the planet, and the bulk of those changes are driven by agriculture. As my colleague Elisabeth Rosenthal has reported here and here, efforts are under way to slow deforestation. But scientists say that alone will not be enough. Somehow, even as humanity increases the production of food over the coming decades, it must reduce the environmental footprint of agriculture. The alternative is continued ecological degradation and a worsening of climate change, which in turn would make food production harder. When you view the problem in that light, the challenge of feeding ourselves becomes that much larger. I visited the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico in February, near the end of the wheat-growing season. This institution was the original starting point for the Green Revolution, which raised agricultural output across much of the planet. While it saved humanity from mass starvation, the Green Revolution has often been attacked on the left for having spread environmentally unsustainable practices to developing countries. Most agronomists now acknowledge that it did, in fact, cause many environmental problems, although they contend that these have sometimes been exaggerated, and were in any case necessary at the time to prevent famine. Perhaps it will come as a surprise to many to learn that the sustainability of agriculture has become a major focus at the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement. The director general, Thomas A. Lumpkin, told me that the real task at hand was not just to increase food output, but to make agriculture so productive that humanity could begin to restore some of what it has destroyed. “We need to be really bold here,” he said in an interview. “It’s not just that agriculture needs to keep food prices reasonable. We need to find a way to make a dramatic contribution to the greenhouse-gas problem. We need to make farming so productive that we can get off half the agricultural land out there, so that we can return it to nature.” That is a tall order indeed, and how it might be done is not clear. But the center in Mexico, like many other institutes around the world, is exploring various strategies. One approach, known as conservation agriculture, has begun to gain some traction. It involves minimal tillage of the soil, leaving straw and stubble in place as a soil cover, and various other techniques that conserve water and nutrients and allow carbon to build up in the soil. In some ways this approach resembles organic farming of the sort that has caught on in the West. But it differs in that farmers are still allowed to use inorganic fertilizers and to make judicious use of herbicides. “I’m not for or against organic agriculture,” Bram Govaerts, one of the researchers in Mexico who is studying this method, told me when I visited. “I am for rational agriculture.” Conservation agriculture has not been proven to work in all farming scenarios, and even when it does work, yields sometimes fall during the initial changeover period. It can require new machinery, a barrier for many farmers. But in many places, after a transition of several years, the method has been shown to increase organic matter in the soil, raise yields, lower costs, increase resilience to drought and other stresses, and reduce the use of nitrogen and water. Technology adapted to the needs of small farmers may be able to help. When I was in Mexico, I met Jared Crain, a student at Oklahoma State University. He was working to improve a hand-held sensor that uses the color of plants to tell when they need nitrogen fertilizer. Such machines are available in the West for thousands of dollars, but the one Mr. Crain was working on might sell for $200 or so, making it accessible to villages or to agricultural extension agents in developing countries. The idea is to cut the excessive use of fertilizer that is common in many of the areas touched by the Green Revolution. As conservation agriculture becomes more advanced, improved crop varieties are likely to be an important part of the picture. Gary Toenniessen is director of agricultural programs at the Rockefeller Foundation, of New York, which provided the original funding for the work that led to the Green Revolution. “The Green Revolution varieties were ecological weaklings,” he told me in an interview. “They had shallow roots, short stems and couldn’t compete with the weeds. They needed tender loving care from the farmer. Given tender loving care, they put all their energy into grain production.” The task now for plant breeders is to preserve and enhance the yield gains of the Green Revolution, while creating varieties with deeper root systems that can survive on less water and fertilizer and are also strong enough to germinate through a dense cover of decaying vegetative material from the previous season. Conventional breeding can accomplish some of that. But many experts say the biggest gains will eventually come from the genetic engineering of crop varieties. For example, Monsanto is on the verge of winning approval for a transgenic corn plant designed to protect crops from moderate drought; a project is under way to make that trait available to African farmers. Such varieties could presumably be employed in irrigated agriculture as a way to cut down on water use; and in the future, transgenic varieties might allow lower use of nitrogen fertilizer, directly tackling one of the major sources of greenhouse gases from agriculture. As such approaches become more widespread, I am guessing that critics of crop biotechnology will face a choice: Do they embrace technologies that violate their ideological precepts but offer potentially big environmental gains, or do they continue to oppose them? In fact, among many of the experts I interviewed, I detected a great weariness with the ideological battles that have surrounded the food system in recent years. Like it or not, they said, the reality is that the agricultural system is only going to get more intensive as the human population rises and diets grow richer. “We’re not going to be abandoning conventional agriculture,” said Jonathan A. Foley, a University of Minnesota scientist. “So why don’t we fix it?”</text></article>

Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but fake impartiality is obnoxious. There were two pieces in Forbes about my column. The more reasonable one categorized me as a “foodie elite” – presumably not because I sometimes eat well but because I refuse to acknowledge that genetically engineered foods will save the world, which they will not (you might read this terrific piece by Christopher Cook in The Christian Science Monitor, about Monsanto’s business and its threat to food safety, and then remember that not all new developments are progressive) and a “luddite” (which is ridiculous, unless believing that not every bit of technology is world-saving makes you a luddite). The other was written by a member of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an organization whose slogan appears to be “Free Markets and Limited Government,” and which is a member of the Cooler Heads Coalition, whose “Global Warming 101″  page reads: “Global warming may or may not be a problem. Man may or may not be driving it.” This plus the fact that the so-called think tank has received funding from ExxonMobil (or is it MobilExxon?) shows you how seriously that should be taken. Meanwhile, as I wrote last week, although there has been almost no evidence that GE food is a direct public health problem, it’s a field in which Monsanto and others are having their way. I do believe we need to push our regulatory agencies to give approval to these new creations more grudgingly. But without further ado, let’s go to the poll results. I invited you to share your feelings and thoughts, both here and on Facebook and Twitter, about genetically modified foods. To all of you who answered or commented in one place or another, thank you. You’ll have to allow me a small margin of error for my counting, but unless I was off by hundreds of votes (and I wasn’t) it seems that a large majority of you are in some way leery of GM foods or crops, or at least want them to be labeled. If you have a few minutes to spare, scroll through some of the comments; there are some great responses (from all sides), and certainly a discussion worth having (and continuing) as we see how the latest GMO decisions play out. In short, in last week’s blog poll, about 83 percent of you are bothered by the presence of GMOs in food; 89 percent want to see labeling of such foods, and about 85% percent would like to see stricter regulations; nearly three-fourths would buy less salmon if it were genetically engineered (but this number is skewed by the large number of you who don’t buy farm-raised salmon in the first place – I’m in that category – or who eat no salmon at all). The Facebook and Twitter polls were similar: between 82 and 85 percent of those responding would choose not to buy foods with GMOs if they were so labeled. The details: NYT Blog: 1.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/business/28alfalfa.html?ref=monsantocompany">U.S. Approves Planting of Genetically Modified Alfalfa<date>Published: January 27, 2011</date><text>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced on Thursday that he would authorize the unrestricted commercial cultivation of genetically modified alfalfa, setting aside a controversial compromise that had generated stiff opposition.In making the decision, Mr. Vilsack pulled back from a novel proposal that would have restricted the growing of genetically engineered alfalfa to protect organic farmers from so-called biotech contamination. That proposal drew criticism at a recent Congressional hearing and in public forums where Mr. Vilsack outlined the option. Mr. Vilsack said Thursday that his department would take other measures, like conducting research and promoting dialogue, to make sure that pure, nonengineered alfalfa seed would remain available. “We want to expand and preserve choice for farmers,” he told reporters. “We think the decision reached today is a reflection of our commitment to choice and trust.” Mr. Vilsack in recent months has been calling for coexistence among growers of genetically engineered crops, organic farmers and nonorganic farmers growing crops that have not been genetically altered. Organic farmers can lose sales if genetic engineering is detected in their crops, which occurs through cross-pollination from a nearby field or through intermingling of seeds. And exports of nonorganic but nonengineered crops to certain countries can be jeopardized if genetically engineered material is detected in significant amounts. The genetically modified crop — developed by Monsanto and Forage Genetics, an alfalfa seed company that is owned by the Land O’Lakes farming and dairy cooperative — contains a gene that makes the plant resistant to the herbicide Roundup. That allows farmers to spray the chemical to kill weeds without hurting the crop. Alfalfa is grown mostly to make hay fed to dairy cows and horses. More than 20 million acres are grown in the United States; it is the nation’s fourth-largest crop by acreage, behind corn, soybeans and wheat, with a value of about $8 billion. About 1 percent of alfalfa is organic. In deciding whether to approve the genetically engineered alfalfa, the Agriculture Department was considering restricting areas where the crop could be planted. That, Mr. Vilsack argued, would help prevent litigation, like the lawsuits that have already delayed the approval of genetically altered alfalfa and sugar beets. “The rapid adoption of G.E. crops has clashed with the rapid expansion of demand for organic and other non-G.E. products,” Mr. Vilsack wrote in a letter issued by his department in December. “This clash led to litigation and uncertainty. Such litigation will potentially lead to the courts’ deciding who gets to farm their way and who will be prevented from doing so.” But the proposal ran into considerable opposition in Congress and from some farm groups and biotechnology companies. They argued that since the department’s environmental impact statement had concluded that growing the alfalfa would be safe, the government was obligated to allow it to be grown without restrictions. Introducing restrictions based on economic consequences of pollen drift “politicizes the regulatory process and goes beyond your statutory authority,” Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, who is the new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, wrote to Mr. Vilsack on Jan. 19, before holding a hearing on the proposals the next day. The letter was also written by Republican Senators Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Pat Roberts of Kansas. At the news conference on Thursday, Mr. Vilsack at one point said that the department did have the authority to restrict planting. But at another point, he said of the decision to allow unrestricted planting: “We are working within the statutory and regulatory system we have available to us.” Organic farmers and food companies said they were not pleased with the decision on Thursday. “It was disappointing, but as you know, there is a tremendous amount of pressure here,” said George Siemon, chief executive of Organic Valley, the nation’s largest organic dairy cooperative. He said federal oversight was needed to keep organic crops free of genetically engineered material. Critics of planting restrictions said they were concerned that the approach used in alfalfa would eventually be extended to other crops, causing restrictions on the growing of corn, soybeans and cotton, the vast majority of which are already genetically engineered. “It’s like a Pandora’s box,” said Keith Menchey, manager of science and environmental issues for the National Cotton Council of America. Critics also said that restricting the growing of alfalfa would undermine Washington’s efforts to persuade other countries to accept genetically modified crops. The Agriculture Department first approved the commercial planting of the genetically engineered alfalfa in 2005. But some environmental groups and alfalfa seed producers sued. In 2007, a federal judge rescinded the approval, saying the department had not adequately assessed the environmental impacts of the biotech crop, including the possible effect on organic and conventional farmers. The judge ordered the department to do a full environmental impact statement and banned further planting of the engineered seeds. The Supreme Court in 2010 overturned the ban on planting, but did not reinstate the approval of the crop, so no new seeds could be planted. The final environmental impact statement, 2,300 pages long, was released last month. It said that the department would decide between two options: allowing unrestricted commercial growing or partly restricted growing. The partial restriction would have prohibited growing the biotech alfalfa on about 20 percent of current alfalfa acreage nationwide, and about 50 percent in Western states, where most alfalfa seed is produced, according to Forage Genetics. Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, the advocacy group that organized the lawsuit against the Agriculture Department, said his group would soon ask the judge in the case to rule that the environmental impact statement was still inadequate. “It’s clear that Vilsack caved to pressure from the biotech industry and Monsanto,” he said. “We’ll be back in court seeking to vacate this approval, as we have done in the past.”Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced on Thursday that he would authorize the unrestricted commercial cultivation of genetically modified alfalfa, setting aside a controversial compromise that had generated stiff opposition.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07monsanto.html?ref=monsantocompany">Monsanto Income Drops by Nearly Half<date>Published: October 6, 2010</date><text>Executives of Monsanto told skittish investors on Wednesday that earnings per share would grow 13 to 17 percent in the next fiscal year and that the company was on its way to fixing problems in its seed business that have undermined the confidence of Wall Street.The remarks, in line with some previous assurances by company executives, were made as Monsanto reported that net income for the year that ended Aug. 31 had dropped by nearly half from a year earlier. “I believe we’ve taken steps to allow our company to return to growth,” Hugh Grant, the chief executive, told analysts and investors Wednesday on a conference call. He said the seed business was going to offer “more products at more price points” to help regain the trust of farmers who have been put off by high seed prices and lower-than-expected yields for some products, particularly Monsanto’s new SmartStax corn. Company shares, which have lost about 40 percent of their value this year, rose 5 percent in early trading Wednesday but then settled back down. The shares closed at $48.65, up 13 cents. Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company and the leading developer of genetically engineered crops, said that net income for the year plunged to $1.1 billion from $2.1 billion a year earlier. In the fourth quarter, Monsanto lost $143 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of $233 million, or 43 cents, in the period a year ago. The decline was largely because sales and profit from its Roundup weed killer business were eviscerated by low-priced generics from China. Sales for the year fell 10 percent, to $10.5 billion from $11.7 billion. For the quarter, sales were $1.95 billion, up from $1.88 billion in the period a year ago. Earnings were $2.01 a share for the year compared with $3.80 a year ago. Excluding restructuring charges and discontinued operations, earnings were $2.41 a share, at the low end of the range the company had expected, though the forecast had been lowered earlier in the year. The company said it expected earnings to rise to $2.72 to $2.82 a share in fiscal year 2011. For its fourth quarter, the company reported a loss, after adjustments, of 9 cents a share, 3 cents worse than the consensus analyst estimate. Monsanto typically loses money in the fourth quarter because farmers do not buy many seeds in the summer. While the decrease in earnings came largely from the Roundup chemical business, the focus of both analysts and company executives was on seeds and genetically engineered traits, which constitute most of the company’s business now and are expected to be the source of growth. The biggest concern is that early data from this year’s harvest have shown the company’s newest product, SmartStax corn, with eight inserted genes, was not providing higher yields than older varieties with three genes. Monsanto executives said that since most corn had not been harvested yet, it was too early to judge. Some yield problems, it said, were the result of one particular corn variety that did not perform well in the high nighttime temperatures in parts of the Corn Belt this year. Nevertheless, the company has already cut prices sharply for SmartStax for next year. “Going into 2011 we’ve taken a decidedly practical approach,” Mr. Grant said. American farmers planted three million acres of SmartStax corn in 2010, below Monsanto’s goal of four million. Executives declined to provide a goal for 2011 for SmartStax alone. The goal is the midteen million acres for SmartStax and two other product families combined.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/05monsanto.html?ref=monsantocompany">Fortunes Turn for Monsanto After Problems With Seeds<date>Published: October 4, 2010</date><text>As recently as late December, Monsanto was named “company of the year” by Forbes magazine. Last week, the company earned a different accolade from Jim Cramer, the television stock market commentator. “This may be the worst stock of 2010,” he proclaimed.Monsanto, the giant of agricultural biotechnology, has been buffeted by setbacks this year that have prompted analysts to question whether its winning streak of creating ever more expensive genetically engineered crops is coming to an end. The company’s stock, which rose steadily over several years to peak at around $140 a share in mid-2008, closed Monday at $47.77, having fallen about 42 percent since the beginning of the year. Its earnings for the fiscal year that ended in August, which will be announced Wednesday, are expected to be well below projections made at the beginning of the year, and the company has abandoned its profit goal for 2012 as well. The latest blow came last week, when early returns from this year’s harvest showed that Monsanto’s newest product, SmartStax corn, which contains eight inserted genes, was providing yields no higher than the company’s less expensive corn, which contains only three foreign genes. Monsanto has already been forced to sharply cut prices on SmartStax and on its newest soybean seeds, called Roundup Ready 2 Yield, as sales fell below projections. But there is more. Sales of Monsanto’s Roundup, the widely used herbicide, has collapsed this year under an onslaught of low-priced generics made in China. Weeds are growing resistant to Roundup, dimming the future of the entire Roundup Ready crop franchise. And the Justice Department is investigating Monsanto for possible antitrust violations. Until now, Monsanto’s main challenge has come from opponents of genetically modified crops, who have slowed their adoption in Europe and some other regions. Now, however, the skeptics also include farmers and investors who were once in Monsanto’s camp. “My personal view is that they overplayed their hand,” William R. Young, managing director of ChemSpeak, a consultant to investors in the chemical industry, said of Monsanto. “They are going to have to demonstrate to the farmer the advantage of their products.” Brett D. Begemann, Monsanto’s executive vice president for seeds and traits, said the setbacks were not reflective of systemic management problems and that the company was moving to deal with them. “Farmers clearly gave us some feedback that we have made adjustments from,” he said in an interview Monday. Mr. Begemann said that Monsanto used to introduce new seeds at a price that gave farmers two-thirds and Monsanto one-third of the extra profits that would come from higher yields or lower pest-control costs. But with SmartStax corn and Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, the company’s pricing aimed for a 50-50 split. That backfired as American farmers grew only six million acres of Roundup Ready 2 soybeans this year, below the company’s goal of eight million to 10 million acres, and only three million acres of SmartStax corn, below the goal of four million. So now Monsanto is moving back to the older arrangement. SmartStax seed for planting next year will be priced about $8 an acre more than other seeds, down from about a $24 premium for this year’s seeds, Mr. Begemann said. The company will also offer credits for free seed to farmers who planted SmartStax this year and were disappointed. Monsanto has also moved to offer farmers more varieties with fewer inserted genes. Some farmers have said they often have to buy traits they do not need — such as protection from the corn rootworm in regions where that pest is not a problem — to get the best varieties. This issue has surfaced in the antitrust investigation. Monsanto’s arch rival, DuPont’s Pioneer Hi-Bred, has also capitalized on the lack of options under a campaign called “right product, right acre.” “If they don’t have a need for rootworm then we won’t have that trait in that product,” Paul E. Schickler, the president of Pioneer, said in an interview. After years of rapidly losing market share in corn seeds to Monsanto, Pioneer says it has gained back four percentage points in the last two years, to 34 percent. Monsanto puts its market share at 36 percent in 2009 and says it has remained flat this year. In soybeans, Pioneer puts its share at 31 percent, up seven percentage points over the last two years; Monsanto puts its share at 28 percent last year and said it had dropped some this year. Monsanto had a similar problem with lower-than-expected yields on Roundup Ready 2 soybeans last year, when the crop was first planted commercially, forcing it to slash its premium. But this year, the yield appears to be meeting expectations, said OTR Global, a research firm that surveys farmers and seed dealers. That could bode well for SmartStax next year. One reason is that the Roundup Ready 2 gene is now offered in more varieties, making it better suited to more growing conditions. The yield of a crop is mainly determined by the seed’s intrinsic properties, not the inserted genes. An insect protection gene will not make a poor variety a high yielder any more than spiffy shoes will turn a slow runner into Usain Bolt. In the first year of a new product, few varieties contain the new gene. Still, Monsanto is bound at some point to face diminishing returns from its strategy of putting more and more insect-resistant and herbicide-resistant genes into the same crop, at ever increasing prices. Growth might have to eventually come from new traits, such as a drought-tolerant corn the company hopes to introduce in 2012. “Technologically, they are still the market leader,” said Laurence Alexander, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company. “The main issue going forward is do they get paid for the technology they deliver. The jury is still out on that one. It’s going to take a year or two of data to reassure people.”</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/world/europe/24modify.html?ref=monsantocompany">In Italy, a Battle Over Genetically Modified Corn<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>VIVARO, Italy — Giorgio Fidenato declared war on the Italian government and environmental groups in April with a news conference and a YouTube video, which showed him poking six genetically modified corn seeds into Italian soil.In fact, said Mr. Fidenato, 49, an agronomist, he planted two fields of genetically modified corn. But since “corn looks like corn,” as he put it, it took his opponents weeks to find his crop. The seeds, known as MON810, are modified so that the corn produces a chemical that kills the larvae of the corn borer, a devastating pest. Yet while European Union rules allow this particular seed to be planted, Italy requires farmers to get special permission for any genetically modified, or G.M., crop — and the Agriculture Ministry never said yes. “We had no choice but to engage in civil disobedience — these seeds are legal in Europe,” said Mr. Fidenato, who has repeatedly applied for permission, adding that he drew more inspiration from Ron Paul than Gandhi. The World Trade Organization says that general bans on genetically modified crops constitute an unfair trade barrier, because there is no scientific basis for exclusion. But four years after a W.T.O. panel ruled that European Union policies constituted an illegal “de facto moratorium” on the planting of genetically modified seeds, some farmers, like Mr. Fidenato, and seed producers like Monsanto complain that Europe still has not really opened its doors. It is true that a small but growing number of European countries, including Spain, Portugal and Germany, now allow some cultivation of genetically modified crops. But only two genetically modified seeds (MON810 and the Amflora potato seed) out of dozens on the global market have made it through the European Commission’s laborious approval process, a prerequisite for use. What is more, some areas of Europe have declared themselves “G.M.O.-free zones,” or free of genetically modified organisms. France, Austria and Germany specifically ban MON810, saying they believe that it could harm local crops. In Italy, a Kafkaesque approval process in which the Agriculture Ministry has never established the requirements for success, makes genetically modified crops a nonstarter. Such foot-dragging reflects passionate public opposition to the crops in many parts of Europe, even as more than three-quarters of corn, soybeans and sugar beets in the United States are genetically modified. Though the science is at best inconclusive, there is a widespread conviction in Italy that genetically altered foods and crops pose dangers to human health and ecosystems. After Mr. Fidenato’s provocation, investigators did genetic testing to identify the locations of the offending stalks in the sea of cornfields that surround this tiny town. Officials seized two suspect fields — about 12 acres — and declared the plantings illegal. Greenpeace activists surreptitiously snipped off the stalks’ tassels in the hope of preventing pollen from being disseminated. On Aug. 9, 100 machete-wielding environmental activists from an antiglobalization group called Ya Basta descended on Vivaro and trampled the field before local police officers could intervene. They left behind placards with a skull and crossbones reading: “Danger — Contaminated — G.M.O.” Giancarlo Galan, who became agriculture minister in April, called the protesters “vandals,” although he did not say he would allow genetically modified crops. But Luca Zaia, the previous agriculture minister and president of the nearby Veneto region, applauded the rampage, saying: “There is a need to show multinationals that they can’t introduce Frankenstein crops into our country without authorization.” Over the past decade, genetically modified crops have been a major source of trade friction between Europe and the United States. Both the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European Food Safety Agency say that there is no scientific evidence that eating MON810 corn is dangerous. But there is greater disagreement on how genetically modified plants affect ecosystems and whether traditional and genetically modified crops can be kept apart to avoid what organic farmers call “contamination” of traditional crops by modified plants or genes. Seed or pollen can travel with the wind or on farm equipment or truck tires, sometimes for hundreds of miles. This issue is particularly sensitive in Italy, whose farmers rely heavily on specialized organic and heritage crops, like hundreds of varieties of tomatoes. Crops contaminated with genetically modified material can lose its organic designation. Farmers worry that plants with tailor-made survival genes will over time displace tastier traditional varieties. Greenpeace has called the European Union’s judgment to accept MON810 as safe “fundamentally flawed,” noting, for example, that the chemical that kills corn borer larvae could also harm butterflies that land on the plants. Even in the United States, reservations linger. This month, a federal judge in San Francisco revoked permission for further planting of genetically modified sugar beets, saying that the Agriculture Department had not adequately assessed the environmental consequences; 95 percent of the sugar beets in the United States are genetically modified. Faced with a W.T.O. judgment on the one hand and a reluctant public on the other, the European Commission has tried in recent years to walk a middle ground. It requires countries to establish procedures for separating traditional and modified crops, like maintaining certain distances between fields. Recent proposals give regions increasing latitude to deny entry to such plants if they provide scientific proof that the seeds could harm the environment, however. But groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation say that studies used to justify excluding genetically modified crops do not pass muster. Here in Vivaro, farmers are divided about the issue, said Luca Tornatore, Ya Basta spokesman and an astrophysicist from Trieste, Italy, noting that his group’s “blitz” did not allow much time for talking with local people. Residents may not know much about the science of genetically modified crops, but they are quite familiar with the corn borer larvae; they tunnel into ears of corn, allowing funguses to fill the holes in their wake. Some of the funguses produce mycotoxins that can end up in places like the milk of corn-fed cows and have been associated with serious health problems, including cancers. Some farmers spray insecticides on the crops to prevent the boring, but it must be applied at just the right moment and leaves chemical residues as well as an odor in the air. Others simply sell the corn in bulk, ignoring the problem, said Mr. Fidenato, displaying an ear from a field that was alive with worms and covered with patches of white fuzz. If the Italian government does not relent on the genetically modified seeds, he warned, he commands an army of farmers across Italy who are prepared to plant MON810 to force its hand. But it is not clear that the battle of Vivaro will have a quick victor. Jail time or at least fines are expected for Mr. Fidenato (illegal planting) and Mr. Tornatore (trespassing and destroying private property).</text></article>

Fines Monsanto $2.5 Million<date>Published: July 9, 2010</date><text>ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The Monsanto Company agreed to pay the Environmental Protection Agency a $2.5 million penalty for selling mislabeled bags of genetically engineered seed. The E.P.A. said it was the largest fine ever imposed under a law that regulates pesticides and fungicides. From 2002 to 2007, Monsanto improperly sold its Bollgard and Bollgard II cotton seeds in 10 Texas counties where the seeds were banned, according to the E.P.A. The cotton seeds are regulated as pesticides because they kill insects, and the seeds were banned in parts of Texas to avoid growing pest resistance to them. The ban has since been lifted. Monsanto informed the E.P.A. it was selling seeds in the 10 Texas counties, even though the company was supposed to label the seeds as banned in those areas, the E.P.A. said. Monsanto later changed its cotton seed labels to reflect the ban.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/business/energy-environment/08biotech.html?ref=monsantocompany">Europe’s New Approach to Biotech Food<date>Published: July 7, 2010</date><text>BRUSSELS — After decades of pushing nations to surrender more power to Brussels, the European Union is about to throw in the towel on one highly contentious issue: genetically modified foods.On Tuesday, the European Commission will formally propose giving back to national and local governments the freedom to decide whether to grow crops that many Europeans still call Frankenfoods. The new policy is aimed at overcoming a stalemate that has severely curtailed the market for biotech seeds in Europe for years. Only two crops, produced by Monsanto and B.A.S.F., are sold for cultivation here. The new flexibility is supposed to open up markets in countries like the Netherlands, where governments are broadly favorable toward growing and trading biotech products, while countries like Austria, where the products are unpopular, can maintain a ban. But far from celebrating, the growing global industry, as well as some farmers themselves, is extremely wary of the new approach. “So many different authorities suddenly doing so many different things risks sending a message to successful growers in Africa and Asia that authorities are unsure how to deal with biotech,” said Nathalie Moll, the secretary general of EuropaBio, an industry group. She said it also remained to be seen whether the proposals would conform with World Trade Organization rules. The United States and the Union are still trying to resolve a dispute over genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.’s, and related issues after the W.T.O. ruled, in 2006, against Europe’s de facto ban. Washington could still retaliate in that case. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative declined to comment on the new approach but said it would be on the agenda at a meeting with E.U. officials this month. Despite “some progress” in recent months, the United States “still has a number of concerns,” said Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative. They include “a substantial backlog of pending biotech applications, and bans adopted by individual E.U. member states on biotech products approved at the E.U. level.” The reality remains that the European Union still produces few genetically modified crops. The United States, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada are the top five producers in terms of land under cultivation. The European Union, with 27 member nations, is the 14th largest, just after Burkina Faso. A key factor behind the proposed change in Europe is a growing frustration in Brussels with the current system, under which meetings between government officials and ministers routinely end in deadlock. That forces unelected officials at the European Commission to make the final decision on authorizing biotech products — and to take the heat. The commission has found itself repeatedly pressured on one side by the United States and the W.T.O. to follow the recommendations of its own scientific authorities and enforce the use of approved products and on the other by countries like Austria and environmental groups that believe the E.U. authorities are too eager to promote newfangled technologies. Under the new proposals, the commission would continue to make the approvals itself but leave it to members and local and regional authorities to decide what they want to grow at home. But whether the new rules will win the necessary approval from E.U. governments and the European Parliament still is unclear. In an unlikely alliance, the Austrian and Dutch governments first made the proposal back in 2008. The Dutch were eager to ease tensions over biotech crops with the United States and other trading partners, and to ensure continuing imports of animal feeds that contain biotech products. Animal farming is a big part of the economy in the Netherlands, which, in turn, is a major exporter of meat and dairy products. Dutch researchers also are involved in developing biotech products. The Austrians supported the changes as a way to keep its national ban on growing any such crops without facing regular challenges from the E.U. authorities. Other countries, though, have expressed concern about setting a precedent that could undermine European integration. The crisis this year over how to supervise the finances of the 16 nations that use the euro already has highlighted the limits to European cooperation. “If the agricultural policy is common, why wouldn’t the policy of cultivation of G.M.O.’s be?” asked Elena Espinosa, the Spanish environment minister. Spain grew 80 percent of the biotech corn, designed to resist a pest called the corn borer, produced in Europe last year. In addition, Belgium, which has just taken over the rotating E.U. presidency, is concerned that a ban by a single country could put the entire bloc in danger of facing retaliatory trade sanctions. Even farmers that favor biotech crops are concerned that the commission is offloading a problem on them — and that the issue could become even more politicized than it is now. “The Welsh and the Scots are vehemently opposed to genetically modified crops,” said Philip Lodge, who would like to farm biotech sugar beets in Yorkshire, in northern England. “With these conflicts of interest so close to home, I just don’t see how I’ll be able to grow G.M. in practice.” Other farmers warned that the Union risked stirring up new confrontations with activists, who in the past have destroyed crops planted in trial fields. “The prospect terrorizes me,” said Jerome Hue, who farms in Carcans, France. “If every locality can ban G.M.O.’s, I don’t see how we will be allowed to grow the crops anywhere in France anymore.” Mr. Hue grew corn produced by Monsanto before the French government imposed a national ban in 2008. France has said it would consider lifting that ban once the European authorities have assessed new evidence about the effects of G.M. crops on the environment. Mr. Hue said anti-biotech activists could erect beehives at the edges of some farmers’ fields to put pressure on the authorities to impose new bans if the honey picked up traces of the modified genes. But commission officials and some other member states like the Netherlands say the new policy points the way to managing an increasingly unwieldy group of 27 countries. Last week, in the latest example of the persistent differences, countries failed for a third time to break a deadlock over whether to allow imports of six varieties of bioengineered corn for food and feed made by Monsanto, Dow AgroSciences, Pioneer and Syngenta. That leaves the decision up to the E.U. health commissioner, John Dalli, who is expected to approve the products in coming months. He caused a furor among environmentalists in March when he approved cultivation of a biotech potato by B.A.S.F. — the first such approval in more than a decade in Europe. In the European Parliament, among those reviewing the proposed new rules will be José Bové, a French sheep farmer who captured worldwide attention a decade ago for ransacking a McDonald’s restaurant to protest the influence of multinational corporations. Since then he has served time in a French prison for damaging biotech crops. He is now a deputy chairman of the agriculture committee at the European Parliament, where he was elected as a member of the Green party.</text></article>

But in practice the decision is not likely to measurably speed up the resumption of planting of the genetically engineered alfalfa. A federal district judge in San Francisco had ruled in 2007 that the Agriculture Department had approved the genetically engineered alfalfa for commercial planting without adequately considering the possible environment impact, as required by federal law. The judge vacated approval, known as deregulation of the crop, and also imposed a nationwide ban on planting those seeds. The ban was later upheld on appeal. But the Supreme Court, in a 7-to-1 decision, said the lower court judge had gone too far, ruling that the national ban prevented the Agriculture Department from considering a partial approval. That avenue, the court said, would have allowed some of the alfalfa to be grown under certain conditions; for example, isolating it from conventional alfalfa. “The district court barred the agency from pursuing any deregulation — no matter how limited the geographic area in which planting of RRA would be allowed,” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote in the opinion, referring to Roundup Ready alfalfa. Justice John Paul Stevens was the lone dissenter. Justice Stephen G. Breyer did not take part because his brother, District Judge Charles Breyer, had issued the original decision. Because the Supreme Court left in place the lower court’s rejection of approving the crop, the Agriculture Department must either fully or partly approve it before growing can resume. “I think the practical impact is nil,” said George A. Kimbrell of the Center for Food Safety, a Washington advocacy group that was part of a coalition of environmental groups and organic and conventional alfalfa farmers who had challenged the crop’s approval. The Agriculture Department said Monday that it was on track to complete its environmental impact statement and approve the crop in time for next spring’s planting. Speeding up planting beyond that could only occur if the agency pursues a partial approval while finishing its environmental assessment. But getting partial approval in time for this fall’s planting season — beginning in two months — might be difficult. Still, David F. Snively, Monsanto’s general counsel, called the decision a significant victory. “Monsanto and farmers in the United States are thrilled with this decision, which is far-reaching in its look at the regulatory framework that should govern biotech crops,” Mr. Snively told reporters in a conference call. The Supreme Court’s ruling could affect a similar case, also brought by the Center for Food Safety, involving Roundup Ready sugar beets. In that case, a different federal judge in San Francisco ruled last September that the Agriculture Department had failed to adequately assess the environmental impact. Planting has continued, however, because the judge, Jeffrey S. White, has not yet ruled on a remedy. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for July 9. The Supreme Court’s decision makes it highly unlikely that he will issue a blanket ban on the growing of the genetically engineered beets. The decision could also sway environmental law in general. Organizations like the National Association of Home Builders and the American Petroleum Institute had filed friend-of-the-court briefs supporting Monsanto, while environmental groups as well as the states of California, Oregon and Massachusetts had weighed in on the side of the Center for Food Safety. Mr. Snively of Monsanto said the decision made it clear that courts must meet the same strict test in granting injunctions in environmental cases as in other cases. But Nathaniel S. W. Lawrence, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the decision also contained wording that would make it easier in some instances for lawsuits to be filed in cases of possible environmental dangers. Roundup Ready alfalfa and sugar beets were the newest additions to Monsanto’s extremely successful lines of Roundup Ready soybeans, corns and cotton. The crops contain a bacterial gene that allows them to withstand spraying with Roundup or its generic equivalents, known as glyphosate. That allows farmers to spray their fields to kill weeds while leaving the crop intact, making weed control easy. The environmental groups and others had said that the foreign gene might spread to organic or conventional nongenetically engineered crops, hurting sales of organic farmers or exports to countries like Japan that did not want genetically engineered varieties. Court Upholds Verdict The Supreme Court rejected Pfizer’s appeal of a verdict for an Arkansas woman, Donna Scroggin, who blamed the company’s menopause drugs for her breast cancer, leaving intact a $2.7 million award that may grow with punitive damages. The justices let stand on Monday a lower court decision upholding that award, which was the first federal verdict against Pfizer’s Wyeth unit over its Prempro hormone-replacement treatment. The appeal by Wyeth and Pfizer’s Upjohn unit sought to leverage a different part of the appeals court ruling ordering a new trial on punitive damages, which a jury had set at $27 million. Pfizer argued that the new trial should cover all aspects of the case, including the jury’s finding that the drugs had helped cause Ms. Scroggin’s cancer.</text></article>

It also highlighted that weed resistance to herbicides deserves attention. We agree. We disagree, however, with your statement that the National Research Council report concluded that “farmers are simply planting too many acres of Roundup Ready crops.” The report stated that farmers should incorporate diverse weed management practices, a message promoted by Monsanto and public-sector scientists. This is good advice regardless of the herbicides used. Weed resistance is not unique to glyphosate or to herbicide-tolerant crops. Farmers continue to choose the Roundup Ready system — incorporating other tools and techniques — as the cornerstone of successful weed management programs.

Signals Big Shift on Genetically Modified Crops<date>Published: May 9, 2010</date><text>BRUSSELS — Madeira is more than 500 kilometers from the African coast and is officially one of the “outermost regions” of the European Union.Despite that far-flung status, Madeira catapulted into the center of the Union’s agricultural and environmental affairs last year when Portugal asked the European Commission for permission to impose an unprecedented ban on growing biotech crops there. Last week, the commission quietly let the deadline pass for opposing Portugal’s request, allowing Madeira, which is one of Portugal’s autonomous regions, to become the first E.U. territory to get formal permission from Brussels to remain entirely free of genetically modified organisms. Madeira now will probably go ahead and implement the ban, a spokeswoman for the Portuguese government said Friday. Individual European countries and regions have banned certain genetically modified crops before. Many consumers and farmers in countries like Austria, France and Italy regard the crops as potentially dangerous and likely to contaminate organically produced food. But the case of Madeira represents a significant landmark, because it is the first time the commission, which runs the day-to-day affairs of the European Union, has permitted a country to impose such a sweeping and definitive rejection of the technology. The Madeirans’ main concerns focused on preserving the archipelago’s biodiversity and its forest of subtropical laurel trees. Such forests, known as laurisilva, were once widespread on the European mainland but were wiped out thousands of years ago during an earlier period of climate change. That has left Madeira with “much the largest extent of laurel forest surviving in the world, with a unique suite of plants and animals,” according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which named the Madeiran laurisilva a World Heritage Site in 1999. The forest also is a growing attraction for tourists, who make up a significant portion of Madeira’s earnings. In seeking to ban biotechnology on Madeira, the Portuguese government told the commission that it would be impossible to separate crops containing genetically engineered material from other plant life. The “risk to nature presented by the deliberate release of GMOs is so dangerous and poses such a threat to the environmental and ecological health of Madeira, that it is not worthwhile risking their use, either directly in the agricultural sector or even on an experimental basis,” the Portuguese told the commission, using the acronym for genetically modified organisms. In an internal memorandum seen by the International Herald Tribune, the commission said it had let the deadline in the Madeira case pass without a formal assessment and more fanfare because that could “create misunderstandings and send confusing signals” at a time when Europe was reconsidering its approach to cultivating GMOs. In reality, the Madeira case marks the unofficial beginning of a new — and potentially highly contentious — policy that would give European nations and regions far greater freedom to decide when to ban such crops. In return for that freedom, skeptical countries like Austria would be expected to drop their opposition at E.U. meetings to approving more biotech crops for cultivation, allowing countries and regions that do wanted to plant them to do so. The policy would be aimed at overcoming an institutionalized stalemate in Europe that has left governments unable to reach decisions on whether to allow cultivation of new biotech products. As a result of that stalemate, only two biotech crops are allowed in Europe: a corn called Mon 810 from Monsanto and a potato called Amflora from the German industrial group BASF. John Dalli, the E.U. commissioner for health and consumer affairs, is expected to present details of the new policy by summer, and he will almost certainly have the full backing of José Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, who suggested the policy last year. Even so, the new policy is unlikely to be without its problems. A key concern is a sudden proliferation of bans dotting the continent. That could make it impossible for farmers to grow such crops over any significant amount of territory. The policy also risks stirring up new questions about whether the bloc is condoning impediments to trade with key partners like the United States. U.S. agricultural companies like Monsanto have long complained about lack of access to European markets and, in particular, about restrictions on cultivating crops. In one of the most contentious recent cases in trans-Atlantic trade policy, the World Trade Organization ruled against European restrictions on imports and cultivation of genetically modified crops in 2006. Mr. Dalli said in a recent interview that concerns about renewed trade tensions with the United States over GMOs were greatly exaggerated. Mr. Dalli also said that his priority was to get experts, companies and activists to “understand and accept a process that they will not try to second-guess or try to attack once a decision not to their liking is taken.” That may yet prove to be a tall order at a time when such profound differences of opinion over the potential damage that biotech crops could unleash show few signs of diminishing. The commission’s decision to allow Madeira its ban came only four months after the European Food Safety Authority, the main body tasked with advising the commission on food safety, categorically recommended ignoring Portugal’s concerns about the effect of GMOs. The agency concluded in January that, “no new scientific evidence, in terms of risk to human and animal health and the environment, was provided that would justify a prohibition of the cultivation of GM plants in the Autonomous Region of Madeira.”</text></article>

Tells Farmers It Will Press Agriculture Industry on Antitrust<date>Published: March 12, 2010</date><text>ANKENY, Iowa — The attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., traveled to the heart of Midwestern farm country on Friday to declare that the Obama administration was serious about rooting out anticompetitive practices in agriculture.“Is today’s agricultural industry suffering from a lack of free and fair competition in the marketplace? That’s the central question,” Mr. Holder said. He spoke at an unusual public meeting called to discuss the concerns of some farmers and ranchers that a few large companies had come to dominate many agricultural markets, controlling the seed that farmers plant and the milk they sell and the livestock ranchers raise. Mr. Holder and the agriculture secretary, Tom Vilsack, who co-hosted the event, said their agencies would work together on antitrust enforcement. “You will see an historic era of enforcement that will almost inevitably grow from the partnership that we have established,” Mr. Holder said later in a session with reporters. The meeting was attended by about 500 people, including farmers, meat packers and public relations executives for some of the large companies that have come under Mr. Holder’s microscope, including the biotechnology giant Monsanto. The Justice Department had previously announced that it was taking a look at practices in the seed industry, which Monsanto dominates, that might be anticompetitive. The seed industry has become increasingly concentrated as large bioengineering firms snap up smaller companies. Farmers and regulators are concerned because seed prices for crops like corn, soybeans and cotton have risen sharply in recent years. Justice Department officials on Friday said they would not discuss details of the seed industry investigation. But Mr. Holder’s chief antitrust enforcer, the assistant attorney general Christine A. Varney, drew applause from the audience when she said the agency planned to keep a close eye on the coming shift to generic forms of biotech crop traits, as the patents that companies hold on those traits expire. Generic biotech crop seeds could save farmers lots of money. The first major trait to lose its patent, in time for the 2014 growing season, will be Monsanto’s best-selling gene for making soybeans resistant to a popular herbicide. Mr. Vilsack, a former Iowa governor, said the push against anticompetitive behavior meshed with a broader effort to bolster rural communities. “If we have a system that is not fair, is not making it easier for midsized operations to stay in business and therefore is leading to further declines in the number of farmers, then that’s something we need to address,” Mr. Vilsack said.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/business/12seed.html?ref=monsantocompany">Rapid Rise in Seed Prices Draws U.S. Scrutiny<date>Published: March 11, 2010</date><text>During the depths of the economic crisis last year, the prices for many goods held steady or even dropped. But on American farms, the picture was far different, as farmers watched the price they paid for seeds skyrocket. Corn seed prices rose 32 percent; soybean seeds were up 24 percent.Such price increases for seeds — the most important purchase a farmer makes each year — are part of an unprecedented climb that began more than a decade ago, stemming from the advent of genetically engineered crops and the rapid concentration in the seed industry that accompanied it. The price increases have not only irritated many farmers, they have caught the attention of the Obama administration. The Justice Department began an antitrust investigation of the seed industry last year, with an apparent focus on Monsanto, which controls much of the market for the expensive bioengineered traits that make crops resistant to insect pests and herbicides. The investigation is just one facet of a push by the Obama administration to take a closer look at competition — or the lack thereof — in agriculture, from the dairy industry to livestock to commodity crops, like corn and soybeans. On Friday, as the spring planting season approaches, Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, and Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, will speak at the first of a series of public meetings aimed at letting farmers and industry executives voice their ideas. The meeting, in Ankeny, Iowa, will include a session on the seed industry. “I think most farmers would look to have more competition in the industry,” said Laura L. Foell, who raises corn and soybeans on 900 acres in Schaller, Iowa. The Iowa attorney general, Tom Miller, has also been scrutinizing Monsanto’s market dominance. The company’s genetically engineered traits are in the vast majority of corn and soybeans grown in the United States, Mr. Miller said. “That gives them considerable power, and questions arise about how that power is used,” he said. Critics charge that Monsanto has used license agreements with smaller seed companies to gain an unfair advantage over competitors and to block cheaper generic versions of its seeds from eventually entering the market. DuPont, a rival company, also claims Monsanto has unfairly barred it from combining biotech traits in a way that would benefit farmers. In a recent interview at Monsanto’s headquarters in St. Louis, its chief executive, Hugh Grant, said that while his company might be the market leader, competition was increasing as the era of biotech crops matured. “We were the first out of the blocks, and I think what you see now is a bunch of people catching up and aggressively competing, and I’m fighting with them,” Mr. Grant said. He said farmers chose the company’s products because they liked the results in the field, not because of any untoward conduct on Monsanto’s part. Yet in a seed market that Monsanto dominates, the jump in prices has been nothing short of stunning. Including the sharp increases last year, Agriculture Department figures show that corn seed prices have risen 135 percent since 2001. Soybean prices went up 108 percent over that period. By contrast, the Consumer Price Index rose only 20 percent in that period. Many farmers have been willing to pay a premium price because the genetically engineered seeds that make up most of the market come with advantages. Genetic modifications for both corn and soybeans make the crops resistant to herbicides, simplifying weed control and saving labor, fuel and machinery costs. Many genetically engineered corn and cotton seeds also resist insect pests, which cuts down on chemical spraying. Lee Quarles, a Monsanto spokesman, said the price increases were justified because the quality of the seeds had been going up, and new biotech traits kept being added. For example, he said, many corn varieties now include multiple genes to battle insect pests, raising their value. Mr. Quarles said higher prices were justified because the traits saved farmers money and made their operations more efficient. Monsanto began investing heavily in biotechnology in the 1980s — ahead of most other agricultural companies. In the mid-1990s, it became the first to widely market genetically engineered seeds for row crops, introducing soybeans containing the so-called Roundup Ready gene, which allowed plants to tolerate spraying of its popular Roundup weed killer. Soon after, it began selling corn seed engineered with a gene to resist insect pests. The number of biotech plant traits has grown since then, and other large companies — including DuPont, Dow Chemical, Syngenta, BASF and Bayer CropScience — have gotten into the business. But Monsanto has taken advantage of its head start. Today more than 90 percent of soybeans and more than 80 percent of the corn grown in this country are genetically engineered. A majority of those crops contain one or more Monsanto genes. As biotechnology has spread, Monsanto and its competitors have bought dozens of smaller seed companies, increasing the concentration of market power in the industry. Monsanto sells its own branded seed varieties, like Dekalb in corn and Asgrow in soybeans, to farmers. But it has expanded its influence and profits by licensing those traits to hundreds of small seed companies, allowing them to incorporate the traits in the seeds they sell. It has also granted licenses to the other large trait developers, allowing them to create combinations of engineered traits in a process known as stacking. Monsanto says that its licensing shows it is the opposite of a monopolist, encouraging rather than hampering competition. But critics say the licenses give Monsanto excessive control. Seed company executives said the licenses were sometimes worded in a way that compelled them to sell Monsanto traits over those of its competitors. Mr. Quarles denied that, saying the contracts contain sales incentives typical of the industry. Some of the most pointed accusations have come in a court battle between Monsanto and DuPont. Last year Monsanto sued its rival, saying DuPont had used a Monsanto trait to create a gene combination that was not permitted in its licensing agreement. DuPont countered by charging that Monsanto was using its market power to strong-arm competitors and quash innovation that would benefit farmers and consumers. In January, Monsanto won a partial victory. A federal judge ruled that the license barred DuPont from creating the gene stack. But the judge said that DuPont could move ahead with its antitrust claims, which, if successful, could potentially nullify the stacking ban. DuPont made another accusation that caught the attention of farmers and regulators, saying that Monsanto was trying to head off the eventual entry into the marketplace of generic Roundup Ready seeds. The company’s patent on the Roundup Ready trait in soybeans expires before the 2014 planting season, meaning that, just as in the pharmaceutical business, rivals would be free to sell a cheaper version. Farmers would also be free to save seed from one year to the next, a money-saving step they are now barred from taking. But DuPont charged that Monsanto was trying to force seed companies to switch prematurely to its second-generation Roundup Ready soybeans and taking other steps to make the entry of generics more difficult. Monsanto responded by announcing that it would not block companies from selling a generic version of Roundup Ready seeds. But farmers have continued to fret that cheaper generic seeds may be at risk.</text></article>

Clears Biotech Potato for Cultivation<date>Published: March 2, 2010</date><text>BRUSSELS — The European Commission began a new push Tuesday to allow farmers in Europe to grow more biotech crops, clearing a genetically modified potato for cultivation despite persistent public opposition to the technology. In the first such step in more than a decade, the commission approved the Amflora potato produced by the German company BASF for cultivation inside the 27-country European Union. John Dalli, the bloc’s health commissioner, said the potatoes could be planted in Europe, with some conditions, as soon as next month. The potato is engineered to be unusually rich in a starch suitable for making glossy paper and other products, as well as for feeding animals. Currently the only other biotech crop grown in Europe is a type of corn produced by Monsanto, which was approved in 1998. On Tuesday, the commission also approved three additional types of genetically modified corn by Monsanto for food and feed, but those are for import and processing rather than cultivation. For the biotech industry, the decisions handed down by Mr. Dalli, who took office last month, could signal the emergence of a major new advocate for genetically modified products in Europe. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr. Dalli, who is from Malta, also said he would present a proposal this summer to give national governments more authority to decide whether to allow genetically modified crops to be grown within their borders. That could make it easier for biotech-friendly states to go ahead with planting certain new products even when other states disapprove of the technology. “Responsible innovation will be my guiding principle when dealing with innovative technologies,” he said. The bloc has long been divided over biotech crops, with countries like Britain favoring the technology and Austria in fierce opposition. “We feel encouraged by this decisive regulatory approach,” said Willy De Greef, the secretary general for a group representing the biotech industry, EuropaBio. The “approvals represent a step in the right direction and a return to science-based decision making,” he said. The commission first forwarded an application to grow the potato to governments in May 2004. When a number of countries raised objections, the commission sent the application to experts at the European Food Safety Authority. Experts at the authority approved the application for the potato in 2006 and 2007, and again in 2009. But because member governments were repeatedly unable to reach a qualified majority to approve the potato, the commission on Tuesday invoked its power to approve the application by a form of fiat. That procedure had only been used once before to get a biotech seed to market for cultivation in Europe. The seed, called Bt176 and produced by Syngenta, no longer is grown in Europe. The Amflora potato looks like any garden-variety spud, but in developing it, BASF included a marker gene as a way of identifying plant cells that successfully produced the desired type of starch. Some scientists have linked the marker gene to antibiotic resistance in humans, raising concerns that the ill and the elderly, especially, could become more vulnerable to disease. Environmentalists reacted with fury to the decision, saying that Mr. Dalli had overstepped his mandate. The commissioner “only needed weeks in his new position to show such flagrant support for industry interests ahead of his own portfolio,” said Martin Häusling, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. Opinion polls have consistently shown that a majority of European consumers are apprehensive about such technology. The European Commission, however, wants to allow more gene-altered products into the Union to remove an irritant in trade relations with the United States and other countries that use them — and to lower costs for European farmers and industry. “The way is now clear for commercial cultivation of Amflora this year,” Peter Eckes, the president of BASF Plant Science, said in a statement on the company’s Web site. “Amflora will strengthen the international position of the European potato starch industry.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 3, 2010, in The International Herald Tribune.BRUSSELS — The European Commission began a new push Tuesday to allow farmers in Europe to grow more biotech crops, clearing a genetically modified potato for cultivation despite persistent public opposition to the technology.

The hedge fund reported no holdings of the troubled bank’s shares at the end of the third quarter. Soros Fund Management owned 6.2 million shares of SPDR Gold Trust — an exchange-traded fund that owns gold bullion — at the end of the year, worth $663 million. That was up from 2.5 million shares at the end of the third quarter, Reuters said. Mr. Soros and other noted investors like John Paulson have previously promoted gold as a hedge against inflation, further economic turmoil or a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. Last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr. Soros said “the ultimate asset bubble is gold,” but he declined to say whether he was investing in the precious metal. The filing for the end of the fourth quarter revealed no listing for the Canadian chemicals manufacturer Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, Mr. Soros’s largest holding at the end of the third quarter. That could indicate that the stake of almost three million shares was sold during the fourth quarter. But large investors occasionally leave off major holdings when they are trading the position and disclose their investment in a confidential filing with the S.E.C. or in a subsequent amendment to their public report, Reuters said. The firm does not comment on its holdings, a spokesman told Reuters. Mr. Soros’s most recent S.E.C. filing also revealed large bets on the seed producer Monsanto and the Brazilian gas and oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro, also known as Petrobras. The firm held 3.9 million shares of Monsanto at the end of the fourth quarter, up from 1.1 million three months earlier. Mr. Soros also reported a stake of 7.7 million shares of Petrobras’s U.S. A.D.R.’s, worth $369 million, and a slight increase from the 7.4 million receipts held at the end of the third quarter. Mr. Soros had another 5.9 million shares of nonvoting A.D.R.’s, worth $249 million, virtually unchanged from his holding three months earlier. Mr. Soros also reported raising his holdings in the oil company Hess Corporation and the telecommunications company AT&amp;T, among others. According to the regulatory filing, Soros Fund Management raised its holding in the carmaker Ford Motor to 10.9 million shares, from 7.3 million shares at the end of the third quarter, when Mr. Soros started to accumulate his position. Mr. Soros also raised his holdings of AT&amp;T for the second consecutive quarter, to 4.7 million shares, at the end of the fourth quarter from 4.2 million shares at the end of the third quarter. Large investors such as Mr. Soros are required to report holdings of U.S.-listed equities at the end of each quarter, but not short positions or holdings of other securities like bonds and over-the-counter derivatives contracts, Reuters noted. Investors are also allowed to file some holdings on confidential reports if they are trading into or out of a position at the end of a quarter.

The Justice Department’s antitrust division “is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the seed industry,” a department spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, said. Monsanto will not block seed makers from creating generic versions of any of its gene-modified seeds as they lose patent protection, the chief executive, Hugh Grant, said. Starting in 2015, farmers can replant Roundup Ready soybeans saved from the last year’s harvest, and rival seed makers can create their own Roundup-tolerant seeds. “We understand why regulators would want to know more about competition in modern agriculture and how products are commercialized and used,” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s chief deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “We believe that an objective review will show our business and our industry to be competitive.” The company said it had provided access to “millions of pages of documents” and it was cooperating with the inquiry.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Dan Gill/Associated Press In 2014, the patent for Monsanto's Roundup soybean seeds will expire, the first expiration on a widely used bioengineered crop. Related Times Topics: Monsanto Company Add to Portfolio Monsanto Co DuPont Company Go to your Portfolio » In letters to seed companies and farm groups this week, Monsanto said that it would allow farmers to continue to grow its hugely popular Roundup Ready 1 soybeans even after the patent protecting the technology expires in 2014. The letter countered a widespread impression in the agriculture business that Monsanto planned to force farmers and seed companies to migrate to a successor product called Roundup Ready 2 Yield, which will remain under patent and is more expensive. The issue has potentially broad implications for the agriculture industry because Roundup Ready soybeans will be the first widely grown biotechnology crop to lose patent protection since gene splicing became a mainstay of crop science in the 1990s. Because farmers and seed companies would no longer have to pay royalties to Monsanto on the gene after 2014, Roundup Ready soybeans would become agricultural biotechnology’s equivalent of a generic drug. Monsanto’s statement comes as the Justice Department is investigating possible antitrust concerns in the seed business, looking in particular at Monsanto, which dominates the business of supplying crop traits developed through genetic engineering. Critics, including some competitors, say that Monsanto has great leverage over the seed business and growers through restrictive contracts that must be signed to use Monsanto’s genes or to grow the genetically modified crops. Monsanto calls such criticisms baseless. But it certainly is getting harder for seed companies to avoid using the Roundup Ready bacterial gene, which makes the plants impervious to the widely used herbicide glyphosate, which Monsanto sells as Roundup. That allows farmers to spray their fields to kill weeds without harming the crops. More than 90 percent of the soybeans grown in the United States contain it. So do about two-thirds of the nation’s corn and cotton crops, though those are protected by different patents that expire later than the soybean patent. Gerald A. Steiner, executive vice president for corporate affairs at Monsanto, said Thursday that Monsanto was not changing its policy on how it would handle the soybean patent expiration, but was merely clarifying its intentions. “What’s different,” he said, “is we have made a very comprehensive communication of what we are going to do.” But the widespread impression in the seed business was that Monsanto was backing away from a previous policy. “The only thing we were told was that as of 2014 you would not be able to sell any more Roundup Ready 1,” said Jack Debolt, manager of Advanced Genetics, a coalition of small Ohio seed companies that license the Roundup Ready gene from Monsanto to put in their seeds. Monsanto’s biggest competitor, DuPont’s Pioneer Hi-Bred seed company, has also accused Monsanto of antitrust violations including, as it says in a lawsuit, an effort to “remove Roundup Ready from the market prior to the time when competitors will be able to produce a generic product.” Mr. Steiner of Monsanto said one reason for the company’s letters this week was to counter statements made by Pioneer, which Monsanto has sued alleging patent infringement. Roundup Ready seed can cost as much as $75 an acre compared with $30 to $35 for soybean seeds that are not genetically modified, according to James Beuerlein, a soybean specialist at Ohio State University. The difference in price is thought to reflect mainly royalties paid to Monsanto. While Monsanto sells Roundup Ready seeds itself, it also licenses the technology to other seed companies. Some seed industry executives and academic soybean specialists say that Monsanto was not planning to renew licenses for that Roundup Ready 1 trait that expired before 2014, so that seed companies would have no choice but to move to Roundup Ready 2. But in its letters this week, Monsanto said it would now extend all contracts for Roundup Ready 1 until the patent’s expiration date. It also said it would not enforce language in some contracts that would have required seed companies to destroy or return Roundup Ready seed when the patent expired. And Monsanto said seed companies could continue to sell seeds containing the Roundup Ready 1 trait without jeopardizing their access to the successor technology. Monsanto also said that after the patent expired it would allow farmers to save Roundup Ready 1 seeds from one year’s crop to plant the next. Monsanto said it would not enforce other patents that might protect those seeds. Many soybean farmers used to save seeds, but with Roundup Ready seeds they have been contractually obliged to buy new seeds each year. Monsanto has taken legal action against hundreds, if not thousands, of farmers it has accused of saving seed. “This is a pretty big concession for Monsanto,” said Shawn Conley, a soybean specialist at the University of Wisconsin, who said saving seed could save farmers a lot of money. Still, it is uncertain how long Roundup Ready 1 would survive in generic form. Some nations require licenses for the import of genetically engineered crops to be periodically renewed. Monsanto said it would maintain those licenses through 2017. But if they expired after that, American farmers would not be permitted to export the Roundup Ready 1 generic soybeans to certain countries, which would discourage them from growing those crops. Monsanto said it was confident that most farmers and seed companies would move to Roundup Ready 2, which uses the same bacterial gene but places it in a different location in the soybean DNA. Monsanto said that Roundup Ready 2 crops would have higher yields, and that other desirable traits would be added to those crops over time.

Monsanto denies the allegations. It says that it regularly allows other companies to stack their genetic traits onto its own and that DuPont could have signed such a license. It also says that farmers are switching to the new anti-Roundup technology because it improves yields. We don’t know who is right, but we do know that these charges need to be fully investigated. Monsanto has never been shy about going to court to defend its dominant position. Regulators are certainly concerned. In 2007, when Monsanto bought a cotton-seed maker, Delta and Pineland, the Justice Department’s antitrust division required it to remove license provisions forbidding rivals from stacking Monsanto with non-Monsanto traits. The antitrust division will not say if it is investigating Monsanto.

As U.S. farmers prepare to harvest billions of bushels of corn and soybeans — main ingredients in food, livestock feed and transportation fuel around the world — the two titans of seed technology, Monsanto and DuPont, are ramping up their rivalry to new heights. DuPont is accusing Monsanto of illegal anti-competitive practices, while Monsanto counters that DuPont is engaging in a covert smear campaign that borders on fraud. The chief executive of Monsanto, Hugh Grant, this week sent a letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, to the DuPont chairman, Charles O. Holliday Jr., accusing the company of a “serious breach of business ethics” and requesting that a special committee of DuPont’s independent directors investigate what Mr. Grant called an “attack” on Monsanto’s seed business. Monsanto executives claim that DuPont has supported forged documents and secretly financed Monsanto critics. “This is just the tip of the iceberg of dirty tricks. I have never seen corporate conduct of this nature,” said a lawyer at Monsanto, Scott Partridge. DuPont counters that it is trying to expose what it calls Monsanto’s “illegal monopoly” and the harm it says Monsanto is doing to farmers and others up and down the food chain. “This is not just a DuPont problem. This is a competition problem,” said a lawyer for DuPont, Donald L. Flexner. “They’ve gained illegal monopoly power.” The stakes have risen as both the U.S. Agriculture and Justice Departments said this month that they would start an examination of competition and antitrust concerns in the seed industry. “We understand that there are concerns regarding the levels of concentration in the seed industry, particularly for corn and soybeans,” said Philip J. Weiser, deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division at the Justice Department. Both companies have strong positions in the U.S. seed industry and have been racing each other and other competitors to develop higher-yielding crops through genetic modifications and other means. This spring, the competition spilled into the courts as Monsanto and DuPont sued each other over a soured licensing arrangement. Monsanto claimed DuPont was using the herbicide-tolerant technology of its Roundup Ready seeds outside the scope of the agreement. DuPont countersued, seeking relief under antitrust laws to end what it called “Monsanto’s multifaceted, anti-competitive scheme to unlawfully restrict competition.” Monsanto claims, and DuPont does not dispute, that DuPont has been aligning itself with, and in some cases financing, groups critical of Monsanto. Monsanto in turn has started an effort to discredit DuPont, working with a Washington law firm to circulate documents that lay out a series of scathing accusations. The documents accuse DuPont of misleading investors about certain product capabilities, as well as involvement in what Monsanto has said were several falsified letters to lawmakers and others who criticize Monsanto. A Monsanto spokesman, Lee Quarles, said the company wanted to protect itself against DuPont’s “smear campaigns” designed to “compete through deceit.” A DuPont spokesman, Anthony Farina, said Monsanto was engaging in a “campaign of diversion” and that DuPont was cooperating with a group of attorneys general from states including Iowa, the top U.S. corn grower, investigating Monsanto’s business practices. The biotechnology companies are battling while farmers, agricultural academics and consumer groups are growing increasingly concerned about climbing seed prices and industry concentration, which they say restricts the supply of seeds that have not been genetically modified. “We’re hearing lots of complaints from farmers about huge price increases and that non-G.M.O. seed availability no longer exists,” said Bill Wenzel, national director of the Farmer to Farmer Campaign on Genetic Engineering, which has been studying the sharp price increases in soy and corn seed in recent years.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Monsanto Co Go to your Portfolio » The vote, taken by European environment ministers, could irritate Washington, which has complained to the World Trade Organization about obstacles to planting bioengineered crops. The vote was also a setback for the European Commission, the union’s executive arm. The commission has sought to ease the restrictions in Europe on gene-altered crops, in part to keep down the cost of animal feed. Member countries were “firm” and the “commission should take a close reading of the result,” the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said after the announcement in Brussels, according to Bloomberg News. The market for genetically engineered crops is worth several billion dollars worldwide. Only one genetically altered crop is currently grown in Europe: a form of corn, called MON 810, produced by Monsanto and other companies. In 2003, Argentina, Canada and the United States brought complaints about Europe’s biotechnology policies to the W.T.O., which ruled in 2006 that a de facto ban on imports of genetically modified foods from 1984 to 2004 violated trade rules. Since that ruling, the commission has required Austria to drop its ban on imports of genetically modified foods. But some other countries have maintained bans on imports and cultivation of such crops. “The risk has increased this morning that attention now will be thrown back to the W.T.O.,” said Willy De Greef, the secretary general of Europabio, a biotechnology industry organization in Brussels. The United States Mission to the European Union had no immediate comment. Officials at offices of the United States trade representative could not be reached.

The vote was also a setback for the European Commission, the union’s executive arm. The commission has sought to ease the restrictions in Europe on gene-altered crops, in part to keep down the cost of animal feed. Member countries were “firm” and the “commission should take a close reading of the result,” the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said after the announcement in Brussels, according to Bloomberg News.

As the world’s population expands and global warming alters weather patterns, water shortages are expected to hold back efforts to grow more food. People drink only a quart or two of water every day, but the food they eat in a typical day, including plants and meat, requires 2,000 to 3,000 quarts to produce. For companies that manage to get “more crop per drop,” the payoff could be huge, and scientists at many of the biggest agricultural companies are busy tweaking plant genes in search of the winning formula. Monsanto, the biggest crop biotechnology company, says its first drought-tolerant corn will reach farmers in only four years and will provide a 10 percent increase in yields in states like Nebraska and Kansas that tend to get less rainfall than eastern parts of the Corn Belt. At a recent farm show here called Husker Harvest Days, a few thousand farmers were guided past a small plot on which Monsanto had grown its drought-tolerant corn next to a similar variety without the “drought gene.” A transparent tent had shielded the plants from any rain through the hot Nebraska summer. The results were, to be sure, less than miraculous. Both the drought-tolerant and the comparison plants were turning brown and shriveling, and they were about three feet shorter than the lush green irrigated corn growing nearby. But the drought-tolerant plants, which also contained a second gene to protect their roots from a pest, were a little greener and a few inches taller than the comparison plants, and their cobs were missing fewer kernels. Monsanto said the improvement was significant. And the Nebraska and Kansas farmers who toured Monsanto’s plot, many of them facing water-use restrictions and soaring pumping costs for irrigation, said any improvement would be welcome. “We pump water like there’s no end, and that’s not going to last forever,” said Tom Schuele, a farmer in Cedar Rapids, Neb. Monsanto’s competitors, including DuPont’s Pioneer Hi-Bred unit and Syngenta, say they also plan to introduce water-efficient corn in a few years. And companies are working on plants that can stand up to heat, cold, salty soils and other tough environments. A small California company called Arcadia Biosciences is trying to develop crops that need only half as much nitrogen fertilizer as a conventional plant. Fertilizer is crucial to modern food production, but the large quantities used today damage the environment. And because fertilizer is made from natural gas, its costs have soared along with other energy costs. Public sector scientists are also on the hunt. Researchers at the University of California and the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines are developing rice that can survive flooding, which causes major crop losses for poor farmers in the lowlands of India and other countries. While rice is typically grown in standing water, the plants will die if submerged for more than a few days. Many of these advanced crops are being developed using genetic engineering. The technology, already used to make crops that can resist weeds and insects, has spurred worldwide controversy. But in an era in which people are marching in the streets of many countries to demand more food at lower prices, low-water crops might win over areas that now shun biotech crops, such as most of Africa. “Drought tolerance to me is the most critical entry point,” said Calestous Juma, a professor of international development at Harvard who has advised African governments on biotechnology. “This is kind of reopening the window for genetic modification.” Critics accuse the biotechnology industry and its backers of exploiting the recent global food crisis to push a technology that has been oversold and that could have unanticipated health and environmental effects.

The company will focus instead on its thriving business of selling seeds and developing ways to improve crops. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Monsanto Co Go to your Portfolio » The decision comes as more retailers, saying they are responding to consumer demand, are selling dairy products from cows not treated with the artificial hormone. Wal-Mart, Kroger and Publix are among the retailers that now sell house-brand milk from untreated cows. Almost all of the fresh milk sold by Dean Foods, the nation’s largest milk bottler, also comes from cows that were not treated with the artificial hormone, a spokeswoman said. Monsanto officials said the decision was not related to the retail trend and that business for the artificial hormone, sold under the brand name Posilac, remained brisk. Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis and is the only commercial manufacturer of the hormone, declined to provide sales numbers. Selling Posilac “will allow Monsanto to focus on the growth of its core seeds and traits business while ensuring that loyal dairy farmers continue to receive the value of Posilac in their operations,” Carl Casale, Monsanto’s executive vice president for strategy and operations, said in a statement. The growth hormone, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1993, was one of the first applications of genetic engineering used in food production. When the artificial hormone, which is made in genetically modified bacteria, is injected into cows, it increases milk production by about a gallon a day. A 2007 survey by the Department of Agriculture said 17 percent of the nation’s dairy cows were receiving it. Despite the government’s approval, many advocacy groups have long maintained that Posilac is bad for the health of cows. Some even claim it could pose a cancer risk in people, though little scientific evidence has emerged to support that view. Their concerns have been fueled by the refusal of many countries, including Canada and members of the European Union, to permit the use of the hormone. “I think they saw the handwriting on the wall and gave up,” said Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington. “It’s a major victory for consumers.” Mr. Kimbrell said the original idea of marketing a growth hormone for milk production was flawed because milk is so emblematic of childhood. Fear of the effects of the artificial hormone was one of the primary drivers behind the growth of the organic dairy industry, he said. But Elena Gonser, a dairy farmer in Everson, Wash., contended that consumers had been misled by misinformation. She added that Posilac, which is also known as bovine somatotropin or BST, was safe and effective. “I believe it’s just catering to ignorance to tell people it’s BST-free, and it’s better for you,” said Ms. Gonser, who along with her husband runs a farm that has 70 cows. But she added: “I’m not surprised to find they want to step back from it. It’s gotten a bad rap for so long.” Monsanto’s announcement comes after a year of pitched battles over labeling on dairy packages. A year ago, Monsanto tried unsuccessfully to persuade federal officials to crack down on labels that say the milk has been produced without the hormone, arguing that milk from treated cows was the same as that from untreated cows. In the months since, a Monsanto-backed advocacy group and a handful of dairy organizations have struggled to have similar laws or regulations passed at the state level. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the secretary of agriculture banned the labels, only to have his order overturned by the governor amid a consumer uproar. Monsanto will continue to sell and market the product until a buyer is found, said Christie Chavis, who leads commercial development and strategy for the company’s animal agriculture business unit. Posilac is sold in 20 countries. Ms. Chavis said that the artificial hormone was safe and also good for the environment, saying that it takes fewer cows and less resources to produce the same volume of milk. Jim Werkhoven, a dairy farmer in Monroe, Wash., said he was disappointed when he learned of the move on Wednesday from a Monsanto industrial relations executive. “I certainly understand from a business perspective why they may be doing this,” he said. “At the end of the day, the customer is going to be the one that sets the rules, and at the end of the day, it’s going to be the customer that pays the price.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on August 7, 2008, on page C1 of the New York edition.After struggling to gain consumer acceptance, Monsanto on Wednesday announced that it would try to sell its business of producing an artificial growth hormone for dairy cows.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Monsanto Researchers at Monsantos Breeding Research Center in Stonington, Ill., are working on new soybean products. Related The Food Chain: Food Is Gold, and Investors Pour Billions Into Farming (June 5, 2008) Leaders Speak of Their Own Issues at a Conference Addressing Food Shortages (June 5, 2008) The announcement, coming as world leaders are meeting in Rome to discuss rising food prices and growing food shortages, appears to be aimed at least in part at winning acceptance of genetically modified crops by showing that they can play a major role in feeding the world. Much of what is in the commitment are things the company was doing anyway. But Monsanto’s chief executive, Hugh Grant, said in an interview Wednesday that the company wanted to make the goals public “so this isn’t just a bound report on some library shelf.” He said it was only coincidence that the announcement was made at the same time as the meeting in Rome. Monsanto said it had developed its commitment after consulting farmers, political leaders, academics and advocacy groups as to what needed to be done to increase food production without converting more forests into farmland or increasing pollution. It is a matter of debate how much genetic engineering, which involves adding bacterial or other foreign genes to the DNA of plants, could contribute to improving output. A recent review of agricultural technology, sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, depicted a limited role. But in Rome on Tuesday, the United States secretary of agriculture, Edward T. Schafer, said biotechnology would be essential if the world was to increase food supply by 2030 to meet rising demand. Soybeans, corn and cotton that have been genetically engineered to provide herbicide tolerance, insect resistance or both are widely grown in the United States and several other countries. But they are largely shunned in Europe and some other areas because of concerns about potential environmental and health effects. Perhaps seeking to avoid controversy, Monsanto’s announcement did not mention the term “genetic engineering.” It referred instead to “other technologies” beyond breeding. Monsanto’s goal of doubling yields by 2030 over levels in 2000 might require a sharp acceleration in the rate by which agricultural productivity has been increasing. James E. Specht, a soybean genetics expert at the University of Nebraska, said he doubted it could be done. “The hype-to-reality ratio of that one is essentially infinity,” Mr. Specht said. “Seeing an exponential change in the yield curve is unlikely.” Mr. Specht said that on irrigated farms in Nebraska, soybean yields have been increasing by about 0.6 bushels an acre every year. At that rate it would take 83 years for yields to double from the 50 bushels an acre recorded in 2000. But Monsanto executives say that a new technique called marker-assisted selection could double the rate of gain made from breeding. That technique does not involve altering crops by putting in foreign genes. Rather it uses genetic tests to help choose which plants to use in conventional cross-breeding, vastly speeding up the process. Monsanto executives say genetic engineering could provide additional increases in output beyond that. The company’s insect-resistant crops already help protect corn and cotton. And Monsanto scientists are working on genetically engineered crops that would grow better with less water and fertilizer. Moreover, the company is not talking about the United States alone. In some countries, output could be increased sharply just by introducing modern hybrid corn, whether or not that corn is genetically engineered, Mr. Grant said. Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, a Washington group critical of biotech crops, said some studies had shown that genetic engineering can actually reduce yields. He and other critics also say that the biotech crops developed so far have mainly been aimed at feeding livestock in wealthy countries, not improving the staple crops grown by small farmers in poor countries. As part of its announcement Wednesday, Monsanto said it would work to improve the lives of small and poor farmers by sharing its technology. It recently announced a project with some other organizations to develop drought-tolerant corn for Africa, with Monsanto not charging royalties for use of its technology. Monsanto also said it would donate $10 million over five years to public-sector programs aimed at improving yields of wheat and rice, which are not a primary focus of the company’s efforts. Much of the breeding of those two food staples are performed by governments and universities. While Mr. Grant said that skeptics might say Monsanto was exploiting the food crisis to win acceptance for its technology, other people “will say it’s long overdue, and thank goodness the companies are stepping up.” Shares of Monsanto fell by $1.54, to close at $131.60 Wednesday. But the stock has more than doubled in the last year, in part because of soaring crop prices. Besides being a leader in genetic engineering, Monsanto is one of the largest suppliers of seeds in the world.

Related The Food Chain: Food Is Gold, and Investors Pour Billions Into Farming (June 5, 2008) Leaders Speak of Their Own Issues at a Conference Addressing Food Shortages (June 5, 2008) The announcement, coming as world leaders are meeting in Rome to discuss rising food prices and growing food shortages, appears to be aimed at least in part at winning acceptance of genetically modified crops by showing that they can play a major role in feeding the world. Much of what is in the commitment are things the company was doing anyway. But Monsanto’s chief executive, Hugh Grant, said in an interview Wednesday that the company wanted to make the goals public “so this isn’t just a bound report on some library shelf.” He said it was only coincidence that the announcement was made at the same time as the meeting in Rome. Monsanto said it had developed its commitment after consulting farmers, political leaders, academics and advocacy groups as to what needed to be done to increase food production without converting more forests into farmland or increasing pollution. It is a matter of debate how much genetic engineering, which involves adding bacterial or other foreign genes to the DNA of plants, could contribute to improving output. A recent review of agricultural technology, sponsored by the United Nations and the World Bank, depicted a limited role. But in Rome on Tuesday, the United States secretary of agriculture, Edward T. Schafer, said biotechnology would be essential if the world was to increase food supply by 2030 to meet rising demand. Soybeans, corn and cotton that have been genetically engineered to provide herbicide tolerance, insect resistance or both are widely grown in the United States and several other countries. But they are largely shunned in Europe and some other areas because of concerns about potential environmental and health effects. Perhaps seeking to avoid controversy, Monsanto’s announcement did not mention the term “genetic engineering.” It referred instead to “other technologies” beyond breeding. Monsanto’s goal of doubling yields by 2030 over levels in 2000 might require a sharp acceleration in the rate by which agricultural productivity has been increasing. James E. Specht, a soybean genetics expert at the University of Nebraska, said he doubted it could be done. “The hype-to-reality ratio of that one is essentially infinity,” Mr. Specht said. “Seeing an exponential change in the yield curve is unlikely.” Mr. Specht said that on irrigated farms in Nebraska, soybean yields have been increasing by about 0.6 bushels an acre every year. At that rate it would take 83 years for yields to double from the 50 bushels an acre recorded in 2000. But Monsanto executives say that a new technique called marker-assisted selection could double the rate of gain made from breeding. That technique does not involve altering crops by putting in foreign genes. Rather it uses genetic tests to help choose which plants to use in conventional cross-breeding, vastly speeding up the process. Monsanto executives say genetic engineering could provide additional increases in output beyond that. The company’s insect-resistant crops already help protect corn and cotton. And Monsanto scientists are working on genetically engineered crops that would grow better with less water and fertilizer. Moreover, the company is not talking about the United States alone. In some countries, output could be increased sharply just by introducing modern hybrid corn, whether or not that corn is genetically engineered, Mr. Grant said. Bill Freese, a science policy analyst at the Center for Food Safety, a Washington group critical of biotech crops, said some studies had shown that genetic engineering can actually reduce yields. He and other critics also say that the biotech crops developed so far have mainly been aimed at feeding livestock in wealthy countries, not improving the staple crops grown by small farmers in poor countries. As part of its announcement Wednesday, Monsanto said it would work to improve the lives of small and poor farmers by sharing its technology. It recently announced a project with some other organizations to develop drought-tolerant corn for Africa, with Monsanto not charging royalties for use of its technology. Monsanto also said it would donate $10 million over five years to public-sector programs aimed at improving yields of wheat and rice, which are not a primary focus of the company’s efforts. Much of the breeding of those two food staples are performed by governments and universities. While Mr. Grant said that skeptics might say Monsanto was exploiting the food crisis to win acceptance for its technology, other people “will say it’s long overdue, and thank goodness the companies are stepping up.” Shares of Monsanto fell by $1.54, to close at $131.60 Wednesday. But the stock has more than doubled in the last year, in part because of soaring crop prices. Besides being a leader in genetic engineering, Monsanto is one of the largest suppliers of seeds in the world.</text></article>

Growers had argued that the economic harm they faced was serious enough for the month-old ban to be lifted immediately, before the start of the spring planting season. Proponents also said that allowing plantings of the gene-altered seed, called MON810, could benefit consumers at a time of rising food prices. But the Conseil d’État upheld the ban until it could rule on its scientific underpinning. Hearings are expected to be held in coming months. In his ruling, Judge Jean-Marie Delarue pointed out that a report issued in January by a committee of French specialists had called for more studies on the product’s safety. The decision was a victory for environmentalists and for farmers opposed to gene-modification technology. They had warned that the corn, which confers resistance to pests, could pollute other crops and pose a threat to the environment and human health. Other farmers, backed by the biotechnology industry, argue the products could help lower costs and reduce use of pesticides. “We are disappointed,” said Stéphanie Piécourt, a spokeswoman for Monsanto in France, adding that corn farmers “will not be able to benefit from the economic, agricultural and environmental advantages that this product offers.” The French agriculture ministry imposed the ban on Feb. 7, saying it should remain in place until a review of the product  required every 10 years  was completed by European authorities. Efforts to overturn the ban were led by the General Association of Maize Growers in France and several biotechnology companies, including Monsanto and Pioneer, a unit of the chemical company DuPont. Cédric Poeydomenge, a spokesman for the maize growers’ association, said farmers had hoped to plant 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) using the pest-resistant corn. He said farmers would plant nonmodified corn this year, but would face 10 million euros in insecticide costs and potential losses from pests. Battles over gene-altered crops have been fought across Europe for more than a decade, but there now are signs that some governments and policy makers are prepared to ease longstanding opposition. Nathalie Moll of Europabio, an industry association in Brussels, said she expected MON810 to be cultivated this year in at least seven European Union countries, including Spain and Germany. MON810, under the brand name YieldGard, has been used in the United States for more than a decade. But some governments, including those in Austria and France, are extremely wary of softening their stance on genetic modification because of continuing distrust among those citizens who consider gene-altered products to be “Frankenstein” foods.

Skip to next paragraph Kevin P. Casey for The New York Times Posilac is the brand name of a Monsanto synthetic hormone used to increase milk production in cows. A new advocacy group closely tied to Monsanto has started a counteroffensive to stop the proliferation of milk that comes from cows that aren’t treated with synthetic bovine growth hormone. The group, called American Farmers for the Advancement and Conservation of Technology, or Afact, says it is a grass-roots organization that came together to defend members’ right to use recombinant bovine somatotropin, also known as rBST or rBGH, an artificial hormone that stimulates milk production. It is sold by Monsanto under the brand name Posilac. Dairy farmers are indeed part of the organization. But Afact was organized in part by Monsanto and a Colorado consultant who lists Monsanto as a client. Afact has also received help from Osborn &amp; Barr, a marketing firm whose founders include a former Monsanto executive. The firm received a contract in 2006 to help with the Posilac campaign. Lori Hoag, a spokeswoman for the dairy unit of Monsanto, said her company did provide financial support to Afact. But Ms. Hoag asserted that the group is led by farmers, not Monsanto. “They make all the governing decisions for their organization,” she said. “Monsanto has nothing to do with that.” Afact has come together as a growing number of consumers are choosing milk that comes from cows that are not treated with the artificial growth hormone. Even though the Food and Drug Administration has declared the synthetic hormone safe, many other countries have refused to approve it, and there is lingering concern among many consumers about its impact on health and the welfare of cows. The marketplace has responded, and now everyone from Whole Foods Market to Wal-Mart Stores sells milk that is labeled as coming from cows not treated with the hormone. Some dairy industry veterans say it’s only a matter of time before nearly all of the milk supply comes from cows that weren’t treated with Posilac. According to Monsanto, about a third of the dairy cows in the United States are in herds where Posilac is used. And the trend might not stop with milk. Kraft is planning to sell cheese labeled as having come from untreated cows. But consumer demand for more natural products has conflicted with some dairy farmers’ desire to use the artificial hormone to bolster production and bottom lines, and it has certainly interfered with Monsanto’s business plan for Posilac. Cows typically produce an extra gallon a day when they are treated with Posilac. That can translate into serious money for dairy farmers at a time when prices are near record highs. So Afact has embarked on a counteroffensive that includes meeting with retailers and pushing efforts by state legislators and state agriculture commissioners to pass laws to ban or restrict labels that indicate milk comes from untreated cows. Last fall in Pennsylvania, Dennis Wolff, the agriculture secretary, tried to ban milk that was labeled as free of the synthetic hormone because, he said, consumers were confused. Mr. Wolff’s office acknowledged that it had no consumer research to back up his claim, and he eventually had to scale back his plans when consumer groups and Gov. Edward G. Rendell balked. Instead, the state tightened up the language on milk labels to make sure it was more accurate. But Posilac’s supporters haven’t given up. In recent months, labeling changes have been floated in New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Missouri and Vermont, according to Michael Hansen, who has tracked the issue as a senior scientist for Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports. A Consumer Reports survey last summer found that 88 percent of consumers believed that milk from cows not treated with synthetic hormones should be allowed to be labeled as such. Afact says it believes that such “absence” labels can be misleading and imply that milk from cows treated with hormones is inferior. In fact, the F.D.A. maintains that there is no significant difference between milk from cows that are treated and from those that are not. Afact also argues that some consumers are paying a premium for milk that doesn’t include artificial hormones. “We know it’s a technology that makes us money and is safe for our cows,” said Carrol Campbell, a Kansas dairy farmer who is co-chairman of Afact. Mr. Campbell said he became involved in the issue because his cooperative called him and asked him to stop using Posilac; instead, he found a new cooperative. Ms. Hoag of Monsanto said her company was not actively pushing changes in milk labeling laws. Advocates for Posilac, including Monsanto, have been complaining for years about milk labeled as free of artificial bovine growth hormone. In September 2006, Kevin Holloway, president of the Monsanto dairy unit, gave a speech in which he said the “fundamental issue” was dairy farmers’ ability to choose the best technology. “Dairy farmer choice to use a variety of F.D.A.-approved technologies is at risk,” he said. That same year, the Monsanto dairy unit hired Osborn &amp; Barr to handle, among other things, the Posilac brand, according to an article in the St. Louis Business Journal. In 2007, Monsanto and several dairy organizations met by phone to “lay the groundwork” for a grass-roots organization, according to an online dairy industry newsletter. Afact was created in the fall of 2007. In addition to receiving money from Monsanto, Afact has received help with its Web site from Osborn &amp; Barr, said Monty G. Miller, a Colorado consultant who was hired to organize the group. Afact believes that the push for milk from untreated cows is being driven by advocates like Consumers Union and PETA, “who make a profit, living and business by striking fear in citizens,” Mr. Miller said in an e-mail message. The group also believes it will be hard for food retailers to “move away from the rBST-free stance without legislation and government policy,” according to an Afact presentation to dairy farmers in January. In the presentation, Afact also listed “integrity,” “honesty” and “transparent” as “words we wish to embody.” They could start by being more straightforward about who is behind Afact.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/business/worldbusiness/26corn.html?ref=monsantocompany">Both Sides Cite Science to Address Altered Corn<date>Published: December 26, 2007</date><text>BRUSSELS  A proposal that Europe’s top environment official made last month, to ban the planting of a genetically modified corn strain, sets up a bitter war within the European Union, where politicians have done their best to dance around the issue. Skip to next paragraph Thierry Roge/Reuters Science advisers told the European official Stavros Dimas that Bt corn was unlikely to pose a risk. He suggested banning it. The environmental commissioner, Stavros Dimas, said he had based his decision squarely on scientific studies suggesting that long-term uncertainties and risks remain in planting the so-called Bt corn. But when the full European Commission takes up the matter in the next couple of months, commissioners will have to decide what mix of science, politics and trade to apply. And they will face the ambiguous limits of science when it is applied to public policy. For a decade, the European Union has maintained itself as the last big swath of land that is mostly free of genetically modified organisms, largely by sidestepping tough questions. It kept a moratorium on the planting of crops made from genetically altered seeds while making promises of further scientific studies. But Europe has been under increasing pressure from the World Trade Organization and the United States, which contend that there is plenty of research to show such products do not harm the environment. Therefore, they insist, normal trade rules must apply. Science does not provide a definitive answer to the question of safety, experts say, just as science could not determine beyond a doubt how computer clocks would fare at the turn of the millennium. “Science is being utterly abused by all sides for nonscientific purposes,” said Benedikt Haerlin, head of Save Our Seeds, an environmental group in Berlin and a former member of the European Parliament. “The illusion that science will answer this overburdens it completely.” He added, “It would be helpful if all sides could be frank about their social, political and economic agendas.” Mr. Dimas, a lawyer and the minister from Greece, looked at the advice provided by the European Union’s scientific advisory body  which found that the corn was “unlikely” to pose a risk  but he decided there were nevertheless too many doubts to permit the modified corn. “Commissioner Dimas has the utmost faith in science,” said Barbara Helfferich, spokeswoman for the environment department. “But there are times when diverging scientific views are on the table.” She added that Mr. Dimas was acting as a “risk manager.” Within the European scientific community, there are passionate divisions about how to apply the growing body of research concerning genetically modified crops, and in particular Bt corn. That strain is based on the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and mimics its production of a toxin to kill pests. The vast majority of research into such crops is conducted by, or financed by, the companies that make seeds for genetically modified organisms. “Where everything gets polarized is the interpretation of results and how they might translate into different scenarios for the future,” said Angelika Hilbeck, an ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, whose skeptical scientific work on Bt corn was cited by Mr. Dimas. “Is the glass half-empty or half-full?” she asked. Ms. Hilbeck says that company-financed studies do not devote adequate attention to broad ripple effects that modified plants might cause, like changes to bird species or the effect of all farmers planting a single biotechnology crop. She said producers of modified organisms, like Syngenta and Monsanto, have rejected repeated requests to release seeds to researchers like herself to conduct independent studies on their effect on the environment.

But Karen S. Oberhauser, a leading specialist on monarch butterflies at the University of Minnesota, said that debate and further study of Bt corn was appropriate, particularly for Europe. “We don’t really know for sure if it’s having an effect” on ecosystems in the United States, she said, and it is hard to predict future problems. About 40 percent of corn in the United States is now the Bt variety, and it has been planted for about a decade. “Whether Bt corn is a problem depends totally on the ecosystem  what plants are near the corn field and what insects feed on them,” Ms. Oberhauser said. “So it’s really, really important to have careful studies.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 26, 2007, on page C1 of the New York edition.BRUSSELS  A proposal that Europe’s top environment official made last month, to ban the planting of a genetically modified corn strain, sets up a bitter war within the European Union, where politicians have done their best to dance around the issue. Skip to next paragraph Thierry Roge/Reuters Science advisers told the European official Stavros Dimas that Bt corn was unlikely to pose a risk. He suggested banning it. The environmental commissioner, Stavros Dimas, said he had based his decision squarely on scientific studies suggesting that long-term uncertainties and risks remain in planting the so-called Bt corn. But when the full European Commission takes up the matter in the next couple of months, commissioners will have to decide what mix of science, politics and trade to apply. And they will face the ambiguous limits of science when it is applied to public policy. For a decade, the European Union has maintained itself as the last big swath of land that is mostly free of genetically modified organisms, largely by sidestepping tough questions. It kept a moratorium on the planting of crops made from genetically altered seeds while making promises of further scientific studies. But Europe has been under increasing pressure from the World Trade Organization and the United States, which contend that there is plenty of research to show such products do not harm the environment. Therefore, they insist, normal trade rules must apply. Science does not provide a definitive answer to the question of safety, experts say, just as science could not determine beyond a doubt how computer clocks would fare at the turn of the millennium. “Science is being utterly abused by all sides for nonscientific purposes,” said Benedikt Haerlin, head of Save Our Seeds, an environmental group in Berlin and a former member of the European Parliament. “The illusion that science will answer this overburdens it completely.” He added, “It would be helpful if all sides could be frank about their social, political and economic agendas.” Mr. Dimas, a lawyer and the minister from Greece, looked at the advice provided by the European Union’s scientific advisory body  which found that the corn was “unlikely” to pose a risk  but he decided there were nevertheless too many doubts to permit the modified corn. “Commissioner Dimas has the utmost faith in science,” said Barbara Helfferich, spokeswoman for the environment department. “But there are times when diverging scientific views are on the table.” She added that Mr. Dimas was acting as a “risk manager.” Within the European scientific community, there are passionate divisions about how to apply the growing body of research concerning genetically modified crops, and in particular Bt corn. That strain is based on the naturally occurring soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis and mimics its production of a toxin to kill pests. The vast majority of research into such crops is conducted by, or financed by, the companies that make seeds for genetically modified organisms. “Where everything gets polarized is the interpretation of results and how they might translate into different scenarios for the future,” said Angelika Hilbeck, an ecologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, whose skeptical scientific work on Bt corn was cited by Mr. Dimas. “Is the glass half-empty or half-full?” she asked. Ms. Hilbeck says that company-financed studies do not devote adequate attention to broad ripple effects that modified plants might cause, like changes to bird species or the effect of all farmers planting a single biotechnology crop. She said producers of modified organisms, like Syngenta and Monsanto, have rejected repeated requests to release seeds to researchers like herself to conduct independent studies on their effect on the environment.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Eric Hylden for The New York Times Robert Green will plant the modified sugar beets on his farm in North Dakota next spring. Add to Portfolio Monsanto Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Chad Case for The New York Times In his right hand, Duane Grant holds a genetically engineered sugar beet, next to a conventional beet. Once refined, the sugar from each would be the same, sucrose. You give small doses of products that might harm the crop, but it harms the weeds a little more, said Mr. Green, who plants about 900 acres in beets in St. Thomas, N.D. But next spring, for the first time, Mr. Green intends to plant beets genetically engineered to withstand Monsantos powerful Roundup herbicide. The Roundup will destroy the weeds but leave his crop unscathed, potentially saving him thousands of dollars in tractor fuel and labor. For Mr. Green and many other beet farmers, it is technology too long delayed. And the engineered beets could pave the way for the eventual planting of other biotech crops like wheat, rice and potatoes, which were also stalled on the launching pad. Seven years ago, beet breeders were on the verge of introducing Roundup-resistant seeds. But they had to pull back after sugar-using food companies like Hershey and Mars, fearing consumer resistance, balked at the idea of biotech beets. Now, though, sensing that those concerns have subsided, many processors have cleared their growers to plant the Roundup-resistant beets next spring. It would be the first new type of genetically engineered food crop widely grown since the 1990s, when biotech soybeans, corn and a few other crops entered the market. Basically, we have not run into resistance, said David Berg, president of American Crystal Sugar, the nations largest sugar beet processor. We really think that consumer attitudes have come to accept food from biotechnology. A Kellogg spokeswoman, Kris Charles, said her company would not have any issues buying such sugar for products sold in the United States, where she said most consumers are not concerned about biotech. If some other big food companies are now open to genetically modified sugar, though, they are not talking about it. Both Hershey and Mars declined to comment. Theres just nothing we have to say on the topic, a Mars spokeswoman said. Many sugar refiners and seed developers also refused to comment, hewing to an industrywide plan to coordinate the introduction of the genetically engineered beets and carefully control what is said about them. When it comes to genetically modified crops, there is a reason to keep ones corporate head low  to avoid protests. Some opponents of biotechnology are only now getting wind that the sugar beets have been resurrected. When I first saw this I said, No, it cant be, said Ronnie Cummins, national director of the Organic Consumers Association. I thought we had already dealt with this. His organization issued a call to arms and thousands of identical e-mail messages were sent to Mr. Berg at American Crystal Sugar warning that profit margins of your company and its supporting farmers would be hurt by consumer resistance. Mr. Berg said he received 681 messages in a 24-hour period before having the e-mail blocked. He said he still believed that most consumers would accept biotech crops. Mr. Cummins, however, said he would next try to persuade consumers to pressure food companies to boycott the sugar. I dont think companies like Hershey are going to want any more hassles than they already have, he said, referring to recent earnings pressure and management turmoil at the chocolate company. About 10,000 American farmers grow sugar beets on about 1.3 million acres, mainly in Northern states from Oregon to Michigan. That makes the beets a minor crop compared with corn, at about 90 million acres, and soybeans, at almost 70 million. And yet beets account for about half the nations sugar supply, with the rest coming from sugar cane. The sugar from beets and cane, generally considered interchangeable, is used in candies, cereals, cakes and numerous other products, although some food manufacturers have switched to high-fructose corn syrup, which is cheaper. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 27, 2007, on page C1 of the New York edition.Each growing season, like many other sugar beet farmers bedeviled by weeds, Robert Green repeatedly and painstakingly applies herbicides in a process he compares to treating cancer with chemotherapy.

But the growth rate for Monsantos core business of genetically modified corn, soy and cotton seeds, and its history of exceeding its earnings guidance, encouraged investors, and its shares recouped most of an earlier sell-off. At Monsanto they view their projections as a commitment, not an aspiration, said Frank Mitsch, a BB&amp;T Capital Markets analyst, adding that the company had significantly beaten its earnings growth target for the last three years. Monsanto shares closed down 74 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $88.78 on the New York Stock Exchange, after declining 4.4 percent just after the markets open. Monsanto said its net loss widened to $210 million, or 39 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, which ended Aug. 31, from $144 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. The results included a $186 million in-process research and development charge at its Delta and Pine Land cotton business. On an ongoing basis, the company, based in St. Louis, said its loss was 18 cents a share, missing analysts average estimate by a penny, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose to $1.57 billion, from $1.39 billion, helped by a strong end to the corn season in the United States and higher corn seed revenue from Argentina and Brazil. One area of business that is not doing well is the companys selective herbicide business, which is declining as farmers switch to Monsantos Roundup, in combination with crop plants that tolerate the broad-spectrum weedkiller. Monsanto said it expected fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.20 to $2.40 a share. Analysts on average had forecast $2.50, according to Reuters Estimates.

Monsanto said net income rose to $570 million, or $1.03 a share, in its fiscal third quarter, which ended May 31, from $334 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated $1 a share, according to Reuters Knowledge. Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, said strong demand for its branded corn seed products in the United States, as well as in Italy, France and Germany, contributed to the sharp profit increase. Farmers are planting more corn this year because of sharply higher prices caused by strong demand for corn to use in making ethanol, food and livestock feed. The company’s shares rose 68 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $67.68 on the New York Stock Exchange. Over all, sales for Monsanto’s seeds and genomics division totaled $1.7 billion for the third quarter, up 32 percent from a year earlier. Yesterday, Monsanto raised its projections for American corn planting and said it was undertaking a three-year $610 million capital investment for its United States corn production. It expects corn tolerant of the herbicide Roundup to be grown on about 80 million acres, up from its previous estimate of 60 million acres. The Department of Agriculture will issue a June plantings report today. Analysts on average expect total 2007 corn plantings of 90.6 million acres. Monsanto said it had increased prices across the board for 2008 in its DeKalb brand, including Roundup Ready herbicide-tolerant corn, in the 10 to 25 percent range. Monsanto reiterated expectations for full-year earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 a share. It raised the forecast this month from a previous estimate of $1.60 to $1.65 a share.

Making the journey to Vietnam was important for me, but at the time I couldnt quite formulate how.

The region was so thick with foliage one would never suspect that in an effort to expose the Vietcong by destroying their environment, the United States sprayed about 19.5 million gallons of Agent Orange and other toxic herbicides over the jungles of South Vietnam. As I traveled the region, I knew about Agent Orange, just as I knew that an environmental cleanup effort was still under way, and yet it was hard to believe. The foliage was lush and green, seemingly untouched by the noxious chemicals of the war. I had seen a video of the C-123 cargo planes swooping low, just above a blanket of crenellated canopy, the fusillade of white clouds fanning out, pretty as powdered sugar. The chemicals worked through the top layers of foliage, moving down to the rice paddies and sinking into the red soil. In the video, the defoliant appeared almost tonic, like cool talcum powder falling from heaven. My father walked in the wake of those planes. He remembered the defoliants descent over the jungle, slow as snow. He recalled the white coated leaves, the way his throat burned when he breathed the humid air, the strange discoloration he found when he blew his nose. He remembered bathing in a bomb crater, dead birds floating on the surface. Last year, after five years fighting throat cancer that he and his doctors attributed to exposure to the dioxin in Agent Orange, my father died. He was 61. During my trip, I visited a museum dedicated to remembering what the Vietnamese call the American War. Exhibits on the effects of Agent Orange make up a significant part of the permanent collection. There were numbers and charts and statistics, run-of-the-mill data, but there were also pictures of babies born of parents exposed to Agent Orange. Their deformities were gruesome, making them appear bestial, inhuman. Years after my trip, these are the images I remember most vividly. Today the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, is scheduled to hear oral arguments against Dow, Monsanto and 35 other companies that manufactured Agent Orange and related herbicides used during the Vietnam War. In addition, 16 appeals by American veterans will be heard, as well as an appeal by a group that represents Vietnamese victims of Agent Orange. The veterans and the Vietnamese are seeking the reinstatement of lawsuits dismissed in March 2005 by Judge Jack Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The plaintiffs are asking the court to acknowledge that Agent Orange has damaged the lives of thousands of people in both the United States and Vietnam. One of the Vietnamese civilians taking part in this appeal is a woman named Dang Hong Nhut, who lived in Cu Chi during the war, the very same part of Vietnam where my father spent his tour. After losing numerous babies to miscarriage and deformity, Dang Hong Nhut sent a biopsy abroad for analysis. The results showed that, years after the war, her body still retained traces of dioxin. In a television interview, she said: It doesnt matter if the companies wont admit their crimes. What really counts is that people see that a crime took place. It has been eight years since I went to Vietnam, and I am just starting to understand that my trip was less about changing the past, an impossible pursuit by any stretch of the imagination, and more about taking the time to understand and recognize the mistakes of the Vietnam War. Perhaps now, after 40 years, the victims of Agent Orange will finally get such recognition.

The decision, by Judge Charles R. Breyer of Federal District Court in San Francisco, came after a ruling he made a month ago that the Agriculture Department had violated the law by failing to prepare an environmental impact statement before approving the crop in June 2005. Yesterday’s order, the first time that approval of a genetically engineered crop had been revoked by a court, was a preliminary injunction. The judge said he would consider whether to make the injunction permanent at a hearing in late April. The lawsuit had been filed by some alfalfa seed companies and environmental and farm advocacy groups against the department. Monsanto intervened in the case after Judge Breyer’s ruling last month in an effort to keep the crop on the market. It was joined by several alfalfa growers and by Forage Genetics International, an alfalfa breeder that worked with Monsanto and now handles the sale of the seeds to farmers. The alfalfa is resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide, allowing farmers to kill weeds without hurting the crop. Monsanto said it was disappointed. “We are hopeful that a reasoned approach in this matter will address questions about the regulatory approval process for Roundup Ready alfalfa while maintaining farmer access to this beneficial technology,” Jerry Steiner, an executive vice president, said in a statement. In an effort to soften the impact of his ruling on farmers, Judge Breyer said seed already purchased could be planted until March 30. But in its news release, Monsanto said the deadline was too soon. It quoted Dale Scheps, a dairy farmer in Almena, Wis., saying he had already purchased enough seed for 35 acres but did not plant alfalfa until mid-May. About 200,000 acres of the Roundup Ready crop were planted last year, but Forage Genetics had expected the acreage to increase to 550,000 this year, according to Monsanto. About 22 million acres of alfalfa are grown in the United States, most of which is used for feeding livestock. Compared with its genetically modified soybean and corn, alfalfa is not yet a big product for Monsanto. The Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group that organized the lawsuit, hailed the latest ruling. The Agriculture Department did not have immediate comment. In his earlier decision, Judge Breyer had said the government had failed to assess adequately whether the Roundup Ready trait could be transferred to organic or conventional alfalfa, hurting sales of organic farmers or alfalfa exports to countries like Japan that did not want the genetically engineered variety.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/business/14crop.html?ref=monsantocompany">U.S. Agency Violated Law in Seed Case, Judge Rules<date>Published: February 14, 2007</date><text>A federal judge ruled yesterday that the Agriculture Department violated the law by failing to adequately assess possible environmental impacts before approving Monsantos genetically engineered alfalfa. Judge Charles R. Breyer of Federal District Court in San Francisco said the agency had been cavalier in deciding that a full environmental impact statement was not needed because the potential environmental and economic effects of the crop were not significant. Plaintiffs in the case  some alfalfa seed companies and environmental and farm advocacy groups  said they would push to stop the sales and planting of the alfalfa, which is resistant to Monsantos Roundup herbicide. Joseph Mendelson, legal director of the Center for Food Safety, a Washington advocacy group that organized the lawsuit, said the decision by itself could block commercial sales of genetically engineered alfalfa seeds but that the plaintiffs would ask for an injunction to make sure. Judge Breyer asked the parties to meet and propose remedies to him by Feb. 26. Christopher R. Horner, a spokesman for Monsanto, said the company had not seen the decision but thought it would not affect its business. Monsanto was not named in the suit, which was filed against the Agriculture Department. Calls to several spokesmen for the Agriculture Department were not returned. A recording in the departments communications office said the government closed early yesterday because of expected bad weather in Washington. A federal judge in Washington said last week that the Agriculture Department had not done adequate assessments before approving field trials of genetically engineered grass. And last August a federal judge in Hawaii, in a case involving field trials of crops engineered to produce pharmaceuticals, ruled that the Agriculture Department had not adequately assessed the possible impact on endangered species. Mr. Mendelson of the Center for Food Safety said yesterdays decision could set a precedent that would require the Agriculture Department to do full impact statements for other biotech crops before they are approved. The Roundup Ready alfalfa was deregulated by the Agriculture Department in June 2005, meaning it could be grown outside of field trials. It was the first approval in years of a new genetically engineered crop. Because alfalfa is the fourth most widely planted crop in the United States, the action presented a big opportunity for Monsanto. The Agriculture Department had first done an environmental assessment, which concluded that a longer and more detailed environmental impact statement was not needed. This was in part, the agency said, because the implanted gene conferring herbicide resistance was harmless to people and livestock. But Judge Breyer, in his 20-page opinion, said that the agency had not adequately considered the possibility that the gene could be transferred by pollen to organic or conventional alfalfa, hurting sales of organic farmers or exports to countries like Japan that did not want the genetically engineered variety. An action which potentially eliminates or at least greatly reduces the availability of a particular plant  here, nonengineered alfalfa  has a significant effect on the human environment, he wrote. The judge also said that the Agriculture Department had too easily dismissed the possibility that planting Roundup-resistant alfalfa would lead to wider use of Roundup, which in turn would contribute to the development of weeds resistant to the popular herbicide. That is particularly a risk, he said, because many other crops like soybeans and corn are also resistant to Roundup, which is known generically as glyphosate. One would expect that some federal agency is considering whether there is some risk to engineering all of Americas crops to include the gene that confers resistance to glyphosate, he wrote.

Net income in the three months ended Nov. 30 rose to $90 million, or 16 cents a share, from $59 million, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Monsanto, which is based in St. Louis, said annual profit would be at the high end of its earlier forecast of $1.50 to $1.57 a share, less than the $1.64 a share estimated by analysts. The stock dropped the most it had in five weeks. People were expecting a bump in guidance, and thats not happening, said Mark Gulley, an analyst at Soleil Securities. The highest corn prices in a decade helped the company increase sales of seeds and genetics 35 percent in the latest quarter as American farmers moved to protect crop yields. Total revenue rose 9.5 percent, to $1.54 billion, and Roundup sales gained 18 percent, Monsanto said. Shares of Monsanto fell 89 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $50.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, for their biggest percentage decline since Nov. 27. The company was expected to earn 10 cents a share in the first quarter, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Net income last year was $1.25, or $1.31 excluding some items. Corn prices rose 81 percent in 2006. They reached a 10-year high in November, at $3.935 a bushel on record demand for corn-based ethanol, an alternative fuel. Plantings may rise 9.4 percent next year, to 85.9 million acres, Informa Economics, a commodity research company, said last month. Monsanto has enough corn seed to meet demand should United States acreage rise to 85 million acres, the chief executive, Hugh Grant, said in a conference call with analysts and investors. Total soybean acres may drop slightly from last year as more corn is planted, Monsanto said. Corn seeds will be $3 an acre more profitable than soybeans in 2007, up from 80 cents last year, because farmers are buying more genetic modifications to protect yields, Monsanto said last month.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Price Increases for Corn Graphic A Preference for Corn The company and its local soybean processor offered the farmers doughnuts and a simple pitch: an extra 35 cents a bushel to grow the special soybeans, instead of regular ones, and seemingly unlimited demand. The special soybeans contain less of the fatty linolenic acid than other soybeans. Some liked the offer, but others were not so sure, given the extra work involved and the allure of planting high-priced corn instead to feed the ethanol boom. I think that the reason that farmers are not catching on to these low-lin soybeans is the premium is not quite enough, said Fred Tilstra, a 69-year-old farmer in Steen, Minn. As it now stands, there are not nearly enough of the special beans to fill the surging demand. That has created a tricky situation for major fast-food chains and manufacturers who want to stop using partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, a food industry workhorse that is the source of artificial trans fat. The reluctance of farmers is only one part of the problem. Monsanto and its competitors have not been able to create new varieties of trans-fat-free soybeans fast enough to meet the demand for more varied uses. And the situation is only going to get worse: in the three weeks since New York City announced it would ban trans fat from its restaurants, several major cities and some states, including California, have begun considering similar measures. Everybody knows the situation; you just cant pull this stuff out of a sock, said Kelly Brintle, senior vice president of Ventura Foods, a California company that processes and sells edible oils and is also trying to persuade farmers to produce a lot more of the special soybeans. Our phones are ringing off the wall. Trans fat, which is in foods as diverse as cookies and French fries, is created when food manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil, a process called hydrogenation, to increase the shelf life of food and stabilize flavors. For several decades, it was considered a healthier alternative to butter and tropical oils, which contain saturated fats. But in the 1990s, scientists became convinced that trans fat was more dangerous than the fats it replaced. Not only does it raise the level of unhealthy cholesterol, it lowers the level of the kind of cholesterol that is considered desirable. A strange twist to the current supply squeeze for trans-fat-free soybean oil is that the seeds were created more than a decade ago, but for years, there were no buyers. One seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, finally stopped research on new varieties in 1999 because of the dismal prospects. We waited and waited, said Russ Sanders, marketing director at Pioneer, which is now part of DuPont. Now the market is expanding faster than we can keep up. As a result, seed companies and oil manufacturers are offering farmers 21 cents to 80 cents a bushel extra to grow the low-linolenic soybeans. Monsanto has made arrangements with 14 processing plants across the Midwestern corn belt to process the beans next year, and it has held several meetings with neighboring farmers at each plant to make their sales pitch. Our guys are working really hard to sign up as many growers as possible, but obviously there are challenges, said Christopher R. Horner, a Monsanto spokesman. This year, farmers planted about three-quarters of a million acres of low-linolenic soybeans, about a third to a half of what is needed to meet the demand, said Steven W. Poole, a spokesman for Qualisoy, an association that researches and promotes soybeans with enhanced traits. Ultimately, Mr. Poole anticipates that as many as five million acres of low-linolenic soybeans could be planted in the United States as more partially hydrogenated oils are replaced. The soybeans are not the only alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Some food companies have already switched to palm oil, canola oil or sunflower oil, all products that are growing rapidly. Given the difference between supply and demand, prices have risen for many of these oils as well. But palm oil is high in saturated fats, so health advocates argue that using it substitutes one problem for another. The other oils have their supporters  Frito-Lay uses corn oil and sunflower oil, for example, while Wendys uses a soybean-corn blend and Taco Bell recently switched to trans-fat-free canola oil. But many of the alternatives are more expensive than soybean oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the edible oils consumed in the United States. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: January 16, 2007 An article and a picture caption in Business Day on Dec. 29 about an effort to persuade farmers to grow a low-linolenic soybean, which produces cooking oil with reduced or no trans fat, referred imprecisely to the qualities of the soybean. Oil from the low-linolenic soybeans has many of the same characteristics of regular cooking oil with less need for hydrogenation, a process that creates trans fat. Soybeans themselves do not contain trans fat.

And the situation is only going to get worse: in the three weeks since New York City announced it would ban trans fat from its restaurants, several major cities and some states, including California, have begun considering similar measures. Everybody knows the situation; you just cant pull this stuff out of a sock, said Kelly Brintle, senior vice president of Ventura Foods, a California company that processes and sells edible oils and is also trying to persuade farmers to produce a lot more of the special soybeans. Our phones are ringing off the wall. Trans fat, which is in foods as diverse as cookies and French fries, is created when food manufacturers add hydrogen to vegetable oil, a process called hydrogenation, to increase the shelf life of food and stabilize flavors. For several decades, it was considered a healthier alternative to butter and tropical oils, which contain saturated fats. But in the 1990s, scientists became convinced that trans fat was more dangerous than the fats it replaced. Not only does it raise the level of unhealthy cholesterol, it lowers the level of the kind of cholesterol that is considered desirable. A strange twist to the current supply squeeze for trans-fat-free soybean oil is that the seeds were created more than a decade ago, but for years, there were no buyers. One seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, finally stopped research on new varieties in 1999 because of the dismal prospects. We waited and waited, said Russ Sanders, marketing director at Pioneer, which is now part of DuPont. Now the market is expanding faster than we can keep up. As a result, seed companies and oil manufacturers are offering farmers 21 cents to 80 cents a bushel extra to grow the low-linolenic soybeans. Monsanto has made arrangements with 14 processing plants across the Midwestern corn belt to process the beans next year, and it has held several meetings with neighboring farmers at each plant to make their sales pitch. Our guys are working really hard to sign up as many growers as possible, but obviously there are challenges, said Christopher R. Horner, a Monsanto spokesman. This year, farmers planted about three-quarters of a million acres of low-linolenic soybeans, about a third to a half of what is needed to meet the demand, said Steven W. Poole, a spokesman for Qualisoy, an association that researches and promotes soybeans with enhanced traits. Ultimately, Mr. Poole anticipates that as many as five million acres of low-linolenic soybeans could be planted in the United States as more partially hydrogenated oils are replaced. The soybeans are not the only alternative to partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. Some food companies have already switched to palm oil, canola oil or sunflower oil, all products that are growing rapidly. Given the difference between supply and demand, prices have risen for many of these oils as well. But palm oil is high in saturated fats, so health advocates argue that using it substitutes one problem for another. The other oils have their supporters  Frito-Lay uses corn oil and sunflower oil, for example, while Wendys uses a soybean-corn blend and Taco Bell recently switched to trans-fat-free canola oil. But many of the alternatives are more expensive than soybean oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the edible oils consumed in the United States. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: January 16, 2007 An article and a picture caption in Business Day on Dec. 29 about an effort to persuade farmers to grow a low-linolenic soybean, which produces cooking oil with reduced or no trans fat, referred imprecisely to the qualities of the soybean. Oil from the low-linolenic soybeans has many of the same characteristics of regular cooking oil with less need for hydrogenation, a process that creates trans fat. Soybeans themselves do not contain trans fat.</text></article>

The revamping will reduce fourth-quarter profit by $200 million, and an estimated $100 million in annual savings will be spent on faster development of seeds, the company said. DuPont is tying to stop the Monsanto Company from gaining a larger share of the nation’s corn-seed sales for the sixth consecutive year. Agriculture profit at DuPont fell 24 percent in the nine months that ended in September. The company eliminated 1,500 auto-paint jobs in March and has a year-old goal to reduce fixed costs by $1 billion. “This says to me that the goal they set for 2007 of $400 million in cost reduction is achievable,” said an HSBC Securities analyst, Hassan Ahmed. The company raised its 2006 net income forecast to $3.25 a share, from $2.86. The revised estimate includes a number of one-time items, the largest being a $500 million gain from a tax benefit related to the repatriation of overseas earnings. Excluding those items, profit will be $2.85 a share, the same as previously forecast, a spokesman, Anthony Farina, said. Production at 10 sites that make herbicides and pesticides, or are part of Solae, a venture with Bunge, will be reduced, a spokesman, Doyle Karr, said.

BCE was created 23 years ago to avoid regulatory conflicts for Bell and went on to hold major stakes in several companies including Northern Telecom (later Nortel) as well as TransCanada Pipelines. Until recently it controlled a media company that included CTV, Canada’s largest private broadcaster, and The Globe and Mail newspaper in Toronto. “There’s no doubt the winding down of BCE certainly does mark the end of an era in Canadian business, but the fact is, BCE was a company that was created for another time,” the chief executive, Michael J. Sabia, said Wednesday in a conference call. “Our strategy has been all about focus on Bell. That’s the business we know, and that’s the business we will stick to.” Given BCE’s market value of about 25.8 billion Canadian dollars ($22.9 billion), Bell Canada will be by far the biggest company to convert to an income trust. About 247 companies with a total market value of close to 200 billion Canadian dollars have made the switch so far. After companies convert to income trusts, they pay most of their earnings directly to unit holders and avoid most corporate tax. Once current BCE shareholders swap their shares one-for-one for Bell Canada trust units, they will receive annual payments of 2.55 Canadian dollars a unit. That is a 93 percent increase over BCE’s current annual dividend of 1.32 Canadian dollars a share. During the conference call, Mr. Sabia acknowledged that the decision to transform Bell into a trust was partly prompted by last month’s conversion by Telus of Vancouver, the chief competitor of Bell Canada. Some critics have argued that companies undergoing technology changes are not good candidates for trust conversions because they will divert too much of their cash to unit holders. Mr. Sabia, however, said that even after making its cash payments Bell Canada would have substantial amounts of capital for projects like introducing new technologies. “We will continue to make investments,” he said. But the size of the Bell Canada conversion may attract unwanted attention from the federal government. During a visit to Vancouver, the finance minister, Jim Flaherty, declined to discuss BCE’s plan.

LOUIS, Oct. 11 (AP)  Monsanto said on Wednesday that its quarterly loss widened as lower sales of seeds and related products offset higher sales of Roundup and other herbicides. Monsanto also forecast profit for 2007 that was below what Wall Street expected, and its shares fell 5.3 percent. The company, which is based in St. Louis, said its loss for the quarter that ended Aug. 31 was $144 million, or 27 cents a share, up from a loss of $125 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax provision for the repatriation of overseas earnings and other one-time items, the loss for the quarter was 21 cents a share. Revenue in the period, which was the fourth quarter of Monsanto’s fiscal year, rose 9 percent, to $1.39 billion from $1.27 billion. Analysts had expected a quarterly loss of 21 cents a share on revenue of $1.34 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. The revenue increase resulted from higher sales of Roundup and other herbicides in the United States and increased sales of corn products. The company said the strong herbicide results were partly offset by lower soybean trait revenue in the United States, because the company sold more of those products than usual in the first three quarters of the year. Monsanto said it expected 2007 earnings of $1.50 to $1.57 a share, below the $1.62 forecast by analysts. Stock in Monsanto fell $2.46, to $43.95 a share. More Articles in Business »ST.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Fawzan Husain for The New York Times Villagers in Bhadumari gathered in the house of Anil Kondba Shende and looked at his body as the local police investigated his suicide. The farmer, Anil Kondba Shende, 31, left behind a wife and two small sons, debts that his family knew about only vaguely and a soggy, ruined 3.5-acre patch of cotton plants that had been his only source of income. Whether it was debt, shame or some other privation that drove Mr. Shende to kill himself rests with him alone. But his death was by no means an isolated one, and in it lay an alarming reminder of the crisis facing the Indian farmer. Across the country in desperate pockets like this one, 17,107 farmers committed suicide in 2003, the most recent year for which government figures are available. Anecdotal reports suggest that the high rates are continuing. Though the crisis has been building for years, it presents an increasingly thorny political challenge for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. High suicide rates and rural despair helped topple the previous government two years ago and put Mr. Singh in power. Changes brought on by 15 years of economic reforms have opened Indian farmers to global competition and given them access to expensive and promising biotechnology, but not necessarily opened the way to higher prices, bank loans, irrigation or insurance against pests and rain. Mr. Singhs government, which has otherwise emerged as a strong ally of America, has become one of the loudest critics in the developing world of Washingtons $18 billion a year in subsidies to its own farmers, which have helped drive down the price of cotton for farmers like Mr. Shende. At the same time, frustration is building in India with American multinational companies peddling costly, genetically modified seeds. They have made deep inroads in rural India  a vast and alluring market  bringing new opportunities but also new risks as Indian farmers pile up debt. In this central Indian cotton-growing area, known as Vidarbha, the unofficial death toll from suicides, compiled by a local advocacy group and impossible to verify, was 767 in a 14-month period that ended in late August. The suicides are an extreme manifestation of some deep-seated problems which are now plaguing our agriculture, said M. S. Swaminathan, the geneticist who was the scientific leader of Indias Green Revolution 40 years ago and is now chairman of the National Commission on Farmers. They are climatic. They are economic. They are social. Indias economy may be soaring, but agriculture remains its Achilles heel, the source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of people but a fraction of the nations total economy and a symbol of its abiding difficulties. In what some see as an ominous trend, food production, once Indias great pride, has failed to keep pace with the nations population growth in the last decade. The cries of Indian farmers  or what Prime Minister Singh recently described as their acute distress  can hardly be neglected by the leaders of a country where two-thirds of people still live in the countryside. Mr. Singhs government has responded to the current crisis by promptly expanding rural credit and promising investments in rural infrastructure. It has also offered several quick fixes, including a $156 million package to rescue suicide prone districts across the country and a promise to expand rural credit, waive interest on existing bank loans and curb usurious informal moneylenders. But pressure is building to do more. Many, including Mr. Swaminathan, the agricultural scientist, would like to see the government help farmers survive during crop failures or years of low world prices. Subsidies, once a linchpin of Indian economic policy, have dried up for virtually everyone but the producers of staple food grains. Indian farmers now must compete or go under. To compete, many have turned to high-cost seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, which now line the shelves of even the tiniest village shops. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in International »BHADUMARI, India  Here in the center of India, on a gray Wednesday morning, a cotton farmer swallowed a bottle of pesticide and fell dead at the threshold of his small mud house.

The $1.5 billion cash deal, announced yesterday, would give Monsanto control of half the American market for cotton seeds and could face tough antitrust scrutiny at a time when smaller seed companies are being gobbled up by larger ones. Indeed, Monsanto tried to buy Delta and Pine Land in 1998, only to drop the deal the following year, saying it could not obtain approval from federal regulators. Delta and Pine Land, saying Monsanto did not try hard enough to win clearance, sued for $2 billion in damages and the companies have had a somewhat fractious relationship ever since. The new deal would end that litigation as well as an arbitration proceeding in which Monsanto is seeking the right to revoke Delta and Pine Lands license to use Monsantos genetically engineered technology to provide cotton with herbicide and insect resistance. Were not naïve to the history between the parties, but were both genuinely committed to make the transaction work, Hugh Grant, the chief executive of Monsanto, said in a conference call with analysts. He said that the market had changed since 1998 and that the deal could win clearance this time. Deltas share of the cotton seed market has fallen to a little over 50 percent, from about 80 percent, largely because of competition from Bayer CropScience. Mr. Grant said Monsanto expected that to win clearance it would have to divest itself of the American cotton seed business of Stoneville, a company it acquired last year that has about 12 percent of the market. If the deal cannot win clearance, Monsanto may have to pay Delta and Pine Land as much as $600 million. Monsanto also dominates the market for the genetically engineered traits for insect and herbicide resistance, which could also present an antitrust issue. Its a concentration issue that should be a matter of concern, said Neil E. Harl, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. But Mr. Grant said that other big companies were now developing such traits. Its a much more competitive business than it was a decade ago, he said. The deal for Delta, which must still be approved by that companys shareholders, is worth $42 a share, a 16 percent premium to Deltas closing price on Monday. The company, based in Scott, Miss., had $366 million in sales last year. Deltas stock yesterday rose $4.10, or 11 percent, to $40.34. Monsanto shares gained 39 cents, to $45.56. Mr. Grant said the deal would allow Monsanto to get more of its biotech traits into cotton, both in the United States and around the world. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, licenses its biotechnology traits to seed companies, including Delta, which incorporate them in their own varieties. More than 80 percent of the cotton grown in the United States this year was genetically engineered, according to the Department of Agriculture. Monsanto also sells seeds on its own and has been buying seed companies, in part to obtain desirable varieties in which to insert its genetically engineered traits. While it is strong in sales of corn and soybeans, it has been weaker in cotton. Monsanto also paid about $1 billion last year to buy Seminis, the worlds largest supplier of fruit and vegetable seeds, Mr. Grant said Delta had been slow to incorporate the latest Monsanto crops into its cotton varieties. Buying the company could significantly accelerate our technology penetration into this business, he said. Monsanto could also be aiming to significantly decelerate the penetration of its agricultural biotechnology rivals into the cotton business. In recent years, Delta and Pine Land has signed deals to use new technology for herbicide and insect resistance developed by DuPont and Syngenta. Tom Jagodinski, chief executive of Delta, said in an interview that his company stood to make more money from the DuPont and Syngenta traits because it negotiated more favorable terms than it did with Monsanto. But once Monsanto buys Delta, it could de-emphasize the DuPont or Syngenta technology, or those companies could withdraw from their deals. Mr. Jagodinski told analysts in a conference call that the deals with Syngenta and DuPont can survive a change in control of his company. Were going to continue to work with them up until the closing, he said. What Monsanto does with them after that is up to Monsanto. A spokeswoman for Monsanto said the company would be delighted to continue to offer those traits but does not yet know the details of the contracts between the companies. The deal could also conceivably deal a blow to a controversial genetic engineering technology that makes sterile seeds as a way of forcing farmers to buy new biotech seeds each year rather than saving the seed from one years crop to plant the next. Delta, which developed the technology along with the United States Department of Agriculture, has continued to work on it.

DuPont, which owns the Pioneer Hi-Bred International seed company, will become an equal partner in an existing Syngenta venture called GreenLeaf Genetics that licenses both conventional and genetically modified varieties to other seed companies in the United States and Canada. Syngenta will also use an experimental genetic engineering technology developed by Pioneer that allows crops to withstand glyphosate, the herbicide sold by Monsanto as Roundup. With both Pioneer and Syngenta offering that technology, it should have a better chance of competing against Monsanto's popular Roundup Ready seed technology. The partnership will "bring more choice, more options, to the growers," Michael Mack, the chief operating officer for Syngenta's seed business, said at a news conference at the biotechnology industry's annual convention here yesterday No financial terms were disclosed. The move marks a big departure for Pioneer, a company that is extremely proud of its long history as a corn breeder and which until now has sold seeds only under its own name. But Monsanto has been gaining market share in corn seeds over the last few years at Pioneer's expense, in part by licensing Monsanto's herbicide-resistant and insect-resistant crop genes to other seed companies. Pioneer executives said they would continue to sell their premium brands under the company's name. "Our long heritage is intact," Dean Oestreich, Pioneer's president, said at the news conference. But he and other Pioneer executives said there were some nonpremium varieties now just sitting on the shelf that could be licensed to others, allowing Pioneer to expand into the 40 percent of the market that does not buy premium seeds. Other seed companies will be able to cross lines provided by Pioneer to create new varieties, and seed retailers would be able to sell Pioneer varieties under their own brands. "What has changed is the time is right," Mr. Oestreich said. "Our biotechnology pipeline is now maturing. These important products really need to be driven across the industry." During a conference call held by DuPont, analysts questioned why the company entered a 50-50 joint venture, since Pioneer is much stronger in seeds than Syngenta. But DuPont officials said the deal was mutually beneficial. Monsanto accounts for the vast majority of biotech crops planted in the world, some under its own brands and the rest by other seed companies that have licensed its technology. Its biggest class of products has been soybeans, cotton, corn and canola genetically engineered to resist Roundup, enabling farmers to spray to kill weeds while leaving the crop intact. Both Pioneer and Syngenta license the Roundup Ready technology from Monsanto to impart glyphosate resistance to their own varieties. Developing their own herbicide-resistance technology would not only give them entry into a lucrative market but also relieve them of paying licensing fees and royalties to Monsanto. Pioneer executives said soybean seeds using its new technology would be ready for sale in 2009. The technology is called Optimum GAT, standing for glyphosate ALS tolerant. Crops using it would be even more resistant to glyphosate than Roundup Ready crops, the executives said, and would also be resistant to another widely used class of weed killers that use so-called ALS chemistry. ALS is an abbreviation for acetolactate synthase, a plant enzyme that the weed killers inhibit. In return for allowing Syngenta to use Optimum GAT, Pioneer is getting a license to insect-resistance genes from Syngenta. Pioneer now sells seeds for insect-resistant corn developed in partnership with Dow Chemical. Robb Fraley, chief technology officer for Monsanto, said it was too early to judge the effectiveness of the Optimum GAT technology or the impact of the new joint venture. "In the end it's going to come down to who has the best product in the marketplace," he said. DuPont shares rose 27 cents, to $42.97 yesterday, while Monsanto's fell 62 cents to $85.62. Syngenta's American depository receipts were down 24 cents in New York, to $27.71.

Monsanto, an industry leader in genetically altering crops to resist pests and to tolerate weed-killing treatments, earned $440 million, or $1.60 a share, up from $373 million, or $1.37 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Feb. 28 and was the second quarter of Monsanto's fiscal year, rose to $2.20 billion from $1.91 billion. The company cited greater adoption of its genetically modified corn varieties as a main driver of growth. Corn seed sales jumped 25.5 percent from the year-earlier quarter. The results were better than the $1.51 a share expected by analysts. Shares of Monsanto fell 47 cents, to $85.41, on concerns about Monsanto's growth prospects. Analysts were disappointed that Monsanto was not raising its forecast for 2006 earnings per share, which it said should be about $2.35 to $2.50. They also said they were worried about increased competition and the lagging performance of Monsanto's newly acquired vegetable and seed business. "They had a good quarter, but there are a number of things that we heard in the conference call to give us pause," said Michael Judd, an analyst at Greenwich Consultants. "All in all it is a good story, but the problem is that you have a limited upside potential to the stock," Mr. Judd said. Monsanto is projecting that its herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready corn will be planted on 34 million acres this spring, with a goal of 50 million acres by 2008. The use of Monsanto's insect-protected corn products is also expected to grow significantly, according to Carl Casale, a Monsanto executive vice president. The company also added $148 million in incremental sales in the second quarter as a result of its acquisition last summer of the Seminis vegetable and fruit seed business. The business caused some concern because sales for it were softer year over year, particularly in Europe. Monsanto also said that it was still having problems trying to collect fees for the black-market use of its technology in Argentina and that its Brazilian business was being hurt by a rapid rise in the currency there.

Food manufacturers, responding to the growing demand for food that does not contain heart-clogging trans fats, are turning to oil made from special types of soybeans. The move comes as seed companies like Monsanto and the Hi-Bred International unit of DuPont, are planting hundreds of thousands of acres of new soybean varieties. Both are planning for new rules on Jan. 1 that will require nutritional labels to list whether foods contain trans fats. David MacKay, Kellogg's president and chief operating officer, said in an interview on Thursday that his company had determined through extensive testing that a soybean oil known as low-linolenic was the best alternative to partially hydrogenated oils, which are high in trans fats. At first, Kellogg, which is based in Battle Creek, Mich., will mainly use an oil made by Monsanto. "This is the only solution we have found where we take trans fats out and minimize the amount of saturated fats," Mr. MacKay said. "We need to encourage growers and processors to make more of this oil." But a shortage of the oil - brought on by heightened demand - will slow Kellogg's plans to reduce trans fats in its products. Mr. MacKay said Kellogg planned to introduce some products reformulated with the new oil including cereal bars and most of its cracker products by early next year. Availability of the oil will determine when the rest of the snack products and other baked goods like cookies will be free of trans fats. "Some of our foods will have trans fats until we are in a position to remove them," he said. The new soybean oils reduce the need for partial hydrogenation, so that fewer trans fats are produced during processing. The oil is stable enough to replace hydrogenated oils and did not show any statistical difference in taste and shelf life in Kellogg's testing, Mr. MacKay said. But the new soybean oil is not stable enough to withstand the high temperatures required in the cooking of fried foods like McDonald's French fries, said Dave Stark, vice president for consumer traits at Monsanto. "There are still too many polyunsaturated fats," he said. "We are still at least a few years off" from a soybean oil that could serve as a substitute. McDonald's has been widely criticized for the high trans fat content in its fries. Food manufacturers are searching for alternatives to partially hydrogenated oils that have been the food industry's cooking oil of choice for decades. Studies show that trans fat has the same heart-clogging properties as saturated fat, but unlike saturated fat, it reduces the good cholesterol that can clear arteries. The Food and Drug Administration has declared that there is no healthy level of trans fats in the diet and it ordered food companies to disclose trans fat amounts on food labels by January. Food companies could choose to substitute tropical oils like palm or canola oil, which also reduce trans fats, but those oils raise saturated fat levels. The demand for the new soybean oil presents an opportunity for farmers, who are being paid a hefty premium for growing the specialized beans. Grain elevators are paying some Midwest farmers 40 cents a bushel more than for regular soybeans, said Desiree Fletcher-Hayes, a spokeswoman for DuPont.

"The vote reflects the view across the E.U., not just Switzerland," said Adrian Bebb, an expert on the issue at Friends of the Earth, an advocacy group. "The public doesn't want to eat genetically modified food." Syngenta, one of the largest producers of genetically modified organisms, often called G.M.O.'s, criticized the outcome of the vote. The company, which is based in Basel, Switzerland, has large operations in the United States. "We regret the negative impact for research," Alwin Kopse, a spokesman for Syngenta, told Bloomberg News. "We regret that farmers don't have the whole range of choice." Although Switzerland's move does not ban research on G.M.O.'s, a Swiss business group, Economiesuisse, said it feared that a ban would deter companies from making further investment. "The ban would deprive our farmers, companies and researchers of finding out what these genetically modified foods can do," the group said during campaigning before the vote. "Because it is a very dynamic sector, five years is equivalent to an eternity, and we won't be able to regain that lost time." In Switzerland, which is not a member of the European Union, farmers are not currently involved in growing genetically modified crops. On Sunday, 55.7 percent of the voters supported the five-year ban. While the United States has led the production and consumption of genetically modified crops, European consumers have been largely hostile to them. The European Commission banned the import of G.M.O.'s, from the United States from 1998 to 2004. Many European governments and consumers have fought the commission's attempts to open the market. In June, ministers of the environment in European countries upheld a decision by some governments, including France, Austria and Greece, to ban the use of eight genetically modified products previously authorized by the commission. While some governments, including Spain, Britain and the Netherlands, say Europe has appropriate safeguards in place, many nations contend further tests are needed before allowing widespread farming of genetically modified crops. Currently, only Spain has sizable areas given over to farming of such crops. Farmers in Germany and France are among those to have recently started operations on a smaller scale. The commission has pushed ahead with approving new G.M.O.'s despite the doubts about safety expressed by some European governments. In August, for example, it approved the use of rapeseed, or canola, in animal feed produced by the American company Monsanto after member states were split over whether the product was a risk to the environment. Michael Mann, a spokesman for the European Union's agriculture commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, said the union rigorously tested G.M.O.'s before approving them. The commission, he said, would not comment on the Swiss vote. Genetically modified crops are mainly produced by large-scale farmers in nations like the United States, Canada and China. Proponents say the technology, which involves using genetic alterations to help plants combat insects and herbicides, could help increase yields and reduce prices over the long term.

LOUIS, Oct. 12 (AP) - The Monsanto Company, a maker of genetically engineered seeds and the Roundup herbicide, said Wednesday that its quarterly loss widened substantially, but the results exceeded Wall Street expectations and Monsanto raised its forecast for the year ahead. Monsanto said its loss was $125 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with the year-earlier loss of $42 million, or 16 cents a share. Excluding a number of one-time items, the company said its loss from continuing business was 50 cents a share, better than a loss of 51 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the fourth quarter of Monsanto's fiscal year, rose 3 percent to $1.27 billion from $1.23 billion. The company said sales grew for its seeds and traits business, offsetting lower revenue for its Roundup herbicides and other herbicides in the United States. Seeds and traits sales were helped by its newly acquired Seminis business. "The really good seed gains came from their new acquisitions," said Juli Niemann, an analyst for RT Jones in St. Louis. "Everybody expected Roundup to be lower until they get the new generation out." Monsanto raised its 2006 forecast, saying it expects adjusted earnings of $2.35 to $2.50 a share, up from its previous forecast of $2.34 a share.

The deal could pull Solutia from bankruptcy and restore it to Monsanto. Shares of Monsanto rose 5 percent, also bolstered by news that the company was lifting its outlook for quarterly operating earnings. Monsanto's commitment to add up to $250 million to Solutia comes on top of more than $600 million already spent or set aside by Monsanto for Solutia-related concerns over the last two years. Monsanto spun off its chemicals businesses into Solutia in 1997. The money is earmarked to clean up pollution at old chemical plant sites, satisfy legal claims against Solutia and partially provide medical, disability and life insurance benefits for retirees. The agreement must be approved by the bankruptcy court. Also yesterday, Monsanto cut its forecast for third-quarter net earnings per share because of the costs of its recent purchases of Seminis , the fruit and vegetable company, and the Emergent Genetics cotton seed company. For the quarter ending in May, the company expects net earnings in a range of 12 cents to 17 cents a share, down from a previous estimate of 15 cents to 22 cents a share, the company said. But the company said it expected operating earnings of about $1.05 a share, up from a previous estimate of about $1.

Advertisement The company said profit rose to $373 million, or $1.37 a share, for the quarter that ended in February, from $154 million, or 57 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.32 a share, according to Reuters estimates. Monsanto said results were helped by a 35 percent increase in revenue from its seeds and gene technology business, which makes plants resistant to herbicide and insects. Monsanto also had a 17 percent gain in sales in its agricultural productivity segment, which includes Roundup herbicides and other herbicide products. Over all, net sales increased 27 percent, to $1.9 billion, in the second quarter. The results included after-tax restructuring charges of $6 million, or 2 cents a share, and income on discontinued operations of $2 million, or 1 cent a share, associated with the planned sale of the company's environmental technologies businesses. Expenses were slightly higher at $127 million for the quarter, in part because of Monsanto's expansion of its seeds business. The company bought the North American canola seed businesses of Advanta Seeds last year, as well as the Channel Bio Corporation, which is now part of Monsanto's American Seeds subsidiary. The company also recently bought Emergent Genetics to increase its presence in the cotton market. Monsanto has particular strength in soybeans, with market share estimated at more than 80 percent of United States soybean acreage. The company, which is based in St. Louis, reiterated its forecast, given last week, that profit for the year would be $2 to $2.05 a share. In a conference call with analysts and news media, Terry Crews, chief financial officer of Monsanto, cited strength in the United States as well as opportunities in Latin America and better-than-expected performance in Europe, Africa and Asia. But he warned that Monsanto was facing many unknowns, including potential liability in the bankruptcy of a former affiliate, Solutia, and uncertainty about the ability to collect fees for biotech soybean seeds in some Latin American markets. Shares of Monsanto rose 77 cents, to $61.75.</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/25/business/25seed.html?ref=monsantocompany">Monsanto Buying Leader in Fruit and Vegetable Seeds<date>Published: January 25, 2005</date><text>n at least a temporary diversification away from genetically modified crops, Monsanto, the agribusiness company, agreed yesterday to pay about $1 billion to acquire Seminis, the world's largest producer of fruit and vegetable seeds. Until now, Monsanto has focused on corn, soybeans and cotton seeds, and on using genetic engineering to produce crops that are resistant to herbicides and insects. But executives said yesterday that Monsanto would develop new vegetable varieties using conventional breeding. They said the fruit and vegetable seed business could grow without biotechnology, based on a consumer movement toward healthier diets. "It's fine to dream, but you have to decide what you're going to do tomorrow morning," Monsanto's chief executive, Hugh Grant, said about biotech fruits and vegetables during a conference call with analysts. "In the long term, there may be opportunities in biotech." Some genetically engineered papaya and squash are on the market. The first biotech crop to be commercialized was the Flavr Savr tomato, developed by a biotechnology start-up that Monsanto acquired. But that tomato did not catch on. Now industry executives say it is difficult to bring new biotech fruits and vegetables to market because of consumer resistance. Also, fruits and vegetables are small crops, making it difficult to recoup development and regulatory costs. A few years ago, Monsanto decided to focus its biotech efforts on major crops. The acquisition comes as Monsanto has been shifting its business from agricultural chemicals to seeds and biotechnology. Over the last decade, it has aggressively acquired seed companies, mainly in the corn and soy business, igniting some concerns that the markets were becoming too concentrated. The new acquisition not only makes Monsanto the largest supplier of vegetable seeds in the world, but also, according to the company's calculations, the largest seed and biotech company over all. It would surpass DuPont, which owns the corn seed giant Pioneer Hi-Bred, in terms of revenues derived from seeds and biotech traits. Seminis, based in Oxnard, Calif., had sales last year of $526 million, with its leading products being tomato, cucumber, beans and pepper seeds. Its main brands are Seminis, Asgrow, Petoseed and Royal Sluis and it sells mainly to farmers, not gardeners. But, with partners, it has recently started to develop some consumer items, like the Bambino miniature watermelon and Lettuce Jammers, lettuce in the shape of a taco shell. Its main rivals in fruit and vegetable seeds are Syngenta of Switzerland and Limagrain of France. Less than 1 percent of Seminis's sales come from genetically modified seeds. Under the deal, Monsanto will pay about $1 billion in cash and assume $400 million in debt. It might also pay an additional sum of up to $125 million by the end of fiscal year 2007 based on the performance of Seminis. Seminis was started in 1994 by a Mexican entrepreneur, Alfonso Romo Garza, who decided to create a giant vegetable seed company by acquiring smaller ones. The company went public in 1999 at $15 a share, though Savia, a Mexican company affiliated with Mr. Romo, retained majority ownership. But the company suffered severe losses and in 2003, majority control was acquired for $3.78 a share by Fox Paine &amp; Company, a buyout firm. Fox Paine, based in Foster City, Calif., paid $163 million for what is now a 58 percent stake in Seminis. New management helped spur growth and restore profits before special charges. Based on the $1 billion Monsanto is paying, Fox Paine will get about $580 million, the president and co-founder, Dexter Paine, said. Shares of Monsanto, which have nearly doubled in the last year, fell $3.62, or 6 percent, yesterday to $54.10, as investors seemed to be surprised by the size and price of the deal. "I think the market was expecting strategic acquisitions of the bolt-on variety," like small corn-seed companies, said Kevin McCarthy, analyst at Banc of America Securities. "This deal is clearly in a different league." Frank Mitsch, analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners, pointing to how much the price of Seminis has risen since Fox Paine bought it in 2003, said, "It does make one step back and wonder as to why this transaction didn't occur 18 months ago." Monsanto has said that sales of its genetically modified soy, corn and cotton continue to grow, but that it has had trouble expanding genetic engineering to other crops. It dropped an effort to introduce genetically modified wheat last year after some American farmers said such an introduction might hurt exports. And its genetically modified grass for golf courses has run into opposition from environmental groups. With fruits and vegetables, it said, it will analyze genes in the crops to speed conventional breeding of improved varieties but would refrain for now from putting new genes into the crops.</text></article>

LOUIS, Jan. 13 (AP) - A Brazilian court has temporarily halted royalty payments to the Monsanto Company by a farmers' group using the company's herbicide-resistant soy seed. The ruling applies only to a group of 8,700 growers in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's third-largest soy-producing state. Most of its soybeans come from genetically modified seeds. The farmers' group asserted that Monsanto should be permitted to charge royalties only on its seeds, not on the amount of soy produced. In Brazil, selling genetically modified seeds is illegal, but farmers can plant seeds that they have. Growers have used Monsanto seeds smuggled from other countries and saved seed from their harvests to plant the next year, without paying royalties. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, said it would not comment until it had been officially notified.</text></article>

Monsanto said the Justice Department investigated whether a former manager directed an outside consultant to make a $50,000 bribe to an Indonesian government official in 2002. The bribe was meant to influence an Indonesian official to repeal or amend an unfavorable decree requiring an environmental impact study before authorization was granted to allow cultivation of genetically modified crops by Monsanto, the company and the Justice Department said. Despite the bribe, the official never rescinded or altered the decree. Monsanto also said at least $700,000 in other illegal or questionable payments were made to various Indonesian government officials from 1997 to 2002.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/business/06monsanto.html?ref=monsantocompany">High Seed Sales Reduced Loss in First Quarter for Monsanto<date>Published: January 6, 2005</date><text>y Reuters The Monsanto Company posted a narrower quarterly loss yesterday on higher seed sales as the company struggled with stiff competition and looming legal liabilities. Monsanto said that its net loss for the first quarter, ended Nov. 30, narrowed to $40 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $97 million, or 37 cents, in the quarter a year ago. An analyst at Fulcrum Global Partners, Frank Mitsch, said the results offered little news. Monsanto said that sales in the seed and biotech businesses rose 20 percent in the quarter. Total net sales for the quarter grew 7 percent, to $1.09 billion, higher than analysts' expectations for $1.06 billion. The gain came largely from strong sales of corn seed in Europe and Brazil and stronger sales of genetically modified corn and soybean seeds in the United States and biotech cotton in Australia. Monsanto said the results were an indication that it was on track for 2005 net earnings. "The signs so far indicate we are advancing as we'd hoped," the chief financial officer, Terry Crews, said in a conference call. "The first quarter is a great start in the right direction." Competition has eroded Monsanto's dominance in the herbicide business, and the company, based in St. Louis, has been focusing revenue growth efforts in the seeds market, for both conventional and genetically modified crops. Monsanto's bioengineered traits help farmers protect crops from weeds, insects and disease. Results in the latest quarter included a $284 million charge, or $181 million after tax, for liabilities tied to Monsanto's former affiliate, Solutia Inc., a chemical concern in bankruptcy protection. Last month, the company said the reserve would be in the range of $285 million. The first-quarter results also included a tax benefit of $106 million from losses incurred in a European wheat and barley business that the company has been winding down.</text></article>

Monsanto said it expected a loss of 16 cents a share in the first quarter. Excluding the reserve, Monsanto raised its outlook for the quarter to earnings of 13 cents a share, up from its previous expectation of break-even to 4 cents. For the year, Monsanto increased its earnings guidance to $1.56 to $1.71 a share. Monsanto will report results for the first quarter on Jan. 5. Monsanto said it expected to book a reserve of about $285 million before taxes in anticipation of certain legal and environmental liabilities reverting to Pharmacia -- and by extension, to Monsanto. Monsanto cautioned that the costs may differ from its estimate. Solutia, based in St. Louis, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a year ago, citing its struggles under heavy financial obligations assigned to it when the company was spun off by Monsanto in 1997. Since then, Solutia, which makes nylon products, films for safety glass, water-treatment chemicals and industrial fluids, has been responsible for retiree benefits, environmental and litigation costs accrued by Monsanto and Pharmacia from more than a century of manufacturing. In 1999, Monsanto, also based in St. Louis, was acquired by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn to create the Pharmacia Corporation, which in 2002 completed a spinoff of its biotechnology and agricultural businesses to form the current Monsanto. Pharmacia was acquired by Pfizer in April 2003. Shares of Monsanto rose $1.05, to $52.49.</text></article>

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/03/national/03creek.html?ref=monsantocompany">Toxic Paint Muddies a Beloved Creek<date>Published: October 3, 2004</date><text>EWISTOWN, Mont. - Big Spring Creek rises up out of the prairie at the cottonwood-tree-shaded state fish hatchery a few miles outside this agricultural hamlet. It oxbows several miles through farmland and pine-studded bluffs and into town, through neighborhoods and downtown. The deep, clear creek also flows through the center of life here. The water is piped without treatment into the faucets of city residents, fishermen come from around the country to drop flies into its pools, children and adults float the stream in inner tubes, and a local tavern has a hole in the floor a few steps from the bar which allows patrons to watch swimming fish while they drink. "Lewistown wouldn't be here if it weren't for Big Spring Creek," said Torger Oaas, a local lawyer. That is why high levels of toxic PCB's found in the stream and their unlikely source have sent a ripple of shock through this central Montana town of 4,000. PCB's were first discovered in the stream in the early 1990's, but at low levels. An advisory was placed on eating fish. But after an old industrial site at Brewery Flats, which officials thought was the likely source, was cleaned up, they kept finding PCB's. Last year, they started sampling above the flats, which no one had thought to do before. "The levels got higher and higher the closer you got to the hatchery," said Don Skaar, a pollution control biologist with the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. "We sampled fish right below the hatchery and they had levels 30 times the 'no eat' levels. It was totally out of the blue.'' The problem turned out to be the blue-green paint that was used on the walls of the hatchery. Since the 1960's the paint, with high levels of PCB's that were added to make it more elastic, has been flaking off the concrete walls at the hatchery, washing downstream and accumulating in a toxic layer of sediment, a foot below the creek bottom in some places. PCB's were classified as a "probable carcinogen" by the federal government and banned in 1977. The walls of the hatchery here were painted in 1959. Fish, Wildlife and Parks, which owns the hatchery, has drained and closed the raceways. Workers killed nearly three-quarters of a million young fish, tainted by the toxic paint, by herding them into a small area and adding lethal levels of a tranquilizer to the water. They also posted a "do no eat" order for all fish taken from the stream, which are not hatchery fish but have been contaminated by paint flakes there. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently took blood from more than a hundred local residents to test PCB levels. Results are due in October. The sudden appearance of a snake in what many thought of as Eden has been unsettling. "When we moved here in 1985 my boy caught a big brown trout before we unloaded the truck,'' said Marty Paulson, a retired mail carrier. Big Spring Creek forms the back boundary of his yard. Every so often, Mr. Paulson said, he would catch a fish from his yard, clean it, roll it in corn flour and fry it up for dinner. No more. "The last fish I caught was ugly,'' he said, shaking his head. "It had a big head, a skinny little body and was green. I lost my appetite." The "do not eat" warning did not worry several fly fishermen who were casting flies into Big Spring Creek recently. Some had not seen the small signs warning against eating the fish. Others released all of their catch. One said he did not care. "If I ate 10 fish a day for 40 years I guess I might be dead," Richard Hansen, an insurance adjuster from Lewistown, said with a shrug as he walked down a dirt road clad in tight brown neoprene waders. "Otherwise it's not a big deal." But nearby property owners think it is big deal. "What does it do to my property value?" asked Bill Haugen, a general contractor whose backyard lawn rolls down to the stream. "It adds doubt." Both Mr. Haugen and Mr. Paulson are part of a class-action lawsuit against the state and the Monsanto Company, which made the paint, and are represented by Mr. Oaas. They want the creek back the way it was, which would probably mean dredging the bottom, especially near the hatchery. The fish, on the other hand, may have high PCB levels for five years or more. A lawyer representing Monsanto did not return calls seeking comment. There was considerable talk about the PCB's at the Montana Tavern, on Lewistown's Main Street, which has an unusual connection to the stream. The creek runs under the streets of downtown Lewistown for three blocks or so before it emerges into the open. There is a wooden box with a plexiglass top over a hole in the tavern floor that looks down on the stream, where a spotlight illuminates the long sleek bodies of trout. Jim Awbery, the bar's owner, said his son once caught a six-pound brown trout in the hole. Mr. Awbery said people had come from all over to see the bar with a trout stream underneath. And PCB's or not, he said, "they'll keep coming."</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/21/business/21grass.html?ref=monsantocompany">Genes From Engineered Grass Spread for Miles, Study Finds<date>Published: September 21, 2004</date><text>new study shows that genes from genetically engineered grass can spread much farther than previously known, a finding that raises questions about the straying of other plants altered through biotechnology and that could hurt the efforts of two companies to win approval for the first bioengineered grass. The two companies, Monsanto and Scotts, have developed a strain of creeping bentgrass for use on golf courses that is resistant to the widely used herbicide Roundup. The altered plants would allow groundskeepers to spray the herbicide on their greens and fairways to kill weeds while leaving the grass unscathed. But the companies' plans have been opposed by some environmental groups as well as by the federal Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Critics worry that the grass could spread to areas where it is not wanted or transfer its herbicide resistance to weedy relatives, creating superweeds that would be immune to the most widely used weed killer. The Forest Service said earlier this year that the grass "has the potential to adversely impact all 175 national forests and grasslands." Some scientists said the new results, to be published online this week by the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, did not necessarily raise alarms about existing genetically modified crops like soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. There are special circumstances, they say, that make the creeping bentgrass more environmentally worrisome, like its extraordinarily light pollen. Because Scotts has plans to develop other varieties of bioengineered grasses for use on household lawns, the new findings could have implications well beyond the golf course. And the study suggests that some previous studies of the environmental impact of genetically modified plants have been too small to capture the full spread of altered genes. Scotts says that because naturally occurring bentgrass has not caused major weed problems, the bioengineered version would pose no new hazards. And any Roundup-resistant strains that might somehow develop outside of intentionally planted areas could be treated with other weed killers, the company said. In the new study, scientists with the Environmental Protection Agency found that the genetically engineered bentgrass pollinated test plants of the same species as far away as they measured -about 13 miles downwind from a test farm in Oregon. Natural growths of wild grass of a different species were pollinated by the gene-modified grass nearly nine miles away. Previous studies had measured pollination between various types of genetically modified plants and wild relatives at no more than about one mile, according to the paper. "It's the longest distance gene-flow study that I know of," said Norman C. Ellstrand, an expert on this subject at the University of California, Riverside, who was not involved in the study but read the paper. "The gene really is essentially going to get out," he added. "What this study shows is it's going to get out a lot faster and a lot further than people anticipated." One reason the grass pollen was detected so far downwind was the size of the farm - 400 acres with thousands of plants. Most previous studies of gene flow have been done on far smaller fields, meaning there was less pollen and a lower chance that some would travel long distances. Those small studies, the new findings suggest, might not accurately reflect what would happen once a plant covers a large area. "This is one of the first really realistic studies that has been done," said Joseph K. Wipff, an Oregon grass breeder. Dr. Wipff was not involved in the latest study but had conducted an earlier one that found pollen from genetically engineered grass traveling only about 1,400 feet. That test, though, used less than 300 plants covering one-tenth of an acre. The effort to commercialize the bentgrass has attracted attention because it raises issues somewhat different from those surrounding the existing genetically modified crops.

The decision will allow the importation and sale of Roundup Ready Corn 2 feed corn, but not its cultivation.''Europe's decision on Monday represents definite progress,'' said Lee Quarles, public affairs manager at Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis. ''We haven't seen action out of the European Union since 1998.''But the Bush administration said the decision would not deter it from pursuing its case against the European Union at the World Trade Organization, said Richard Mills, the spokesman for the United States trade representative.''Our bottom line is Europe needs to have a predictable, timely, transparent and science-based regulatory system for biotech products,'' Mr. Mills said.Europeans are far more suspicious of genetically modified food than Americans, and they consider the issue one of safety rather than free trade. European consumers have protested what they call ''frankenfoods'' and have said that American multinationals cannot force them to accept a product they consider unsafe for human consumption or for the environment.The European Union has sought to ease consumer fears by passing stringent labeling rules in April to ensure that no one unknowingly purchases genetically modified food.Margot WallstrÃ¶m, the top European official for the environment, who made the announcement on Monday, said in a statement that the corn, known as NK603 maize, had been rigorously tested and was considered ''as safe as any conventional maize.''''Clear labeling provides farmer and consumers the information they need to decide whether to buy the product or not,'' she said.She also underscored that the corn would be easily traced following the strict new rules.Syngenta, the Swiss biotechnology company, won approval in May to sell a genetically modified sweet corn in the European Union, which does not include Switzerland.Neither corn was approved for cultivation in Europe, where officials fear that sowing the seeds of biogenetically engineered crops will ruin the diversity of their plants and cause environmental damage.</text></article>

On Wall Street, the shares rose to the highest level in three years.Monsanto's net income increased 45 percent, to $252 million, or 93 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended May 31, compared with $174 million, or 66 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. The results surpassed analysts' expectations of 85 cents. Monsanto last week forecast earnings at 90 cents a share.Revenue was up 14 percent, to $1.68 billion from $1.47 billion a year earlier.The planting of biotechnology crops is hotly debated and opposition is stiff in many parts of the world. But farmers in the United States have embraced genetically modified soybeans, and new Monsanto corn seed and other products are making inroads both domestically and abroad, the company says.The chairman of Monsanto, Hugh Grant, said the company was pushing forward with new biotechnology products, including a variety of corn that has been modified to protect against insects. The corn has recently received approval in Japan and will be introduced in the United States next year.Mr. Grant reiterated that the increasing focus on bioengineered-seeds businesses was expected to result in compound annual earnings growth of 10 percent a share in 2005 and 2006. ''That is really the main driver for our future growth,'' he said.To capitalize on the popularity of its biotechnology crops, Mr. Grant said that Monsanto would raise prices next year for certain Roundup Ready soybeans by $4 to $5 an acre and by $2 an acre for Roundup Ready corn.The company also said its quarterly results benefited from a reduced tax rate, to 24 percent from 33 percent, after resolution of several matters with the Internal Revenue Service.Monsanto's stock rose $1.30 yesterday, to close at $38.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article>

The company also said it expected to break even results or a slight loss in the fourth quarter, as customers shift to buying cheaper products in its Roundup herbicide line. Farmers typically spray Roundup in the fourth quarter, which began on June 1. The company expects the shift in its Roundup product mix to continue into fiscal 2005, but it still expects to meet its growth rate goals of 10 percent from its ongoing business for the year. For the third quarter ended May 31, Monsanto forecast earnings of about 90 cents a share.</text></article>

The court said Monsanto was not entitled to profits earned by the farmer, Percy Schmeiser, from his genetically modified crop because he had not financially benefited from the plants' engineered ability to withstand Monsanto's herbicide Roundup.Mr. Schmeiser and his supporters, including numerous farm and environmental groups, expressed disappointment that the court had confirmed Monsanto's right to patent a plant gene and control its use by farmers.''It's not nearly the victory that we were looking for,'' Mr. Schmeiser said at a news conference in Saskatoon.Pat Mooney, executive director of ETC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said the ruling suggested that ''wherever a gene wanders, it's under Monsanto's control.''But a patent law expert, Eileen McMahon, a partner at the Toronto law firm Torys, hailed the ruling as ''a fantastic decision in terms of biotechnology and patents.'' According to Ms. McMahon, ''we have a strong signal that cells and genes are patentable.''Monsanto also welcomed the decision, saying in a news release that it ''has set a world standard in intellectual property protection.''While Canadian court decisions have no direct bearing on American law, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, said that the Canadian judgment could nonetheless have an impact on similar claims by Monsanto against American farmers.Almost 100 such cases have so far gone to trial in the United States, and farmers have paid penalties averaging $100,000 each to Monsanto. Mr. Kimbrell said if American courts followed the Canadian court's example in not requiring Mr. Schmeiser to repay his profits, it might reduce the economic incentive for Monsanto to pursue other farmers.The case involving Mr. Schmeiser, who is 73, had become a rallying point for critics of genetically modified plants. ''He touched upon a long-standing issue that is not resolved globally,'' said Thomas Redick, a partner at Gallop Johnson and Neuman, a law firm in St. Louis.</text></article>

''It really is a matter of lining up all the efforts together.''Ceres, a small plant biotechnology company in California that collaborates with Monsanto, also said on the conference call that it would make its information available. The donation of the data was arranged in part by the National Corn Growers Association, which is also pushing for a project to sequence the corn genome.Academic scientists welcomed the decision, saying that the amount of corn gene sequences that will be put into the public domain by the companies vastly exceeds the amount that is there now.''For the public sector it will be a very valuable asset,'' said Joachim Messing, a professor at Rutgers University who has been active in government-financed projects to determine corn genes. ''We have been trying to persuade the companies to do that and it has been very difficult in the past.''The change of heart by the companies could reflect changing priorities in the agricultural biotechnology industry. A few years ago the companies, commanding budgets that public-sector scientists envied, were far ahead in the search for genetic information on important crops. But in the last few years the government has been financing gene sequencing projects for crops, helping the public sector catch up.Much of the information the companies developed is about specific genes, and the companies are believed to have already filed for patents on some of the information they are now making publicly available.</text></article>

Monsanto said it had reached a preliminary agreement with farm associations in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, the only state where genetically modified soy is widely grown. The farmers' associations said they were still working out final details, but in principle agreed to pay royalties. The deal foresees royalties of 20 reais ($7) per metric ton for the 2004 and 2005 harvests. For crops just harvested, the charge would be as low as 10 reais ($3.50) a metric ton, Monsanto said. For years, the company complained that farmers in the state were using seeds developed with its Roundup Ready technology without paying royalties. The seeds were initially smuggled from Argentina.

The allocation, beginning March 1, is expected to last all year.A Monsanto spokeswoman, Janice Armstrong, said the cutback came after a Food and Drug Administration inspection in November of the factory at which the product was made. The F.D.A. found that more batches of hormone than expected were failing the factory's quality control tests, she said.Although those batches were not sold, Ms. Armstrong said, the factory, which is in Austria and is owned by Sandoz, must make changes to correct the problems, cutting into output.The growth hormone, known as bovine somatotropin and sold under the name Posilac, is used in 22 percent of the nation's dairy cows, according to a 2002 survey by the Department of Agriculture. Injected once every two weeks, the hormone can increase a cow's milk output by 10 percent to 15 percent, according to the company and to farmers.The product, which has been sold in the United States since 1994, has not been approved in Canada and Europe, primarily because it can cause health problems in cows. The F.D.A. has said that milk from cows treated with the hormone is indistinguishable from milk from untreated cows.The shortage of growth hormone could tighten supplies of milk a bit, and milk futures prices surged last week in response. Steven A. Larson, managing editor of Hoard's Dairyman, a trade publication, said, however, that the Posilac cutback ''would be pretty far down the list'' of factors determining milk supply.Lloyd Holterman, a dairy farmer in Watertown, Wis., said that although the cutback would hurt his milk output, the rise in milk prices would offset that. ''We like the high price, so I can't be totally negative,'' he said.Monsanto, which is the only supplier of the hormone, told customers in December that it would cut supplies by 15 percent. But the company now says the manufacturing changes will have a greater effect on output than it initially thought.Monsanto has shifted some production of the main ingredient to a new $180 million factory in Augusta, Ga., but that factory has not received approval to make the final product.Monsanto, based in St. Louis, also told farmers last week that it was increasing the price of Posilac by 9 percent. It said the increase, the first for the product, was independent of the supply shortfall.Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of the Center for Food Safety, a Washington group that has tried to have the hormone removed from the market, called the production cutbacks ''good news for dairy cows and good news for consumers, though obviously a body blow to Monsanto.''But Kevin W. McCarthy, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, said Monsanto would not be hurt much because Posilac, even before the cutbacks, accounted for what he estimates at $250 million to $300 million in annual sales, or about 5 percent of the company's expected total this year.''I don't think this is a business investors are particularly focused on, nor should they be,'' said Mr. McCarthy, whose firm has done investment banking for Monsanto. Monsanto does not break out sales of Posilac.</text></article>

The nearly $5.5 billion earned from soy exports in the first three quarters of last year gave the economy a much-needed lift as it gradually recovers from a four-year recession that led to a default and a currency devaluation in 2002.Land planted in soy has tripled over the last decade to nearly 32 million acres in 2003, spurred partly by the huge productivity gains farmers have made by using seeds genetically modified by Monsanto to resist its Roundup Ready herbicide.But instead of buying seeds from Monsanto each year, farmers can cull seeds from their crop and save them for replanting, without harming harvest yields. Monsanto, based in St. Louis, estimated that more than half the transgenic seeds planted in Argentina in the October-November planting season were bought on the parallel market, compared with a fifth three years ago.Some analysts say the rapidly growing black-market trade -- oddly enough, called ''bolsa blanca,'' which in Spanish can mean either ''white market'' or ''white bag,'' for the white, unlabeled sacks farmers stash culled seeds in -- has pared Monsanto's Argentine revenues from $580 million in 2001 to $300 million in 2002.Although the company, which does not break out sales figures for Argentina, says such claims are exaggerated, its executives acknowledge that the damage is severe.''It has come to the point where it is impossible even to cover our costs,'' said Federico Ovejero, a Monsanto official in Argentina, explaining the decision to suspend sales and research and development in the country.Monsanto could resume selling soybean seeds, he said, if the government ensured renewed enforcement of the law, guaranteeing ''a fair return'' for seed producers.Soy-related products accounted for 15 to 18 percent of Monsanto's sales in Argentina last year, but analysts said the company's soy business would double in value if farmers did not use culled seeds.</text></article>

Sippel of Federal District Court in St. Louis, said at a court hearing on Thursday that he had been unaware that in 1997 and 1998, before his appointment as a federal judge, he was listed in court records as a lawyer representing Monsanto in a civil lawsuit at the same federal courthouse.Judge Sippel said that despite being a lawyer of record, he did no work on the earlier Monsanto case. He also said he had no bias in the continuing price-fixing case.''I have no horse in this race,'' Judge Sippel said in the court hearing, according to The Associated Press. ''I honestly don't care which party in this case prevails.''Lawyers representing a group of farmers who have accused Monsanto and other big seed companies of fixing the prices of genetically modified seeds asked Judge Sippel in December to recuse himself because the earlier case was substantially related to the price-fixing case. They asserted that he could have had access to information in that case.According to court papers unsealed on Thursday, lawyers representing farmers in their price-fixing case against Monsanto said the two cases were closely related and that documents in the price-fixing case show that in 1997, Monsanto offered to settle the earlier case in exchange for a pricing agreement.The lawyers said that Judge Sippel never disclosed that while working as a lawyer for Husch &amp; Eppenberger, a large St. Louis law firm, he was listed for five months as one of three lawyers representing Monsanto in the earlier dispute, which was with Pioneer Hi-Bred, another big seed company that is also a party in the price-fixing case.According to court records, Husch &amp; Eppenberger has done legal work for Monsanto in dozens of cases over the last decade, including many cases now before Judge Sippel.Legal experts say that if Judge Sippel had been part of the earlier case, he should have disclosed the relationship, though failing to do so probably did not violate the judicial code of conduct for federal judges because the two Monsanto cases are not identical.</text></article>

Sippel, was chosen by his law firm, now known as Husch &amp; Eppenberger, as one of three lawyers to represent Monsanto in a civil lawsuit against Pioneer Hi-Bred International, another big seed company.The chairman of Husch &amp; Eppenberger acknowledged that Judge Sippel was listed in court papers for five months as one of the main lawyers for Monsanto in that suit, but he said that Judge Sippel never actually did any work on the case.The chairman, Joseph P. Conran, also said that Judge Sippel never did any work for Monsanto, one of the biggest clients of the 300-lawyer firm, when he worked there.Legal experts say Judge Sippel probably did not violate the Judicial Code of Conduct for United States judges but that he should have disclosed his prior relationship with Monsanto to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest in the case.''The fact that he didn't disclose it is troubling,'' said Deborah Rhode, a professor of law at Stanford University. ''Courts are supposed to avoid the appearance of impropriety.''Professor Rhode and other legal experts also said that while Judge Sippel might not have billed Monsanto for work, his listing as a Monsanto lawyer suggested he still might have had access to confidential information and could have served as an adviser in the case.Judge Sippel was the vice chairman of the litigation committee at Husch &amp; Eppenberger at the time he was listed in the federal court docket as a lawyer representing Monsanto.The Judicial Code of Conduct says that ''a judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which: the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.''</text></article>

Monsanto also said the companies discussed prices, but added that they were engaged in legitimate negotiations about changes to an existing licensing agreement, not illegal price fixing.Interviews with former and current executives of major seed companies, along with company documents, however, show that through much of the 1990's Monsanto tried to control the market for genetically altered corn and soybean seeds. Monsanto spent billions in the 1980's to invent specialized seeds and sold the rights to make them to big seed companies like Pioneer.More than a dozen legal experts contacted by The New York Times say that if the goal of the talks between the rivals was to limit competition on prices, they would have violated antitrust laws.The talks, which occurred from 1995 to 1999, involved licenses that let Pioneer sell altered seeds developed by Monsanto, which is based here. In those talks, according to interviews with dozens of executives and court and other documents, the companies discussed prices, swapped profit projections and even talked about cooperating to keep the prices of genetically modified seeds high.The talks involved top executives at both companies, including Robert B. Shapiro, then Monsanto's chief executive, and Charles S. Johnson, then Pioneer's chief executive, as well as Richard McConnell, now president of Pioneer, and Robert T. Fraley, now Monsanto's chief technology officer, according to company officials and documents. Together, Pioneer and Monsanto control about 60 percent of the nation's $5 billion market for corn and soybean seeds.Also in the late 1990's, Monsanto pressured at least two other big seed companies to coordinate their retail pricing strategies with Monsanto's, former chief executives at those companies said. The executives, who ran Novartis Seeds and Mycogen, said they rejected Monsanto's entreaties as anticompetitive and potentially illegal.</text></article>

When Monsanto, which holds the patent, learned what Mr. McFarling had sown, it sued him in federal court in St. Louis for patent infringement and was awarded $780,000.The company calls the planting of saved seed piracy, and it says it has won millions of dollars from farmers in lawsuits and settlements in such cases. Mr. McFarling's is the first to reach a federal appeals court, which will consider how the law should reconcile patented food with a practice as old as farming itself.If the appeals court rules against him, said Mr. McFarling, 61, he will be forced into bankruptcy and early retirement.''It doesn't look right for them to have a patent on something that you can grow yourself,'' he said.Janice Armstrong, a Monsanto spokeswoman, said the company invested hundreds of millions of dollars to develop the seed. ''We need to protect our intellectual property so that we can continue to develop the next wave of products,'' she said.Were farmers allowed to replant the seed, the company said in its appeals court brief, ''Monsanto would effectively, and rapidly, lose control of its rights.''That is because one bag of the patented seed can produce about 36 bags of seed for use in the next growing season. The number grows exponentially. By the third season, the single bag of seed could generate almost 50,000 bags.Ms. Armstrong said that there are about 300,000 soybean farmers in the United States, and that Monsanto has disputes with only about 100 of them a year. Most disputes are resolved quickly and informally, she said.Farmers here said the company's efforts to investigate the replanting of saved seeds have been intrusive, divisive and heavy-handed.''They hired the whole city of Tupelo's night police force,'' said Mitchell Scruggs, 54, who is a defendant in another saved-seed lawsuit. ''They bought a lot across the street from me for surveillance. They're spending all this money on airplanes, helicopters, detectives, lawyers.''</text></article>

Rather, it said, the move was part of a broader overhaul announced yesterday that would result in layoffs of 7 to 9 percent of its work force, or as many as 1,200 people.Scientists are experimenting with putting genes into plants that cause the plants to produce proteins for use as drugs, like growth hormone or various monoclonal antibodies. This approach, called pharming or biopharming, is not done commercially yet but may prove to be cheaper than the current method of producing such drugs in genetically modified animal cells grown in vats.Pharming has attracted opposition not only from the environmental groups that usually oppose genetically modified foods, but from food companies, which worry that pharmaceutical-containing corn might wind up in corn flakes, forcing product recalls and undermining public confidence in the safety of the food supply.Such concerns were stoked by a couple of incidents last year in which pharmaceutical-containing corn developed by ProdiGene, a small biotech company, intermingled with food crops, though the problem was discovered before any of the food was eaten. Regulations have since been tightened in a way that could make it more difficult to grow pharmaceutical-containing corn -- the crop Monsanto was concentrating on -- in the Corn Belt.In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Hugh Grant, the chief executive, said that the decision was based on the ''uncertainty of the longer-term reward from a highly capital-intensive business.'' He said the company was trimming research and development spending and focusing on projects that had a nearer-term payoff.Bryan W. Hurley, a spokesman for Monsanto, said in a subsequent interview that the move was ''purely a business decision'' unrelated to the controversy. The company's plant-based pharmaceutical division, known as Monsanto Protein Technologies, employed about 70 people.Monsanto remains committed to genetically modified crops, he said. The company is suffering from generic competition to its Roundup herbicide and is focusing more than ever on seeds and biotechnology.The company said yesterday that it would trim its work force, largely in the agricultural chemical business. It also said that it would exit the European breeding and seed business for wheat and barley, though it will continue to develop genetically engineered wheat resistant to its Roundup herbicide.It announced a loss for its fourth quarter of $188 million, or 72 cents a share, largely because of a settlement of a lawsuit tied to decades-old pollution in Alabama. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $1.31 billion.</text></article>
