That includes the water that goes into irrigating the cotton crop, stitching the jeans together and washing them scores of times at home.The company wants to reduce that number any way it can, and not just to project environmental responsibility. It fears that water shortages caused by climate change may jeopardize the company’s very existence in the coming decades by making cotton too expensive or scarce. So to protect its bottom line, Levi Strauss has helped underwrite and champion a nonprofit program that teaches farmers in India, Pakistan, Brazil and West and Central Africa the latest irrigation and rainwater-capture techniques.  It has introduced a brand featuring stone-washed denim smoothed with rocks but no water. It is sewing tags into all of its jeans urging customers to wash less and use only cold water. To customers seeking further advice, Levi Strauss suggests washing jeans rarely, if at all — the theory being that putting them in the freezer will kill germs that cause them to smell. Conservation worries are not limited to the clothing giants: food and beverage conglomerates, tobacco companies and metal and mining companies are all starting to reckon with their heavy dependence on water. Pepsico, for example, has embraced a method of sanitizing plastic bottles with purified air instead of water at a plant in Georgia. For its Frito-Lay brands, it has identified drought-resistant potato strains that it provides to farmers along with a soil-monitoring method so that crops are watered only when necessary. The Carbon Disclosure Project, a group that monitors corporations’ greenhouse gas emissions, recently added water security to its priorities. Of the 150 companies that responded last year to a questionnaire that it sent to the world’s largest corporations, nearly 40 percent reported that water problems had already resulted in “detrimental impacts” to their businesses. The threat of water shortages was brought home to Levi Strauss last year when floods in Pakistan and parched fields in China destroyed cotton crops and sent prices soaring. Roughly two pounds of cotton go into every pair of jeans that the company manufactures. Although scientists are wary of linking specific extreme weather events to climate change, recent increases in floods and droughts are in line with patterns that experts have long projected would result from global warming. The general rule of thumb is that wet regions will get wetter and dry regions will become even more arid. Upmanu Lall, director of the Columbia Water Center at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, said that the local implications of those changes were still being sorted out but that “agriculture, which does best with a relatively consistent supply of water, will be impacted the most.”   That is particularly the case for cotton, the world’s biggest nonfood crop. Many big cotton-producing countries like India, which has tens of thousands of small cotton farmers, lack the reservoirs to store water, heightening the risk of shortages. Companies doing business overseas are also contending with rising water costs or water that is not clean enough. Then there is the threat of bad publicity if a corporation is perceived to be squandering precious local water. “The total volume of water used by a single beverage business, for example, may not be much,” Dr. Lall said. “But they are often the most visible users in a locality, depleting groundwater much more quickly than, say, a small farmer.” It is not lost on American and European manufacturers that cotton already competes with grain for what arable land exists in some regions, a tension that will only grow as the world seeks to feed its growing population in coming decades. Making ‘Better Cotton’ Because cotton is mostly grown by a diffuse network of very small farmers in more than 70 countries, encouraging water-efficient practices is a formidable challenge. Cotton cultivation accounts for more than 3 percent of the world’s agricultural water use and 6 percent of all pesticide purchases. Outmoded practices like field flooding contribute to overconsumption. In 2005, nongovernmental and cotton industry organizations and some giant retailers, including Ikea, the Gap and Adidas, founded the international nonprofit Better Cotton Initiative to promote water conservation and reduce pesticide use and child-labor practices in the industry. Levi Strauss joined in 2009. Partners include groups like Cotton Inc., an American industry association that has provided technical know-how. A three-year independent study of Indian farms found those adopting the new techniques reduced water and pesticide use by an average of 32 percent, the initiative says. The profit was 20 percent higher than that of a control group using traditional methods. 1 2 Next Page » Sruthi Gottipati contributed reporting from Shelu, India.SAN FRANCISCO   —  From the cotton field in rural India to the local rag bin, a typical pair of blue jeans consumes 919 gallons of water during its life cycle, Levi Strauss &amp; Company says, or enough to fill about 15 spa-size bathtubs.

The complaint — by the Center for Digital Democracy, Consumer Watchdog, Consumer Action and the Praxis Project — contends that digital marketing campaigns created by PepsiCo, including the Hotel 626 and Asylum 626 Web sites and an online concert featuring Rhianna, violate federal trade law that prohibits marketers from using unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The campaigns promote the Doritos snack chips. Hotel626.com and Asylum626.com are horror-themed Web sites where users get treatment at the asylum or walk through a haunted hotel. The video promotion with Rhianna and other artists took place on the Web site doritoslatenight.com. The complaint says that the campaigns create the illusion that they are entertainment instead of advertising. It also contends that the sites do not clearly state how and to what extent the data collected on users will be shared or used. “Pepsi is really in the forefront of using digital marketing to promote its products, including its snack chip line,” said Jeffrey Chester, of the Center for Digital Democracy. “They have unabashedly targeted teens.” A spokeswoman for the F.T.C. said the commission had received a complaint and would review carefully. A representative for Frito-Lay declined to comment, saying the company had not yet seen the complaint. The groups’ accusations come as the Federal Trade Commission prepares to issue a final report on consumer privacy in the coming months. The commission also is part of an interagency panel created to analyze food marketing to children. The panel, which also includes the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Agriculture, submitted proposed voluntary guidelines for marketers in April. On Oct. 12, David C. Vladeck, the commission’s director of the bureau of consumer protection, testified at a hearing on food marketing, saying the new proposed guidelines would not include children aged 12 to 17. Marketing efforts that are philanthropic in nature, or geared towards families and general audiences and not just children, also would not be affected by the guidelines. Characters used to promote food would be unaffected, said Mr. Vladeck, who stressed that the commission would support “strong and meaningful industry self-regulation.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/x-factor-watch-most-memorable-performance-by-a-soda-pop/?ref=pepsicoinc">'X Factor' Watch: Most Memorable Performance by a Soda Pop<date>October 14, 2011, 10:21 am</date><text>And the winner of “The X Factor” is — Pepsi! Was I the only one who was distracted during Thursday night’s show by the tacky product placement? We saw performances in four different, widely separated places — Santa Barbara, the Hamptons, Malibu and France — hosted by four radically different people, i.e. the four judges. And yet at each one, the favored drink — in fact, apparently the only drink — was Pepsi. There was Simon Cowell cradling a can in France. Paula Abdul lounged with one in Santa Barbara. Yeah, I know, that’s just the way things are these days, but still. To stand out for tackiness on a show that wallows in it — that’s an achievement. Anyway, on to the singing. The 32 remaining acts have been divided into four groups (boys, girls, over-30s and groups) and parceled out among the judges for mentoring. Each judge brought the assigned eight acts to what we were told was the judge’s home. If that’s true, we can all stop worrying that the music business is hurting financially, because these places were far larger and more lavish than any home needs to be. Thursday’s show, which was delayed one night by a scheduling collision with the baseball playoffs, gave us 16 performances, along with the obligatory mini-biographies of the singers. It felt to me as if we were seeing a lot of these people for the last time; there seemed to be a fair number of weak performances in the lot. Brian Bradley, the kid rapper, was average and left me asking: How much more of what he offers does anyone want to hear? Simone Battle, who shouldn’t have even reached this round after spacing out on the lyrics of a song on an earlier show, tried to sell the Beatles’ “Help” as a ballad but was undercut by the ridiculous outfit she was wearing (think black bathing suit with a fishnet wrapped around the waist). Phillip Lomax, the Frank Sinatra knockoff, left me wondering why the world needs another Sinatra knockoff when it already has Harry Connick Jr. And, speaking of imitators, Dexter Haygood, for a former homeless guy, surely punched his ticket home with another Mick Jagger/James Brown/etc. effort on “Crazy in Love,” performed in dangerously high heels on what looked to be a cliffside at Nicole Scherzinger’s home. Also unmemorable: Nick Voss. The Brewer Boys sounded their usual tight-harmony selves, but Paula Abdul, their judge/mentor, seemed unimpressed. And Tora Woloshin, the platinum blonde with the nose jewelry, sounded great but loses points in my book for fretting, in the pre-performance video, about remembering her lyrics. Her song turned out to be the Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” one of the best-known and most-played songs of the last half-century; even a twentysomething knows those words, or ought to. The judges, by the way, sprang a surprise on their guests: each had asked a celebrity to join them and help thin the field. Ms. Abdul had Pharrell Williams, Ms. Scherzinger produced Enrique Iglesias, and L.A. Reid trotted out Rihanna (which gave Mr. Lomax the pleasure, if you can call it that, of singing one of Rihanna’s songs — ‘Don’t Stop the Music” — in front of her). Mr. Cowell was supposed to have Mariah Carey on hand but instead had to tell his singers — the “girls” group — that she couldn’t join them in France because of Hurricane Irene. Which tells us when these segments were filmed. So who sounded good on Thursday night? My choices: The Anser, singing Pink’s “Perfect,” which was — eerie! — the same song that opened this season’s other singing competition show, “The Sing-Off.” Caitlin Koch, the world’s best-looking rugby player, who sang “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” to Mr. Cowell. Drew Ryniewicz, a 14-year-old who now has to be taken seriously after a tasty rendition of “Must Have Been Love.” Stacy Francis, who sounded pretty good, if deafening, on “Purple Rain.” But somebody needs to tell this woman to stop bawling every time she finishes singing a song. Lakoda Rayne, which might have been the night’s biggest surprise. This is one of two Frankenstein’s-monster groups formed spontaneously by the judges out of audition-round also-rans. The four women were nicely in sync on “Born This Way.” But we need a constitutional amendment forbidding any further use of that tired point-at-the-sky choreography. The remaining 16 groups get their chance to point at the sky on Sunday, when the show originally slated for Thursday will be broadcast. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 14, 2011 An earlier version of this post misspelled the name of one of the show's contestants. It is Drew Ryniewicz, not Drew Ryniewiec.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/business/pepsico-plans-higher-prices-on-drinks-and-snacks.html?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo Plans Higher Prices on Drinks and Snacks<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>PepsiCo is planning to raise prices on some Gatorade sports drinks and Frito-Lay snacks in coming weeks to help offset higher commodity costs.Those increases, on top of other increases taken earlier this year, are helping the company stand by its full-year earnings growth target, despite a smaller-than-expected boost from foreign exchange rates. The company — whose brands include Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal — also reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company cited a lower tax rate and cost savings from acquisitions, which are helping it endure higher costs for commodities like corn and wheat and weak consumer spending. PepsiCo executives also sought to quell recent speculation on Wall Street about a possible breakup of the company, saying it had considered that option and did not find it to be in shareholders’ best interest. In addition to price increases put through in the third quarter, PepsiCo said it would impose more in the fourth quarter, primarily on Gatorade and single-serve bags of Frito-Lay snacks, but also on select products sold overseas. PepsiCo stood by its full-year outlook, which calls for 2011 earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate. Because of a recent strengthening of the dollar, that forecast now only includes a rise of one percentage point from foreign exchange, whereas the company earlier expected a two-point increase. PepsiCo still expects to see a rise in commodity costs this year at the high end of a $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion range. The company reported that its third-quarter net income rose to $2 billion, or $1.25 a share, from $1.92 billion, or $1.19 a share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.31 a share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue climbed to $17.58 billion from $15.51 billion a year ago. Analysts on average were expecting $17.18 billion. Total sales volume rose 8 percent in the snacks business and 4 percent in the drinks business. Volume in the Americas Foods business rose 1 percent as gains of 1 percent at Frito-Lay North America and 3.5 percent in Latin America offset a 4.5 percent decline at Quaker Foods North America. PepsiCo Americas Beverages volume was flat. Net revenue in that business rose 1.5 percent, helped by price increases. The company’s shares were up nearly 3 percent, or $1.75, to $62.70. Coca-Cola will report earnings next Tuesday.PepsiCo is planning to raise prices on some Gatorade sports drinks and Frito-Lay snacks in coming weeks to help offset higher commodity costs.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/business/pepsicos-chick-pea-plan-includes-taking-on-famine.html?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo’s Chickpea Plan Includes Taking On Famine<date>Published: September 20, 2011</date><text>PepsiCo plans to announce a new venture on Wednesday aimed at increasing its access to chickpeas, which play an increasing role in its food products, and expanding production of the crop in Ethiopia.The company’s partners, the World Food Program and the United States Agency for International Development, say the project has the potential to reduce famine in Africa over the long term. “If it works as we believe it will, it will go a long, long way towards improving nutrition and hunger there,” said Nancy E. Roman, director of public policy and private partnerships at the World Food Program. PepsiCo plans to work with farmers in Ethiopia to increase the production and quality of chickpeas, which the company needs to meet demand for its hummus products. Currently, 100,000 farmers there grow chickpeas, but not as a primary crop. The company wants to invest in better seeds and drip irrigation systems so that farmers can improve yields and grow chickpeas twice a year. The increased yield would exceed PepsiCo’s needs. So some of the additional crops will be used to make a new, ready-to-eat food product that the World Food Program has used to address famine in Pakistan. Local businesses will produce and sell that product and perhaps others based on chickpeas. The primary goal is to turn chickpeas into a major export crop for Ethiopia, as demand for them is increasing globally. “This will boost the production of chickpeas in Ethiopia, but it will also help local manufacturers produce and develop products using chickpeas and supply a steady stream for export,” said Derek Yach, a spokesman for PepsiCo. “The idea is to build value into the chain all the way up to the macroeconomic level.” Because chickpeas get much of the nitrogen they need from the air rather than from the soil, cultivating the crop improves conditions for the country’s other crops. Like PepsiCo, the World Food Program has been looking for a steady supply of chickpeas to increase production of a food called Wawa Mum, which means “Good food, Mom,” in Pashto, a language spoken in northwest Pakistan. The organization developed the product in India to address food shortages after a flood in 2008 and began working with local companies in Pakistan to produce it for that country in 2009. Expanding production to other malnourished regions, however, has proved challenging because of limited amounts of chickpeas. When Ms. Roman encountered Mr. Yach at the World Economic Forum in Dubai and heard about PepsiCo’s plans to spur the production of chickpeas for the company’s use, they began talking about going beyond that to address malnutrition and famine in a way that also would contribute to economic development. The program will not, however, have an immediate role in the famine currently devastating the Horn of Africa. “The tough reality is that crops grow as fast as they grow,” Mr. Yach said. “Some 12 million people will remain in need for years after this famine ends, though, and we might have some impact on them.”PepsiCo plans to announce a new venture on Wednesday aimed at increasing its access to chickpeas, which play an increasing role in its food products, and expanding production of the crop in Ethiopia.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/dude-this-video-game-promotion-is-sweet/?ref=pepsicoinc">Dude, This Video Game Promotion Is Sweet<date>August 24, 2011, 1:00 pm</date><text>The “dudes” who interrupt their playing of video games only for the slamming of sugared sodas –- or interrupt their slamming of sugared sodas only to play video games — have a reason to live until the fall. Activision is teaming up with the Mountain Dew soda sold by PepsiCo for a promotion for a new edition of a popular video game, which is to come out on Nov. 8. The promotion, set to begin on Oct. 10, is for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and it carries a theme in the vernacular of dude-speak: “Rank up your game.” The promotion includes rewarding drinkers of Mountain Dew with an incentive known as double experience points, which can be redeemed while playing the new game for perks like more powerful weapons. The incentive is referred to as “double XP” –- presumably to echo the shorthand of dude-speak. Also, the PepsiCo Americas Beverages unit of PepsiCo plans to bring back a limited-edition version of Mountain Dew called Mountain Dew Game Fuel –- a name that reinforces the ties between the young males who drink the soda and play video games. There will be two varieties of Game Fuel. One, cherry-citrus, was also sold in 2009. The other is a new, tropical flavor, developed with Activision to promote the new video game. Both are due out on Oct. 10. Activision is also joining with another PepsiCo division, Frito-Lay, for the introduction of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Codes to redeem the double experience points during playing of the game will be found on packages of Doritos along with packages of Mountain Dew. Mountain Dew and Doritos are the kinds of brands “that pair perfectly with Call of Duty,” Tim Ellis, chief marketing officer at Activision, said in a statement. “Through this partnership we are able to provide a very meaningful value to our passionate gamers and reward their multi-player experience,” he added. Mountain Dew has been an ardent partner of various video games. In addition to Call of Duty, they include Halo and World of Warcraft. It is about “marrying the passions” of the target audience, said Brett O’Brien, vice president of marketing for Mountain Dew at PepsiCo Americas Beverages. The promotion, in its language, tone and approach, has “a strong Dew sensibility,” he added. For those customers who are not keen to play the new game, there is an element of the promotion involving codes that can be submitted to win prizes. The promotion is indicative of the growing interest of marketers in reaching consumers who spend time in virtual worlds. Another example is a recent partnership between Dunkin’ Donuts, sold by Dunkin’ Brands, and the new Sims Social Facebook game. Agencies that are working on the promotion include three that are part of the Omnicom Group: BBDO New York, TracyLocke and Tribal DDB.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/business/media/pepsi-takes-active-role-in-x-factor.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi Takes Active Role in ‘X Factor’<date>Published: August 5, 2011</date><text>SIMON COWELL has not just switched television shows; he has switched soft drinks.“The X Factor,” a British export that will make its United States premiere on Fox on Sept. 21, is the long-awaited competitor to “American Idol” and the new home for Mr. Cowell. The show will also be a marketing centerpiece for its lead sponsor, PepsiCo, whose eternal nemesis, Coca-Cola, is the longtime sponsor of “American Idol.” As with Coke’s branding on “Idol,” Pepsi’s logos will be a regular sight on “The X Factor,” seen on the judges’ drinking cups, in banner ads and elsewhere. But Pepsi, which is spending up to $60 million for the sponsorship, is also playing an unusually active role in the show itself, and its connection to the show will continue even after the season ends in December. Adding a sweetener of its own to the $5 million recording contract offered as the top prize on “The X Factor,” Pepsi will have the winner star in a commercial to be shown during the Super Bowl on Feb. 5. “It’s been the most collaborative relationship I’ve ever had with a sponsor,” said Mr. Cowell, the show’s creator. “From Day 1, they just bought into what we’d planned for the show, and almost became like producers. As we developed the show, we consulted with them in all the decisions, and they came and presented to us their own marketing ideas.”  For Pepsi, “The X Factor” represents a dual marketing opportunity. Through its ads on the show and next year’s Super Bowl commercial, the company will return to its tradition of big, splashy pop music commercials, its bread and butter for much of the last three decades. At the same time, it will step up its recent emphasis on digital and social media. Frank Cooper, the global consumer engagement officer, PepsiCo Beverages, said that using pop stars in commercials worked well for a time but that the company now wants to have a more active role in the projects it sponsors and in the careers of the musicians it works with. “Historically our approach, from Michael Jackson in the ’80s through Britney Spears in 2001, was really an approach of borrowed equity,” Mr. Cooper said. “The ‘X Factor’ relationship is more about what role a brand can play in an entertainment platform beyond simple sponsorship.” The Super Bowl ad — for which the winning contestant will not be paid — will be regularly invoked on the show as one of the ultimate prizes, and Pepsi’s presence on the air is also to include features like a “Pepsi Challenge,” in which viewers choose the songs that contestants will sing. After the winner is chosen, customers will be able to vote online for some of the elements in the Super Bowl ad. Pepsi’s online promotions for “The X Factor” have already started. In each city where auditions were being taped, the company invited in a handful of popular local Twitter users. They were found using Klout, a company that ranks Twitter accounts by their level of influence. Pepsi will also run game promotions, like having viewers take a picture of a can of soda with their smartphones for bonus content, said Shiv Singh, the global head of digital for PepsiCo Beverages. “You have to have a can in your hand to do that, so it helps our business,” Mr. Singh said.  Combining a big old-fashioned media campaign with smaller-scale online activity may also be a chance for Pepsi to satisfy analysts who have been skeptical of the company’s unorthodox recent marketing. Last year, Pepsi did not run a Super Bowl ad, for the first time in 23 years, but instead it put $20 million toward a charitable online campaign, the Pepsi Refresh Project. And its TV ad spending has declined significantly in recent years. In 2006, Pepsi spent $249 million to advertise its carbonated beverages on television, compared with $264 million for Coke. But in 2010, Pepsi’s spending had come down 45 percent to $136 million, while Coke’s had come down only 23 percent to $203 million, according to Nielsen. The cola war dealt Pepsi a setback this year. Beverage Digest, a trade publication, reported in March that Diet Coke had surpassed Pepsi as the second-most-popular soda in the United States, with Coke at No. 1. “The results would suggest that swinging the pendulum all the way to nontraditional media has not worked for them,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company who studies beverages and household products. This year, Pepsi returned to the Super Bowl and said it would increase the television budget for advertising its beverages by 30 percent. “Our hope, and our intention, is to find the right balance in spending between TV and digital,” said Mr. Cooper, whose other projects have included Green Label Sound, a record label financed by Mountain Dew, a PepsiCo brand, which releases online tracks by underground rock bands and pays for all the recording and marketing expenses. The goal for the show, Mr. Cooper said, was also to test the boundaries of the role of a sponsor by becoming as closely integrated within the show as possible. “When people are sitting on the couch looking at the TV,” he said, “you will see that the actual elements of the song they are singing have been filtered by, shaped by and ultimately brought to you by Pepsi.”SIMON COWELL has not just switched television shows; he has switched soft drinks.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/business/shares-drop-as-pepsico-cools-its-forecast.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Shares Drop as PepsiCo Cools Its Forecast<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>PepsiCo tempered its full-year outlook Thursday, citing economic uncertainty, sending its shares down 3.39 percent.

Now in its second year, Pepsi Refresh has been heralded as the fifth best social-media campaign by Forbes magazine.While Pepsi, with its advertising agency — the TBWA/Chiat/Day division of TBWA Worldwide — has been widely lauded for the initiative, it would not have come to pass if not for a team of young sneaker-wearing idealists from GoodInc. Based in Los Angeles, Good began five years ago as a Web site and magazine for an audience it describes as “people who want to live well and do good.” In 2009, Good met with Pepsi, which had a slogan adopted in the optimistic wake of the 2008 election, “Every Pepsi refreshes the world,” and an urge to give away money. “But what was missing was what we were going to do on the ground,” said Ana Maria Irazabal, the marketing director for the Pepsi brand in the United States. In addition to helping to conceive of Pepsi Refresh, Ms. Irazabal credits Good with developing the online voting platform to submit ideas, highlighting Pepsi Refresh on the Good Web site and Facebook page, assembling a grant management team to assist award recipients, recruiting an advisory board to lend the effort cachet and credibility, and documenting the community projects in videos that have raised the profiles of the projects and the program. Pepsi Refresh “would not have happened” without Good, “which was an extremely valuable partner,” Ms. Irazabal said. Now Good is officially starting an agency arm, Good/Corps, to work with other companies on altruistic efforts, which go by many names, including cause marketing, social impact marketing and corporate social responsibility. “Over the last three or four years people have been looking at brands and asking, ‘Is this brand part of the solution or is this brand part of the problem?’ ” said Kirk Souder, executive creative director of Good/Corps. “More brands are coming out wanting to create a new North Star for themselves, and we help them align their business strategy with social impact.”  A study by Edelman, the public relations business, found that 87 percent of Americans believe that companies should be at least as concerned with societal interests as with business interests. The 2010 Cause Evolution Study by Cone, another public relations company, found that 41 percent of consumers had bought a product in the last year because it was associated with a good cause, more than double the 20 percent who did so in 1993, the first year of the annual study. Cone also found that 80 percent of Americans were likely to switch to brands that supported a good cause, with an even greater portion of mothers (93 percent) and 18- to 24-year-olds (85 percent) likely to do so. While altruism may sound as simple cutting a check to an appreciative cause, such efforts can be fraught with missteps. In 2010, for example, as part of a “Buckets for a Cure” promotion to raise money and awareness for breast cancer, KFC changed its fried chicken buckets from red to pink. Both KFC and Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which lent its imprimatur to the promotion and was its beneficiary, were widely ridiculed, with critics associating deep-fried chicken with obesity, and adding that among postmenopausal women obesity has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. PR Watch, the Web site published by the Center for Media and Democracy, called the campaign an example of “pink washing,” which it defined as “when a company promotes pink-ribboned products and claims to care about breast cancer while also selling products linked to disease or injury.” The KFC campaign was “one of those where you say, ‘Oh, I wish you hadn’t done that,’ ” said Alison DaSilva, executive vice president of Cone, which helps companies develop cause-related marketing. “A lot of times marketers are not meant to be the experts of all things at all times, and when it comes to corporate responsibility efforts, it does make sense to get outside counsel.”  Good was started in 2006 by a group including the chief executive, Ben Goldhirsh, then 26, whose father, Bernard A. Goldhirsh, founded Inc. magazine. In April, the Good Web site drew 1.1 million unique visitors, and the magazine, which is published quarterly, has a circulation of 65,000. The company, which has slightly more than 100,000 followers on Facebook and about 587,000 on Twitter, says the average age for its magazine and online readers is 34. While Good/Corps is a new moniker for the agency arm for the company, for the last couple of years, under the name Good Projects, it developed programs for companies besides Pepsi, including Toyota, Starbucks and IBM. For the Toyota Prius, for example, in 2009 Good built an interactive microsite, Roadmap to Harmony, that, like a television and print campaign called “Harmony” by the Los Angeles office of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, explored being environmentally and socially harmonious. And for Starbucks, during election season in 2008, Good produced weekly small newspapers that were circulated in all Starbucks coffee shops in the United States. In an era when consumers actually follow brands in the same manner they follow their friends on Facebook and Twitter, “the values revolution is in many ways being amplified by the digital revolution,” said Sebastian Buck, a co-leader of Good/Corps. “Customers can advocate both for and against companies, so companies have to be truly authentic,” Mr. Buck said. “All brands are going to have to cross this threshold in terms of redefining themselves in this new culture — and we think we occupy a very novel place in helping brands with this challenge.”THE Pepsi Refresh Project awarded more than $20 million to about 1,000 projects in 2010, with grant seekers promoting their causes on the Pepsi Web site and on Facebook, and consumers deciding who received the money by voting online. Now in its second year, Pepsi Refresh has been heralded as the fifth best social-media campaign by Forbes magazine.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/how-we-decided-to-go-global/?ref=pepsicoinc">How We Decided to Go Global<date>April 14, 2011, 7:00 am</date><text>When I first suggested taking TerraCycle’s operations global, there was nearly a mutiny among my board members and executive team. No exaggeration, they thought I’d lost my mind. As quickly as I’d brought up the idea, it was tabled — that is, until I got a phone call in 2008 that set everything in motion. The phone call came from PepsiCo-Frito in Brazil. The company’s executives liked what we had done with Frito chip bags in the United States, and they wanted to do the same thing in Brazil. As we’ve done with many brands, we had developed national collection programs for Frito’s nonrecyclable waste, its chip bags. People all across America can collect used bags and send them to TerraCycle. We cover the cost of shipping and pay 2 cents per chip bag to the charity or school of the collector’s choice. We then take the bags and convert them into materials including branded fabrics and plastic pellets. Our team then works with major manufacturing companies to use the new stuff in their products, effectively replacing the need for virgin materials. As an example, Olivet, a major supplier to Wal-Mart, now uses “chip-bag plastic” from TerraCycle as the plastic in the coolers it makes. This renders the chip bag nationally recyclable and produces a major win for the brands and their sustainability goals. The executives with PepsiCo Brazil indicated that, if we weren’t prepared to open operations there, they would pay us to teach a local company how to replicate our business. It immediately became clear to me that if we didn’t seize the opportunity in other countries, someone else would get there first, and we’d never get another chance. So I went back to my board, this time with a major corporate partner ready to go. The board members still had a concern, and it was a legitimate one — that the strain of global expansion would burden our operations in the United States and threaten the fiscal viability of the company. I made the following promise (not knowing for sure whether I could keep it): Money will not flow from the United States to our operations in other countries, I told the board. If those operations cannot subsist on their own, they will fail. With this, I got approval to start TerraCycle do Brasil. This started a journey that has taken TerraCycle into 14 countries beyond the United States: Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden, France, Germany, Turkey, Israel, Spain, Holland and Belgium. And there are five more coming in the next nine months: Italy, Switzerland, Philippines, Chile and Uruguay. In most cases, the impetus to open in these countries came from domestic partners that have operations overseas. The companies we work with have global waste problems, and if something works in one market, they like to try it in others. For us, the process has been a learning experience like no other. I wish I could say we got it all right, but of course we didn’t. Here are a few lessons we’ve learned, mostly through trial and error: 1. Setting up a new entity in a new country can be expensive, and there are a lot of hurdles. Some countries require you to have a board that includes citizens of that country. Most require that all of your legal and financial work be done by firms based in the country. One of the methods I’ve found effective is to stretch free advice as far as it will go. Lawyers and accountants are often willing to offer free advice and services, all over the world, as long as they think there will be business later on. 2. Employment taxes can make hiring the right person difficult. I love Brazil and its progressive attitude toward sustainability, but it is frustrating to have to pay close to 100 percent taxes on every employee there. I also learned that it is critical to have local people doing local work. Public relations and customer service are great examples. To work effectively with media and customers, we need someone who not only knows the language but the local customs and norms. When we tried to manage our British public relations and customer service from the United States, we had no success. The moment we hired local representatives, our media interest and customer engagement took off. 3. Managing a global company can be complex. Our Trenton, N.J., operation employs more than 65 people, but none of our foreign entities has more than 10. When we begin operations in a new country, we hire a local general manager who works from his or her home, has no staff and wears the P.R., customer-service, operations, business-development and client-management hats all at once — just like a proper start-up. To maintain global oversight, our team leads in the United States are responsible for managing their counterparts in the rest of the world. Each country’s local general manager reports to me and to each of the United States team leads in their areas of responsibility. In other words, structure your team so that you can manage whatever you take on. 4. Adapt and continue to adapt. While every country in the world has a garbage problem, business and garbage are different everywhere, as are consumer attitudes, customs, retail demands, regulation and everything else. After six months in Mexico, we had fantastic P.R., but very few people had signed up for our program collecting Tang pouches. We realized that in some countries not as many consumers use the Internet for daily communications, so we had to rethink our outreach strategy. We began to focus on phone communications and leveraging local nonprofits to function as our ambassadors. So far, we’ve been able to stick to my pledge – none of our domestic dollars are supporting the global expansion. And in 2010, our non-United States operations accounted for 10 percent of our revenue. In 2011, I expect our international divisions to generate more than 25 percent of our revenue. Tom Szaky is the chief executive of TerraCycle, which is based in Trenton, N.J.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/obama-pushes-energy-savings-from-clean-fleets/?ref=pepsicoinc">Obama Pushes Energy Savings From 'Clean Fleets'<date>April 1, 2011, 10:41 am</date><text>President Obama is joining with FedEx, U.P.S. and several other major companies whose vehicles are familiar sights on America’s roadways to promote a new administration initiative encouraging businesses to operate commercial fleets that burn less gasoline and diesel fuel. Two days after Mr. Obama set a national goal of cutting oil imports by one-third by 2025, in a speech at Georgetown University, he was scheduled to travel on Friday to a shipping center in Landover, Md., just outside Washington, to view new “clean fleets” belonging to the two delivery giants and to AT&amp;T, PepsiCo and Verizon. The president’s focus on clean energy this week comes at a time when Americans are paying gasoline prices that now average about $4 a gallon, close to the high levels just before he won election in 2008. According to the White House, the five corporations have commercial fleets that are among the 10 largest in the country; together they own more than 275,000 cars and trucks. They have joined the administration’s new public-private partnership to encourage a switch to vehicles that are more fuel-efficient or run on electric power or alternative fuels. In the near term, the five companies will deploy more than 20,000 advanced-technology vehicles, saving more than 7 million gallons of oil, the administration estimated. The National Clean Fleets Partnership would be open to companies of all sizes, according to the White House. Through the Department of Energy, which already has a Clean Cities vehicle technology program, participants would get up-to-date technical information and purchasing assistance. For example, smaller companies could piggy-back on larger corporations’ bulk purchases, enjoying the same cost savings on advanced vehicles that use electric batteries, natural gas, biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen or propane.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/business/global/22pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo’s Deal With Mexican Farmers Is Good for Business<date>Published: February 21, 2011</date><text>SAN GABRIEL, Mexico — In the past, farmers would make the dangerous trek north from this tiny town hidden in the rugged folds of the Jalisco mountain range to the United States, hoping to earn enough money doing odd jobs to cover debts incurred while cultivating the small plots of land that have been in their families for generations.But more recently, many have managed to avoid the trips, staying home as the result of a new venture with PepsiCo, which buys their crops. “Some of us used to go north to work to make money to pay off debts, but no longer,” said Martín Ramos Torres, a farmer, adding that at least two members of the cooperative he leads had been caught by United States border patrol agents and deported. “In just three years, everything has changed.” Mr. Ramos and some 300 small farmers here no longer sell their corn to middlemen but directly to PepsiCo, which guarantees the price it will pay for their crops upfront. The deal enables the small farmers to secure credit to buy seeds and fertilizers, crop insurance and equipment. “Before, I had to sell my cow to buy what I needed,” said José Guzmán Santana, another farmer selling to Pepsi. “Now I keep the cow and my family has milk while I grow my crop.” PepsiCo’s work with the corn farmers reflects a relatively new approach by corporations trying to maintain a business edge while helping out small communities and farmers. Begun as a pilot project by the foundation affiliated with the company’s Sabritas snack foods division, it is expanding to about 850 farmers to develop a local source of sunflower oil, which the company needs to improve the nutritional quality of its products. The corn project saved PepsiCo transportation costs because the farms were close to two of its factories, and the use of local farms assured it access to types of corn best suited to its products and processes. “That gives us great leverage because corn prices don’t fluctuate so much, but transportation costs do,” said Pedro Padierna, president of PepsiCo’s operations in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The social benefits of the corn program are obvious in higher incomes that have improved nutritional and educational standards among the participating farmers, not to mention its impact on illegal immigration and possibly even the reduction of marijuana production. The sunflower farmers are expected to see similar benefits — but PepsiCo insists those benefits are ancillary to the business rationale for the program. A growing number of major companies have adopted similar business tacks aimed at profitability that also prove to be economically and socially beneficial for needy people. One of the earliest examples was Danone’s development of a vitamin-enhanced yogurt product that sells for 11 cents in Bangladesh. The product is profit-neutral, but has given the company valuable insights into the 2.5 billion potential consumers who live on less than $2.50 a day. “These are markets,” Harry Verhaar, head of strategic sustainability initiatives at Philips Electronics, said of countries with sizable populations of impoverished consumers. Philips has begun selling low-cost, solar-powered lighting products in Africa to people who lack access to the electrical grid. “We are developing products to address them that are economically good for us as a company and also good for ecology and good for consumers,” Mr. Verhaar said. The products reduce the use of kerosene, the fuel of choice among the world’s poorest consumers. Because they light homes that previously went dark at sundown, they may enable a child to study longer or a community to enjoy an evening soccer game. And they have spawned business. “A guy will set up a small shop with a large solar panel on the roof or behind and charge a small fee for recharging the solar light,” Mr. Verhaar said. “We are seeing an increased focus by companies looking to see how they can use their core capabilities for public good rather than simply writing a big check,” said Gaurav Gupta, regional director for Asia at Dalberg Global Development Advisors, a consulting firm focused on international development. “They’re starting to realize that the marginal cost of doing a little extra good produces such a great impact — and not only in terms of good will, but also because it’s good for business.” 1 2 3 Next Page »SAN GABRIEL, Mexico — In the past, farmers would make the dangerous trek north from this tiny town hidden in the rugged folds of the Jalisco mountain range to the United States, hoping to earn enough money doing odd jobs to cover debts incurred while cultivating the small plots of land that have been in their families for generations.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/business/11pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo’s Profit Drops on Commodity Costs<date>Published: February 10, 2011</date><text>PepsiCo cut its earnings growth targets for 2011 and beyond on Thursday, citing soaring commodity costs and uncertainty about when the economic recovery on paper would actually be felt by consumers.Its chief, Indra K. Nooyi, whom analysts peppered with tough questions on a tense conference call, defended the new forecast, which called for earnings growth of 7 to 8 percent for 2011 and high-single digit rates beyond. She challenged analysts to find another $63 billion company that could grow as much despite weak demand and a large exposure to commodities. “Boy, if you could find other companies like ours, you should go ahead and invest in them,” Ms. Nooyi said. Shares of PepsiCo, whose products include Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana juice, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal, were down 2.1 percent in afternoon trading despite Pepsi’s reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. Its rival, Coca-Cola, on Wednesday surprised the market with sales volume increases in all its segments. Both companies said they would raise prices this year on some drinks as they tried to offset higher costs for supplies like corn syrup and packaging. But PepsiCo’s sizable food business makes it much more exposed to commodities than Coke, and it said it would not fully offset the impact of the cost inflation with price increases, for fear of turning consumers away. While there are signs of an economic recovery, company executives said unemployment remained high and consumers were holding on to their money. PepsiCo’s net income fell to $1.37 billion, or 85 cents a share in the fourth quarter, from $1.43 billion, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.05 a share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.04 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Its sales jumped 37 percent to $18.16 billion, helped by the acquisition last year of its two largest bottlers. Analysts were expecting revenue of $17.6 billion. Overall fourth-quarter volume rose 3 percent in snacks and 12 percent in beverages. Excluding added volume the company took on as part of its bottler acquisition, North American volume rose 1 percent, trailing the 3 percent growth seen by Coca-Cola, which gained market share. James T. Tierney Jr., chief investment officer of W.P. Stewart and a PepsiCo shareholder, said Pepsi was doing “pretty good” in a tough sector. “PepsiCo is one of the best houses in a really tough neighborhood right now,” Mr. Tierney said. The company had earlier forecast earnings growth in the low double digits for 2011 and 2012, but lowered it, partly because of commodity inflation of 8 to 9.5 percent this year, which translates to some $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion. PepsiCo shares closed down 1.65 percent, or $1.06, to $63.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.PepsiCo cut its earnings growth targets for 2011 and beyond on Thursday, citing soaring commodity costs and uncertainty about when the economic recovery on paper would actually be felt by consumers.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/pepsi-to-buy-rest-of-russian-juice-maker/?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo to Buy Rest of Russian Beverage Company<date>February 3, 2011, 8:04 am</date><text>PepsiCo, which announced on Thursday that it had completed its $3.8 billion acquisition of a two-thirds stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods, plans to pay $132 a share for the remaining piece. The acquisition increased PepsiCo’s total stake to roughly 77 percent in Wimm-Bill-Dann, the top food and beverage company in Russia. With the transaction complete, PepsiCo is now the largest food and beverage company in Russia. In 2008, it paid $1.4 billion for a 76 percent stake in a Russian juice maker, JSC Lebedyansky. The country is also PepsiCo’s largest market outside the United States. “Adding Wimm-Bill-Dann to PepsiCo’s portfolio is financially attractive and gives us a strong, high-growth platform in the dairy category,” Indra K. Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chairwoman and chief executive, said in a statement when the deal was first announced in December. The acquisition will also boosts PepsiCo’s global revenue from the nutritious and functional foods sector to $13 billion from $10 billion today. The company hopes to expand the business to at least $30 billion by 2020. Pepsi also said it planned to buy the rest of Wimm-Bill-Dann for $132 a share — the same price it paid for the two-thirds stake. The company expects to make a bid by March 11, 2011.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi’s Bet on Community Projects Over the Super Bowl<date>Published: January 30, 2011</date><text>What’s better than reaching more than 100 million viewers during last year’s Super Bowl? For Pepsi, it could be 6,000 football fans during a high school game on Friday night in central Texas. Or a group of parents who wanted a new playground in their Las Vegas neighborhood.That is the bet that PepsiCo made when it walked away from spending $20 million on television spots for Pepsi during last year’s Super Bowl and plowed the money into a monthly online contest for people to submit their ideas and compete for votes to win grants. Withdrawing from the Super Bowl for the first time in 23 years and giving the money away for the Pepsi Refresh Project was considered a gamble by the beverage maker as it explored the potential of social media and cause-related marketing to make a difference in its business. But the company, despite accusations that some winners used questionable voting tactics, says it was a huge success and plans to expand it beyond the United States this year. More than $20 million in grants, ranging from $5,000 to $250,000, has been distributed to about 400 winners so far, including $25,000 for new uniforms for the Cedar Park High School band in Cedar Park, Tex., which took its campaign to win votes to Friday night football games. In Las Vegas, a new playground opened last week with a $25,000 grant won in September. “This was not a corporate philanthropy effort,” said Shiv Singh, head of digital for PepsiCo Beverages America. “This was using brand dollars with the belief that when you use these brand dollars to have consumers share ideas to change the world, the consumers will win, the brand will win, and the community will win. That was a big bet. No one has done it on this scale before.” As Pepsi had hoped, competitors have turned to their personal networks on Facebook and Twitter to gain support for their ideas, extending the Pepsi brand and its do-good message. Nearly 19 percent of the 77 million votes have been cast through Facebook. On Twitter, participants were urged to use the hash tag “#PepsiRefresh,” and they did. B. Bonin Bough, who oversees social media for PepsiCo, said that the power of social platforms, like Twitter and Facebook, and blogs allowed this program to work and have reach. “But most important is the power of these platforms to help individuals build communities to help support their efforts and ideas,” he said. “These communities will exist long after and are a testament to the type of social impact programs like this can have.” But did the Pepsi Refresh Project sell more cans of soda? Prompt more consumers to switch from Coca-Cola to Pepsi? Create more brand awareness? Build stronger relationships with consumers? Figuring out how to translate social media efforts into sales and customers — and how to measure overall effectiveness — was cited as a top concern of many companies looking to expand their efforts to reach consumers using social media technologies in 2011, according to a recent survey by the Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. More than 79 percent of the 2,100 companies participating in the survey said they either currently use social media channels like Facebook and Twitter, or are preparing to start social media initiatives. But most executives reported they were still struggling over how best to use the different channels and measure their effectiveness. Of those companies participating in social media, nearly a third do not currently measure the effectiveness of their programs, and less than a quarter are using social media analytic tools, the report said. At Pepsi, the company is using dozens of methods to assess the impact of Pepsi Refresh, but its success is not being measured by sales of the beverage. Last year, Pepsi sales fell 6 percent, a sharper decline than the 4.3 percent decline overall in carbonated sales beverages. Mr. Singh said the Pepsi Refresh Project was not a sales-driving program, but viewed as an investment to build brand awareness and cultivate a long-term relationship with consumers. “It was designed to drive brand health,” he said. “We look at brand equity, brand health and sales — and we have seen movement in all of them.” He also said the project had allowed the company to understand and learn the priorities of many of its customers across the country. “There have been 120,000 ideas submitted,” he said. “It gives us a strong sense of what matters to them and what is exciting to them.” Allison H. Fine, co-author of the book “The Networked Nonprofit,” said the upside of the growing number of companies’ embracing social media to run online charity contests was that a local shelter could compete head-to-head for money with a large national nonprofit and do well. “But it is still different from traditional philanthropy,” she said, noting many of the awards are to support “loving acts of kindness” and not aimed at achieving social change or perhaps a community’s more urgent and important needs. At Cedar Park High School, band members waged a four-month campaign to win the $25,000 grant from Pepsi Refresh for new uniforms last fall; their efforts included distributing fliers during a game and asking people to vote online in support of their request. They also urged people to use their mobile phones to cast a vote during halftime. To help them text the number, band members created a formation on the field of 1-0-2-1-1-4 while an announcer told fans what to do. “That was a lot of fun,” said Bob Chreste, associate director of the high school band and the driving force behind the band’s successful campaign. “A lot of people in the audience during the game pulled out their phones and voted.” For Pepsi’s advertising agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day, based in Los Angeles, the decision to skip the Super Bowl ad last year and use the money for the Pepsi Refresh Project acknowledged the consumer shift toward social media and the need to reach the millennial generation with a project that allowed them to participate in a meaningful way. “It was a big deal,” said Carisa Bianchi, president of TBWA/Chiat/Day, about the decision to forgo a traditional ad. “But it really placed Pepsi as a modern brand.” What about this year’s Super Bowl? The Pepsi Max brand will join its sibling brand, Doritos, in the Crash the Super Bowl contest, which will offer six ad spots this year for consumer-created commercials. Voters decide which spots get on the air.What’s better than reaching more than 100 million viewers during last year’s Super Bowl?

After the $3.8 billion acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann Foods is complete, PepsiCo will be the largest snack and beverage company in Russia. The country will also be PepsiCo’s largest market outside the United States. Under the terms of the deal, PepsiCo — whose businesses include Pepsi-Cola, Frito Lay and Gatorade — will buy 66 percent of the Russian company. Once the deal closes, the company would own about 77 percent of Wimm-Bill-Dann’s outstanding shares, PepsiCo said. Like many large American multinationals, PepsiCo is seeking growth abroad to mitigate stagnant domestic sales. The deal gives the company a foothold in the Eastern European and Central Asian markets. The deal will raise PepsiCo’s global annual revenue in what the company calls its nutritious foods business to $13 billion, from $10 billion. PepsiCo is hoping to raise that figure to $30 billion by 2020.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/06/business/06charity.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi Contest Faces More Charges of Cheating<date>Published: January 5, 2011</date><text>Pepsi Refresh, the online fund-raising contest with a $20 million giveaway for charitable causes and nonprofit groups, is again receiving complaints that its results are being manipulated.A few nonprofit groups say that recent winners have used a mysterious service to propel themselves into the winning ranks, and complain that the practice breaks Pepsi’s ban on proxy voting and on votes from international locations. “I feel like we were cheated out of a win,” said Ann Goody, a founder of the Three Ring Ranch, an exotic-animal sanctuary in Kona, Hawaii, that participated in the contest for many months. “We worked our hearts out with e-mails, phone calls, Facebook, kids handing out candy canes at Wal-Mart and then we find out our win was stolen from us by people breaking the rules.” Pepsi has been running the contest each month since last February. Organizations and causes compete for votes to win grants of $5,000, $10,000, $25,000, $50,000 or $250,000. “I’d say only three months of this contest, the first three, were pretty legitimate,” said Randall G. Herzon, founder of Kritter Kountry, a new nonprofit animal shelter and rescue center in Eureka, Calif., that vied several months for the $250,000 prize. Mr. Herzon said he first started noticing problems in May. “I’ve been complaining to Pepsi about a number of things since then, and so have others,” he said. “I think they got tired of hearing from us. They kept skirting the issues and saying everything was O.K. under the rules.” In a statement, Pepsi said it was committed to maintaining the integrity of the contest, and that it deployed a variety of proprietary methods to identify fraudulent votes and remove them from the system. Pepsi also said it “adamantly disputes Mr. Herzon’s claims,” adding that the organizations it had hired to help respond to inquiries had thoroughly reviewed complaints. “We take any allegation of fraud very seriously, and once we have completed a thorough investigation, we will take appropriate action,” the company said. The most recent flap appears to revolve around competing animal shelter contestants. Carol Schultz, the operator of Guardian Angel Feline Rescue, won a $50,000 grant in October, but now finds herself at the center of the latest distress. Ms. Goody, Mr. Herzon and others say they believe a third-party service was used to generate proxy votes from abroad. Ms. Schultz, however, says she did nothing wrong. The only information known about the outside service in question is that it is represented by an unknown individual called “Mr. Magic” by the contestants, who cited only an e-mail address, tubebilling@gmail.com. Someone using that address offered to help raise vote totals to get some of the groups into the winning ranks in exchange for payments or a share of their winnings. “Someone sent us an e-mail from an address like that a couple of months ago, asking us if we wanted this service,” said Jeff Hynes, the founder of Cash for Critters, a nonprofit group in Euclid, Ohio, that won $25,000 in the contest last month. “I think we just deleted it because we didn’t want anything to do with that. We tried to do this the way it’s supposed to be done.” Ms. Goody and other contestants are asking Pepsi to disqualify any winner found to have used the third-party service. In October, Three Ring Ranch came close to winning one of the 10 $50,000 grants, hovering around fifth place until it fell to the 11th position, just out of the money, in the final days. One of the organizations that unseated Three Ring Ranch was Guardian Angel Feline Rescue, which had been languishing at 17 until it surged into seventh place to win. In the next month’s contest, Ms. Goody’s organization was ranked around 100. She said Ms. Schultz called her and offered to help put her in touch with someone, known as Mr. Magic in India, at the Gmail address. “I played along because I wanted to know how she did it,” Ms. Goody said. “I decided I’d be a spy.” Ms. Schultz declined to say whether she had used Mr. Magic’s services or whether she had paid for such services. “I’m not going to incriminate myself with anything as far as this goes,” she said. But e-mails provided by Ms. Goody that appear to be from Ms. Shultz describe efforts to pay for the service. “I have just spent 3 days for hours at a time at my bank &amp; other banks trying to get a cash advance on this stupid debit card” — using her winnings from Pepsi — “so that I could wire Mr. Magic his fee,” one e-mail on Dec. 11 states. The e-mail says that the fee was wired to an account held by NetDigitalinc.com L.L.C., in Baton Rouge, La., according to a man who identified himself as Christopher Moran and as the owner of the business. In a telephone interview, a man who said he was Mr. Moran said he had been doing business with Mr. Magic over the last two years, but would not identify him further. “He’s the one who solicited them,” Christopher Moran said of the contestants and Mr. Magic. “I only know them when they call me. I don’t know their arrangements with him.” Someone responded to queries sent to the Gmail address, but the writer did not disclose his or her identity or provide the name of the business. The e-mail reply said the business was based in India, but would not supply its Web site address. “We would not like to disclose our tube Web site because this would be negative PR as we are using it to win charity contests,” the e-mail stated. Told of the latest contretemps involving the Pepsi contest, Allison Fine, an expert on nonprofit use of social media and co-author of the book, “The Networked Nonprofit,” said the onus was on Pepsi to investigate. “I don’t think I’ve heard about any of these contests where gaming wasn’t an issue,” she said. “It is incumbent on the sponsors to respond quickly to concerns because otherwise, there is a real question about the legitimacy of these things.” But she laughed at the circumstances. “This is worthy of a Coen brothers movie.”Pepsi Refresh, the online fund-raising contest with a $20 million giveaway for charitable causes and nonprofit groups, is again receiving complaints that its results are being manipulated.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/business/media/04adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi to Sponsor ‘The X Factor’<date>Published: January 3, 2011</date><text>THERE are Coke people, and there are Pepsi people. But for Simon Cowell, who is moving from “American Idol” to “The X Factor,“ that allegiance — which quite often lasts a lifetime — is about to take a turn.Fox will announce Tuesday that Pepsi is the sole season-long sponsor for “The X Factor,” a singing competition that Mr. Cowell is bringing to the United States in the fall. Pepsi will have commercial time and integrations within “X Factor,” and the two brands will support each other on the Web and in stores. With the sponsorship deal, the Fox network is able to have it both ways: it has Coca-Cola locked up on “Idol” in the winter and spring, and now it will have Pepsi on “X Factor” in the fall. The sponsorship appears to be a victory for Pepsi in the never-ending Cola Wars — assuming that viewers take to “X Factor” the way Fox and Pepsi hope they do. Thanks to Mr. Cowell’s backing and its status as a hit overseas, there is already a significant amount of interest in “The X Factor,” and Fox is trying to stir it up further: in November, at least 10 months before the show’s premiere, the network started to run short commercials for it. “Coming to America Fall 2011,” the commercials say, trying to set up “X Factor” as a television event.  Late last year, Coke, Pepsi and other beverage companies participated in what Fox called a “jump ball negotiation” to be the exclusive beverage brand in “X Factor.” Frank Cooper, a senior vice president at PepsiCo, rebuffed questions about the Cola Wars in an interview. But when asked if he took any personal joy in stealing the “X Factor” franchise from Coke, he laughed and said, “We love winning.” “There is absolutely personal joy in getting the ‘X Factor’ property. I love it,” he said. “But I love it mostly because of what we can do with it.” Along with commercials, Pepsi and Fox will work together on marketing off the air and a joint Web site. Mr. Cooper said the social media and local community parts of the “Pepsi Refresh Project” — which lets people vote to give grants to deserving groups — would be used as a template for “X Factor.” Mr. Cowell, too, talked up the online opportunities for “X Factor” and Pepsi. “The social community, the Internet, is going to be a vital part of building up the buzz about this show,” he said in an interview on Monday. It is “extraordinary” to sign up a partner for a show that is still the better part of a year away from its premiere, said Jean Rossi, the executive vice president of sales for Fox and the president of Fox One, the cross-platform sales arm of Fox’s parent, the News Corporation. “Because of the way we want to co-promote this — being able to leverage some of Pepsi’s assets to get the promotion out there to launch the show — we felt we needed to get out early on this,” she explained. Fox will sell commercial time on “X Factor” as part of its upfront sales presentations in the spring.The American version of “X Factor” has been in development for an unusually long time. The show, which will be produced by FremantleMedia North America and Mr. Cowell’s Syco Television, was announced 12 months ago in conjunction with Mr. Cowell’s exit from “Idol.” Like “Idol,” it is a search for a musical superstar, but there are differences in the formats. Notably, “X Factor” auditions both individuals and groups, and does so in front of live audiences. Contestants on “X Factor” are divided into four categories, each mentored by a different judge. “X Factor” “has a lot of things going for it,” said Todd Gordon, the senior vice president and managing director of broadcast for Initiative, an ad buying firm, citing Mr. Cowell’s brand as a judge and the international track record of the show. FremantleMedia says “X Factor,” which originated in Britain, has been shown in more than 20 territories around the world.  “Idol,” the country’s most-watched reality show, has proved to be a hugely important vehicle for advertising. There were more product placements in “Idol” than in any other television series by far last year, according to Nielsen. Along with Coke, “Idol” has two other major sponsors, Ford Motor and AT&amp;T. While Fox has decided to make Pepsi the only season-long sponsor of “X Factor,” the network may sign up a couple of other partners for shorter periods. In “Idol,” “X Factor” and Fox’s other shows, integrated ad deals last one season with the right of first refusal the next season — a structure that protects Pepsi if “X Factor” is a dud. Pepsi had its eye on “X Factor” for much of last year, but the bidding for the beverage category partnership did not begin until the fall. The companies would not confirm a report on Deadline.com last month that the bids ranged from $50 million to $100 million. “It is a deal that none of us went into lightly,” Mr. Cooper, from PepsiCo, said, adding, “The money was not the most critical thing. The most significant question was, ‘What can we get out of this property?’ “ Pepsi will have regular commercial time throughout the season of “X Factor,” and its brand and its products will also be integrated into the show. Perhaps there will be blue Pepsi cups on the judges’ table, just as there are red Coke cups on “Idol.” But “that to me would be the wallpaper,” Mr. Cooper said. “We’re really going a layer deeper.” The specifics, he said, will be hashed out in the months ahead. Speaking for Pepsi, Mr. Cooper said, “We believe in the power of Simon Cowell.” Mr. Cowell, too, praised Pepsi as being the “right fit" for his show. Mr. Cowell sensed a trick question when he was asked which beverage he personally preferred. He thanked Coke for its support for “Idol” over the years, and he ended the interview by saying, “I do love the taste of Pepsi, yes.”THERE are Coke people, and there are Pepsi people. But for Simon Cowell, who is moving from “American Idol” to “The X Factor,“ that allegiance — which quite often lasts a lifetime — is about to take a turn.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/media/28adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Companies Promote Health and Brands With Playgrounds<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>MARKETERS like Kraft Foods, MetLife, CVS and Dr Pepper/Snapple Group are steering millions in charitable dollars to a new and somewhat unlikely project — building neighborhood playgrounds for children.The companies are embracing the playground as an opportunity to make their names better known — and better liked — locally and to encourage employees to volunteer in their communities. As the first lady, Michelle Obama, highlights child obesity and urges regular exercise, providing play spaces is a winning cause for the food and beverage companies, which are under fire for high calorie snacks and drinks. Dr Pepper/Snapple Group pledged $15 million this month to build or fix 2,000 playgrounds over the next three years. “A fit and active lifestyle is one of our philanthropic goals,” said Tina Barry, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. “Playgrounds align with that.” In October, Kraft Foods made playground-building a centerpiece of its annual company “Delicious Difference Week.” About 1,300 employees, including the chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, built 13 playgrounds, including one in Washington Park on the South Side of Chicago, at a total cost of more than $1.4 million. Kraft, too, counts healthful lifestyles, along with ending hunger, as a top philanthropic priority. “It’s huge — getting children excited about play,” said Nicole Robinson, the vice president of the company’s charitable arm, the Kraft Foods Foundation. Kraft and other companies that provide money for playground construction say they have not studied whether their contributions increase public awareness of their brand. Corporate-financed playgrounds typically bear a plaque with the company’s name and receive a flurry of local news coverage. Kraft’s playground projects are “a huge boost to the company’s reputation, and add to its credibility,” Ms. Robinson says. • Foresters, the life insurance provider, also has opted for playgrounds, recently pledging $1.5 million to build 20 in the United States, where the company, which is based in Canada, has most of its clients. “It’s a good fit for us,” said George Mohacsi, its president and chief executive. “And we get more bang for the buck when we build a playground, we put in something that people can use daily for a decade or more.” A. Dennis White, president and chief executive of MetLife Foundation, said his company regularly finances playgrounds to promote physical fitness. The company has donated $850,000 in the last three years for 400 play spaces in the United States and Mexico. “It’s something that can be built in a day, and we like the visibility it gets in the local community,” Mr. White said. Once upon a time, playgrounds were largely the province of schools or municipalities, but with plummeting local tax revenues, they are ripe for corporate support. This dovetails with a recent study that found companies are allocating their charitable giving — whether it is goods, services or cash — more toward community needs instead of grand goals such as alleviating world hunger. Basic needs were the only categories in which corporate cash contributions increased last year, according to the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s annual corporate giving report, which used information from 171 major companies, including 61 of the Fortune 100. Companies financing playgrounds often work in partnership with Kaboom, a nonprofit group based in Washington, which recently drew praise from Mrs. Obama. It has a comprehensive plan to include the community and company volunteers in designing, building and maintaining play spaces. Kaboom has nearly 300 corporate partners, including Home Depot and Kimberly Clark. Darell Hammond, its chief executive, said companies need to spend $75,000 to $500,000 to create a public playground, depending on whether the floor is rubberized. Companies are drawn to the idea because “playgrounds bring the community together,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s almost a new town square.” Other companies work with nonprofit organizations like Shane’s Inspiration or Boundless Playgrounds, to create play areas that are accessible to disabled children. This fall, CVS worked with the Pepsi Refresh Project to give $70,000 to construct the playground proposal from the public that had won the most votes on the project’s Web site. A Fort Wayne, Ind., playground proposal was selected and will be built in 2011, said Eileen Howard Dunn, senior vice president for community relations for CVS Caremark. CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., has spent $3 million in recent years to finance 65 playgrounds around the country, and has pledged to build 10 more next year as part of its $25 million “All Kids Can” initiative to help disabled children. With charitable cash in shorter supply, companies are encouraging employees to volunteer. The corporate philanthropy committee report found that in the last three years, 20 percent more companies offer paid time during the workday for employees to volunteer. • Companies devoting resources to building playgrounds, which typically are in areas that are home to a concentration of their employees, say that worker engagement and satisfaction are important considerations in choosing the playground option. “Employees who participate feel a sense of community whether they participate for the one day or for the six months of planning,” Ms. Robinson, of Kraft, said. “And any company really receives a halo.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/15/business/15soda.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Save the Children Breaks With Soda Tax Effort<date>Published: December 14, 2010</date><text>Over the last year, Save the Children emerged as a leader in the push to tax sweetened soft drinks as a way to combat childhood obesity. The nonprofit group supported soda tax campaigns in Mississippi, New Mexico, Washington State, Philadelphia and the District of Columbia.At the same time, executives at Save the Children were seeking a major grant from Coca-Cola to help finance the health and education programs that the charity conducts here and abroad, including its work on childhood obesity. The talks with Coke are still going on. But the soda tax work has been stopped. In October, Save the Children surprised activists around the country with an e-mail message announcing that it would no longer support efforts to tax soft drinks. In interviews this month, Carolyn Miles, chief operating officer of Save the Children, said there was no connection between the group’s about-face on soda taxes and the discussions with Coke. A $5 million grant from PepsiCo also had no influence on the decision, she said. Both companies fiercely oppose soda taxes. Ms. Miles said that after Save the Children took a prominent role in several soda tax campaigns, executives reviewed the issue and decided it was too controversial to continue. “We looked at it and said, ‘Is this something we should be out there doing and does this fit with the way that Save the Children works?’ ” she said. “And the answer was no.” Ms. Miles said the talks with Coke were continuing and the grant under discussion was significantly larger than past donations from the soft drink giant. Coke has given the group about $400,000 since 1991, according to a company spokeswoman. Save the Children has received much more money from Pepsi through the PepsiCo Foundation, which it has designated as a “corporate partner” in recognition of the $5 million grant for work in India and Bangladesh. PepsiCo awarded the grant in early 2009, before the charity began its soda tax advocacy. Representatives of both Coca-Cola and Pepsi said they had not asked the charity to alter its position on soda taxes. But soda tax advocates say that soft drink makers are flexing their muscles in opposition to soda taxes. In Washington State, the American Beverage Association, a trade group that includes Coke and Pepsi, spent $16.5 million to win passage of a November ballot initiative that overturned a small tax on soft drinks enacted by the legislature to help plug a budget gap. The beverage association outspent supporters of the tax by more than 40 to 1, and the tax was repealed. Jon Gould, deputy director of the Children’s Alliance, an advocacy group in Seattle, said Save the Children’s decision to abandon the issue was “a significant loss, especially at a time when the American Beverage Association has just shown that their resources are unlimited.” The alliance got $25,000 from Save the Children to help advocate for a soda tax. Kelly D. Brownell, a soda tax advocate and director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said that many food and beverage companies made donations to nonprofit groups fighting hunger but it was less common for them to finance work to address obesity. “It would be a shame if there were a quid pro quo and the groups felt pressure to oppose something like a soda tax,” Mr. Brownell said. Public debate about soda taxes has intensified over the last year. Proponents say that if the tax were large enough, perhaps a penny an ounce or more, it could reduce consumption of sugary beverages, which are high in calories and can contribute to obesity. In addition, money raised by the tax could be spent on public health efforts to fight obesity. The soda companies argue that it is unfair to blame their products for the obesity epidemic, which has complex causes. They say that policies should be focused instead on getting people to exercise more. So far, tax proposals have gotten little traction. Last year, federal lawmakers considered a soft drink tax to help pay for health care reform, but that idea was dropped. Governors, state lawmakers and mayors have proposed taxes but made little headway. Save the Children’s involvement in the issue began in late 2009, when it got a $3.5 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to fight childhood obesity through a program it called the Campaign for Healthy Kids. Save the Children initially financed the work of local groups, some of which focused on improving school lunches and requiring health education in schools. But local activists in Mississippi, New Mexico and Washington State used the grants to push for a soda tax. When politicians in Philadelphia and Washington proposed soda taxes this year, the Campaign for Healthy Kids got more directly involved, paying for lobbyists and polling. “We really took the lead on those and were publicly identified with those,” said Andrew Hysell, an associate vice president for Save the Children and the director of the obesity campaign. None of the soda tax measures supported by Save the Children passed, although in Washington, the city council removed a sales tax exemption for carbonated beverages. Save the Children’s prominent role in Philadelphia and Washington led top executives of the charity to review the work. Ms. Miles said they concluded the advocacy was not part of the charity’s mission. “We made a decision that it was an issue that was controversial among our constituents and really was not core to the work we’re doing in the U.S.,” Ms. Miles said. She said that while the charity’s constituents included corporate donors, concerns over fund-raising were not involved in the decision. Mr. Hysell informed soda tax advocates of the change in October and the Campaign for Healthy Kids removed declarations of support for soda taxes from its Web site. Officials of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who had encouraged Save the Children to advocate for soda taxes, are disappointed. “They were obviously some of the strongest out there working on the issue, and we had such high hopes,” said Dwayne Proctor, team director for childhood obesity at the foundation. He said the two groups would continue to work together on other aspects of the obesity fight.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E2D71331F93AA35751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=pepsicoinc">S.E.C.

If the deal goes through, it would be the largest acquisition on record in Russia by an American company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Like many large American multinationals, PepsiCo is gunning for growth abroad as domestic sales stagnate. The deal would raise PepsiCo's global annual revenue in nutritious and functional foods to $13 billion, from $10 billion. It hopes to hit $30 billion by 2020. PepsiCo would also be the largest food and beverage company in the country. In 2008, PepsiCo paid $1.4 billion for a 76 percent stake in a Russian juice maker, JSC Lebedyansky. ''Adding Wimm-Bill-Dann to PepsiCo's portfolio is financially attractive and gives us a strong, high-growth platform in the dairy category,'' Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo's chairwoman and chief executive, said in a statement. PepsiCo is offering $33 for each American depository receipt, or A.D.R. That is the equivalent of about $132 for each ordinary Russian share of the company. Wimm-Bill-Dann shares jumped 28 percent on Thursday, while PepsiCo's stock fell 0.7 percent. Investors in part seemed concerned about the price. PepsiCo's bid values the company at roughly $5.4 billion. Danone sold its 18 percent stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann for $470 million in October. At that price, the company had an implied value of $2.6 billion. ''We were surprised by the high valuation,'' said Natalya Zagvozdina, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a boutique investment bank. But PepsiCo is a ''profitable and very well-run company. They're building a pan-European and -Asian platform.'' Including this deal, acquisitions by American companies in the emerging markets have amounted to $23.8 billion so far this year. That is up 94 percent from the full year 2009 and the strongest activity since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters. Russia, for its part, is trying to prove it is hospitable to business. Despite advances in the regulatory and legal environment, international investors still tread cautiously. Ikea has had a series of problems in Russia, most recently dismissing two senior executives over issues of bribery. Russia ranked 154 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, worse than Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe.

PepsiCo has agreed to buy a two-thirds stake in the juice and dairy group Wimm-Bill-Dann and is making an offer for the rest, valuing the enterprise at $5.4 billion. It’s one of the largest ever foreign investments in Russia. Despite the country’s notoriously tricky climate for outsiders — consider the private equity firm TPG’s travails with its investment in Lenta supermarkets — Russia’s nascent consumer market still holds attractions for acquisitive global companies.Pepsi is familiar with the local risks. In the 1970s, it became the first Western multinational licensed to produce in the Soviet Union, and in 2008 it paid $2 billion to buy Russia’s largest juice maker, Lebedyansky. The economy has struggled of late, dragging down Wimm-Bill-Dann’s sales. But things have started to turn and the company’s revenue is now expected to climb 20 percent in dollar terms in the current year. Even if the timing looks opportunistic, the deal still isn’t cheap. The 32 percent premium being offered over Wimm-Bill-Dann’s prebid market value is not out of line for an M.&amp; A. deal. But taking Wimm-Bill-Dann’s own forecast of $334 million of Ebitda in 2010, the acquisition values the enterprise at a lofty 16 times that figure. The return on investment in year one would be only about 3 percent, assuming the group reaches its expected $2.6 billion of revenue and holds operating margins at last year’s level. The longer-term opportunities may justify the outlay. Russia’s consumer market is benefiting from changing tastes and lifestyles, not simply rising disposable incomes. Wimm-Bill-Dann originally focused on fruit juice, where its runaway success in the 1990s was an early illustration of the huge potential for Western-style consumer brands. More recently, the company has diversified into dairy products and become a market leader. Yogurt was virtually unheard-of in Soviet days, but as Russians emulate Western lifestyles, demand has taken off. Even so, the average Russian still consumes less than half as much yogurt and fruit juice as an average American or Pole. With Pepsi’s marketing might, the costly deal could pay off. (In)efficient Markets One lesson from recent fat data dumps relates to fat tails. Both the Federal Reserve’s publication of data on its emergency credit facilities and the WikiLeaks releases of State Department messages could have caused market turmoil if they had been made public in real time. But some financial and political insiders were at least partly informed. It is a reminder that even supposedly efficient markets can’t reflect unknowns — and that information is always unevenly distributed. The efficient market hypothesis and the formulas that are derived from it and used in Wall Street’s risk management systems make the assumption that information is equally available to market participants. In the case of the Fed data, that was not the case. For instance, while Morgan Stanley’s borrowing under the primary dealer credit facility totaled $61.2 billion at the peak, Citigroup’s topped out at $18.6 billion. Such information on the relative illiquidity of major market participants during the crisis was valuable, yet it was available, presumably, only to the Fed and the institution concerned. Similarly in the WikiLeaks case, the information that Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah wanted the United States to bomb Iran to eliminate its nuclear weapons program could have shocked markets if public. Yet it must have been known to senior officials in Saudi Arabia, some of whom may have had influence over substantial asset pools. Complete openness is not the solution. There’s a rationale for not immediately disclosing details of emergency lending by the Fed, since doing so might create volatility in the markets it was intended to stabilize. In any event, this is an impractical goal. Market participants would find ways to avoid disclosure in delicate cases. Instead, market theory and risk management techniques should be adapted to reflect that not all information is public and that private information in particular is unevenly spread around. The immediate implication is that some “market” prices are false because not all relevant facts are widely known. It also implies that extreme events and market swings are far more likely than efficient market theory indicates. In the jargon, the tails of the distribution are fatter than conventional theory admits.

It also expects to be hurt by changes in currency exchange rates. Pepsi said it earned $1.92 billion, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter, up from $1.72 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Without one-time items including charges to integrate its bottlers, the company earned $1.22 a share, in line with analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue in the period, which ended on Sept. 4 and was the third quarter of PepsiCo’s fiscal year, rose 40 percent, to $15.51 billion, from $11.08 billion. The revenue was helped by strong gains abroad and the acquisition of the company’s largest North American bottlers this year. Revenue beat analysts’ estimates of $15.38 billion. The company completed its bottler deal for $7.8 billion earlier this year, with the goal of better controlling distribution and to be able to bring products to market more quickly. The company, based in Purchase, N.Y., reported revenue gains across all of its business units, including beverages around the world and snacks, except for Quaker, which has been struggling in the United States. It plans to continue expanding its snacks and soft drinks overseas by increasing investment in production and distribution. Domestically, the company is spending more to support PepsiMax, its zero-calorie version of Pepsi; other beverages; and its Quaker products, including introducing new versions of its oatmeal with a thicker texture. PepsiCo had previously expected earnings to rise 11 to 13 percent a share for the full year, but on Thursday it narrowed that range to 11 to 12 percent. Additionally, the company said it expected foreign currency movements to hurt earnings by one percentage point, so core earnings per share would show 10 to 11 percent growth. The chief executive, Indra Nooyi, told investors the company was seeing improvements in the economic environment. But, she added “there is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many regions.” Pepsi also announced it was creating a new global nutrition group so it could create new products. PepsiCo shares fell $2.01, or 2.95 percent, to close at $66.10.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/business/02bizbriefs-NONPROFITGRO_BRF.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Nonprofit Group Wins Pepsi Contest<date>Published: October 2, 2010</date><text>A nonprofit group that complained that Pepsi had allowed organizations with political agendas to participate in its online giving contest, Pepsi Refresh, won one of the two $250,000 prizes.

He added, “We’ve built a grass-roots effort to tell our families and friends to vote for us, and now we learn that we’re up against a political machine.” Through Pepsi Refresh, Pepsi is giving more than $20 million to charities this year, allowing 1,000 organizations to compete for grants of $5,000, $25,000, $50,000 and $250,000 each month. Online voters decide who wins. The complaint is another example of concern over nonprofit groups using tax-exempt dollars for political purposes in the current election cycle. On Wednesday, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a letter to the I.R.S. asking it to investigate the use of tax-exempt groups for political purposes. The contest rules state that applications cannot be for projects that would advance, lobby or expand membership for a political party, candidate or cause. Groups belonging to the Progressive Slate, many of which are skilled at voter registration and community organizing, are collectively working to help each other win the contest. The strategy is proving successful: as of Thursday evening, eight of the top 10 contestants in the $50,000 category were Slate members, and two members were among the top five contestants vying for $250,000. Many of their Web sites promote liberal agendas, featuring comments from MoveOn.org, recommending LeftyBlogs.com, and displaying membership lists that include labor unions. They are led by the Center for Progressive Leadership, a nonprofit group whose eight-member board includes two Democratic members of the House of Representatives; Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and the former lieutenant governor of Maryland; Matt Dunn, a Democrat who failed to win the party’s nomination to be governor of Vermont; and Mike Lux, a Democratic political operative who helped found the organization. Peter Murray, president of the center, said Arms Wide Open’s complaint had no merit and was nothing more than a competitive tactic in the final hours of the September competition. “These are all nonpartisan, nonprofit charitable organizations,” Mr. Murray said. “The projects that are seeking support have no political or advocacy or lobbying elements to them whatsoever. They are for helping kids, young people, helping the homeless, helping the poor.” Peter Land, a Pepsi spokesman, said, “We evaluated each idea solely on the basis of the merits, and each met our guidelines, which state that an idea cannot support or endorse any political candidate or party.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/u-s-approves-coca-colas-buy-of-big-bottler/?ref=pepsicoinc">U.S. Approves Coca-Cola's Buy of Big Bottler<date>September 28, 2010, 6:25 am</date><text>Coca-Cola won approval from the United States and Canada to buy the North American operations of its largest bottler on the condition that it safeguards rival Dr Pepper Snapple Group‘s confidential business information, Reuters said. The United States Federal Trade Commission and Canadian Competition Bureau both approved the deal, the world’s largest soft-drink maker said on Monday. The next step would be for shareholders of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, to approve the deal in a vote scheduled for Oct 1. A Stifel Nicolaus analyst, Mark Swartzberg, said he expected the deal to close as soon as next week. Coke announced the deal in February, just as archrival PepsiCo was closing a similar deal of its own. At that time, the F.T.C. reached a similar decision for PepsiCo regarding Dr Pepper’s business information.

Proxy Voting Skirts Review Guidelines, Documents Show<date>Published: September 16, 2010</date><text>The University of California, which prides itself as a leader on social and environmental issues, voted against hundreds of shareholder resolutions designed to promote human rights, environmental sustainability and efforts to fight discrimination, a review of U.C.’s voting record shows.The resolutions involved corporations like Exxon Mobil, PepsiCo and Occidental Petroleum and pertained to about one-third of the university’s $65 billion investment portfolio, a portfolio that includes some 5,000 companies. Like many other universities, U.C. employs a private firm to manage its investments and vote on its behalf. Under U.C.’s proxy voting guidelines, the university is required to review case by case all shareholder resolutions that are “controversial or relate to social issues.” But thousands of documents obtained from sources and under a California Public Records Act request by The Bay Citizen show that, over the past two years, Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy voting service, voted on behalf of U.C. against hundreds of resolutions that appeared to fall within the university’s guidelines. The documents show that the university voted against nonbinding resolutions that would have encouraged companies to set goals for lower emissions of greenhouse gases, carry out policies prohibiting discrimination against individuals based on sex or sexual identity, report political contributions, form human rights committees and improve treatment of animals. The university voted against 188 such resolutions in 2008, and at least 50 in 2009. Melvin Stanton, the university’s associate chief investment officer, said in an e-mail that U.C. focused primarily on growing its investments. Mr. Stanton added that no evidence existed of “a significant correlation between proposals brought by shareholders/activist groups and additional shareholder value,” on social or environmental issues. “Our focus is doing what is best to improve the financial wherewithal of a particular company,” Mr. Stanton said in a telephone interview. “We’re not really focusing on social issues.” But critics say the university is violating its own policy by failing to review issues touching on social responsibility and the environment before it votes against them. “If the issue has to do with a company that’s running sweatshops in India, then U.C. is supposed to look at that company and say, ‘Should we stay invested in that company?’ ” said D’Artagnan Scorza, a former student representative on the U.C. Board of Regents and a U.C.L.A. graduate student. A student activist group, U.C. Responsible Investments Coalition, of which Mr. Scorza is a founding member, is encouraging U.C. to adopt a proxy voting committee of students, faculty members and administrators. Nine percent of American universities have such committees, according to the 2010 College Sustainability Report Card by the Sustainable Endowments Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting sustainability in college campus operations and endowment practices. Mr. Stanton said U.C. was adhering to its policy. According to the university, the proxy service uses a coding system to categorize each resolution, including those involving environmental, social and governance issues, to ensure that votes comply with U.C. policy. The university’s proxy voting system is under review, he said. Until 2001, regents voted on each shareholder resolution individually. But as the university’s portfolio grew, from fewer than 200 companies to more than 5,000, the university shifted management of some of those investments from its internal staff to “external equity managers,” a U.C. spokesman said. The money in those accounts comes from state and employee contributions, individual donations and student fees, among other sources, according to the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. Over the past year, some students have urged the university to divest from companies doing business in Israel in response to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the 1980s, U.C. spearheaded the anti-apartheid divestment movement, which persuaded universities to terminate holdings in companies doing business in South Africa. In 2009, U.C. divested from companies doing business in Sudan in response to the genocide in Darfur. Students said they were not asking U.C. to move its investments, only to use them as leverage for social change. “We’re not saying vote one way or the other; we’re saying pay attention to it,” Mr. Scorza said. In May 2008, the Unitarian Universalist Committee, a shareholder of PepsiCo, submitted a resolution that Pepsi recognize water as a human right. The proposal noted that Pepsi’s water-use license was revoked in 2003 in India after the company was accused of “overconsuming and depleting community groundwater.” U.C. voted against the resolution, which failed.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/nyregion/04cheez.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Cheese Whatevers, City Has Them by the Handful<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>If you lined up, end to end, all the Cheez Doodles that Wise Foods produced in one year’s time, a thin crunchy row of bright orange, cheese-dusted corn puffs would stretch from Times Square to the Outback Steakhouse in Orange, Conn., just west of New Haven (about 72 miles).About 1,200 pounds of a rival snack, Cheese Curls, are manufactured each hour at the Herr Foods plant in Nottingham, Pa., including the Jalapeño Popper, Honey Cheese and Grilled Cheese flavors. Cheetos, the top-selling cheese puff in America, generates about $4 billion in annual retail sales around the world for PepsiCo. On Tuesday morning, Erich Buchrieser, 36, was taking his two dogs on a pleasant stroll on 36th Street in Astoria, Queens, when he was suddenly asked his preference: Cheez Doodles, Cheetos, Cheese Balls, Cheese Curls. He is a vegan, and a personal trainer, but still he had his mind made up: Cheez Doodles. “I don’t really think of them as chips,” Mr. Buchrieser said. “With a Cheez Doodle, it’s a completely different experience. It’s more a textural thing.” Cheese-flavored junk food — of the ball, tube and curl varieties that have been staples on grocery store shelves for decades — is suddenly in the news. The reason: the man credited with inventing Cheez Doodles, Morrie Yohai, died on July 27 at his home in Kings Point, N.Y. He was 90 years old. A husband, father and grandfather. Born in Harlem, raised in the Bronx. Fought in World War II. Wise Foods now produces 15 million pounds of Cheez Doodles annually, a large number of which are consumed by the men, women and children of New York City. For many New Yorkers, the death of Mr. Yohai accomplished a seemingly impossible feat — humanizing the Cheez Doodle. There was now a man, a face, a back story to a product that seemed ageless, fatherless. “Wow,” said Kevin Miles, 33, upon being informed, inside a bodega on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx, of Mr. Yohai’s passing. “That’s like if Colonel Sanders of KFC passed away. A lot of kids grew up on Cheez Doodles. There’s going be a little hole in their hearts for the inventor.” (Mr. Miles seemed unaware that Harland Sanders, the Kentucky Fried Chicken founder better known as the Colonel, died 30 years ago.) There is more of everything in New York. For reasons that no one has adequately studied or explained, this truism also applies to cheesy corn puffs. New Yorkers have more of a choice of Cheez Doodle-esque snacks than consumers in other parts of the country, and it could be argued that as a result they eat more of them than other Americans. Cheez Doodles are available mostly in the Northeast; there are people who live in Los Angeles who have never heard of them. But in New York City, the shelves of thousands of bodegas and grocery stores are stocked with countless national and regional brands, offering subtle differences in color, flavor, shape and price, so much so that people are often getting the brands confused. Herr’s makes Cheese Curls, for instance, but so does Utz, which is based in Hanover, Pa. Wise’s Cheez Doodles also come in cheese-ball form, sold in a plastic barrel, but Utz’s Cheese Balls are available in a 35-ounce barrel as well. Agustin Diaz, 22, a cashier at a Bravo supermarket in Astoria, had this reaction when told that the inventor of Cheez Doodles had died: “What’s his name? Don’t tell me it’s Cheeto or something. Like Gary Cheeto? You know how they name things after people.” In the world of mass-marketed tube-shaped cornmeal snacks, Cheetos actually came before Cheez Doodles. Cheetos were introduced nationally in 1948, one of the original snack foods produced by the Frito Company, years before it merged with H. W. Lay &amp; Company to form Frito-Lay Inc., now a division of PepsiCo. The first Cheez Doodles were produced in 1964. Mr. Yohai was the man behind the Cheez Doodle. Charles Elmer Doolin was the one behind the Cheeto. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Mr. Doolin, the founder of the Frito Company and the son of an inventor, experimented in a little kitchen next to his office in Dallas. “We were taste-testers, guinea pigs,” Mr. Doolin’s daughter, Kaleta Doolin, 60, said of her and her four siblings. Ms. Doolin, who is writing a book called “Fritos Pie: The Family Story of the Frito Company,” says when she sees people eating Cheetos and Fritos, she thinks of her father, who died in 1959. She prefers Fritos. Her 20-year-old son prefers Cheetos. “Maybe it’s a generation thing,” she said. It was not until 1976 that Herr’s began producing its Cheese Curls. Edwin Herr, 55, did not invent the snack, but he has devoted much of his life to refining the taste of them. “What we looked for then and what we still look for today is a Cheese Curl that has the perfect texture, and that texture is crunchy on the outside, but as it hits the palate it dissolves,” said Mr. Herr, the president of Herr’s and the son of its founder, James S. Herr. “It has to do with where you get your cornmeal. It has a lot to do with the cheese blend.” In the delis and bodegas of New York, cheese puffs come down to dollars and cents, and not very many of them, it turns out. The manager of the Oscar L. Inc. convenience store in Hell’s Kitchen estimated that each week, he usually sells about one 24-package box of Cheetos and one box of Cheez Doodles. The weekly profit on both boxes: about $10. He was asked why he even bothered. “We need to,” said the manager, Sang Bae, 50. “Some people come in looking for it.”</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Oil Spill Donations Are Small, but Some Companies Step Up<date>Published: August 2, 2010</date><text>CORPORATE and individual donations after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico have paled in comparison to responses to other disasters.The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that six weeks after the April 20 explosion that caused the disaster, about $4 million had been donated to relief efforts, compared with more than $580 million within eight days of Hurricane Katrina and more than $560 million within 17 days of the earthquake in Haiti. Now Pepsi is donating $1.3 million through its Pepsi Refresh Project, which uses a Web site, refresheverything.com, to determine grant winners by popular vote. That sum is in addition to $20 million that Pepsi has vowed to give away in 2010 in the cause marketing effort, the term for collaborating with nonprofit organizations to bolster both charities and the reputations of companies. The company will award 32 Do Good for the Gulf grants: two for $250,000 and 10 each for $50,000, $25,000 and $5,000. Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback, has signed on as a spokesman to promote the effort. To qualify, grants must not overlap with official cleanup efforts. Voting on about 300 submissions will continue through Aug. 31, with winners announced on Sept. 22. “Most Americans have been sitting back and seeing the gulf and feeling upset and a little helpless about how to help, and the Pepsi Refresh Project gives them a vehicle to put their ideas into action and make a difference,” said Lauren Hobart, chief marketing officer for sparkling brands at PepsiCo. Nicole Wallace, a senior writer at The Chronicle of Philanthropy, who tracks disaster relief efforts, said, “What I’m hearing from folks is that companies are looking at the disaster in the gulf and thinking, ‘This is BP’s responsibility — why should I be making charitable contributions toward that?’ ” BP has vowed to compensate victims through a $20 billion fund, but beyond the fact that some would-be donors figure the company will make everyone whole, disasters caused by humans tend to draw subdued responses. “Since the BP crisis is a manmade disaster versus a natural disaster, it’s easy for people to point fingers at BP and the government, and for the government and BP to point fingers at each other,” said Alison DaSilva, executive vice president of Cone L.L.C., which helps companies with philanthropic marketing. “So it’s a little bit of the blame game, and that hardens the compassions of both consumers and companies to help out,” Ms. DaSilva said.  Still, some companies are stepping up, like Chevron, which donated $750,000 to the Audubon Society for a volunteer response center in Moss Point, Miss. The dishwashing liquid Dawn, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand, has for three decades donated products and money to the International Bird Rescue Research Center, which cleans soiled wildlife with diluted Dawn. It shipped 2,000 bottles to bird-rescue sites in the gulf region. Teva, the shoe company that makes waterproof sports sandals, gave $100,000 to the Waterkeeper Alliance, an advocacy group for clean water, a cause of concern for many Teva-wearing kayakers. “There’s a consumer belief that BP is going to take care of the cleanup and there’s not a need for other organizations to take care of this, but we were just afraid that it was just going to take too long for all the money to funnel out regardless of who was responding,” said Joel Heath, marketing director at Teva, part of Deckers Outdoor Corporation. S.C. Johnson distributed 5,000 units of its Off! insect repellent to volunteers in cleanup areas that are rife with mosquitoes, and donated $25,000 to the National Wildlife Refuge Association, which operates refuges in the area of the spill. Borders, the book chain, gave almost $38,000, part of its receipts for a week in June, to the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana for oil spill relief efforts.  Regional companies also are helping. Abita Brewing Company of Abita Springs, La., is selling what it calls a “charitable brew,” named S.O.S., which was first bottled on July 16. It will donate 75 cents for every 22-ounce bottle sold. Hooters of America, the Atlanta-based chain of more than 450 restaurants, issued a press release on June 11 that said, “Hooters Girls Donate Their Pantyhose to Create Booms and Absorb up to 1 Million Gallons of Oil in the Gulf of Mexico.” Waitresses, who wear pantyhose as part of their skimpy uniforms, donated more than 100,000 torn pairs, which were sent to two organizations that collect hair and fur from salons and pet groomers and stuff it into the legs of pantyhose to make booms that absorb oil. But on May 21, three weeks before Hooters’ announcement, cleanup officials announced that they would not use hair booms, which absorb more water and less oil than widely available commercial booms — and tend to sink. “Individuals and organizations are asked to discontinue collection of hair for the hair boom,” said the Deepwater Horizon Incident Joint Information Center. “Regardless, we still made the donation,” said Alexis Aleshire, a Hooters spokeswoman. She said Hooters “hadn’t really talked to” Matter of Trust, the organization that collects hair and stockings, since then. The group’s Web site, matteroftrust.org, says that all 19 donated warehouses in the gulf are full and that it is not accepting more hair. Ms. DaSilva, of Cone, says such confusion underscores the fact that the philanthropic responses to the spill have not been as well choreographed as those to other disasters. “All those barbershops donated hair and others donated pantyhose because there was no real compelling call to action,” she said. “With natural disasters you can donate to international relief organizations and you know the money is going to help people in need. But there wasn’t a clear ask. There wasn’t an Oxfam or Red Cross to stand up and say, ‘Here’s what we need, and here’s what you can do.’ ”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/business/media/19adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi Campaign Restarts the Cola Wars<date>Published: July 19, 2010</date><text>THE cola wars shaped not just the soft drink industry but also Madison Avenue, inspiring the satirical newspaper The Onion to declare, in a 1997 headline, “Ad Industry Veterans Honored With Cola War Memorial.” Now Pepsi is engaging in a bit of war re-enactment, remaking a well-known comparative commercial, but with a twist, replacing Coke and Pepsi with the sugarless versions Coke Zero and Pepsi Max.The original ad, by BBDO and directed by Joe Pytka, had its premiere during the Super Bowl in 1995. In it, a Pepsi delivery driver pulls into a diner where a Coke truck is parked and sits down at the counter several seats away from the other driver. The jukebox needle drops on “Get Together,” by the Youngbloods. “Good song,” the Pepsi driver says. “Great song,” replies the other, and then the two shake hands, sit side by side, and pull out their wallets to show pictures of their children, laughing. The Coke driver slides a can of his product toward the Pepsi driver, who takes a sip, smiles and returns it, but when the Coke driver reciprocates by taking a sip of the Pepsi, he likes it so much that he will not return it. Their expressions suddenly turn furious and, in a final shot from outside the diner, a chair flies through the window. The commercial has been viewed more than 1.7 million times on YouTube. The new spot, by the TBWA/Chiat/Day division of TBWA Worldwide and directed again by Mr. Pytka, uses the same setup, except this time the drivers drink Coke Zero and Pepsi Max, and the song is “Why Can’t We Be Friends?” by War. Also different: when the Coke driver takes a long sip of the Pepsi Max, the Pepsi driver pulls out his smartphone to record him, taps the screen a few times, and says, “YouTube.” This time it is not a chair but the two drivers who crash through the diner window. “I was never happy with the old ending,” said Mr. Pytka, 71, who directed his first Pepsi commercial in the 1970s. “I had shot a version with the guys coming out the window, and we had a long discussion, and Pepsi was concerned with the violence. The ending is completely satisfying now.” The commercial, scheduled to appear on Monday, even has a cameo: Art LeFleur, who played the Pepsi driver in the commercial 15 years ago, now plays the owner of the diner. Introduced in Britain and Italy in 1993, and widely available in Europe ever since, Pepsi Max was not introduced in the United States until 2007. The sugarless cola, which is sweetened with a combination of aspartame and acesulfame potassium, contains nearly twice the caffeine of Diet Pepsi, and also contains ginseng. A 2009 report by Mintel, the market research firm, said the soda’s sales had been “impressive,” even during the economic downturn, “likely by attracting price-sensitive energy drink users.” Diet Pepsi is more popular with women, but about 60 percent of Pepsi Max drinkers are men, according to Lauren Hobart, chief marketing officer of the sparkling brands division of PepsiCo. Diet sodas popular with men, like Pepsi One, Pepsi Max and Coke Zero, which many in Europe refer to as “bloke Coke,” avoid a word to which marketers believe men are averse: “diet.” (It is a widely held view in the weight-loss industry that men are more apt to say they need to “get in shape” than “go on a diet.”) Ms. Hobart said “while some of our past advertising was more overtly about being the diet cola for men, there’s still a lot of women drinking Pepsi Max, so it doesn’t make sense to be so specifically gender focused.” Among the company’s sugarless brands, Pepsi Max is popular with Gen X and Diet Pepsi with baby boomers. “Boomers generally grew up drinking Diet Pepsi but Gen X has been raised with more choices, and we’re trying to provide more choices that may meet their needs differently,” Ms. Hobart said. “The word ‘diet’ is more about what’s not in the can than what is. One of the things we like about Pepsi Max is it’s more about what the drink is — the fact that you can have zero calories with maximum taste — than what it is not.” Reanimating the ad put Pepsi’s current agency in the awkward position of executing another agency’s concept. “We all loved that original spot, so it’s almost like when a musical artist does a cover of a song,” said Rob Schwartz, chief creative officer of TBWA/Chiat/Day. Also, Mr. Schwartz’s agency and BBDO are both owned by Omnicon. “They’re cousins of ours, so it’s O.K.,” Mr. Schwartz joked. His agency also works on another rivalry campaign, the PC vs. Mac commercials for Apple, in which the actor and writer John Hodgman plays the personification of Microsoft as comically inept. In those ads, “we know from Frame 1 the winner and the loser,” Mr. Schwartz said. “We know that Microsoft is not going to win that battle; they’re too big and too clumsy.” But the cola rivalry calls for “less disparagement,” he said. “To me Coke and Pepsi is one of those rivalries that’s no different than the Yankees and Red Sox,” Mr. Schwartz said. “We do see them as a worthy adversary.” With the country engaged in two real wars, there is perhaps something quaint, even comforting, about one between carbonated beverages. “People love the cola wars,” said Ms. Hobart, of Pepsi. “People identify themselves in many cases as ‘I’m a Pepsi person’ or ‘I’m a Coke person.’ The rivalry is just a very integral part of our heritage for both Pepsi and Coke.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/coke-coughs-up-715-million-in-dr-pepper-deal/?ref=pepsicoinc">Coke Pours $715 Million Into Dr Pepper Deal<date>June 8, 2010, 6:14 am</date><text>Coca-Cola will pay Dr Pepper Snapple Group $715 million for the right to continue selling Dr Pepper drinks once it acquires its North American bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, The Associated Press reported. After completing the buyout of the United States operations of Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coke will distribute Dr Pepper in the United States and Canada Dry in the Northeastern part of the country, where they are currently distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises. It will distribute Canada Dry, C’Plus and Schweppes in Canada. The agreement follows a similar deal between Dr Pepper and PepsiCo, whose agreement to buy its own top North American bottlers led it to pay Dr Pepper Snapple $900 million to continue selling Dr Pepper, Crush and Schweppes. Shares of Dr Pepper were down 1.7 percent on Monday as some investors were disappointed with the payout, while Coca-Cola shares were flat. “The terms and cash amount are in line with the previous deal with PepsiCo, however we believe some investors expected a higher payment to come from Coke,” a Credit Suisse analyst, Carlos Laboy, said in a research note. “We have heard from investors who were expecting the number to be north of what PepsiCo paid.” Go to Article from The Associated Press via The New York Times » Go to Press Release from Coca-Cola » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/business/media/26adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Promoting a Potato Chip Using Many Farmers, and Less Salt<date>Published: May 25, 2010</date><text>IN a campaign for Lay’s that features actual farmers who grow potatoes used to make the chips, the farmers are meant to appear just as they do in life: genuine, simple, plain-spoken, salt of the earth.Oops. Strike that, given the concern among food activists over the amount of sodium in snacks like potato chips. Rather, let it be said that the campaign, now under way, is intended to help consumers think of Lay’s as a food rather than a snack. The campaign, by an agency in Toronto named Juniper Park, expands on an effort the agency introduced last year that was centered on farmers who grow potatoes for the maker of Lay’s, the Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo. The new elements for 2010 include significantly more ads for local markets, with regional farmers as the stars; an online “Happiness Exhibit” photo gallery at the brand’s Web site, lays.com, which reinforces the theme of the campaign, “Happiness is simple”; five new regional flavors like Tangy Carolina BBQ and Southwest Cheese and Chiles; and reformulated versions of the Kettle Cooked varieties of Lay’s.  The stakes are high for the campaign. Lay’s is the third best-selling PepsiCo product of any kind, according to the PepsiCo annual report, ahead of brands like Gatorade, Diet Pepsi and Tropicana; Lay’s trails only Pepsi-Cola and Mountain Dew. Sales for Lay’s last year were estimated at more than $2 billion out of PepsiCo sales that totaled $43.2 billion. Sales growth for Lay’s had slowed to less than 1 percent from 2005 to 2007, raising concern among executives at Frito-Lay as well as PepsiCo. “We had some health and wellness headwinds,” said Gannon Jones, vice president for portfolio marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex., so “in 2008 we started a journey of repositioning” for Lay’s. That effort paid off with “more growth in ’08,” he added, “and exceptional growth in ’09.” The reworking of Lay’s included an acknowledgment of consumer concerns about ingredients indicated by the results of a survey in which a third of respondents said there were “not real potatoes” in Lay’s, Mr. Jones said. “We knew we needed to address that.” So ads were produced to convey the list of “three simple ingredients” in the main variety of Lay’s, called Lay’s Classic: potatoes, “all-natural” sunflower oil and “a dash of salt.” (There are some artificial ingredients in most of the flavored varieties, Mr. Jones said, but “we’re moving to all-natural ingredients.”) Research found that “people were looking for reasons to rekindle their love for Lay’s,” Mr. Jones said, but the motivation to indulge — as encapsulated by the brand’s longtime theme, “Bet you can’t eat just one” — needed to be replaced with a portrayal of Lay’s as “a permissible pleasure.” “We discovered the best way to tell our story was through people,” he added. Enter the farmers, more than 80 of them from 28 states like California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas. The campaign includes, in addition to its presence on lays.com, television commercials, magazine ads, signs in stores and a wooden billboard, planned to go up in San Francisco, that is being hand-carved. There are more than 150 elements of the campaign customized for local markets, Mr. Jones estimated. The growth in Lay’s sales began after the brand’s creative account was shifted to Juniper Park, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, from Element 79 Partners, an Omnicom agency in Chicago. As Juniper Park started working on Lay’s, the agency found that consumers were surprised “this big brand is grown and made across the country,” said Terry Drummond, executive creative director at Juniper Park. “We want to put the hometown face on it,” he added, “and the hometown face is our farmers.” Frito-Lay’s spending in major media to advertise Lay’s has been remarkably consistent the last three years, according to data from the Kantar Media unit of WPP: $31.9 million in 2007, $32 million in 2008 and $31.9 million in 2009.  Many food marketers are seeking ways to cut salt in their products. For instance, H. J. Heinz said this month it would reformulate its famous ketchup to contain about 15 percent less sodium. And PepsiCo is testing a salt with consumers that the company hopes will reduce the sodium levels in Lay’s Classic potato chips by 25 percent. That change would be “absolutely good,” said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy organization in Washington. “Frito-Lay has been trying to improve the chips and make them less of a target,” Mr. Jacobson said, citing a switch to using oil “that’s actually healthful” although “still loaded with calories.” “About a third of a potato chip is oil and two-thirds is potato, which is basically a light starch,” he added, “and Americans are eating too much starch.” It is a misconception that potato chips “are a major source of sodium in the American diet,” Mr. Jacobson said — unless, of course, “you eat a lot of them.” Still, “potato chips are a mixed bag,” he added, no pun intended, because when “you put a potato chip next to a peach, it’s no contest; a peach is what we ought to be eating for a snack, no matter how many potato farmers they show in the ads.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/economy/19leonhardt.html?ref=pepsicoinc">The Battle Over Taxing Soda<date>Published: May 18, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTONThe classic way for lobbyists to defend their client’s interest is to insist that they are not actually defending their client’s interest. Really, they say, they are just looking out for ordinary Americans. Tobacco lobbyists spent years fighting regulation by claiming to be defending individual freedom, not the profits of tobacco companies. Detroit’s lobbyists did much the same to push back against seat belt and pollution laws. Wall Street has spent months opposing the financial regulation bill in the name of families and small businesses. The latest example comes from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and the rest of the soda industry, which is trying to defeat a soda tax now before the District of Columbia Council. The industry has succeeded recently in beating back similar taxes in New York and Philadelphia, and in keeping one out of the federal health overhaul bill. But the Washington Council seems to be seriously considering a penny-per-ounce tax on nondiet sodas, energy drinks and artificial juices. Council members are set to vote on the issue next week. This soda debate is probably going to be around for some time. Cities and counties, desperate to find money to pay for schools and roads, are starting to see a soda tax as a way to raise revenue. The tax also appears to be one of the most promising ways to attack obesity, given the huge role sugary drinks play in the epidemic. “It’s wrong for the government to stand idle in the face of an epidemic of obesity that’s hurting the quality of life and the health of our residents,” says Mary Cheh, the Council member who has proposed the tax, “when we have policy choices in front of us that can materially affect the problem.” The soda industry, of course, is fighting back with newspaper and radio advertisements, among other things. It says a tax would most hurt “hard-working, low- and middle-income families, elderly residents and those living on fixed incomes” and would destroy jobs. Ellen Valentino, an industry official, recently told The Washington Post that companies would spend “whatever it takes” to make their case.  The argument for a soda tax is the same as the argument for a tax on tobacco, pollution or, for that matter, banks that take big, expensive risks. When an activity imposes costs on society, economists have long said that the activity should be taxed. Doing so accomplishes two goals: it discourages the activity, and it raises money to help pay society’s costs. In the case of soda, those costs come in the form of medical bills for diabetes, heart disease and other side effects of obesity. We’re all paying these bills, via Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance premiums. Obesity has become a significant cause of our swelling long-term budget deficit. And soda is a huge reason the country is so much more obese. The typical American consumes almost three times as many calories from sugary drinks as in the late 1970s. This increase accounts for about half the total per-capita rise in calorie consumption over the same period. Remember, many of these drinks have zero nutritional benefit — unlike meat, cheese or juice. As Kelly Brownell, a Yale researcher, says, the link between obesity and soda is scientifically stronger than the link between obesity and any other type of food or beverage. We’re drinking more soda for several reasons. Above all, the inflation-adjusted price has fallen 34 percent since the late 1970s, largely because it can be manufactured more cheaply than in the past. Meanwhile, the average real cost of fruits and vegetables has risen more than 30 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Coincidentally, Ms. Cheh’s proposed tax would roughly reverse the drop in the price of soda over the last three decades, at least for the popular 12-pack of cans. An extra penny per ounce on a 12-pack would add $1.44 — or about 30 percent — to the current typical $4.75 price. (The tax rate would be lower for single-serve bottles and higher for bulk purchases.) Most of the revenue would then be used to improve the miserable quality of many school lunches in Washington. One blog, Better D.C. School Food, has taken to documenting these lunches, with a series of photographs of bland bread, processed cheese and reconstituted beef. So what about Coke’s and Pepsi’s arguments against the tax? They are certainly right that less soda consumption could cost the soda industry some jobs. But it would eliminate jobs from the overall economy only if people put the money they had been spending on soda into their savings accounts. That’s highly unlikely. Instead, people will probably spend more on other food and drinks or, say, go to the movies more often — and create jobs in those industries. The argument that the tax will hurt the poor is a little more serious. The average American now drinks almost a gallon of sweetened beverages each week. If the tax passes, any Washington resident who continued to do so would have to pay about $1.20 each week in soda taxes. Yet even that number overstates the cost, because the tax would surely affect how much soda many people drank. One of the lessons of the recent rise in cigarette taxes is that big price changes can lead to big behavior changes, even with an addictive product like tobacco. Teenagers, the biggest soda drinkers of all, are especially price sensitive. People who cut their soda drinking from a gallon a week to merely three-quarters of a gallon — that’s still 96 ounces, more than twice the consumption level of the late 1970s — would be spending no more on soda than they are now. I suspect that some Washington Council members, in the face of opposition from the soda makers and distributors, may be tempted to support a weakened version of the tax. One option would simply be to extend the normal 6 percent sales tax to sweetened beverages. Like food, they are currently exempt. But here’s the problem with that idea: small tax changes don’t always change behavior, as a recent study by the RAND Corporation found. So a small soda tax could actually have a worse impact on some families’ budgets than a substantial one — by raising the price of soda without affecting consumption. No wonder the American Heart Association supports the penny-per-ounce proposal. Such a tax would certainly raise the cost of living for some heavy soda drinkers, just as cigarette taxes have stretched the budgets of some smokers and mandatory seat belts have added costs to car production. But consider the benefits from those other public health initiatives. They have vastly outweighed the costs. Someday, we will probably look back on our gallon-a-week soda habit the way we now look back on allowing children to ride without seat belts or listening to doctors who endorsed Camel cigarettes. We will wonder what we were thinking. Coke and Pepsi, unfortunately, seem willing to do whatever it takes to delay that day.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/dining/12gardens.html?ref=pepsicoinc">The Rise of Company Gardens<date>Published: May 11, 2010</date><text>PURCHASE, N.Y.HERE at the world headquarters of PepsiCo, the masterminds behind $60 billion worth of Mountain Dew, Cheetos and Rice-A-Roni roam polished hallways. But a five-minute walk away is the organic corporate vegetable garden, where spreadsheets and performance reviews give way to basil starts and black peppermint plants. Employees can sneak out for a quick lunchtime weeding session and cart home the harvest. As companies have less to spend on raises, health benefits and passes to the water park, a fashionable new perk is emerging: all the carrots and zucchini employees can grow. Carved from rolling green office park turf or tucked into containers on rooftops and converted smoking areas, these corporate plots of dirt spring from growing attention to sustainability and a rising interest in gardening. But they also reflect an economy that calls for creative ways to build workers’ morale and health. “It’s almost as if they are saying, ‘Yeah, we couldn’t give you a pay increase and yeah, times are tough, but this is something we can do to help improve the quality of your life,’ ” said Bruce Butterfield, the research director for the nonprofit National Gardening Association. In corporate language, there is very little benchmarking on the numbers of gardens. But dozens of companies in several parts of the country have recently installed them or are digging them this spring. That Google, Yahoo and Sunset magazine have started organic gardens is not a surprise. They are, after all, based in Silicon Valley, where the work force is almost as comfortable composting as it is programming. But the trend has caught on at more-traditional companies, too. At the headquarters for the Kohl’s department stores near Milwaukee, the organic gardens provide vegetables for a local food bank and a place for children at the company child care center to play. Abundant crops of pumpkins and tomatoes grow at the Toyota plant in Georgetown, Ky. Still, what seems like a good idea in the conference room doesn’t always translate to the field. People don’t always follow through. It’s the same dynamic that fills the office refrigerator with old yogurt containers and moldy lunches. At PepsiCo, most of the plots are still weedy and empty. The weather has been cool and so, gardeners say, has enthusiasm. Last year when the company first turned over a plot the size of two tennis courts to peppers and tomatoes, 200 of the 1,450 employees here signed up, mailroom workers and midlevel administrators alike. This year, the volunteers dwindled to about 75, and many of them have yet to ready their plots. So on Tuesday, Anu Malhotra from the food services division pulled on her gardening gloves and yanked weeds from small squares of land that weren’t even her own. “Corporate strategies had two plots last year, but they were always traveling, so we just kind of took over,” she said. At Aveda, which offers on-site massage and organic cafeteria food at its headquarters near Minneapolis, the garden is a chance for its 700 employees to take a break from their desks and take home fresh produce. Workers pay $10 for the season and in return, they get a share of the bounty. Picking up a hoe is optional, but encouraged. “It does seem like work, but it’s a different kind of work from our regular workday,” said Peggy Skinner, an employee who pushed to have the garden installed. Aveda employees sometimes need to be cajoled to take their turn at the weeds. This year, to keep on schedule, Ms. Skinner has devised a chore calendar and suggests twice-weekly gardening sessions. Reminder e-mail messages will be sent. For some employees, beanpoles quickly become just another part of the office scenery. On a visit last fall, the special self-watering “earth box” container garden on the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif., was filled with fewer actual gardeners than with workers hurrying through on their way back to their desks, cafeteria trays filled with free food balanced on their laptops. Nevertheless, the editors of Human Resource Executive magazine were so taken with the corporate-garden concept that last month they named the garden run by the employees of Haberman, a Minneapolis-based public relations firm, one of the top five benefits ideas of the year. True, some of the 24 workers at the firm still enjoy an afternoon mocha, but they also reach for the brussels sprouts and cucumbers packed into the company refrigerator. Even a scant crop of peas was passed around the conference room table as a snack. Kim McMartin, who lives in a condo in downtown Minneapolis, had never planted a thing until she stuck some green bean seeds into the ground at the Haberman garden last summer. Some were planted too deep. Others were too shallow. As a result, her beans came up crooked. This year, she vows to do better. The new corporate green thumb is not necessarily a sign that American business culture is becoming more agrarian-minded, said Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. It’s more about the popularity of backyard gardening. A National Gardening Association survey done in conjunction with Harris shows that 41 million Americans grew fruits and vegetables in 2009. That’s about 13 percent more than the year before.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Linking Customer Loyalty With Social Networking<date>Published: April 28, 2010</date><text>PEPSICO wants to sell its customers sodas whether they are near a grocery store, a restaurant or a gas station. With a new partnership that weaves its loyalty program into the location-based network Foursquare, PepsiCo gets a live notification when its customers are close to those sites, and can present offers that get them into the stores.“Being able to drive foot traffic into our restaurant partners and our retail partners is a huge opportunity, because that’s where our product is sold,” said B. Bonin Bough, director of social and emerging media for PepsiCo. “Ten blocks mean a lot.” Through smartphones that signal someone’s location, stores and brands like Starbucks, Tasti-D-Lite, Macy’s and Pepsi are getting live information about when and where people are shopping. Some companies are turning Foursquare into a virtual loyalty-card program, while others are creating their own location applications, offering customers discounts or other rewards for shopping. “It gives us immediate feedback for what’s going on in the marketplace,” said Margery Schelling, chief marketing officer of PepsiCo Foodservice. “That’s invaluable.” A phone is a simple replacement for a wallet stuffed with loyalty cards, but the real appeal for stores is in the location information provided by Foursquare and other location-based applications. Retailers can track when customers actually enter their stores. Such data can be used to learn things about store traffic, such as when men visit versus women. And it’s easier to note when the most loyal customers visit. “If you check into work, then you leave work, you check into a bank and then you check into a store, that’s a behavior that, in aggregate, we might use to transform the way we market to you in the offline world,” Mr. Bough said. “We might see dayparts that are more likely for you to check out of some place and go to the store, and we might do advertising during that specific daypart in that specific place.” Because consumers are electing to broadcast their location and signing up for these services, the privacy concerns aren’t enormous, another plus for marketers.  While Foursquare has a relatively small user base of about one million, the tactics companies are experimenting with could be extended to customers with a GPS-enabled smartphone, the companies say. Pepsi, in addition to beginning a Foursquare program, is also introducing a location-based iPhone application called Pepsi Loot through which customers can collect points toward free music downloads. “We believe it’s a real, new opportunity to transform loyalty programs in a way that we haven’t done before,” Mr. Bough said. Foursquare is sort of a social application meets game. Its members press a button upon arriving at various locations to “check in,” letting them accumulate points — they compete to be “mayor” of a certain site, or the person with the most check-ins at that site, and can unlock badges for completing certain activities. The designer Marc Jacobs, for instance, gave tickets to his fashion show to four people who unlocked a Marc Jacobs shopping badge. Members can also direct Foursquare to list nearby restaurants, banks or grocery stores, and see where their Foursquare pals are at that moment. In March, Foursquare introduced a tool that lets businesses see who is checking into their locations. It lists data like the total number of check-ins, the male-to-female ratio, the top days and times Foursquare visitors come, and the top visitors. “Foursquare hopes to tell them a little bit more about their loyal customer — who checks in when, where they go before and after,” said Tristan Walker, director of business development for Foursquare. Tasti-D-Lite wove Foursquare into its loyalty-card program this year. When someone registers the card online or visits the loyalty Web site, she can click to connect the card with her Foursquare account (along with Twitter or Facebook). Whenever the card is swiped after that, the customer accumulates Foursquare check-in points and Tasti-D-Lite loyalty points at once. “Imagine the amount of data we now have in order to make better marketing decisions, in order to make loyalty decisions, about our customers, as opposed to the paper punch cards we had before that didn’t do anything for us,” said B. J. Emerson, social technology officer for Tasti-D-Lite. Starbucks has been offering Foursquare badges when people visit a certain number of stores. “The next generation of that is potentially understanding a little bit more about loyalty as well,” Mr. Walker said. “We’re driving people to different stores. What about people who visit the same store over and over?”  The location-based opportunity is particularly big for consumer packaged goods brands like Pepsi. Those brands market their product heavily, but they depend on drugstores or restaurants to actually get consumers into stores. With Foursquare and apps that track consumers’ locations, Pepsi can strike a deal directly with the consumer. Pepsi’s Foursquare program will begin running in June. While the company is still working out details, Mr. Bough said that he expects that when a Foursquare user is near a Pepsi retailer, an offer to enroll the person in a Pepsi rewards system will appear. Once people are enrolled, whenever they check in at a grocery store or drugstore selling Pepsi, they will accumulate rewards points or badges that they can redeem for products or offers or donate toward charities. Separately, Pepsi Loot, to be introduced in mid-May, focuses on restaurants; about 200,000, including chains like Taco Bell, are participating. The app shows the participating Pepsi-serving restaurants on a map, includes menus for them, and allows consumers to sign in to those locations (that sign-in is done separately from a Foursquare check-in). Once they do, they accumulate points toward song downloads. The restaurants can layer in offers, too — Shakey’s is giving $3 off a large pizza for people who show the Pepsi Loot app, for instance. Macy’s, too, has announced that it will use an app from a company called Shopkick to send customers offers when they are in or near the department store. Rewards will be critical for getting more people to use Foursquare and similar applications, said Amy Manus, director of media at Nurun, a digital marketing firm that did not work on the campaign. “Offering something that is beneficial for consumers is going to be essential in mass adoption,” she said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/business/23pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">PepsiCo Raises Profit After Buying Two Bottlers<date>Published: April 22, 2010</date><text>PepsiCo said Thursday its first-quarter profit rose 26 percent after it acquired its two largest bottlers.Net income increased to $1.43 billion, or 89 cents a share, from $1.14 billion, or 72 cents, a year earlier, PepsiCo said. Earnings excluding some one-time items were 76 cents a share, just beating the 75 cents expected by industry analysts. PepsiCo completed the $7.8 billion purchase of its top two bottlers in March in an attempt to save $400 million a year and get control of its distribution system for drinks in North America. The company estimates it will spend $650 million for programs to cut annual expenses as it integrates the bottlers, up from the $400 million it previously predicted. Sales in the quarter rose 13 percent, to $9.37 billion from $8.26 billion, falling short of analysts’ estimates. Sales volume at PepsiCo Americas Foods grew 1 percent, helped by its Frito-Lay subsidiary. PepsiCo Americas Beverages’ volume declined 4 percent while the unit handling Africa, the Middle East and Asia raised snack volume 13 percent and beverage volume 10 percent. PepsiCo said it would take a $40 million charge in the second quarter related to the federal health care overhaul. The charge is a result mostly of a tax on federal subsidies that the company receives for providing a Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the chief financial officer, Hugh F. Johnston, said on a call with reporters. The company said it planned to buy back about $4.4 billion in shares this year. Stock in PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., fell $1.22, to $64.76 a share.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/realestate/18deal3.html?ref=pepsicoinc">The Pepsi Will Flow at the Move-In Party<date>Published: April 15, 2010</date><text>ROGELIO M.

(AP) — PepsiCo said Monday that it would buy back up to $15 billion worth of its own common stock through June 2013.Pepsi, whose brands include Gatorade, Quaker and Pepsi-Cola, said previously that it was buying about $4.4 billion worth of its shares this year. Some of the buybacks will be made under a 2007 repurchase authorization, which had $6.4 billion remaining at the start of the year and expires in June. The company also said Monday that it would increase its annual dividend by 7 percent, to $1.92, most likely starting on June 30 when it expects to pay its next quarterly dividend. The dividend will be paid to shareholders of record June 4, the company said. Last month PepsiCo, based in Purchase, cleared the final regulatory hurdle in a bid to buy its two biggest bottlers — the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas — allowing it to close the $7.8 billion deal.

The 64-ounce container of orange juice will drop to 59 ounces. The suggested retail price will remain at $3.59. The price of Tropicana’s gallon container of pure premium orange juice will rise from 5 percent to 8 percent. The suggested retail price now is $6.49. Citrus growers in Florida, the nation’s top orange producer, are struggling because of freezes this winter. This year’s orange crop is expected to be 19 percent smaller than last year’s, according to a report from the Agriculture Department on Wednesday. Florida had eight consecutive days of below-freezing temperatures in January. Growers said it was an unseasonably long freeze, though the damage was less than expected. Some of the oranges that survived are expected to be smaller than normal. Most of the oranges Florida produces are used to make juice. A Tropicana spokeswoman, Jamie Stein, said the company spent a while examining the impact of the freeze and wanted to make changes without affecting people’s grocery bills too much. That is why the company, based in Purchase, N.Y., chose to shrink its 64-ounce container rather than raise the price outright, although the price per ounce is higher. “We’re doing this so that we don’t have to take the price up on our core product,” she said. Food and beverage makers react to changing ingredient costs by raising prices, changing products sizes or both. It is a way to protect their profit margins, and in the case of shrinking packages, offer less to shoppers so they can still buy products without having to pay more money at once.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/26/business/26views.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Coke Adopts a Move It Scorned<date>Published: February 25, 2010</date><text>The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Muhtar Kent, threw cold water on its archrival PepsiCo’s decision to acquire its bottling subsidiary last year. So it came as some surprise this week to see Coke copying the transaction, with a takeover bid of about $13 billion announced for Coca-Cola Enterprises’ North American bottling operations. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Zhu Min was appointed special adviser to the managing director of the I.M.F. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The about-face does not mean the decision is not financially and strategically sound. The 1980s-era smoke-and-mirrors trick of spinning off asset-heavy businesses to focus exclusively on its secret-formula concentrate is outdated. Nonetheless, Mr. Kent seems like a charlatan for so recently dismissing the idea after Pepsi beat him to the punch. The numbers work for both Coke and its bottler. That is a bit surprising given they also did when Coke spun it off. Coke cleverly avoids paying cash for the assets it is acquiring. It will cancel its 34 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises, worth $3.4 billion, assume $8.9 billion of debt and absorb about $600 million of unfunded pension liabilities. In return, Coke will get control of a bottling system that needs to adapt. The separation of the bottler from the syrup was applauded by Wall Street back when fizzy drinks were growing fast and the Wal-Marts of the world didn’t have huge market share. But consumer behavior has changed. American customers want a variety of noncarbonated beverages, like the Dasani brand of water and Powerade energy drinks from Coke, which the bottlers don’t look after. And more shoppers buy drinks at superstores, which are more efficiently served by fewer large trucks from warehouses rather than tens of thousands of Enterprises dispatches from bottling plants. While this will require retooling, Coke still says it can squeeze out $350 million of synergies. So why all the glum faces from Coca-Cola shareholders? They sliced nearly $5 billion off its market cap. True, Coca-Cola Enterprises engineered a sweet deal. But there was only one plausible buyer for the assets, so it’s hard to argue Coke was swindled. And Coke is paying about the same multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that Pepsi paid for its bottling assets. Coke investors may simply resent being surprised. While the company’s reversal of a longtime strategy looks sensible, it came out of left field. Mr. Kent, and his predecessor, Neville Isdell, discounted Pepsi’s deal. A chief executive who changes his mind shows either great intellectual flexibility  or a tendency to waffle. Influence at the I.M.F. It’s no secret that China would like to match its rising financial weight with a greater say in the institutions that oversee the global economy. That includes a larger formal voice in the International Monetary Fund. For years, China has been shut out of influential positions at the I.M.F., which is dominated by Western countries. So the appointment this week of Zhu Min as a special adviser to the I.M.F. managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a welcome sign of change. China may have preferred garnering a more senior position. When Mr. Zhu was promoted to be a deputy governor of China’s central bank late in 2009, the assumption in China was that he would soon become a deputy managing director at the I.M.F. (Asia’s top job at the I.M.F. has long held by Japan.) China may have unseated Japan as the world’s largest holder of foreign reserves, but the fund’s board doesn’t appear ready to replace Japan just yet. This may be seen as entrenched interests resisting change. But it also reflects practical experience. When the I.M.F. last year expanded its emergency borrowing program by $500 billion, Japan contributed $100 billion before China committed $50 billion. As an adviser, Mr. Zhu will not have direct influence in driving the fund’s policy agenda. But he may have impact on the margins. He can offer guidance on how the I.M.F. can improve its bonds with Asian emerging markets  a relationship that was strained when the I.M.F. doled out remedies during the 1997 currency crisis. As a former executive at a large state-owned bank, he has knowledge of China’s financial system. Mr. Strauss-Kahn has made it clear that he favors giving emerging markets a greater say at the fund. But he cannot change the balance of power overnight at the I.M.F., which has been the subject of protracted negotiations. Mr. Zhu’s appointment may help speed up the process. But China is still some way from taking its place at the I.M.F.’s top table. ROB COX and WEI GU More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 26, 2010, on page B2 of the National edition.The chief executive of Coca-Cola, Muhtar Kent, threw cold water on its archrival PepsiCo’s decision to acquire its bottling subsidiary last year. So it came as some surprise this week to see Coke copying the transaction, with a takeover bid of about $13 billion announced for Coca-Cola Enterprises’ North American bottling operations. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News Zhu Min was appointed special adviser to the managing director of the I.M.F. Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The about-face does not mean the decision is not financially and strategically sound. The 1980s-era smoke-and-mirrors trick of spinning off asset-heavy businesses to focus exclusively on its secret-formula concentrate is outdated. Nonetheless, Mr. Kent seems like a charlatan for so recently dismissing the idea after Pepsi beat him to the punch. The numbers work for both Coke and its bottler. That is a bit surprising given they also did when Coke spun it off. Coke cleverly avoids paying cash for the assets it is acquiring. It will cancel its 34 percent stake in Coca-Cola Enterprises, worth $3.4 billion, assume $8.9 billion of debt and absorb about $600 million of unfunded pension liabilities. In return, Coke will get control of a bottling system that needs to adapt. The separation of the bottler from the syrup was applauded by Wall Street back when fizzy drinks were growing fast and the Wal-Marts of the world didn’t have huge market share. But consumer behavior has changed. American customers want a variety of noncarbonated beverages, like the Dasani brand of water and Powerade energy drinks from Coke, which the bottlers don’t look after. And more shoppers buy drinks at superstores, which are more efficiently served by fewer large trucks from warehouses rather than tens of thousands of Enterprises dispatches from bottling plants. While this will require retooling, Coke still says it can squeeze out $350 million of synergies. So why all the glum faces from Coca-Cola shareholders? They sliced nearly $5 billion off its market cap. True, Coca-Cola Enterprises engineered a sweet deal. But there was only one plausible buyer for the assets, so it’s hard to argue Coke was swindled. And Coke is paying about the same multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization that Pepsi paid for its bottling assets. Coke investors may simply resent being surprised. While the company’s reversal of a longtime strategy looks sensible, it came out of left field. Mr. Kent, and his predecessor, Neville Isdell, discounted Pepsi’s deal. A chief executive who changes his mind shows either great intellectual flexibility  or a tendency to waffle. Influence at the I.M.F. It’s no secret that China would like to match its rising financial weight with a greater say in the institutions that oversee the global economy. That includes a larger formal voice in the International Monetary Fund. For years, China has been shut out of influential positions at the I.M.F., which is dominated by Western countries. So the appointment this week of Zhu Min as a special adviser to the I.M.F. managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn is a welcome sign of change. China may have preferred garnering a more senior position. When Mr. Zhu was promoted to be a deputy governor of China’s central bank late in 2009, the assumption in China was that he would soon become a deputy managing director at the I.M.F.

But, like some of its predecessors, Pepsi Refresh has stumbled over its own rules. The tiny charity currently atop the rankings in one category of the contest accidentally got a little help from Pepsi itself. Materials submitted by the Joyful Heart Foundation, a charity started by Mariska Hargitay, one of the stars of “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,” to help victims of sexual assault, were updated by the staff at Pepsi after the submission deadline, which is against the contest rules. That upset some of the contestants who wondered whether Pepsi was doing favors for a celebrity. “I can’t edit my own submission, so how did she do it?” said one contestant, who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to jeopardize his chances of winning. Just an honest mistake, says Pepsi. “We didn’t follow our guidelines to the letter,” said Jill Beraud, chief marketing officer for the American beverages unit at Pepsi. “The bottom line is that we’ve learned from this and we’re moving on.” The company said it would give away three $250,000 prizes, instead of two as originally planned. The company worked with experts in social media in hopes of avoiding problems other companies have encountered. Ms. Beraud said that so far it had exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people who have voted, the number of submissions and the response from bottlers and employees. A thousand organizations compete for $5,000, $25,000, $50,000 and $250,000 grants in each month at least through the end of the year, using materials and information they must submit before each monthly contest begins. Those materials cannot be edited once the particular contest starts. But a video clip that is embedded in Joyful Heart’s pitch was clearly made after the submission deadline. Featuring Ms. Hargitay and Justine Ezarik, the blogosphere and Twitter phenom, the video incorporates a photo of the Pepsi Refresh Web site, which went up only after the submission deadline had passed. The Joyful Heart submission originally included a link to a video on YouTube, and the Pepsi staff decided it would be simpler for Pepsi Refresh voters to view the video directly on the Pepsi Refresh site. Ms. Beraud said she was certain the video had not given an advantage to Joyful Heart, which had 6 percent more votes than its closest competitor the day before and the day after the video was embedded. (Pepsi does not release vote totals, only rankings.)</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/business/media/05adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">An Advocacy Ad Elevates Interest in All the Ads<date>Published: February 4, 2010</date><text>VIEWERS look forward to the commercials shown during a Super Bowl because they know the spots will almost always be different from  and better than  the everyday ads they typically deride or ignore.

For 2010, the agency is adding an Adbowl application for the iPhone. There are several reasons for the additional interest in the spots that CBS will broadcast on Sunday. The biggest is the inclusion of what is being called the first advocacy ad to ever appear in a Super Bowl, a commercial from Focus on the Family, an evangelical organization that is opposed to abortion. The spot, featuring the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, has been the subject of one of the most intense tugs-of-war over an ad in many years. CBS is not disclosing beforehand the contents of the commercial or when during the game it will run, but that has not stopped advocates on both sides of the abortion issue from rallying supporters for or against the spot. For example, two organizations opposed to abortion, Americans United for Life Action and LifeNews.com, started a page on Facebook called Support Tebow’s Super Bowl Ad; as of Thursday afternoon, there were more than 168,100 fans. Planned Parenthood, which supports abortion rights, introduced on Wednesday an online commercial featuring two athletes  Sean James, who played for the Minnesota Vikings, and Al Joyner, an Olympic gold medalist  endorsing the right of a woman to make her own “decision about her health and her family.” Surveys by companies like Alterian, Nielsen and Zeta Interactive have reported that the Focus on the Family spot is the most-discussed of all potential Super Bowl commercials in online places like blogs and message boards. They also found extensive conversations about spots planned from other advertisers like Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Doritos, Taco Bell and Universal Pictures. The buzz suggests “there’ll be great dialogue about the commercials” after the game as well, said Nelson Marchioli, chief executive at Denny’s, which is buying three commercials in the game compared with one during the 2009 Super Bowl. “Last year, we got such a wonderful response, not only from customers but also from employees and franchisees,” Mr. Marchioli said. So “we wanted to plus it up” with additional spots, he added, as well as start a promotion on dennys.com to win free breakfasts earlier than it began last year. The Denny’s spots are being created by Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, a unit of the Omnicom Group. Another reason for the growing curiosity about the Super Bowl XLIV commercials is that the presence of the Focus on the Family spot is shining a brighter light on the contents of all the ads. For instance, a decision by CBS this week that Electronic Arts change the ending of its Super Bowl spot, promoting the new Dante’s Inferno video game, drew national attention. The company and its agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy, wanted to end the spot with the words “Go to hell,” but CBS said the phrase did not meet its broadcast standards; the wording was changed to “Hell awaits.” Likewise, decisions by CBS to reject commercials submitted by other advertisers were extensively covered, although such refusals are commonplace before most Super Bowls. CareerBuilder.com, GoDaddy.com and KGB, a text-message information service, were told some spots they sought to run did not meet standards for broadcast; all three replaced those spots with others that were accepted. And there were thousands of articles devoted to the refusal of CBS to accept a commercial from ManCrunch.com, a new gay dating Web site. CBS said the spot  depicting two men in a passionate clinch that resembled dirty dancing without the dancing  did not meet its broadcast standards. The network also said it was worried about the ability of the Web site to pay for the commercial. Executives at ManCrunch.com said they had the money and called the refusal discriminatory. Despite the interest in commercials that will not appear, advertisers say they are confident the spots they intend to run will be noticed. “I think we’re getting our fair share of attention,” said Rudy Wilson, vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex., a division of PepsiCo. Frito-Lay is back with another Crash the Super Bowl contest, asking consumers to create commercials for Doritos snacks. Three consumer-produced spots, from more than 4,000 entries, will run during the game; based on their performance in the Super Bowl Ad Meter conducted by USA Today, Frito-Lay could give away as much as $5 million in prize money. Last year, a Doritos commercial created by two brothers from Batesville, Ind., won $1 million. The Pepsi-Cola division of PepsiCo raised eyebrows when it said it would skip Super Bowl XLIV after more than two decades of sponsorship. “I can’t really speak for Pepsi’s decision,” Mr. Wilson said, adding, “At Doritos we’re happy and excited” about returning to the Super Bowl. “We’re the biggest, baddest, boldest chip out there, and we needed the biggest, baddest, boldest stage out there,” he added. “That platform is the Super Bowl.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2010, on page B3 of the New York edition.VIEWERS look forward to the commercials shown during a Super Bowl because they know the spots will almost always be different from  and better than  the everyday ads they typically deride or ignore.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Russel A. Daniels/Associated Press The Smart Choices label adorns even the front of cold cereals known for high sugar content, like Kellogg's Pops. PepsiCo said that it was cutting its ties with the program, called Smart Choices, which features a green checkmark on the front of products that meet its nutritional criteria. Kellogg’s, which makes Froot Loops and other sugary cereals that received the program’s seal of approval, said that it would begin phasing out packaging bearing the program logo as its inventories ran out. Officials with the program said that Smart Choices would suspend most of its operations while they waited for the Food and Drug Administration to devise regulations for package-front nutrition labeling. Those rules could differ from the program’s criteria. “I regard it as a partial victory,” said Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general, who recently began an investigation into the program to see if the labeling campaign violated his state’s consumer protection law. He called on more companies to pull out of the program. “Quite bluntly, without a commitment by the companies to stop using the logo, there is absolutely no benefit to consumers,” he said. The actions were a remarkable turnabout for an initiative that was developed by many of the country’s largest food manufacturers. It had taken at least two years to develop. The Smart Choices logo began appearing on food packages this summer but immediately met with criticism from some nutritionists who felt its criteria were too lax. They pointed to sugary cereals, like Froot Loops, and fat-heavy products like mayonnaise, which they said should not be considered among the healthiest choices in the supermarket. The first ingredient in Froot Loops is sugar. The F.D.A. sent the program a letter in August voicing concern that the label could lead consumers to choose highly processed foods over healthier foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains. And this week, Margaret A. Hamburg, the F.D.A. commissioner, said that the agency would move quickly to devise rules for package-front nutrition labeling, an area that until now has been only loosely regulated. Ms. Hamburg said that the front of the package should give shoppers quick access to key dietary information that is already provided in greater detail in the Nutrition Facts box on the back or side of packages. The Smart Choices program sent a letter on Friday to Dr. Hamburg and Mr. Blumenthal saying it would stop recruiting companies to take part in the program and stop promoting the program to consumers. Eileen T. Kennedy, a nutritionist who is president of the Smart Choices board, said that the program was not bowing to outside pressures. “I’m actually pleased that F.D.A. has moved in this direction,” Dr. Kennedy said. “I think it’s one more step in decreasing any confusion that’s out there in the marketplace.” David DeCecco, a spokesman for PepsiCo, said the company was pulling out of the program in anticipation of working with the new F.D.A. rules. He said that only a few products, like Life cereal and instant oatmeal, made by PepsiCo’s Quaker division, had carried the logo. “We really just had our toe in the water,” Mr. DeCecco said. Kellogg’s said it would maintain ties to the program and that Celeste A. Clark, the company’s senior vice president of global nutrition, would remain on the program’s board. Kraft, another participant, said that it planned to stay involved in the program and had no plans to remove the logo from packaging. Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, had worked with the Smart Choices program to help develop its criteria, but resigned last year out of concerns that the standards were too loose. Mr. Jacobson said he believed that the companies involved in Smart Choices had hoped to head off federal regulation of package-front labeling by showing they could develop an acceptable system on their own. “It clearly blew up in their faces,” Mr. Jacobson said. “And the ironic thing is, their device for pre-empting government involvement actually seems to have stimulated government involvement.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 24, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.Under pressure from state and federal authorities who feared consumers would be misled, the food industry on Friday started backing away from a major labeling campaign meant to highlight the nutritional benefits of hundreds of products.

Kennedy, a nutritionist who is president of the Smart Choices board, said that the program was not bowing to outside pressures. “I’m actually pleased that F.D.A. has moved in this direction,” Dr. Kennedy said. “I think it’s one more step in decreasing any confusion that’s out there in the marketplace.” David DeCecco, a spokesman for PepsiCo, said the company was pulling out of the program in anticipation of working with the new F.D.A. rules. He said that only a few products, like Life cereal and instant oatmeal, made by PepsiCo’s Quaker division, had carried the logo. “We really just had our toe in the water,” Mr. DeCecco said. Kellogg’s said it would maintain ties to the program and that Celeste A. Clark, the company’s senior vice president of global nutrition, would remain on the program’s board. Kraft, another participant, said that it planned to stay involved in the program and had no plans to remove the logo from packaging. Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, had worked with the Smart Choices program to help develop its criteria, but resigned last year out of concerns that the standards were too loose. Mr. Jacobson said he believed that the companies involved in Smart Choices had hoped to head off federal regulation of package-front labeling by showing they could develop an acceptable system on their own. “It clearly blew up in their faces,” Mr. Jacobson said. “And the ironic thing is, their device for pre-empting government involvement actually seems to have stimulated government involvement.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/business/09pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Weak Pepsi Sales in U.S. Faulted for Revenue Slide<date>Published: October 8, 2009</date><text>PepsiCo reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue Thursday, hurt by falling North American soft drink sales, and cautioned it did not expect a major revival of consumer spending next year. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » “Our consumer research shows that the age of thrift that we’re seeing in consumers in the U.S. and Western Europe will continue in 2010, and that consumers will continue to remain very careful about their spending,” the chief executive, Indra Nooyi, said in a conference call. In emerging markets of Asia and South America, Ms. Nooyi said consumer spending should grow, but not at a rate that entirely offsets the slow growth in the West. The company, which is buying the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas for $7.8 billion, also affirmed its 2009 earnings target and set a 2010 goal ahead of analysts’ expectations. Net income rose to $1.72 billion, or $1.09 a share, from $1.58 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, PepsiCo earned $1.08 a share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.03. The profit surprise was mainly driven by a lower-than-expected tax rate, according to a JPMorgan analyst, John Faucher. Revenue in the period, which ended Sept. 5 and was the third quarter of PepsiCo’s fiscal year, fell 1.5 percent to $11.08 billion, missing analysts’ average expectation for $11.25 billion. Stock in PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., fell 78 cents, to $60.39 a share. A Morningstar analyst, Philip Gorham, said the lower-than-expected revenue probably prompted investor concern over the company’s ability to increase its sales. Sales by volume rose 2 percent in PepsiCo’s snacks business, both in the Americas and internationally. In the drinks business, volume was up 0.5 percent, with a decline of 6 percent in the Americas and a rise of 9 percent internationally.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » With the agreements to take over the two bottlers, Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas, PepsiCo will unwind a decade-old strategy of separating its bottling operations from its soft-drink business, one begun by the Coca-Cola Company. PepsiCo says the move will allow it to respond more quickly to changes in demand, especially as consumers move away from carbonated beverages toward juices and water. The two deals would give PepsiCo control of 80 percent of its North American beverage volume. The company expects $300 million in cost savings from the deal by 2012. “The fully integrated beverage business will enable us to bring innovative products and packages to market faster, streamline our manufacturing and distribution systems and react more quickly to changes in the marketplace, much like we do with our food business,” PepsiCo’s chief executive, Indra Nooyi, said in Tuesday’s statement. Recent years have been particularly wrenching for the nonalcoholic beverage business in the United States, which has long been dominated by PepsiCo and Coca-Cola. Soda sales have declined for several years, leaving both Coke and Pepsi struggling to adjust. Under the terms of the deal, PepsiCo will pay $36.50 a share for Pepsi Bottling, a nearly 24 percent premium from the price it offered in April, and $28.50 a share for PepsiAmericas, a 22 percent premium. Both offers are half in cash and half in stock. PepsiCo owns about 33 percent of Pepsi Bottling and 43 percent of PepsiAmericas. PepsiCo shares rose 5 percent, to $59.06, on Tuesday, while Pepsi Bottling rose 8.5 percent, to $36.49, and PepsiAmericas rose 9 percent, to $28.50. Shares of Coca-Cola fell slightly to $49.50. Shortly after PepsiCo first made public its unsolicited offers  then totaling about $6 billion  in late April, the two bottlers rejected the proposals as undervalued. Pepsi Bottling even went so far as to adopt an anti-takeover provision, known as a poison pill, that barred PepsiCo from acquiring any more shares. PepsiCo retaliated by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court. Still, PepsiCo and Pepsi Bottling held several meetings in July, at which the soft drink giant eventually offered $35.50 a share. The contours of Tuesday’s announced deals took shape last Thursday, when Ms. Nooyi contacted Ira Hall, the head of the special committee of Pepsi Bottling’s board, and asked for a meeting, according to people briefed on the matter. At Ms. Nooyi’s home, the two agreed on $36.50 a share. The deal for PepsiAmericas was reached shortly afterward. The two acquisitions are expected to close late this year, pending antitrust approval.

Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image An ad for Pepsi-Cola. Last month the former French president’s endorsement of a Quebec nation reappears in a television commercial selling Pepsi to the province’s French-speaking majority. The ad, which marks the soft drink maker’s 75th anniversary in Canada, is in keeping with Pepsi’s unusual history. Since the 1970s, Pepsi’s Quebec bottling unit has gone its own way, using marketing that appeals, in various ways and with different degrees of subtlety, to the nationalistic sense of the province’s French-speaking population. Quebec is one of the developed world’s few markets where the positions of Pepsi and Coca-Cola are reversed. According to ACNielsen MarketTrack, Pepsi’s main brand commands 29.9 percent of the retail soft drink market in Quebec, based on volume, compared with 12.3 percent for Coke. And all of the brands owned by Pepsi control just over 60 percent of the province’s soft drink business  a dominance that even led to a common slur. The Canadian Oxford dictionary defines “pepsi” as derogatory term for a French Canadian, “from the perceived Québécois preference for Pepsi-Cola.” Until the 1970s, Pepsi followed the approach still used by most advertisers for the Quebec market. Television spots developed for English Canada were double-shot with French-speaking actors substituted if there were speaking roles. For other ads, it was simply a matter of changing onscreen text and substituting French voice-overs. Perhaps there is no connection  certainly no one at Pepsi will draw the link  but Pepsi’s intense focus on the Quebec market coincided with the political changes of the 1970s which eventually brought the separatist Parti Québécois to power and to many English-speaking residents leaving the province. While Pepsi was being promoted by Michael Jackson in the rest of the world 25 years ago, the company hired Claude Meunier, a moderately successful member of a Quebec comedy duo, to perform tiny sketch comedy pieces as Pepsi ads. Using broad, often slapstick humor, Mr. Meunier spoofed a variety of stereotypical Quebecers, including a hockey player who seemed to have taken one too many pucks to the head. Mr. Meunier’s characters often spoke slang-laden joual, a dialect that was once mostly heard in working-class, French neighborhoods of Montreal. The ads turned Mr. Meunier into a big celebrity in Quebec and Pepsi became the province’s top soft drink. (Unusually, Mr. Meunier still appears in some of Pepsi’s Quebec ads, although since 2003 he has mainly promoted Diet Pepsi.) In recent years, the Quebec message has been more overt in ads. One mocks Quebec stereotypes from a peculiar provincial law that sets June 30 as the expiration date for most residential leases (and thus transforms July 1 into a chaotic, provincewide moving day) to a Quebec City so cold that an actor must consume a bottle of Pepsi as if it were a Popsicle. English Canadians don’t escape notice. One ad features a man that Pepsi describes simply as “a tourist” but who dresses unfashionably and acts in a manner that many Quebecers associate with English Canadians. He orders a Coke at a Quebec City restaurant, provoking evident hostility among the French-speaking patrons. Its tagline translates roughly as: “Here, it’s Pepsi.” The cameo appearance of Charles de Gaulle is not the only portion of the fast-paced and largely humorous 75th anniversary commercial (created by BBDO Montreal), which might offend some. One sequence lumps images of Queen Elizabeth II, Canada’s head of state (or more precisely her waving hand and her hat), and Pope John Paul II with Bonhomme, the snowman mascot of Quebec City’s winter carnival. While acknowledging that Pepsi’s Quebec ads sometimes push limits in the interests of humor, Sylvain Charbonneau, vice president for Pepsi’s Canadian bottling group and its director general for Quebec, said that during his 20 years with the company in Quebec, he had never known it to be second-guessed by the Canadian head office, which is in suburban Toronto. “It’s easier for us to have credibility with 60-point share, but that wasn’t the case 25 years ago,” he said in a boardroom at a recently upgraded bottling plant in an industrial area of Montreal. “They listen to us, give a chance to take risks, make mistakes. It was important for them to have someone who understands the market.” Coke has done some Quebec-specific advertising, although none for the last two years. In advance of next year’s Winter Olympics, which will be held in Canada, David M. Moran, a spokesman for Coca-Cola Canada of Toronto, said that the company would feature Quebec athletes in forthcoming commercials. He said the company had signed “a major Quebec celebrity” to act as a spokeswoman, although he declined to identify her. While tailoring its message to French-speaking Quebecers has been successful for Quebec, Mr. Charbonneau acknowledges that the approach may not be appropriate for many companies. “It’s more costly for a population of seven million to do a unique advertising campaign year after year,” he said. “It costs you more per capita than it would for the U.S. with 300 million people. But it pays out for us and Quebecers don’t mind laughing about themselves.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 4, 2009 The Advertising column on Friday, about the popularity of Pepsi in Quebec, misspelled the name of the snowman mascot of Quebec City’s winter carnival in some copies.

Skip to next paragraph Keep up with the latest news on The Timess baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » M.L.B. Scoreboard Schedules: A.L. | N.L. Standings: A.L. | N.L. Stats: A.L. | N.L. Team Reports Yankees 2009 Schedule Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Yankees Mets 2009 Schedule Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Mets State Farm, Bank of America, Pepsi and other sponsors have increased the money they plan to give to charities at this year’s event. For each hit in the game, Bank of America will donate $5,000 to Feeding America, which runs a national network of food banks. State Farm expects to exceed the $370,000 it gave to the Boys and Girls Clubs at the Home Run Derby it sponsored last year. Pepsi helped pay for a free concert by Sheryl Crow on Saturday that raised money for Stand Up to Cancer, a research group. The strategy is in keeping with the times. Unemployment is up, incomes are down and conspicuous consumption is out. The last thing Major League Baseball or sponsors want is to appear insensitive to the economic challenges that many fans face. The companies also want to deflect criticism of corporate spending on sports, which has become a symbol of the excess of the past decade. Increased scrutiny from politicians, shareholders and consumers has tempered spending on luxury suites, hospitality tents and event sponsorships. This is particularly true at Bank of America, General Motors and other companies that have taken taxpayer money to stay afloat. For them, the task is even tougher: how to seem altruistic yet frugal while spending millions of dollars to increase sales. “We’ve cut our promotions hugely, and we’re trying in the few activities that we remain in to make sure we get a return on our investments,” said Ed Peper, the vice president for Chevrolet at General Motors North America, which sponsors the Roberto Clemente Award, honoring the top humanitarian on each team. “We sell cars and trucks, and we need to sell them to help repay the money we borrowed,” Peper said. Incorporating philanthropy into corporate marketing messages at sporting events is not new. Teams of all stripes have favorite charities that they promote and give to. The N.F.L. has had a long relationship with the United Way. Baseball and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have worked together for years. But few sporting events showcase corporate giving as well as the All-Star Game. Baseball is woven into the fabric of many communities and is perceived as a wholesome and less commercial sport. The All-Star Game, in mid-July, is one of the few events competing for viewers’ attention, so companies have a better chance of having their philanthropic efforts noticed. “It is on a broadcast network, it’s prime time, it draws a relatively large audience and it draws a lot of attention leading up to it and has a bit of an afterlife,” said Eric Wright, the vice president for research and development at Joyce Julius &amp; Associates, a sports market-research firm. In concert with baseball, companies are expanding their giving this year. MasterCard will give $1 million to Stand Up to Cancer if a batter hits one of the Hit it Here signs in the outfield during the Home Run Derby or the All-Star Game. In the past, the money went to a fan chosen in a sweepstakes. As it did last year, State Farm will donate $17,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs for each gold ball hit for a home run during the derby. It will also donate $5,000 for each home run hit with regular white balls this year, which should help the company increase its total donation to $500,000. “Charities like the Boys and Girls Clubs are facing tighter times, so this is a great way to help their fund-raising,” said Mark Gibson, the assistant vice president for advertising at State Farm. Bank of America will match donations that fans make to Feeding America during the All-Star Game, up to $100,000. Sports marketing experts say that although charitable giving is a solid strategy, some messages can be lost on viewers if the philanthropy is seen as a one-time effort or a blatant attempt to drum up sales. “There’s a cacophony of ribbons out there,” said Carol Cone, the chairwoman of Cone Inc., which advises companies about cause marketing. “If there’s not enough below that ribbon, it becomes wallpaper.” The companies and baseball are careful to note that their giving during the All-Star Game is part of broader, year-round efforts not just to help charities, but also to improve their bottom lines. For every dollar it spent on sponsoring baseball games, General Motors said, it generated about $5 in sales. About 200,000 people have visited the league’s Web site to take part in a program that gives fans tickets and merchandise based on how often they stay at Holiday Inn hotels. Bank of America said that for every dollar it spent at sporting events, it generated $3 in net income. “I can completely understand the cynicism and understand the questions about philanthropy and investments in sports,” said Ray Bednar, who is in charge of global sponsorship marketing at Bank of America. “But we make money at this, and that’s the most important message to get out.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on July 13, 2009, on page D2 of the New York edition.Making money by giving it away: that is part of the plan for the largest corporate sponsors at the All-Star Game in St. Louis this year. Skip to next paragraph Keep up with the latest news on The Timess baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » M.L.B. Scoreboard Schedules: A.L. | N.L. Standings: A.L. | N.L. Stats: A.L. | N.L. Team Reports Yankees 2009 Schedule Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Yankees Mets 2009 Schedule Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Mets State Farm, Bank of America, Pepsi and other sponsors have increased the money they plan to give to charities at this year’s event. For each hit in the game, Bank of America will donate $5,000 to Feeding America, which runs a national network of food banks. State Farm expects to exceed the $370,000 it gave to the Boys and Girls Clubs at the Home Run Derby it sponsored last year. Pepsi helped pay for a free concert by Sheryl Crow on Saturday that raised money for Stand Up to Cancer, a research group. The strategy is in keeping with the times. Unemployment is up, incomes are down and conspicuous consumption is out. The last thing Major League Baseball or sponsors want is to appear insensitive to the economic challenges that many fans face. The companies also want to deflect criticism of corporate spending on sports, which has become a symbol of the excess of the past decade. Increased scrutiny from politicians, shareholders and consumers has tempered spending on luxury suites, hospitality tents and event sponsorships. This is particularly true at Bank of America, General Motors and other companies that have taken taxpayer money to stay afloat. For them, the task is even tougher: how to seem altruistic yet frugal while spending millions of dollars to increase sales. “We’ve cut our promotions hugely, and we’re trying in the few activities that we remain in to make sure we get a return on our investments,” said Ed Peper, the vice president for Chevrolet at General Motors North America, which sponsors the Roberto Clemente Award, honoring the top humanitarian on each team. “We sell cars and trucks, and we need to sell them to help repay the money we borrowed,” Peper said. Incorporating philanthropy into corporate marketing messages at sporting events is not new. Teams of all stripes have favorite charities that they promote and give to. The N.F.L. has had a long relationship with the United Way. Baseball and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America have worked together for years. But few sporting events showcase corporate giving as well as the All-Star Game. Baseball is woven into the fabric of many communities and is perceived as a wholesome and less commercial sport. The All-Star Game, in mid-July, is one of the few events competing for viewers’ attention, so companies have a better chance of having their philanthropic efforts noticed. “It is on a broadcast network, it’s prime time, it draws a relatively large audience and it draws a lot of attention leading up to it and has a bit of an afterlife,” said Eric Wright, the vice president for research and development at Joyce Julius &amp; Associates, a sports market-research firm. In concert with baseball, companies are expanding their giving this year. MasterCard will give $1 million to Stand Up to Cancer if a batter hits one of the Hit it Here signs in the outfield during the Home Run Derby or the All-Star Game. In the past, the money went to a fan chosen in a sweepstakes. As it did last year, State Farm will donate $17,000 to the Boys and Girls Clubs for each gold ball hit for a home run during the derby. It will also donate $5,000 for each home run hit with regular white balls this year, which should help the company increase its total donation to $500,000. “Charities like the Boys and Girls Clubs are facing tighter times, so this is a great way to help their fund-raising,” said Mark Gibson, the assistant vice president for advertising at State Farm. Bank of America will match donations that fans make to Feeding America during the All-Star Game, up to $100,000.

The company said the acquisitions would allow it to respond more quickly to changes in demand, particularly as consumers move away from carbonated beverages toward juices and water. Pursuing the Pepsi Bottling Group, or P.B.G., and PepsiAmericas would give the company control of 80 percent of its North American beverage volume. PepsiCo is offering $29.50 a share for the Pepsi Bottling Group and $23.27 a share for PepsiAmericas, a 17.1 percent premium over each bottler’s stock price as of Friday. PepsiCo currently owns about 33 percent of P.B.G. and 43 percent of PepsiAmericas. The deals require approval of the two bottlers’ boards and shareholders. Recent years have been particularly wrenching for the nonalcoholic beverage business in the United States, which has long been dominated by Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. Soda sales have been on the decline for four years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry publication, and as consumer tastes have shifted, Coke and Pepsi have both struggled to keep up. “In the more mature market of today, there is a need to be more nimble given the increasing role of noncarbs, retailer consolidation and the changing competitive landscape,” Indra K. Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, said in a call with investors. PepsiCo expects to save more than $200 million a year pretax after the two deals are completed and add 15 cents a share to its earnings. The deals are a reversal of the strategy PepsiCo and Coca-Cola began more than a decade ago. The two had spun off their bottling operations while maintaining big stakes in those companies to drop what were deemed noncore operations from their balance sheets while still giving them some control over the distribution of their drinks products. The proposed deal is expected to increase pressure on Coke to buy its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises. Coke studied such a move a few years ago and decided not to pursue it, Beverage Digest reported. Separately on Monday, PepsiCo said its first-quarter net income was $1.14 billion, essentially unchanged from the quarter a year ago. That amounted to 72 cents a share, slightly higher from the same time in 2008 and beating the 67-cent average estimate of analysts surveyed by Reuters. Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

The beverage giant has offered $6 billion to buy back the bottling companies it spun off in the late 1990s. Skip to next paragraph Joshua Roberts/Bloomberg News Jamie Dimon, chief of JPMorgan Chase, called TARP money a scarlet letter. The deal should give Pepsi more control over its distribution, a smart move in light of changes in its business. Plus, the bottling spinoff fad, begun the previous decade by its rival, Coca-Cola, was based largely on financial engineering, and its logic has largely failed. The 17 percent premium that Pepsi is offering for the Pepsi Bottling Group and PepsiAmericas looks fair. Pepsi already owns a large part of each business, and the bottlers’ stock prices have rebounded from recent lows. Still, Pepsi could raise its bid a bit; analysts think it can squeeze out more than the $200 million in synergies it expects from the deal. But more broadly, the deal is a strategic about-face for Pepsi. Separating the business that bottles and distributes its soda from the one that actually concocts the beverage and its marketing strategies was once a smart idea. It was started by a former chief executive of Coca-Cola, Roberto Goizueta. The logic: the bottling business was industrial and offered lower margins. Spinning it off gave the main beverage business’s shareholders a boon. Part of that logic still holds true. The financial metrics for Pepsi’s soda business could be weighed down as a result of this combination. Nevertheless, the latest deal still makes sense. First, Pepsi is no longer just a soda company. It sells sports drinks and fruit juices, which don’t necessarily have the same bottling system as its soda does. Getting its sodas and Gatorade to, say, Wal-Mart will be more efficient if Pepsi combines its different bottling and distribution channels. Also, many saw Pepsi and its bottling companies as separate in name only. Shareholders often looked at their metrics as if the companies were combined, since their fortunes certainly were. Pepsi also backs the bottlers’ debt. The deal might put Coca-Cola in the hot seat. Pepsi copied its biggest competitor’s decision to separate its businesses. Coca-Cola may now find itself under pressure to follow in its rival’s footsteps. A ‘Scarlet Letter’ The Obama administration may want to place conditions on the repayment of bailout funds by banks, but it shouldn’t go too far. Relatively strong firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have been agitating to shuck off what JPMorgan’s boss, Jamie Dimon, recently called a “scarlet letter.” If they have adequate capital, or can raise it privately, the banks should be allowed to pay the government back. The conditions that lawmakers retroactively attached to the Troubled Asset Relief Program from the Treasury have chafed, especially the politically charged limits on executive pay. Bankers, dismayed by these, the potential for more Congressional meddling and the reputational concern that Mr. Dimon referred to, want to pay the TARP funds back despite the higher cost of raising money in the open market. This should not be discouraged. It could understandably put banks that cannot pay TARP back under an uncomfortable spotlight. But the results of the government’s stress tests should do that anyway if the tests are meaningful and the results are disclosed. And by proving that they can do without TARP, stronger banks might be able to attract private capital on somewhat better terms, exactly the sort of development the government should encourage. Meanwhile, getting some capital back would help replenish the Treasury’s bailout coffers, which will probably be called on again soon to prop up weaker banks and automakers, among others. Finally, the government should not worry too much that allowing banks to pay back TARP will allow them to wriggle free of oversight. It may release them from executive compensation limits. But aside from their everyday regulation, banks have issued immense amounts of government-guaranteed short-term debt and benefit from a range of new emergency lending facilities. Those are levers that regulators  and Congress, if it chooses  can use to influence banks’ behavior. And it’s most likely that any new oversight regime will be tougher. Even if banks repay TARP capital, they will be under regulators’ thumbs for some time to come.

Madison Avenue believes one answer is nostalgia. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » As the recession continues taking its toll, marketers are trying to tap into fond memories to help sell what few products shoppers are still buying. The time-machine tactics are primarily evoking four decades  the 1950s through the 1980s. For instance, on April 20 a beverage unit of PepsiCo will begin an eight-week campaign for “throwback” versions of two soft drinks, Pepsi-Cola and Mountain Dew. The packages and formulas, along with advertising and promotions, will evoke the ’60s and ’70s. The hope is that warm, fuzzy feelings about the past will help make people feel better about the present and future. “It’s about yearning for the past, a simpler time, even though the ’60s and ’70s were not simple,” said Frank Cooper, chief marketing officer for sparkling beverages at the Pepsi-Cola North America Beverages unit of PepsiCo. “They just seem simple, looking back,” he added. The merchants of nostalgia also include other blue-chip names like Coca-Cola, General Mills, McDonald’s, MillerCoors, Target and Unilever. The companies are using marketing tactics including: ¶Reviving vintage slogans and jingles as well as package designs. Diet Coke is being promoted again with “Just for the taste of it,” the theme used by the Coca-Cola Company to introduce the soda in 1982. Five Big G cereals from General Mills, among them Cheerios and Trix, were sold in throwback boxes in Target stores, accompanied by a T-shirt offer (cerealwear.com). And as part of “a back-to-our-roots campaign” for Nationwide insurance to be introduced this month, Eric Hargrove, a company spokesman in Columbus, Ohio, said on Monday, there would be a prominent role for the venerable “Nationwide is on your side” jingle. ¶Bringing back familiar products and menu items to stores and restaurants. The Target circular this week features sock monkeys and gumball machines as part of a sale on “selected retro toys.” The Carl’s Jr. fast-food chain, owned by CKE Restaurants, reintroduced an original menu offering, chili dogs. ¶Recreating in ads nostalgic moments from the popular culture. In a commercial for a new sweet tea sold by McDonald’s, a man walks home through an urban neighborhood of the ’70s. Commercials for the I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter line of spreads sold by Unilever feature a make-believe 1950s family named the Buttertons. “In a time of anxiety, people are seeking out brands they’re comfortable with and they can trust,” said Ric Hendee, vice president for marketing services at Cotton Inc. in New York. Cotton Inc. is reintroducing a song from 1989, “The Fabric of Our Lives,” that served through the 1990s as a jingle in commercials for clothing and home furnishings made from cotton. Research found that women in their 20s and 30s  the intended audience for messages about cotton’s benefits  “remember the song and understand what it means,” Mr. Hendee said. “Even teenage girls” had some memories of it, he added. The jingle comes back this week in a campaign from DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. Those taking part in the trend acknowledge a potential pitfall of nostalgic pitches: They could lead consumers to believe a brand or product is outdated and therefore not for them. To make sure the cotton jingle “is relevant to a new audience,” said Cassandra Anderson, creative director at DDB New York, it is being performed by contemporary musicians like Zooey Deschanel, Miranda Lambert and Jazmine Sullivan rather than the previous cotton crooners, Richie Havens and Aaron Neville. Similarly, as Bumble Bee Foods revives its ’70s jingle for Bumble Bee tuna  “Yum, yum, Bumble Bee, Bumble Bee tuna”  the song is being given a fresh presentation. Commercials are centered on a troubadour character, seemingly from the Me Decade, who serenades modern-day consumers eating dishes like tuna sushi and tuna tacos. The campaigns for Bumble Bee and the I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter spreads were created by McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. In both cases, the agency avoids wallowing in nostalgia. For instance, the members of the Butterton family, and their ardor for butter, serve as a foil for the modern product. “We use what we call a then-and-now set-up,” said Keith Bobier, senior director for marketing at the Englewood Cliffs, N.J., office of Unilever, “to show people the difference between life as it used to be and today, when there’s far more understanding of health concerns.” Hard times have frequently inspired fond looks in the rear-view mirror. There was a nostalgia boom during World War II, as evidenced by movies like “Meet Me in St. Louis” and songs like “Long Ago and Far Away.” In the ’60s, the American Tobacco Company, now part of Reynolds American, introduced a filtered version of one of its first national cigarette brands, Sweet Caporal. In the economic turbulence of the ’70s, there was a fad for nostalgia for the ’50s. The ’60s made a comeback in the ’80s and the ’70s were revived in the ’90s. One updated aspect of nostalgic marketing is that it is starting to take place in Internet time. It used to be that an anniversary would be commemorated if a brand or product lasted 20, 25 or 50 years. But a campaign from Viacom and its licensees promoting SpongeBob SquarePants and his friends carries the theme “Celebrating 10 years of happy.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 7, 2009, on page B3 of the New York edition.IF music hath charm to soothe the savage breast, what can calm worried consumers during an economic crisis?

Commercials are centered on a troubadour character, seemingly from the Me Decade, who serenades modern-day consumers eating dishes like tuna sushi and tuna tacos. The campaigns for Bumble Bee and the I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter spreads were created by McCann Erickson Worldwide, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. In both cases, the agency avoids wallowing in nostalgia. For instance, the members of the Butterton family, and their ardor for butter, serve as a foil for the modern product. “We use what we call a then-and-now set-up,” said Keith Bobier, senior director for marketing at the Englewood Cliffs, N.J., office of Unilever, “to show people the difference between life as it used to be and today, when there’s far more understanding of health concerns.” Hard times have frequently inspired fond looks in the rear-view mirror. There was a nostalgia boom during World War II, as evidenced by movies like “Meet Me in St. Louis” and songs like “Long Ago and Far Away.” In the ’60s, the American Tobacco Company, now part of Reynolds American, introduced a filtered version of one of its first national cigarette brands, Sweet Caporal. In the economic turbulence of the ’70s, there was a fad for nostalgia for the ’50s. The ’60s made a comeback in the ’80s and the ’70s were revived in the ’90s. One updated aspect of nostalgic marketing is that it is starting to take place in Internet time. It used to be that an anniversary would be commemorated if a brand or product lasted 20, 25 or 50 years. But a campaign from Viacom and its licensees promoting SpongeBob SquarePants and his friends carries the theme “Celebrating 10 years of happy.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/business/media/30adnewsletter2.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Q &amp; A with Stuart Elliott<date>Published: March 30, 2009</date><text>Q: (Reader) Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » Every time Alton Brown professes the merits of Welch’s grape juice made with what he calls “CON-chord” grapes, my Massachusetts-bred spouse and I cringe. I, a native New Yorker, have been successfully trained to pronounce the name of the grape, as well as the towns  both in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire  to sound like the word “conquered.” Since this is how it is pronounced regionally, I’ve learned to respect that and say it accordingly. How outraged would we New Yorkers feel if a commercial about Houston Street in New York City had a spokesperson pronouncing it the same way as the city in Texas? Putting it another way, the commercial’s pronunciation is simply wrong. The grapes are from Concord, Mass., and the name of the town is pronounced “conquered.” We love Alton Brown’s dedication to accuracy in food and cooking information. We hope he can conquer this problem and reshoot the commercial. That would be wicked mint. A: (Stuart Elliott) At last, dear readers, a question about juice advertising that has nothing to do with Tropicana! (Just kidding.) The commercial is part of a campaign for Welch’s Foods by the Via Group in Portland, Me., that features Mr. Brown, the TV food guru. Here is a response to the question about pronunciation from Teleia Farrell, a spokeswoman for Welch’s, which is based in  where else?  Concord, Mass. “We are thrilled that there is such a high level of interest in our campaign for Welch’s 100 percent grape juice made from Concord grapes, featuring our friend Alton Brown,” Ms. Farrell writes in an e-mail message that arrived in my in-box in type that was, appropriately enough, colored purple. “As it turns out, both Alton and your reader are correct in their pronunciations of Concord according to dictionary.com,” Ms. Farrell says. “Although both the name of the town and the grape are pronounced “kong-kerd” regionally, they are pronounced “kon-kawrd” throughout the rest of the country. Both pronunciations are considered correct.” “Because we were creating a national campaign we thought it best to go with the more universally used pronunciation,” Ms. Farrell says. “The good news is either way this lofty grape makes the town of Concord, where Welch’s is headquartered, very proud.” Q: (Reader) I read your article about Tropicana from Feb. 22 in which you state that the decision to change Tropicana involved only packaging, “not the formula for or taste of the beverage.” But the Tropicana Pure Premium product called Light ’n Healthy, now Trop50, had more than its name and packaging changed. For one thing, the contents were reduced, from 64 ounces to 59 ounces. And the formula was changed, too. The old formula was sweetened with Splenda and acesulfame potassium, while the new formula is sweetened with stevia. I tried both the old and the new one morning recently and I would say that the taste did change  and I don’t think for the better. A: (Stuart Elliott) I knew it would be difficult to go too long before there was a question about Tropicana. The decision of executives at Tropicana, owned by PepsiCo, to change how the packaging looks  and then change it back after consumers complained  has generated more e-mail messages to this newsletter than anything else I have covered since I joined The New York Times. You are correct, dear reader, that the changes to Tropicana Light ’n Healthy  technically a “light orange juice beverage” rather than orange juice, because it has less sugar  go beyond the renaming and new packaging to include a new formula. However, as far as I know, there have been no changes to the formulas of other varieties of Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice. The reference to the formula and the taste in the Feb. 22 article was to the so-called base brand, with the designation on the carton that reads “Original (no pulp).” Trop50 is also noteworthy because the new orange-shaped carton cap that was introduced as part of the redesign of Tropicana packages is being added to Trop50 as the original caps return to the other types of Tropicana. In the meantime, Tropicana has started running a campaign to promote the arrival of Trop50; ads in Sunday newspaper coupon inserts show the old and new packages. The television commercials for Trop50 feature the actress Kyra Sedgwick dancing to the song “She’s a Lady”; Tropicana says it is the first advertising campaign for Ms. Sedgwick, the star of “The Closer” who is the also the wife of the actor Kevin Bacon. Maybe the reason she was hired is because (Mrs.) Bacon and O.J. go so well together.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Josh Haner/The New York Times Mountain Dews Green Label Sound project tried the showcase treatment at the South by Southwest indie music festival.

Multimedia Slide Show Cinema Down Below Related Music: A Full House for Bands and Fans at SXSW (March 21, 2009) Finding Fame in Austin in the Internet Age (March 20, 2009) Here the Messages Are the Media (Tweet, Tweet) (March 18, 2009) That question was pondered and debated by fans, musicians and corporate sponsors alike at the annual South by Southwest music festival here, where logo-filled banners line the streets downtown, and a flier stapled to a telephone pole might be for an indie-rock showcase in a parking lot, a marketing experiment for a blue-chip soft drink company or both. South by Southwest, which ended its 23rd installment on Sunday, is celebrated around the world as one of the great institutions of independent music, drawing record labels, bloggers, booking agents, filmmakers, radio programmers and anyone else in search of the next cool thing. As it has grown, so has its attraction to corporate America as a rare nexus of tastemakers, leading to saturation promotional tactics that strike many festivalgoers as excessive. “I’m wary when I end up at events like ‘Smokin’ Music,’ ” said Kenneth Tan, a vacationing bookstore employee from New York, “where they offer me free packs of cigarettes and a pass to get into after-show parties for my phone number and e-mail so they can send me advertisements for future American Spirit promotions.” Sponsors do more than just hand out samples and collect e-mail addresses. They provide the shadow financing that pays for much of what happens at South by Southwest, from the rent for off-site party spaces to artists’ lodging and travel expenses. For many bands the only substantial performance fee of the week might come from a sponsored party. Marketers, promoters and artist managers say that a modest branded party at South by Southwest costs $10,000 or so, but that major events with top talent can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. In return that talent is often publicly grateful for the sponsor’s largess. Kanye West made sure to give a shout-out to Levi’s in a performance at its Levi’s/Fader Fort party space on Saturday night. Although the economy has forced many companies to trim their budgets, sponsorship and advertising were ubiquitous in downtown Austin. Giant balloons shaped like energy-drink cans bobbed in the wind on East Sixth Street, and nonmusic companies like PepsiCo, BlackBerry and National Public Radio have established a greater presence, as music magazines and record labels have scaled back. “The core of the 18-to-34 demographic has not been as affected by the economy as the 30- to 40-year-olds,” said Jon Cohen of Cornerstone, a multifaceted marketing firm that organized the Levi’s/Fader Fort. “They have no mortgage, no kids. The brands that target those consumers have not been hit quite as hard.” For most sponsors, however, simply putting up signs and handing out samples is no longer very effective. This year PepsiCo, the beverage and snack conglomerate, was an official sponsor of South by Southwest, landing its logo on banners and program guides. But if that was the only exposure, it would be a waste, said Frank Cooper, PepsiCo’s vice president for portfolio brands. “Having a name on a banner now, if that’s all you do, it’s become wallpaper,” he said. “We’re past the world where you can simply write a check. Now consumers ascribe value to those who create, and brands have to create.” On Thursday night Mountain Dew, a PepsiCo brand, had a showcase for its Green Label Sound project, which releases music by hipster-approved acts like Matt &amp; Kim and the Cool Kids. Held under a tent in a restaurant parking lot, the event resembled any unfancy party at South by Southwest. The performers included the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, a bouncy indie-pop band from New York that only hours earlier had played in a small bar a few blocks away. But for PepsiCo, which encouraged its employees to chat about the event on blogs, Facebook and Twitter, it was an important test of a new, immersive approach that, if successful, could be used for other big festivals like Coachella or Bonnaroo, Mr. Cooper said. For many companies, though, the backlash has already begun. Scion, a Toyota brand that was a major presence at South by Southwest for the last four years, pulled out this year because the combined noise of so many competing sponsors was starting to drown out the music, said Jeri Yoshizu, Scion’s manager for sales promotions and a veteran of underground music sponsorship. “The music was lost among the banners, the energy drinks and the guerrilla marketing happening all over the place,” she said. “It was a bummer. There was a disconnect between the music and the people who wished to hear it.” Though attendance this year was about even with last year  about 12,000, a spokeswoman said  the economy this year seems to have squeezed fans, who have a knack for enjoying the fruits of sponsors’ generosity while blocking out their messages. The streets were just as crowded during the afternoons, when the clubs fill with free sponsored parties, as they were at night for the official showcases, when attendees need a badge that can cost up to $695. At the Perez Hilton party late Saturday in an old Safeway store, the walls were covered with sponsor names  Alizé, Dos Equis, Dell  and the crowd included plenty of people who said that they appreciated what the companies make possible. “It’s great,” said Amber Zook, 26, a landscape designer from Austin. “A few years ago you couldn’t do anything because the badges were so expensive. Now everything you want to go to is free.” Melena Ryzik contributed reporting.

Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Sara Lee Corp Bank of America Corp Go to your Portfolio » “Go humans go” is the theme of a major campaign getting under way for Quaker Oats. The theme acts as an umbrella under which all the division’s oat-based products are being peddled; as an announcer in a commercial declares, “The power of Quaker is in everything we make.” Television, print, online (quakeroats.com/gohumansgo) and outdoor ads  along with promotions and events around the country  proclaim that the Quaker oat is a “super grain” that “gives you a little lift, physically and emotionally” and “makes you feel good knowing you’re doing something good for yourself.” It seems counterintuitive to accentuate the positive amid all the downbeat financial news. But Madison Avenue is typically a place called Hope. Besides, gloom-mongering could convince consumers to put off what little spending they still intend. “You could always look at the glass as half-full or half-empty,” Annie Young-Scrivner, chief marketing officer and vice president for sales at the Quaker foods and snacks division, said on Monday at an event in Times Square to introduce the campaign. “We look at it half-full,” she added, which suits “a very iconic brand” like Quaker.  As Quaker Oats cheers on the human race, Visa has a campaign that also plays up the word go, which carries the theme “More people go with Visa.” And the Hillshire Farm unit of Sara Lee is running a humorous campaign under the banner “Go meat!” Those go-go ads join a lengthening list of cockeyed marketers sponsoring campaigns carrying optimistic themes. They include Bank of America, with “Bank of opportunity”; Coca-Cola, with “Open happiness”; the Pepsi-Cola soft drink sold by PepsiCo, with ads in which the o’s in words like “hope” are replaced by a logo resembling a smiling face; and Western Union, with a one-word burst of positivity: “Yes!” “We did a great deal of research around the globe,” said Gail Galuppo, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at Western Union in Englewood, Colo., and determined that customers were still “working hard in pursuit of their dreams.” “In a world today where they hear a lot of ‘no’ and ‘maybe,’ ” she added, “we wanted to say ‘yes’ to them.” The Western Union campaign is by the Hong Kong office of Publicis Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe. The Quaker campaign, with a budget estimated at more than $100 million, is being created by Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. Another Omnicom agency, OMD, is handling the media part of the campaign. Edelman, part of Daniel J. Edelman Inc., is publicizing elements of the campaign like the Go Project, through which Quaker Oats will donate food to Share Our Strength, and Go Grants, $500 stipends from Quaker to consumers to start efforts to fight hunger in local communities. Many campaigns that are trying to put on a happy face during hard times are including charitable or philanthropic aspects to increase their feel-good appeal to feel-bad consumers.  The Quaker campaign is about “leveraging human energy to fuel your day,” Ms. Young-Scrivner said, “and also leveraging human energy to do more for others.” The development of the campaign began last summer. “Obviously, economic conditions are definitely a factor” in marketing decisions, Ms. Young-Scrivner said, but the premise of the campaign to “fuel yourself to be your very best” ought to resonate in a recession. A TV commercial and an accompanying print ad reflect that attitude, minus any presidents, by showing a man flying to work with a jetpack on his back powered by two packages of Old Fashioned Quaker Oats. A second ad compares Quaker Instant Oatmeal to a ramp that can send a child’s bicycle soaring into the air. A third ad, likening Quaker Chewy Granola Bars to a spring, urges shoppers to “put a little spring in your step.” The fourth ad depicts a section of the oatmeal package in the shape of a heart. “Take good care of your heart, and your heart will take good care of you,” the text reads. “Quaker Oatmeal has been helping lower cholesterol for 20 years.” The campaign represents the first work for Quaker Oats from Goodby, Silverstein since being selected last fall as the company’s lead creative agency. Goodby, Silverstein won the assignment from another Omnicom agency, Element 79 Partners. “Every once in a while as an advertising agency, you are presented with a brand that has great familiarity, great perceptions attached to it, but it’s out there in a latent phase,” said Jamie Barrett, partner and creative director at Goodby, Silverstein. The campaign offers “a focus and a mission for the products as a brand,” he added, which ought to increase product sales as it burnishes the image of the brand. The ads have a contemporary attitude, Mr. Barrett said, while at the same time acknowledging the heritage of Quaker Oats. “The Quaker Man has been an icon for more than a century,” he added, “so we wanted to make sure what we did was true to the brand, served up in a way that rang true and doesn’t take it to a place that’s not genuine.” The campaign began last week with so-called teaser ads, billboards and signs in a dozen large markets that showed only parts of the Quaker Man. The “reveal” came on Monday at the event in Times Square, along with material on the Quaker Oats Web site explaining the campaign. The jetpack TV commercial is scheduled to start next Monday, along with newspaper ads; outdoor ads bearing the “Go humans go” theme, appearing in 20 large markets; and ads on Web sites like health.com and instyle.com. Magazine ads are planned for later this month, as are activities involving bloggers.

The campaign offers “a focus and a mission for the products as a brand,” he added, which ought to increase product sales as it burnishes the image of the brand. The ads have a contemporary attitude, Mr. Barrett said, while at the same time acknowledging the heritage of Quaker Oats. “The Quaker Man has been an icon for more than a century,” he added, “so we wanted to make sure what we did was true to the brand, served up in a way that rang true and doesn’t take it to a place that’s not genuine.” The campaign began last week with so-called teaser ads, billboards and signs in a dozen large markets that showed only parts of the Quaker Man. The “reveal” came on Monday at the event in Times Square, along with material on the Quaker Oats Web site explaining the campaign. The jetpack TV commercial is scheduled to start next Monday, along with newspaper ads; outdoor ads bearing the “Go humans go” theme, appearing in 20 large markets; and ads on Web sites like health.com and instyle.com. Magazine ads are planned for later this month, as are activities involving bloggers.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/nyregion/02border.html?ref=pepsicoinc">New York Vulnerable to Poaching in Recession<date>Published: March 1, 2009</date><text>When Pepsi executives came to Gov. David A. Paterson’s Manhattan offices in late October, they wanted to head off an expansion of bottle deposit requirements to noncarbonated drinks. They left the meeting thinking the governor was sympathetic to the concerns of one of his state’s largest corporations and that the discussion would continue. But two weeks later, Mr. Paterson included the expanded deposit requirements in a deficit reduction plan; later, he proposed an 18 percent tax on nondiet sodas without giving the company a heads up. Now Pepsi is weighing a searing response: moving the headquarters of the Pepsi Bottling Group and more than 1,000 jobs, from Somers, in Westchester County, to Connecticut, which has been dangling a roughly $30 million incentive package. In the eyes of many executives and lobbyists, the handling of Pepsi exemplifies the kind of fumbled communications that have plagued the Paterson administration for months. But it also underscores New York’s growing vulnerability to cross-border poaching of businesses as states try to mitigate the ravages of recession, experts say. As unemployment and commercial vacancy rates have risen in places like Stamford, Conn., and Morris County, N.J., officials in those states have stepped up efforts to lure New York companies. New Jersey’s governor, Jon S. Corzine, has proposed spending $150 million a year to attract larger businesses that promise to create at least 200 jobs in certain urban areas served by commuter train lines. New Jersey recently offered a 10-year subsidy package worth $74.6 million to the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation in Lower Manhattan, which is considering moving. And in December, the state granted $16.5 million in incentives to Tullett Prebon, a British financial company whose main American operations are in Manhattan. The company has promised to move 330 jobs to New Jersey. Connecticut officials say they are in discussions with several New York companies, but declined to provide details. Those discussions have infuriated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who complained publicly about New Jersey’s efforts in a news conference last month. And they have been sharply criticized by some economists, who assert that such incentives mainly benefit established companies with lobbying clout and are not very effective in creating new jobs. “Propping up the big guys and helping them stay big doesn’t really promote economic growth,” said Kevin C. Gillen, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He said much job growth comes from small businesses and fledgling companies. Multiyear tax-abatement programs are often ineffective, Mr. Gillen said, because “they tend to work a lot better in the short term than the long term and often wind up being used to retain employers rather than to attract new firms.” Officials in Connecticut and New Jersey  both of which, like New York, are facing deep budget deficits because of declining tax revenues  say they are not singling out New York companies. But they acknowledge that they are talking to companies that are looking for lower taxes and rents. “Connecticut is not actively out there knocking on doors in New York recruiting, but we do have a lot of activity coming from New York,” said Holly Campo De La Vera, executive director of the Office of Business and Industry Development for the State of Connecticut. “A lot of businesses are coming to Connecticut particularly when their leases are running out.” In New Jersey, Jerold L. Zaro, the chief of New Jersey’s Office of Economic Growth, was not coy about acknowledging the state’s efforts to poach jobs from nearby states. “We are talking with any number of major companies  in Pennsylvania, in Delaware, in Maryland and, yes, in New York  we make no bones about that,” he said. “He’s given me quite an arsenal,” Mr. Zaro said, referring to Mr. Corzine. “We have changed our tax laws dramatically to be more business-friendly.” In Albany, however, some officials and business executives say the Paterson administration, reeling from a number of recent missteps, has been too poorly managed to respond effectively. On Wednesday, Mr. Paterson overhauled his staff, and he has promised to rededicate himself to righting his administration. But in the meantime, the disarray in the administration, and the governor’s tendency to tell people what they want to hear, has bewildered many businesses, including Pepsi. 1 2 Next Page » Charles V.

Skip to next paragraph Related Accounts, People &amp; Miscellany (February 23, 2009) Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Tropicanas previous design, with orange and straw, will soon be brought back. The PepsiCo Americas Beverages division of PepsiCo is bowing to public demand and scrapping the changes made to a flagship product, Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice. Redesigned packaging that was introduced in early January is being discontinued, executives plan to announce on Monday, and the previous version will be brought back in the next month. Also returning will be the longtime Tropicana brand symbol, an orange from which a straw protrudes. The symbol, meant to evoke fresh taste, had been supplanted on the new packages by a glass of orange juice. The about-face comes after consumers complained about the makeover in letters, e-mail messages and telephone calls and clamored for a return of the original look. Some of those commenting described the new packaging as “ugly” or “stupid,” and resembling “a generic bargain brand” or a “store brand.” “Do any of these package-design people actually shop for orange juice?” the writer of one e-mail message asked rhetorically. “Because I do, and the new cartons stink.” Others described the redesign as making it more difficult to distinguish among the varieties of Tropicana or differentiate Tropicana from other orange juices. Such attention is becoming increasingly common as interactive technologies enable consumers to rapidly convey opinions to marketers. “You used to wait to go to the water cooler or a cocktail party to talk over something,” said Richard Laermer, chief executive at RLM Public Relations in New York. “Now, every minute is a cocktail party,” he added. “You write an e-mail and in an hour, you’ve got a fan base agreeing with you.” That ability to share brickbats or bouquets with other consumers is important because it facilitates the formation of ad hoc groups, more likely to be listened to than individuals. “There will always be people complaining, and always be people complaining about the complainers,” said Peter Shankman, a public relations executive who specializes in social media. “But this makes it easier to put us together.” The phenomenon was on display last week when users of Facebook complained about changes to the Web site’s terms of service using methods that included, yes, groups on facebook.com. Facebook yielded to the protests and reverted to its original contract with users. And in November, many consumers who used Twitter to criticize an ad for Motrin pain reliever received responses within 48 hours from the brand’s maker, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which apologized for the ad and told them it had been withdrawn. “Twitter is the ultimate focus group,” Mr. Shankman said. “I can post something and in a minute get feedback from 700 people around the world, giving me their real opinions.” Neil Campbell, president at Tropicana North America in Chicago, part of PepsiCo Americas Beverages, acknowledged that consumers can communicate with marketers “more readily and more quickly” than ever. “For companies that put consumers at the center of what they do,” he said, “it’s a good thing.”  It was not the volume of the outcries that led to the corporate change of heart, Mr. Campbell said, because “it was a fraction of a percent of the people who buy the product.” Rather, the criticism is being heeded because it came, Mr. Campbell said in a telephone interview on Friday, from some of “our most loyal consumers.” “We underestimated the deep emotional bond” they had with the original packaging, he added. “Those consumers are very important to us, so we responded.” Among those who underestimated that bond was Mr. Campbell himself. In an interview last month to discuss the new packaging, he said, “The straw and orange have been there for a long time, but people have not necessarily had a huge connection to them.” Reminded of that on Friday, Mr. Campbell said: “What we didn’t get was the passion this very loyal small group of consumers have. That wasn’t something that came out in the research.” That echoed an explanation offered in 1985 by executives of the Coca-Cola Company in response to the avalanche of complaints when they replaced the original version of Coca-Cola with New Coke: Consumers in focus groups liked the taste of New Coke, but were not told old Coke would disappear. The original version was hastily brought back as Coca-Cola Classic and New Coke eventually fizzed out. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 23, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.IT took 24 years, but PepsiCo now has its own version of New Coke.

But will those efforts take a backseat in a recession? Eric J. Foss, chairman and chief executive of the Pepsi Bottling Group, argues that building diversity in a tough economy is even more important. His company has created one of the most diverse boards, in terms of gender and ethnicity, of any company in the Fortune 500. Skip to next paragraph Eric J. Foss Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The board of Pepsi Bottling, which is based in Somers, N.Y., and is separate from PepsiCo, has four women, one of them Hispanic; one African-American man; and one Mexican man among its 10 members. The company’s customers are distributors and retailers that ultimately sell to consumers. Here are excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Foss: Q. In a recession, shouldn’t companies concentrate on profitability, not diversity? A. If you look at the current business environment, there’s no doubt there’s a huge amount of volatility and unpredictability. We try to control what we can control. First, we concentrate on value, revenue and margin. We want to be a great seller and service provider at the point of sale. Secondly, we’re focused on cost, capital and working capital management. But thirdly, we need to stay focused on and committed to culture and talent development. We need to stay focused on improving our diversity. It’s one of our top three priorities, even in the current business environment. Q. Do you think your own diversity can actually help expand sales? A. Part of the strategic rationale for this is that our employee base needs to be reflective of our customer base. As our customers continue to become more diverse, it’s important that organizationally we look like them. Q. So diversity is part and parcel of your core business strategy, not a luxury or some sort? A. It’s not a fad. It’s not an idea of the month. It’s central and it’s linked very directly to the business strategy. That is the case in great times and in more challenging times. Q. Did you personally create this board or did you inherit it? A. It really started almost 10 years ago when we did our initial public offering and put the board together. We had two females. But we’ve had a very conscious strategy to increase our board diversity. Our starting point was that homogenous boards have a lot more difficulty dealing with the broad range of marketplace challenges that you deal with globally today. In the United States, the multicultural consumer today is over a third of the population, and 80 percent of the population growth. So making sure we have a diverse board and a diverse work force helps us understand the needs of the marketplace. Q. Is there a connection between having a diverse board and being able to attract and retain a diverse work force? A. Absolutely. Our approach to diversity is a fully integrated program. It starts with our business strategy. It connects to our annual operating plan. It runs top to bottom. It runs boardroom to backroom, as we like to say. It plays across all levels of the organization. Q. Is there direct contact between board members and different populations within your work force, like a mentoring program? A. We try during our people-planning sessions each year with our board to talk to them about the talent we have in the organization. We try to expose our future leaders to the board. We do that on a fairly consistent basis both as part of the people-planning process and visits into the marketplace. Q. How do you integrate diverse members into a board culture, what you call “onboarding?” A. Any time we recruit a new board member, we try to give them a real-life experience. We like to get them out into a manufacturing facility. We like to get them introduced to our people and expose them to our culture, take them through each of the functional disciplines and have meet-and-greets with the teams. To have an effective board member to come into a company with a fresh set of eyes, the quicker you can onboard them, the quicker you’re going to have a productive board member. It’s an orientation. Q. Does a diverse board help you as a white male make better decisions? A. I don’t know if it has anything to do with being a white male, but having somebody like Sue Kronick, the vice chairman of Macy’s, who has insights into the consumer, adds tremendous value as we sort through how we’re trying to grow or maybe do something unique on the packaging front given her experience in cosmetics. Packaging is extremely important in the cosmetics industry and she pushed us to think differently about packaging. Creative packaging can be a point of difference versus the competition. Q. Does a diverse board have more conflicts than a more homogenous board might? A. Great boards have to get comfortable with debate itself. The management team has to get comfortable with valuing different points of view. If you do that, while it’s not always easy, and it’s not always pretty, ultimately the outcomes you get for your business are much better. Q. In this climate, wouldn’t it be better to have a smoothly functioning homogenous board than a challenging diverse one? A. I would say it’s difficult, if not impossible, for homogenous boards to challenge and offer different perspectives, unique experiences and the broad-based wisdom that makes the board, and therefore the company, as effective as they can be. I’m a big believer that diversity allows our company to create more shareholder value, whether in challenging times or not.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » PepsiCo, which makes Pepsi, Gatorade and Tropicana products, said it earned $719 million, or 46 cents a share, down from $1.26 billion, or 77 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring and other one-time items, the company earned $1.39 billion, or 88 cents a share. That matched a consensus estimate from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and brands like Doritos and Sun Chips, said revenue climbed 3 percent, to $12.73 billion, from $12.35 billion. Analysts had expected $12.8 billion. The company also said it planned to repurchase $2.5 billion of its stock this year. Stock in PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., rose 57 cents, to $52.57 a share. Like other global consumer products makers, PepsiCo and its larger rival, the Coca-Cola Company, have struggled as the dollar’s value has risen against other currencies since last fall. Companies that do significant business overseas suffer when the dollar strengthens because their overseas sales and operations in other currencies then translate into fewer dollars. PepsiCo said the dollar’s strength hurt operating income by 5 cents a share. If the dollar maintains its current strength, adjusted profit could be eight percentage points lower in 2009, PepsiCo predicted. During the quarter, PepsiCo took a pretax restructuring charge of $543 million for layoffs and the closing of six plants, as well as a $227 million reduction in the value of commodity hedges. PepsiCo has laid off 3,500 employees and closed six plants as part of an effort to cut $1.2 billion in costs by 2011. The chief financial officer, Richard Goodman, said no more job cuts were planned, but it “depends on how the economy progresses.” The company predicts that the first half of the year, especially the first quarter, will decline most from a year earlier because of commodity costs and the stronger dollar. At PepsiCo Americas Foods, revenue climbed 5 percent, while Frito-Lay North America reported 7 percent sales growth. Quaker Foods North America’s revenue grew 2 percent and Latin America Foods’ sales edged up 1 percent. PepsiCo Americas Beverages posted a 10 percent sales decline as the North American soft drink industry had its first year-over-year sales decline. PepsiCo has begun a marketing campaign to bring consumers back to soft drinks like Pepsi, Sierra Mist and Mountain Dew. The promotional push includes a new Pepsi logo, more ads in public spaces and a new 16-ounce soda can to be sold for 99 cents. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 18, 2009 A headline on Saturday with an article about PepsiCo’s fourth-quarter earnings misstated the company’s results. As the article correctly reported, Pepsi’s profit fell 43 percent; it did not suffer a 43 percent loss.

PepsiCo, which owns Frito-Lay and brands like Doritos and Sun Chips, said revenue climbed 3 percent, to $12.73 billion, from $12.35 billion. Analysts had expected $12.8 billion. The company also said it planned to repurchase $2.5 billion of its stock this year. Stock in PepsiCo, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., rose 57 cents, to $52.57 a share. Like other global consumer products makers, PepsiCo and its larger rival, the Coca-Cola Company, have struggled as the dollar’s value has risen against other currencies since last fall. Companies that do significant business overseas suffer when the dollar strengthens because their overseas sales and operations in other currencies then translate into fewer dollars. PepsiCo said the dollar’s strength hurt operating income by 5 cents a share. If the dollar maintains its current strength, adjusted profit could be eight percentage points lower in 2009, PepsiCo predicted. During the quarter, PepsiCo took a pretax restructuring charge of $543 million for layoffs and the closing of six plants, as well as a $227 million reduction in the value of commodity hedges. PepsiCo has laid off 3,500 employees and closed six plants as part of an effort to cut $1.2 billion in costs by 2011. The chief financial officer, Richard Goodman, said no more job cuts were planned, but it “depends on how the economy progresses.” The company predicts that the first half of the year, especially the first quarter, will decline most from a year earlier because of commodity costs and the stronger dollar. At PepsiCo Americas Foods, revenue climbed 5 percent, while Frito-Lay North America reported 7 percent sales growth. Quaker Foods North America’s revenue grew 2 percent and Latin America Foods’ sales edged up 1 percent. PepsiCo Americas Beverages posted a 10 percent sales decline as the North American soft drink industry had its first year-over-year sales decline. PepsiCo has begun a marketing campaign to bring consumers back to soft drinks like Pepsi, Sierra Mist and Mountain Dew. The promotional push includes a new Pepsi logo, more ads in public spaces and a new 16-ounce soda can to be sold for 99 cents. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: February 18, 2009 A headline on Saturday with an article about PepsiCo’s fourth-quarter earnings misstated the company’s results. As the article correctly reported, Pepsi’s profit fell 43 percent; it did not suffer a 43 percent loss.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/business/22pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">How Green Is My Orange?<date>Published: January 21, 2009</date><text>BRADENTON, Fla.  How much does your morning glass of orange juice contribute to global warming? Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show Tracking Carbon Footprints to the Breakfast Table Graphic The Environmental Cost of Orange Juice Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » PepsiCo, which owns the Tropicana brand, decided to try to answer that question. It figured that as public concern grows about the fate of the planet, companies will find themselves under pressure to perform such calculations. Orange juice seemed like a good case study. PepsiCo hired experts to do the math, measuring the emissions from such energy-intensive tasks as running a factory and transporting heavy juice cartons. But it turned out that the biggest single source of emissions was simply growing oranges. Citrus groves use a lot of nitrogen fertilizer, which requires natural gas to make and can turn into a potent greenhouse gas when it is spread on fields. PepsiCo finally came up with a number: the equivalent of 3.75 pounds of carbon dioxide are emitted to the atmosphere for each half-gallon carton of orange juice. But the company is still debating how to use that information. Should it cite the number in its marketing, and would consumers have a clue what to make of it? PepsiCo’s experience is a harbinger of the complexities other companies may face as they come under pressure to calculate their emission of carbon dioxide, a number known as a carbon footprint, and eventually to lower it. “The main thing is helping us figure out where the carbon is in the chain,” said Neil Campbell, president of Tropicana North America, a division of PepsiCo. While acknowledging that protocols for measuring greenhouse emissions are far from perfect, Mr. Campbell said, “you can end up doing nothing if you let that stop you.” PepsiCo, a manufacturer of soda, salty snacks and cereal based in Purchase, N.Y., is among a growing number of companies that hope to get ahead of potential government mandates and curb their energy use as prices and long-term supply grow less certain. They also want to promote supposedly low-carbon products to consumers anxious about rising global temperatures; such labeling has already appeared in Europe. The list of companies that have taken steps to reduce carbon emissions includes I.B.M., Nike, Coca-Cola and BP, the oil giant. Google, Yahoo and Dell are among the companies that have vowed to become “carbon neutral.” PepsiCo is among the first that will provide consumers with an absolute number for a product’s carbon footprint, which many expect to be a trend. The information will be posted on Tropicana’s Web site. The company has not yet decided if it will eventually put it on the package. While carbon reduction efforts are generally welcomed by environmentalists, some complain that the marketing claims are backed by fuzzy numbers and dubious assumptions. Standards exist for determining a carbon footprint, but companies can apply them in different ways. They can decide how rigorous they want to be in counting emissions in the supply chain, and what data sources they should use in the process. “Any time people are making a legitimate effort to reduce emissions directly or indirectly with their product and services, most of us would think that is a good thing,” said Michael Gillenwater, dean of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute, a nonprofit organization that teaches greenhouse gas management and accounting. “The trick is when you try to put a strict label that has implications for comparing your product to another product, or implying that you have no climate change impact,” he said. Nancy Hirshberg, vice president for natural resources at the yogurt maker Stonyfield Farm, said measuring a carbon footprint is a “fabulous tool” for pinpointing areas to reduce emissions. For instance, her company was surprised to learn that milk production was a far bigger contributor to greenhouse gas emissions than its factory. But she said there were so many variables in determining a carbon footprint that an absolute number was meaningless as a marketing tool. “I’m thrilled that people are thinking about their carbon footprint, but to put a number on a package is misleading at best,” she said. PepsiCo’s interest in determining the carbon footprint of its products began in England, where carbon anxiety is further advanced than in the United States. In 2007, Walkers, a PepsiCo brand, published the carbon footprint of its potato chips on its Web site and on the package. Mr. Campbell, who ran the Walkers brand, championed the idea when he came to Tropicana at the beginning of 2008. As was the case with Walkers, Tropicana hired an outside auditor, the Carbon Trust, to review its calculations and certify its footprint. The Carbon Trust was set up by the British government to accelerate progress toward a low-carbon economy. Making orange juice is relatively straightforward: the oranges are picked by hand, trucked to the plant, squeezed, pasteurized and packed into cartons and shipped by train to distribution points around the country. Early on, company officials roughed out the carbon footprint of Tropicana juice. But when the Carbon Trust came back with its own calculations, that initial estimate was off by more than 20 percent. Growing the oranges accounted for a larger share  about a third  than PepsiCo had expected, almost entirely because of the production and application of fertilizer. Now, PepsiCo managers said they planned to work with their growers and with researchers at the University of Florida to find ways to grow oranges using less carbon. And they are starting to grapple with ways to teach the public how to interpret the carbon footprint of a product. PepsiCo is scheduled to announce its Tropicana results on Thursday, and will publish carbon-footprint numbers for products including Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Gatorade. Said Bryan Lembke, a PepsiCo manager on the project: “If you don’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 22, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.BRADENTON, Fla.  How much does your morning glass of orange juice contribute to global warming?

Enough to undertake a major makeover of its advertising, marketing and packaging, centered on “squeeze” as a noun as well as a verb. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Omnicom Group Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The company is retiring its longtime straw logo and carton design. A multimedia campaign, getting under way this week, is the first for the Tropicana juice brand from its new agency, the Arnell Group in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. The campaign carries the typographically challenging theme “squeeze it’s a natural,” which is intended to evoke the way oranges are turned into Tropicana along with the warm way in which the company wants consumers to embrace the brand. The campaign has a budget estimated at more than $35 million, which executives at Tropicana describe as significantly larger than in recent years. One noticeable change is the disappearance of the longtime Tropicana symbol, a straw stuck in an orange that stood for the juice’s fresh taste. The device is being replaced by a tall glass filled with Tropicana and an orange-colored twist cap atop large cartons that is shaped like a halved orange. The campaign is among several efforts by PepsiCo to stimulate sales for its brands with worldwide retail sales of $1 billion or more. In addition to Tropicana, products like Diet Pepsi, Gatorade, Mountain Dew, Pepsi-Cola and Quaker are benefiting from some or all of the following: new campaigns, new agencies, new varieties, new logos, new packaging. Those initiatives are indicative of the renewed attention that prosaic food brands are getting as the recession continues. To save money, consumers are eating more meals at home and fewer meals at restaurants. Though marketers typically cut back during economic downturns, purveyors of packaged foods like PepsiCo, Campbell Soup, ConAgra, General Mills, Heinz and Kellogg are staying the course or even trying to capitalize on conditions and raise the profiles of their familiar brands. “We’re not explicitly talking about the price of a glass of orange juice, but it’s a pretty good value equation,” said Neil Campbell, president at Tropicana North America in Chicago, part of the PepsiCo Americas Beverages division of PepsiCo. “For less than 50 cents, you can get an eight-ounce glass and start your day with two servings of fruit,” he added. Still, because Tropicana is not made from concentrate, it costs more than rivals like Minute Maid, sold by a unit of the Coca-Cola Company. Indeed, the full brand name is Tropicana Pure Premium  and premium-price products, even in the food field, have been suffering as shoppers trade down to lower-priced alternatives. Such sales losses are “not huge” so far, Mr. Campbell said, but they are “something you’ve always got to watch for” in tough times. A primary purpose of the campaign, he added, is “to make sure that doesn’t become a phenomenon.” The campaign represents “the opportunity to re-present Tropicana in a big way,” Mr. Campbell said, “and remind people of the goodness of orange juice.” “We’re looking to rejuvenate the category,” he added, which would help Tropicana as “the category leader.” Typically, about 40 percent of all the orange juice sold each year is Tropicana. The new ads and new packaging could also help the brand counter the competition from newer beverages like energy drinks and flavored waters  some of them sold by PepsiCo  as well as criticism about the sugar content of orange juice. A 14-ounce carton of Tropicana has 39 grams of sugar; a 20-ounce bottle of Pepsi-Cola has 70 grams. “The whole idea of ‘squeeze,’ ” Mr. Campbell said, is to play up “the functional benefit” of orange juice in providing fruit for people’s daily diets “and the emotional connection people have with Tropicana.” That accounts for the use of “squeeze” because of its double meaning. Squeeze “is the process by which we get our product and the hug, ‘my favorite,’ ‘my squeeze,’ ” said Peter Arnell, chairman and chief creative officer at Arnell, which redesigned the Tropicana packaging and created the campaign. “There was this notion of owning a simple word that would communicate the love, the care, in this ‘Obama moment’ we’re all going through,” he added. Adding the phrase “it’s a natural” is intended to address the concerns over the sugar content, Mr. Arnell said, as is the focus on the new packaging of the phrase “100% orange pure &amp; natural” Ads that appeared in Sunday newspapers described the new cartons as a “fresh new look for your morning 100 percent orange” and played up the “two servings of fruit in every glass.” Plans call for television commercials to be added to the campaign. Print and online ads, posters and signs in stores present images of attractive models  men, women, children  as singles and pairs or in familylike groups. They are a long way from the onetime Tropicana brand mascot, Tropic-Ana, a cartoon of a grinning girl in a grass skirt. The models’ poses and the casual clothes would not seem out of place in ads previously created by Mr. Arnell for the DKNY apparel brand. Mr. Arnell said he hoped the new orange-colored, orange-shaped caps on the large Tropicana cartons would become as symbolic of the brand as the white, swirl-shaped caps on cans of Reddi-wip topping are for that product. The Arnell Group has also designed new logos for PepsiCo soft drinks like Diet Pepsi, Diet Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew and Pepsi-Cola. The agency was named to create campaigns for Tropicana in April, replacing another Omnicom agency, Element 79 Partners in Chicago. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 15, 2009 The Advertising column last Thursday, about a new campaign for Tropicana orange juice, misstated the amount of sugar in a 20-ounce bottle of Pepsi-Cola, which was compared to the amount of sugar in a 14-ounce carton of Tropicana.

Skip to next paragraph Related Obscure Fee Pays for Efficient-Energy Projects (December 29, 2008) PepsiCo, for example, received $1 million from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority to cover about half of a $2.35 million combined heat and power system that it installed last year in its 160,000-square-foot bottling plant in College Point, Queens. It is one of at least 45 companies, including The New York Times, that have received such grants in the last half decade. To slash its electric consumption, Pepsi installed four 400-kilowatt generators powered by natural gas that produce about 80 percent of the electricity needed to run the filling, packaging and processing machines. The price of natural gas, which was already being used to run the plant’s boilers, is relatively stable, unlike electricity, which shoots up during peak times, like summer days. Not coincidentally, summer days are when the bottling plant is busiest. By producing its own energy, the company is also eligible for a New York City program that pays Pepsi about 4 cents for every kilowatt-hour that it produces on-site. Generators, of course, give off a lot of heat. Instead of letting it escape into the atmosphere, the machines capture and convert the heat into steam, which is then used to warm the bottles and clean the machines. This has reduced Pepsi’s use of its boilers by 70 percent. “The benefit is you get to use the exhaust from the generators,” said Jorge Lopez, chief executive of ConEdison Solutions, which designed and helped install the system that PepsiCo turned on last year. “It’s three to four times more efficient than a typical generator.” The company still uses some electricity, mostly for when the generators are being turned on and off, as well as on very busy days, when Pepsi needs more than the 1,600 kilowatts that the four generators can produce. Robert Sherman, vice president of operations at Pepsi-Cola Bottling, said the company expects to meet its goal of saving $408,400 in the first year.

This week, Coca-Cola said it would begin selling products made with the new zero-calorie sweetener despite not yet receiving the official word from the government. PepsiCo said it would not follow suit until the F.D.A. issued the designation. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., said Wednesday that it would be releasing three new zero-calorie SoBe Lifewater flavors: Fuji Apple Pear, Black and Blue Berry and Yumberry Pomegranate. The products will be in stores this year, the company said. Coca-Cola, based in Atlanta, said Wednesday it would introduce an extension of its Sprite line with the Truvia sweetener.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/18/business/media/18adco.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Pepsi Shifts to a New Ad Agency<date>Published: November 17, 2008</date><text>ONE of the longest relationships in advertising is coming to an end as PepsiCo shifts the creative duties in the United States for its flagship soft drink, Pepsi-Cola, from BBDO Worldwide, which has produced campaigns for the brand since 1960. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Omnicom Group Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Pepsi-Cola Cindy Crawford appeared in a spot for Diet Pepsi. For decades, BBDO and Pepsi-Cola collaborated on some of the most popular and successful sales efforts ever developed on Madison Avenue. The ads created by BBDO, part of the Omnicom Group, carried themes like “The choice of a new generation” and “The joy of Pepsi.” Many of the campaigns helped transform Pepsi-Cola from a sleepy also-ran behind the leading soft drink, Coca-Cola, into a tough competitor that challenges Coke constantly for control of the carbonated beverage market. But lately, the battle between Coke and Pepsi is being won not by either brand but mostly by noncarbonated products like juices, teas, energy drinks, sports beverages and bottled water. And the most recent campaigns that BBDO has created for Pepsi-Cola have not resonated with consumers the way previous ads did.  PepsiCo said last month it would spend $1.2 billion over three years to revive sales of carbonated soft drinks in North America, which have flagged for the Coca-Cola Company and other beverage behemoths as well as for PepsiCo. That led trade publications like Advertising Age to speculate that BBDO’s hold on Pepsi-Cola was loosening. The agency that will replace BBDO is also owned by Omnicom. It is the office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, that is located in the Playa del Rey section of Los Angeles. The office will also take over from BBDO the creative duties for Diet Pepsi. The change in agencies is being made “to refresh Pepsi’s communications,” Dave Burwick, the new chief marketing officer for the PepsiCo North America beverages division, said in a statement on Monday, “and to reinvigorate Pepsi’s legacy of leading-edge advertising.” A spokeswoman for Pepsi in Purchase, N.Y., Nicole Bradley, said the company would not elaborate beyond the statement. New ads are being developed by TBWA/Chiat/Day to start running at the beginning of next year, Ms. Bradley said, but she added she did not know whether they would be introduced on the Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 1. PepsiCo has for many years used the Super Bowl as a launching pad for new campaigns for Pepsi-Cola and other brands. A spokesman for BBDO in New York, Roy Elvove, referred questions about the change to Ms. Bradley. BBDO will continue to create campaigns for Pepsi-Cola in markets outside the United States. And BBDO will remain the creative agency of record for PepsiCo beverages like Amp, Aquafina, Diet Pepsi Max, Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist as well as the products that PepsiCo markets jointly in North America with the Starbucks Coffee Company, which include Frappuccino. The shift represents an expansion of a fledgling relationship between PepsiCo and TBWA/Chiat/Day; in April, the company gave the agency the creative assignment for its Gatorade line of sports beverages. “We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work on one of the great brands in the world,” Tom Carroll, president and chief executive at TBWA Worldwide, said in a statement, referring to Pepsi-Cola. “It is impossible not to feel passionate about the direction the brand is evolving to,” he added. Also on Monday, PepsiCo designated the Arnell Group in New York, another Omnicom shop, as its design agency for projects centered on brand identity and packaging for Pepsi-Cola and other brands. That, too, was an expansion of a relationship, as Arnell creates campaigns for the SoBe and Tropicana lines of beverages sold by PepsiCo. Arnell has already been working on a redesign of the logos for PepsiCo carbonated soft drinks like Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi, Diet Pepsi Max and Mountain Dew. PepsiCo has been cutting back on ad spending for Pepsi-Cola and Diet Pepsi in major media like television, according to research companies that track ad spending. Data from Nielsen Monitor-Plus reported that spending fell to $94 million in 2007 from $142 million in 2006; it fell further through the first 10 months of this year, to $48 million. The shifts of the Pepsi-Cola and Diet Pepsi creative assignments are the most recent in a skein as PepsiCo seeks to shake up its marketing methods. In addition to Gatorade and Tropicana, other brands with new creative agencies include Doritos snacks, Lay’s potato chips, Propel water, Quaker cereals and Rice-A-Roni.  The key to the success that BBDO had with Pepsi-Cola arose when the agency began to associate the brand with the growing youth market in the United States. It was an idea that paid off hugely as the tens of millions of baby boomers started to perceive Pepsi-Cola as their brand  and Coca-Cola as a brand of their parents or even their grandparents. That was reinforced by campaign themes from BBDO that included “Now it’s Pepsi for those who think young”; “Come alive! You’re in the Pepsi generation”; “Pepsi. The choice of a new generation”; and “Generation next.” Also helping to change perceptions about Pepsi  and Coke  were cheeky campaigns from BBDO that mocked Coke as a bygone brand. One commercial was set in the future, with an archaeology professor overseeing his students at a dig. When they uncover a Coke bottle and ask him what it is, the professor replied, “I have no idea.” Other spots that tweaked Coca-Cola featured a character who was dressed like a driver of a Coke delivery truck but had a penchant for Pepsi. Over the years, BBDO developed a style for Pepsi-Cola campaigns that was centered on high-energy television commercials filled with special effects, celebrities, jingles and pop music. That approach later came to characterize how the agency created Super Bowl spots for clients like FedEx and Visa as well as PepsiCo. Among the celebrities that appeared in BBDO campaigns for Pepsi or Diet Pepsi were Ray Charles, Sean Combs, Cindy Crawford, Michael J. Fox, Michael Jackson, Madonna and Britney Spears. The BBDO creative executive most identified with the agency’s work for Pepsi-Cola was Philip B. Dusenberry, who held posts that included vice chairman of BBDO and chairman for the BBDO North American operations. Mr. Dusenberry retired from the agency in 2002 and died last December.

That’s bad news for PepsiCo’s profits. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Pepsico Inc. Add to Portfolio PepsiCo Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company, which makes Pepsi, Doritos and Quaker Oats cereal, announced on Tuesday that its quarterly earnings were down 10 percent in part because of declines in sales of soda and bottled water in the United States. In response, the company is planning to eliminate 3,300 jobs and close as many as six plants to cut costs and to refocus its efforts on stabilizing its domestic beverage business. “Revitalizing this business is a huge priority for us,” said PepsiCo’s chief executive, Indra Nooyi. Pepsi reported net income of $1.58 billion for the third quarter, compared with $1.74 billion a year earlier. Excluding losses related to commodity hedges, the company’s earnings were $1.06 per share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.08 per share. The company’s stock price dropped $7.37 to close at $54.40 on Tuesday. The stock has fallen 28 percent since the beginning of the year, most of that in the last two weeks. PepsiCo’s stock on Oct. 1 was $71.64. Sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining in the United States for several years, as consumers turn to a growing number of new beverages like enhanced waters, sports drinks and energy drinks. But the problems have accelerated in a volatile economy, with consumers eating at restaurants less and buying fewer grab-and-go beverages. In addition, consumers are increasingly choosing tap water over other beverages at restaurants and at home to help save money and the environment, according to PepsiCo and industry analysts. Research by William Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, found that 34 percent of consumers say they are reusing plastic bottles more often and 23 percent say they are cutting back on bottled beverages in favor of tap water or beverages in containers that create less waste. Information Resources, a research firm, found that sales of water filters increased 16 percent in the first half of the year. PepsiCo said volume for beverages in North America declined by 4 percent in the third quarter, which ended in Sept. 6. In recent years, noncarbonated beverages were an engine of growth as soda sales slipped, but no longer. Volume for noncarbonated beverage sales dropped 5 percent in the quarter, led by double-digit declines in Aquafina and Propel, a flavored and vitamin-enhanced water drink. Carbonated soft drink volume in North America declined by 3 percent in the quarter. In response, PepsiCo is creating new packaging and logos for many beverages, and plans to introduce new products in the coming year. “Because of the economy, there is some movement, probably temporarily, back to tap water,” said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry publication. He predicted that both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola would ratchet up their efforts to improve beverage sales in 2009. “Unless both Pepsi and Coke do something quickly, they could lose a generation of carbonated soft drink consumers,” Mr. Sicher said. To increase sales in the United States, Ms. Nooyi said, would take a “breakthrough” product. Both Pepsi and Coke are hoping for a breakthrough when they introduce beverages that use a natural, low-calorie sweetener derived from the stevia plant. Despite the lackluster beverage sales in North America, Ms. Nooyi said international growth remained robust, particularly in the Middle East, India and China. Revenue for PepsiCo’s food businesses in the North America grew by 12 percent in the quarter, and profit increased by 9 percent.

Both developments are considered bad for Coke, too, because three-fourths of its revenue originates overseas; lower growth could mean lower foreign sales, and weaker currencies cut the dollar value of those sales. The result is a stock that has lost about 15 percent in the last six months, approximately double the loss of the broad market. What shareholders must find especially disheartening is that this is the sort of environment  a recession or something close to it  in which producers of consumer staples like Coke are supposed to display resilience. Coca-Cola’s troubles are not confined to the last few months, and they are not all caused by the unraveling of the global economic boom. Repeated missteps by senior management have made the stock a long-term underperformer. It is down about 20 percent since the start of 1998, a period in which the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index has risen about 35 percent. Some investment advisers think shareholders have gotten what they deserved. Jim Huguet, a portfolio manager specializing in blue-chip stocks for Huguet Associates, has been a longstanding critic of Coke’s management. Rivals like PepsiCo were quick to catch the trend toward bottled water and sports drinks and positioned their companies to benefit, he said. Over the last decade, he said, Coke continued to rely heavily on carbonated drinks and paid a price in stagnant sales. “They could have bought Gatorade, which was up for sale and which Pepsi bought,” Mr. Huguet said. He called Pepsi “a much more innovative company than Coca-Cola” and added, “When you talk about innovative leaders, Coke doesn’t pop to the top of the list.” But even he concedes that the company has taken steps to move farther from the bottom. The recent agreement to pay $2.5 billion for China Huiyuan Juice is a wise move, in his view, because it chisels away at Coke’s dependence on carbonated drinks and expands the company’s presence in a huge, fast-growing economy. That opinion is widespread. John Faucher, who follows Coca-Cola for JPMorgan, called the deal “a long-term strategic positive” in a note to the bank’s clients and lauded the “long-term growth opportunities and the potential for some manufacturing synergies.” He cautioned, however, that some investors might worry that Coke would buy back fewer of its own shares in order to have cash for the acquisition. Ken Gau, an analyst at Waddell &amp; Reed, is another fan of the acquisition. He described the announcement as “one of the first things we’ve seen out of them in a while that’s encouraging for longer-term growth.” Mr. Gau joined Mr. Huguet in criticizing the decisions made by Coke’s bosses during the last decade and the sense of aimlessness that it produced. But he tends to see the bottle as half full rather than nearly empty. HE commended the firm’s chairman, E. Neville Isdell, for overhauling top management  including himself, when he stepped down as chief executive in July, placing Muhtar Kent in the post  and for setting the company in a direction likely to improve growth well into the future. Waddell &amp; Reed holds more than 10 million Coke shares in its portfolios. Mr. Gau contends that the stock’s valuation, about 15 times the earnings that analysts expect for this year, fully takes account of the company’s difficult history. But at that level, he said, investors are not factoring in the positive developments that he foresees. “It’s a pretty inexpensive stock for what it has to offer,” he said.

So why did Americans spend nearly $11 billion on bottled water in 2006, when we could have guzzled tap water at up to about one ten-thousandth the cost?

Related First Chapter: Bottlemania (June 15, 2008) Op-Ed Contributor: A Fountain on Every Corner (May 23, 2008) Times Topics: Water The 'Bottlemania' Web Site Enlarge This Image Adam Berry/Bloomberg News “Bottlemania” is an easy-to-swallow survey of the subject from verdant springs in the Maine woods to tap water treatment plants in Kansas City; from the grand specter of worldwide water wars, to the microscopic crustaceans called copepods, whose presence in New York’s tap water inspired a debate by Talmudic scholars about whether the critters violated dietary laws, and whether filtering water on the Sabbath constituted work. (Verdict: no and no.) Water is a topic that lends itself to tour-de-force treatment (the book “Cadillac Desert” and the movie “Chinatown” come to mind), as well as righteous indictments and dire predictions (“Thirst: Fighting the Corporate Theft of Our Water,” “When the Rivers Run Dry: Water  The Defining Crisis of the Twenty-First Century”). Where others are bold, “Bottlemania” is subversive, and after you read it you will sip warily from your water bottle (whether purchased or tap, plastic or not), as freaked out by your own role in today’s insidious water wars as by Royte’s recommended ecologically responsible drink: “Toilet to tap.” Eww. Sorry. Let’s talk about those evil marketers. In 1987, Americans drank only 5.7 gallons of bottled water per person per year, but the cumulative impact of ad campaigns and the vision of Madonna fellating a bottle of Evian in “Truth or Dare” more than doubled consumption by 1997. In 2000 the chief executive of Quaker Oats bragged to analysts that “the biggest enemy is tap water.” By 2005, the enemy had become the consumer’s bladder; and in 2006, Pepsi, which owns Aquafina, spent $20 million suggesting that Americans “drink more water.” That year we drank 27.6 gallons each at a rate of about a billion bottles a week. But marketing swings both ways. As quickly as bottled water became a symbol of healthy hyperindividualism  sort of an iPod for your kidneys  a backlash turned it into the devil’s drink. In 2006, the National Coalition of American Nuns came out against bottled water for the moral reason that life’s essential resource should not be privatized. New numbers surfaced: each year the bottles themselves require 17 million barrels of oil to manufacture, and, one expert tells Royte, “the total energy required for every bottle’s production, transport and disposal is equivalent, on average, to filling that bottle a quarter of the way with oil.” Mayors from San Francisco to New York suddenly became aware of the new symbolism of bottled water as a waste of taxpayer money, a diss of local tap water and a threat to the environment. Some canceled their city’s bottled water contracts. Chicago began taxing the stuff. And celebrities  among them Matt Damon and ... Madonna  started backing a dazzling array of water charities in support of domestic tap and African water supplies, associating themselves with the magical ur-brand of “pure water” just as marketers and Madonna did in the early ’90s. Royte asks, perceptively, if the pro-bottle and anti-bottle movements aren’t cut from the same plastic: “Is it fashion or is it a rising awareness of the bottle’s environmental toll that’s driving the backlash? I’m starting to think they’re the same thing.” To Royte, the author of “Garbage Land,” righteousness requires a greater commitment. She finds it in Fryeburg, Me., a town of 3,000 that is trying to stop Nestlé’s Poland Spring from sucking 168 million gallons of water a year out of the pristine aquifer buried under its piney woods. As Royte arrives the town is in an uproar, with neighbor pitted against neighbor and rumors of secret planning-board meetings and of dummy corporations. Fryeburg is a “perfect example of water’s shift from a public good to an economic force,” she observes. The locals are more blunt: “This is what a water war looks like.” Fryeburg bears the burden of living at the other end of the giant green Poland Spring pipe. Residents of nearby Hiram count 92 water tankers rolling through their town in one typical 24-hour period; they feel themselves under siege precisely because their watershed is clean, while 40 percent of the country’s rivers and streams are too polluted for swimming or fishing, let alone drinking. Fryeburg residents try to repel the water company. They demand tests, throw a Boston Tea Party by dumping Poland Spring in a local pond, take the issue to Maine’s Supreme Judicial Court and hold a town meeting straight out of Norman Rockwell. Here I wish Royte had devoted more energy to the narrative. The people of Fryeburg and their complaints feel tentative  a sketch where a portrait could have been. And although her writing always flows, I sometimes wished for something less utilitarian. That comes, unexpectedly, as Royte stands at the edge of the Ashokan Reservoir in upstate New York. “Ignoring the bluish mountains that form its backdrop and the phalanx of security guards in our foreground,” she gazes “down onto the spillway which curves and drops like a wedding cake, in four tiers, before sending its excess through a granite passage,” supplying 1.2 billion gallons a day through 300 miles of tunnels and aqueducts and 6,200 miles of distribution mains. There once was grandeur in public works, and Royte captures the mythic heroism that inspired the politicians and engineers to build great reservoirs more than a century ago. Their outsize civic largesse makes our current culture of single-serving bottles feel decidedly crummy. But returning to public water’s golden age, if it’s possible, will not come cheap. Royte says the country needs to invest $390 billion in our failing water infrastructure by 2020. By the time I finished “Bottlemania” I thought twice about drinking any water. Among the risks: arsenic, gasoline additives, 82 different pharmaceuticals, fertilizer runoff sufficient to raise nitrate levels so that Iowa communities issue “blue baby” alerts. And in 42 states, Royte notes, “people drink tap water that contains at least 10 different pollutants on the same day.” The privatization of pristine water is part of a larger story, a tragic failure to steward our shared destiny. And if you think buying water will protect you, Royte points out that it too is loosely regulated. And there is more  the dangers of pipes and of plastic bottles, the hazards of filters, and yes, that “toilet to tap” issue. But there is slim comfort: Royte says we don’t really need to drink eight glasses of water a day. Drink when you’re thirsty, an expert says. That’s refreshing.

Skip to next paragraph Stuart Bradford Well Are energy drinks harmful for teens? Join the discussion. Go to Well » RSS Feed Get Health News From The New York Times » Super-caffeinated energy drinks, with names like Red Bull, Monster, Full Throttle and Amp, have surged in popularity in the past decade. About a third of 12- to 24-year-olds say they regularly down energy drinks, which account for more than $3 billion in annual sales in the United States. The trend has been the source of growing concern among health researchers and school officials. Around the country, the drinks have been linked with reports of nausea, abnormal heart rhythms and emergency room visits. In Colorado Springs, several high school students last year became ill after drinking Spike Shooter, a high caffeine drink, prompting the principal to ban the beverages. In March, four middle school students in Broward County, Fla., went to the emergency room with heart palpitations and sweating after drinking the energy beverage Redline. In Tigard, Ore., teachers this month sent parents e-mail alerting them that students who brought energy drinks to school were “literally drunk on a caffeine buzz or falling off a caffeine crash.” New research suggests the drinks are associated with a health issue far more worrisome than the jittery effects of caffeine  risk taking. In March, The Journal of American College Health published a report on the link between energy drinks, athletics and risky behavior. The study’s author, Kathleen Miller, an addiction researcher at the University of Buffalo, says it suggests that high consumption of energy drinks is associated with “toxic jock” behavior, a constellation of risky and aggressive behaviors including unprotected sex, substance abuse and violence. The finding doesn’t mean the drinks cause bad behavior. But the data suggest that regular consumption of energy drinks may be a red flag for parents that their children are more likely to take risks with their health and safety. “It appears the kids who are heavily into drinking energy drinks are more likely to be the ones who are inclined toward taking risks,” Dr. Miller said. The American Beverage Association says its members don’t market energy drinks to teenagers. “The intended audience is adults,” said Craig Stevens, a spokesman. He says the marketing is meant for “people who can actually afford the two or three bucks to buy the products.” The drinks include a variety of ingredients in different combinations: plant-based stimulants like guarana, herbs like ginkgo and ginseng, sugar, amino acids including taurine as well as vitamins. But the main active ingredient is caffeine. Caffeine content varies. A 12-ounce serving of Amp contains 107 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 34 to 38 milligrams for the same amount of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Monster has 120 milligrams and Red Bull has 116. Higher on the spectrum, Spike Shooter contains 428 milligrams of caffeine in 12 ounces, and Wired X344 contains 258. Mr. Stevens points out that “mainstream” energy drinks often have less caffeine than a cup of coffee. At Starbucks, the caffeine content varies depending on the drink, from 75 milligrams in a 12-ounce cappuccino or latte to as much as 250 milligrams in a 12-ounce brewed coffee. One concern about the drinks is that because they are served cold, they may be consumed in larger amounts and more quickly than hot coffee drinks, which are sipped. Another worry is the increasing popularity of mixing energy drinks with alcohol. The addition of caffeine can make alcohol users feel less drunk, but motor coordination and visual reaction time are just as impaired as when they drink alcohol by itself, according to an April 2006 study in the medical journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research. “You’re every bit as drunk, you’re just an awake drunk,” said Dr. Mary Claire O’Brien, associate professor in the departments of emergency medicine and public health services at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. Dr. O’Brien surveyed energy drink and alcohol use among college students at 10 universities in North Carolina. The study, published this month in Academic Emergency Medicine, showed that students who mixed energy drinks with alcohol got drunk twice as often as those who consumed alcohol by itself and were far more likely to be injured or require medical treatment while drinking. Energy drink mixers were more likely to be victims or perpetrators of aggressive sexual behavior. The effect remained even after researchers controlled for the amount of alcohol consumed. Energy drink marketers say they don’t encourage consumers to mix the drinks with alcohol. Michelle Naughton, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, which markets Amp, said, “We expect consumers to enjoy our products responsibly.” well@nytimes.com More Articles in Health »Health researchers have identified a surprising new predictor for risky behavior among teenagers and young adults: the energy drink.

Related Times Topics: Solar Energy The newest demonstration of solar power (figuratively) is coming from the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo, which is using the sun to help transform its SunChips line of multigrain snack chips into a “green” brand. The initiative is centered on the addition of solar power (literally) to the Frito-Lay plant in Modesto, Calif., that makes SunChips. A 10-acre “farm” of solar collectors is being added, to provide up to 75 percent of the energy needed to produce the product. The plant, one of seven in the United States that make SunChips, is scheduled to start using solar power on Earth Day, April 22, as part of ambitious efforts by Frito-Lay and PepsiCo to convince consumers that the companies care about the environment. Those measures include buying renewable energy credits, a move that is being promoted on packages of SunChips. The company is also rethinking manufacturing processes to use less water and power and is installing fuel-efficient ovens. Frito-Lay does not intend to hide its light under a bushel. A campaign to inform shoppers about the ecologically friendly changes is getting under way, composed of television commercials, print advertisements, billboards, information on the SunChips Web site (sunchips.com) and a presence on Facebook, the social-networking Web site. Environmental themes are enjoying a boom and are changing how marketers and agencies talk to consumers. Companies like Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, Macy’s, E. W. Scripps, Toyota and Wal-Mart are clambering aboard a bandwagon painted green, festooned with flowers and powered by an engine that runs on biodiesel fuel. A dozen news releases so far this week have featured ecological themes, like Macy’s teaming up with the National Parks Foundation for a fund-raiser called Turn Over a New Leaf and the opening by Union, an ad agency in New York, of a shop named Union Green that will specialize in work for “eco-conscious clients.” A skeptic could have fun with the earnest tone and greener-than-thou attitude that infuse many of the initiatives in this realm. So many marketers have been putting environmental claims in their ads that the trade publication Brandweek recently observed in a headline that “a green backlash gains momentum.” There is even a term, greenwashing, coined to describe the perceptions of consumers that a marketer is inappropriately adopting a green persona.  “This is a space that, frankly, everybody is trying to learn about, and we’re in that boat as well,” said Gannon Jones, vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex. He is overseeing the creation of the SunChips campaign by Juniper Park, an agency in Toronto affiliated with the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. As consumers express concerns for the planet, Mr. Jones said, “companies are scrambling to find out as much as they can and respond appropriately.” “The companies and brands that are successful don’t treat green as a promotional strategy,” he added. “They embrace it throughout their business strategy.” Mr. Jones, as may be expected, places Frito-Lay among the marketers that have deeds behind their green words. Although he declined to offer details, he described the installation of the solar panels at the Modesto plant as a multimillion-dollar investment that exceeded the budget for the SunChips campaign. That is significant because there are numerous examples of advertisers that spent more on campaigns to tell the public about noble activities, like bringing out green products or making charitable donations, than was spent on the activities themselves. “What we’re talking about is what we’re doing or what we’ve done,” Mr. Jones said of the campaign. “We’re not making claims we can’t back up because the wild claims have the potential to be harmful to the green movement over the long haul.” The commercials in the campaign, which are to start appearing on April 4, feature girls and women frolicking in the sun as an announcer invites viewers to “imagine capturing the sun’s power and making chips with it.” The spots end with the words “SunChips, now made with solar energy,” and the brand’s theme, “Live brightly.” One way green campaigns seek to avoid seeming too morally pure is to take a humorous tongue-in-cheek tack, and elements of the SunChips campaign follow that approach. For example, the billboards are to be built so that the letters spelling out the brand name are attached above the signs upside down and backward. When the sun comes out, the name will appear, cast in shadow across the top of the signs. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »MADISON AVENUE has always been a place for sun worshipers, whether it was naming brands like Sun, Sunlight, Sunbird, Sunbeam and Sol; coining slogans like “A day with orange juice is like a day without sunshine”; or sending the Coppertone girl and her dog out on the beach to urge, “Don’t be a paleface.” Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Billboards in the campaign for Frito-Lay feature cutouts that cast a shadow spelling out the brand name. Related Times Topics: Solar Energy The newest demonstration of solar power (figuratively) is coming from the Frito-Lay division of PepsiCo, which is using the sun to help transform its SunChips line of multigrain snack chips into a “green” brand. The initiative is centered on the addition of solar power (literally) to the Frito-Lay plant in Modesto, Calif., that makes SunChips. A 10-acre “farm” of solar collectors is being added, to provide up to 75 percent of the energy needed to produce the product. The plant, one of seven in the United States that make SunChips, is scheduled to start using solar power on Earth Day, April 22, as part of ambitious efforts by Frito-Lay and PepsiCo to convince consumers that the companies care about the environment. Those measures include buying renewable energy credits, a move that is being promoted on packages of SunChips. The company is also rethinking manufacturing processes to use less water and power and is installing fuel-efficient ovens. Frito-Lay does not intend to hide its light under a bushel. A campaign to inform shoppers about the ecologically friendly changes is getting under way, composed of television commercials, print advertisements, billboards, information on the SunChips Web site (sunchips.com) and a presence on Facebook, the social-networking Web site. Environmental themes are enjoying a boom and are changing how marketers and agencies talk to consumers. Companies like Coca-Cola, General Electric, General Motors, Macy’s, E. W. Scripps, Toyota and Wal-Mart are clambering aboard a bandwagon painted green, festooned with flowers and powered by an engine that runs on biodiesel fuel. A dozen news releases so far this week have featured ecological themes, like Macy’s teaming up with the National Parks Foundation for a fund-raiser called Turn Over a New Leaf and the opening by Union, an ad agency in New York, of a shop named Union Green that will specialize in work for “eco-conscious clients.” A skeptic could have fun with the earnest tone and greener-than-thou attitude that infuse many of the initiatives in this realm. So many marketers have been putting environmental claims in their ads that the trade publication Brandweek recently observed in a headline that “a green backlash gains momentum.” There is even a term, greenwashing, coined to describe the perceptions of consumers that a marketer is inappropriately adopting a green persona.  “This is a space that, frankly, everybody is trying to learn about, and we’re in that boat as well,” said Gannon Jones, vice president for marketing at Frito-Lay in Plano, Tex. He is overseeing the creation of the SunChips campaign by Juniper Park, an agency in Toronto affiliated with the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. As consumers express concerns for the planet, Mr. Jones said, “companies are scrambling to find out as much as they can and respond appropriately.” “The companies and brands that are successful don’t treat green as a promotional strategy,” he added. “They embrace it throughout their business strategy.” Mr. Jones, as may be expected, places Frito-Lay among the marketers that have deeds behind their green words.

Go to The Board » The electronic sign, disguised as a Ferris wheel, will be built in the Meadowlands, a few miles from New York City near Giants Stadium. It’s hard to imagine that the area needs more development, but the wheel will be part of an entertainment complex called Xanadu that will feature an indoor ski slope. (Because there are no hills or snow, of course, in the Northeast.) Xanadu would be politely called colorful, with its random patterns of orange and blue stripes. One state senator called it “yucky.” For PepsiCo, it is a “colossal branding opportunity,” and for the state of New Jersey, it is $100 million for naming rights. The ride will be aglow in Pepsi’s red, white and blue colors and will have 26 glass capsules, each seating 20 people. The initial phase of Xanadu, which ultimately will cost $2.3 billion, is scheduled to open just before Thanksgiving. Where once there were marsh grasses and the final resting places of storied mobsters, there also will be a sky-diving tower and a man-made lake stocked with fish (in case anyone thinks there’s not enough water in the marsh already), a huge theater and restaurants. The developers say those who have remarked on the dullness of the colors of the development and its general unattractiveness should not worry. They assure us that more than 50 percent of what people currently see will be covered by signs and other structures. “It will be something like they’ve never seen before,” said Laurence Siegel, president of the venture.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Posters in stores are part of a campaign to introduce Tava, with flavor names like Brazilian Samba and Mediterranean Fiesta. The decision by the North American division of Pepsi-Cola, part of PepsiCo, is another sign of the growing use of new media to introduce brands in mainstream categories like packaged goods. Such shifts in media-planning habits by companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever are the reason that spending for ads online is increasing far faster than for any other medium. Pepsi-Cola North America is bringing out a line of no-calorie, carbonated beverages named Tava  not to be confused, presumably, with Teva, Lava, Kava or just plain java  with a campaign that is bypassing mainstay media like television and print. Instead, Tava is getting a spirited send-off with its own Web site (tava.com), banner ads, promotions and offbeat stunts like sampling events at popular shops and the delivery of free samples to the employees of prominent companies like Google and MTV. That would not be an unusual introduction if Tava were intended for the younger consumers who have grown up in a digital world. But the product, which is fruit-flavored and caffeine-free, is being aimed primarily at men and women ages 35 to 49. “There used to be an assumption this target was not online,” said Frank Cooper, vice president for flavored carbonated soft drinks at Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y. “But there’s a group in that category that’s ‘reborn digital.’ They’ve lived through the change and learned to adapt to it.” “This consumer spends significant time online, although what they do may differ from the younger consumer,” Mr. Cooper said. “They’re not I.M.-ing their friends; they’re looking at e-mail or looking up information about travel, music, food.” To help Tava reach the right audience, Mr. Cooper turned to agencies like Tribal DDB Worldwide, the interactive unit of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; TracyLocke, an Omnicom shop that specializes in tasks like promotions aimed at shoppers; Element 79, an Omnicom advertising agency; and Grow Marketing, which creates what it calls “brand experiences” that are meant to generate favorable consumer recommendations (a k a positive word of mouth). “The heart of it is creating more of an emotional connection with consumers by tapping into their natural inclination to tell other people about their experiences,” said Cassie Hughes, strategic director at Grow in San Francisco, which also works for marketers like J. Crew, Levi Strauss and Visa. For Tava, “the strategy was going in to talk to the right few who could fuel the many,” she added. In addition to providing samples to employees of companies like Apple, Bliss Spa, Google and MTV, Pepsi-Cola is giving away Tava at events like the Sundance Film Festival and to customers of businesses like Frank’s Chop Shop, a barbershop on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. It will also offer the beverage to arts lovers at plays, concerts and festivals, and to celebrities at locations like the set of the TV soap opera “General Hospital.” According to Ms. Hughes and Mr. Cooper, the campaign is zeroing in on eight major markets where consumers seem to appreciate soft drinks that contain vitamins and bear new-age flavor names like Brazilian Samba, Mediterranean Fiesta and Tahitian Tamure. They are Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Seattle and Raleigh, N.C. The online aspects of the campaign extend beyond local markets. The Web sites on which the Tava banner ads are to appear include AOL, chow.com, CitySearch, dailycandy.com, discovery.com, Evite, MSN, oprah.com, People and weather.com.  “The target spends significant amounts of time online every day,” said Christian Dietrich, director for the Pepsi-Cola client business at the Dallas office of Tribal DDB, “not just for utilitarian reasons but for interest-based exploration.” The idea for the banner ads is to “give you that taste, pun intended, for what the brand is about,” he added, “and increase your predisposition to click through to the Tava site.” The content of tava.com goes beyond pitches for the product, including downloadable songs from emerging musicians like Deccatree, a rock band from California, and Stephanie McKay, a singer from New York. It also features the work of artists like Amy Guip, an illustrator and photographer, and carries information about arts events like the Boston Arts Festival, the Chicago Jazz Festival and Shakespeare in the Park at Central Park. “If Tava was a person, this is what he or she would be into,” Mr. Dietrich said. As alluring as a bottom-up marketing strategy for Tava may be, there are risks to forgoing the traditional media to introduce a product.  Television commercials, for instance, can quickly create awareness for new brands. And inserts in newspapers offer a fast way to distribute millions of cents-off coupons to encourage people to try the product. In 2005, Pepsi-Cola North America sponsored a campaign without TV commercials to reintroduce a diet cola, Pepsi One. When was the last time you saw someone drinking one? “The risk is always there that you won’t connect to consumers,” Mr. Cooper said. “You can come from the top down and not get traction, and you can come from the bottom up and not get traction.” “To build trust between a consumer and a brand, people need to feel they’re sharing it with other people instead of a corporation pushing it down on them,” he added. “The goal is to have people experience the product on their own terms and turn them into brand ambassadors.” Hmmmm. Perhaps the brand ambassadors could locate their embassy on a park and call it Tava on the Green.

His best-known character, Horst Schlämmer, is a tiresome, booze-addled reporter for a small-town German paper who snorts when he laughs, revealing a mouthful of nasty dental work, and paws any young woman within reach. It is a coarse act, and Germans can’t get enough of it. Mr. Kerkeling has become one of this country’s most popular entertainers, with his own television variety show, film career and sold-out concert tours. Perhaps inevitably, he has also cranked out a book, which, given his celebrity, might have been expected to sell decently. As it turns out, the book, “I’m Off for a Bit, Then,” has become one of the best-selling nonfiction works in Germany since World War II, selling 14 times as many copies as Günter Grass’s much-discussed memoir, “Peeling the Onion.” Since it was published in May 2006, Mr. Kerkeling’s book has topped the best-seller list in the magazine Der Spiegel every week except for when it was briefly displaced by the memoir of the former chancellor Gerhard Schröder and a meditation on Jesus by Pope Benedict XVI. With sales of nearly 2.9 million copies, the book is a publishing phenomenon, all the more improbable because it is about a pilgrimage Mr. Kerkeling made to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, following the medieval pilgrims’ path known as the Way of St. James. “I just got up off my couch one day, after finishing a Diet Pepsi and a bag of chips, and started walking,” said Mr. Kerkeling, who professes to be as mystified as anyone by his success. In this land of empty churches and creeping secularism, Mr. Kerkeling has clearly tapped into something. His whimsical, moving and ultimately spiritual account has caught the imagination of Germans. (It will be published in the United States by Free Press in 2009.) People here are setting off on the pilgrimage in large numbers. Last fall, a German television network broadcast a weekly series, with celebrities retracing Mr. Kerkeling’s six-week journey. Religious and political leaders have debated why the book is so popular. They offer mostly familiar theories: the spiritual anomie of post-reunification Germany, which creates a hunger for some sort of fulfillment; the failure of traditional religion to inspire; even a reaction to the rise of Islam in Europe, where Muslims are building mosques next to cathedrals. And, it must be said, the pope’s book, “Jesus of Nazareth,” has also done well in his native land, with about 450,000 copies sold. “With the breakdown of old ideologies, there is a new search for the meaning of life,” said Peter Schneider, a noted German author. Or could it be simply that Mr. Kerkeling, shorn of his comic alter egos, is an agreeable travel companion? “I think the book works on three levels,” he said. “You can read it simply as a funny book; you can read it as an adventure story; or you can read it as a spiritual journey.” A CUDDLY fellow with an ever-present cigarette and a passing resemblance to Jerry Lewis, Mr. Kerkeling, 43, said he did not view his pilgrimage as a quest that would hold lessons for others. Though raised as a Catholic, he stopped going to church years ago. He describes his faith as a fusion of Buddhism and Christianity. Born in 1964 in Recklinghausen, a town in the Ruhr Valley, to a family with Dutch roots, Hape Kerkeling  his first name is a combination of his given name, Hans Peter  came up in show business through radio and television comedy shows. In 1991, he dressed up as Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and almost talked his way into a state dinner with the German president. By 2001, Mr. Kerkeling was one of the most recognizable faces in Germany, but he said he felt physically and spiritually spent. After having his gall bladder removed, Mr. Kerkeling said he needed a “timeout.” He chose the pilgrimage, known by its Spanish name, el Camino de Santiago, after coming across a book about it. “The first book that more or less landed at my feet was called ‘The Joyful Path of St. James,’ ” Mr. Kerkeling wrote in his first chapter. He found the whole idea preposterous. “Chocolate brings joy, to some extent,” he wrote, “and whiskey, in extreme situations.” He bought the book anyway, and read it in one sitting. A self-described couch potato, Mr. Kerkeling was unprepared for the rigors of a 400-mile trek. The trail begins in St.-Jean-Pied-de-Port, in southern France, traverses the Pyrenees and then winds across northern Spain, past Pamplona and the vineyards of La Rioja.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ben Garvin for The New York Times CONFAB In Montreal, from left, the Guru partners Joseph Zakher, Eric Graveline, Raymond Jolicoeur, François Bazinet and Eric Tomeo. A 36-year-old with a master’s degree in industrial psychology, Mr. Margulies left a corporate career to become a sales representative for Guru energy drinks, a new company started by a bunch of old Canadian high school pals. It might seem like a strange career switch, until you consider that the investors in the last beverage sensation in Manhattan  Glacéau, the makers of Vitaminwater  split $4.1 billion last year after Coca-Cola bought it. “Bust my hump and get some equity in the company,” Mr. Margulies explained. “That’s what we are all here for.” Guru, which is already selling in Canada, is trying to crack the New York market by zipping around the city in electric minicars painted like Guru cans and hiring cheerful, attractive young women to offer samples at convenience stores, health clubs, supermarkets and delis. But most of all, it is relying on the skills of salesmen like Mr. Margulies, who in three months on the job has received a quick education on how to win coveted shelf space in beverage cases around the city. It requires a gift for schmoozing, a comfortable pair of shoes and armorlike skin. The nonalcoholic beverage market, in New York City and elsewhere, is tough. For decades, it was dominated by the soft-drink giants Coke and Pepsi, with a few other brands scrambling for the leftovers. But the industry has radically changed in the last decade, as consumers have turned away from soft drinks amid concerns about their impact on health. Since 1998, Americans have been drinking about 33 fewer cans of soda per person per year, according to Beverage Digest, a trade magazine. An enormous variety of drinks, a hundred or more even in small delis, have picked up the slack. Bottled water and Gatorade are big sellers, but there’s also a rainbow of teas, flavored waters, sparkling waters, carbonated juices and yogurt smoothies. And energy drinks, where Guru believes it has found an opening offering products with all natural and organic ingredients. The explosion of new beverages has been marked by stories of regular folks who started small and made it big with a new drink that they hustled to local stores. Three New York friends created Snapple, which was sold to Quaker Oats Company in 1994 for $1.7 billion. Arizona tea was mixed up by a couple of Brooklynites who first tried flavored seltzer and malt liquor. Glacéau’s Vitaminwater was the brainchild of J. Darius Bikoff, who insisted on selling his vitamin-spiked flavored water beside regular bottled water rather than in the soda section. The four founders of Guru Beverage have a pretty good story, too. But the ending remains far from certain. While creating a drink in a blender and finding a bottler is relatively easy and inexpensive, making it a successful brand is difficult. “Frankly, some of it is luck,” said Gary Hemphill, managing director of the Beverage Marketing Corporation. “Being at the right place with the right product at the right time.” Guru’s founders met in high school in Montreal, at Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf, and became close as their paths crossed again in later years. Eric Graveline became an investment banker and moved to New York, where he roomed with François Bazinet, a fashion model. When Mr. Bazinet moved back to Montreal, he and Joseph Zakher opened several nightclubs. Raymond Jolicoeur worked in Canada for several food and beverage companies, including Kraft and Allied Domecq, now part of Pernod Ricard. (A fifth partner, Eric Tomeo, joined later.) In the late 1990s, Mr. Bazinet noticed energy drinks for sale in his travels in Europe and Japan and suggested to Mr. Jolicoeur that they introduce one in Canada. They began experimenting with drinks in Mr. Jolicoeur’s Montreal apartment, mixing in botanical ingredients, like ginseng and guarana, that Mr. Bazinet had discovered during his travels. The inspiration for the name came from an article on Bill Gates, which described him as “the guru of technology.” “It was like, wow, you know, this should be the guru of all drinks, as strong as we can make it, as healthy as we can make it,” Mr. Bazinet said. Bankrolled by the founders’ savings accounts, the company sold its first can of Guru at a small deli in Montreal in 2000. By the end of the first year of production, nearly one million cans had been sold, mostly in Montreal. By 2005, Guru was being sold throughout Canada, and the company was looking to sell in the United States. New York City was selected because it was the largest market, it was fairly similar to Montreal in terms of its many independent retailers, and Mr. Graveline was living there and preparing to retire from Wall Street. “If it doesn’t make it there, we would rather know up front rather than later,” Mr. Jolicoeur said. “But if it does make it there, we would feel like we can make it in other cities, not just in America but elsewhere.” He said it was important for the company to prove to itself “that the Guru concept has legs.” Guru set up an office in the foyer of a two-bedroom apartment on Wall Street that doubles as Mr. Jolicoeur’s residence and a crash pad for the other partners when they visit from Montreal. Mr. Jolicoeur shares the apartment with a cat named Chloe. “It’s the good-luck cat,” he said, explaining that he found Chloe abandoned on a highway around the time Guru was being introduced in Canada. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »CRAIG MARGULIES is hoping to strike it rich in the grab-and-go beverage cases on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ben Garvin for The New York Times CONFAB In Montreal, from left, the Guru partners Joseph Zakher, Eric Graveline, Raymond Jolicoeur, François Bazinet and Eric Tomeo. A 36-year-old with a master’s degree in industrial psychology, Mr. Margulies left a corporate career to become a sales representative for Guru energy drinks, a new company started by a bunch of old Canadian high school pals. It might seem like a strange career switch, until you consider that the investors in the last beverage sensation in Manhattan  Glacéau, the makers of Vitaminwater  split $4.1 billion last year after Coca-Cola bought it. “Bust my hump and get some equity in the company,” Mr. Margulies explained. “That’s what we are all here for.” Guru, which is already selling in Canada, is trying to crack the New York market by zipping around the city in electric minicars painted like Guru cans and hiring cheerful, attractive young women to offer samples at convenience stores, health clubs, supermarkets and delis. But most of all, it is relying on the skills of salesmen like Mr. Margulies, who in three months on the job has received a quick education on how to win coveted shelf space in beverage cases around the city. It requires a gift for schmoozing, a comfortable pair of shoes and armorlike skin. The nonalcoholic beverage market, in New York City and elsewhere, is tough. For decades, it was dominated by the soft-drink giants Coke and Pepsi, with a few other brands scrambling for the leftovers. But the industry has radically changed in the last decade, as consumers have turned away from soft drinks amid concerns about their impact on health. Since 1998, Americans have been drinking about 33 fewer cans of soda per person per year, according to Beverage Digest, a trade magazine. An enormous variety of drinks, a hundred or more even in small delis, have picked up the slack. Bottled water and Gatorade are big sellers, but there’s also a rainbow of teas, flavored waters, sparkling waters, carbonated juices and yogurt smoothies. And energy drinks, where Guru believes it has found an opening offering products with all natural and organic ingredients. The explosion of new beverages has been marked by stories of regular folks who started small and made it big with a new drink that they hustled to local stores. Three New York friends created Snapple, which was sold to Quaker Oats Company in 1994 for $1.7 billion.

The company also forecast full-year earnings in line with its long-term goals. Its shares rose $3.68, to $70.41 Shares of the company, which makes Pepsi-Cola drinks, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal, have lost 16 percent in the last month as investors feared that earnings could be hurt by weak consumer trends and high costs for commodities. “Given the significant weakness in PepsiCo shares over the past few weeks on worries about the ’08 outlook, we should see some relief as management confirmed its outlook,” an analyst at Morgan Stanley, William Pecoriello, wrote in a research note. PepsiCo said net income for its fourth quarter was $1.26 billion, or 77 cents a share, down from $1.83 billion, or $1.09 a share, in the period a year ago. Excluding items, the company earned 80 cents a share, meeting the average estimate of analysts polled by Reuters estimates. “The market was preparing itself for a miss, so the high-quality in-line number is more than enough,” an analyst at JPMorgan, John Faucher, wrote in a research note. Net revenue rose 17 percent, to $12.35 billion, as total sales volume rose 5 percent. The company said it was able to raise prices and improve productivity, which helped offset soaring costs for commodities like grains and cooking oils. Quarterly volume rose 3 percent at Frito-Lay and 1 percent at the North American beverage business. Higher sales of noncarbonated drinks like Gatorade and Lipton tea offset declines for carbonated soft drinks, like Pepsi- Cola, and juices like Tropicana, as price increases hurt sales. North American volume for Quaker Foods rose 3 percent in the quarter on improved sales of oatmeal and ready-to-eat cereals. Snack volume rose 8 percent and drink volume rose 9 percent in the international business, which has grown in importance as soft drink sales in the United States have begun to decline. The snacks business registered double-digit growth in Russia, the Middle East, Turkey and India. The beverage business had double-digit increases in the Middle East, China, Brazil, Argentina, India and Russia. Beverage sales volume declined in Mexico, Thailand and Spain. PepsiCo said its tax rate, which rose to 30.6 percent from 28.4 percent in the period a year ago, reduced growth in core earnings per share by more than three percentage points.

Pepsi Bottling, which affirmed its full-year outlook, said net income was $81 million, or 35 cents a share for the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 29, including charges from restructuring and the disposal of some vending machines. A year earlier, the company posted a profit of $133 million, or 55 cents a share, including a 22-cent-a-share gain on the reversal of tax reserves. Excluding items, the bottler earned 39 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 38 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly net revenue rose 7 percent to $4.04 billion, as price increases across all segments drove revenue up 8 percent per case. By volume, sales were flat, the company said. Sales by volume in the United States were flat, but fell 2 percent in Mexico, as declines in traditional soft drinks and water in large jug containers offset gains in bottled water and noncarbonated drinks. In Europe, volume fell 1 percent as growth in Russia was offset by weakness in Spain and Turkey. Revenue was aided by foreign currency rates, which increased the value of foreign sales when they were converted to weak United States dollars for inclusion in the company’s income statement. Cost of goods per case rose 7 percent because of higher costs for the drink concentrate it buys from PepsiCo and the high-fructose corn syrup it uses to sweeten its drinks.

Skip to next paragraph Getty Images Justin Timberlake is expected to appear in a Pepsi ad during the Super Bowl. The major record labels lined up with Pepsi-Cola and Apple four years ago to give away 100 million songs through Apple’s online store, unveiling the promotion in a Super Bowl commercial with music from the band Green Day. The effort helped spread the word about Apple’s iTunes offerings. Pepsi’s promotion is back this year on a much bigger scale  but with the star wattage provided by Justin Timberlake instead of Green Day, and Amazon in place of Apple. The switch is an indicator of the continuing tension between the music industry and Apple. Pepsi’s earlier ad, set to Green Day’s version of the song “I Fought the Law,” prodded music fans to quit pirating music online and instead buy songs  legally  from Apple’s then-fledgling iTunes. Four years later, iTunes is by far the biggest digital music store, and the industry is taking a liking to Amazon’s rival music service, introduced in September. Though iTunes blazed a trail in encouraging fans to pay for music online, record executives now complain that Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, wields too much clout in setting prices and other terms. At issue now is whether the labels can help popularize a more industry-friendly service and accelerate the pace of digital sales. Behind this strategy is a growing desperation: sales of digital albums and songs are rising far too slowly to offset the rapid decline of the CD, the industry’s mainstay product. CD sales slid 19 percent last year; after adding in the 50 million digital albums sold last year and counting every 10 digital songs sold as an album, overall music sales were still down 9.5 percent, according to Nielsen SoundScan. In trying to nurture Amazon’s service, the four major record companies have offered it one potential edge. One by one, they have agreed to offer their music catalogs for sale on the service in the MP3 format, without the digital locks that restrict users from making copies of the songs. (Sony BMG Music Entertainment, the second-biggest company and the last holdout, signed on last week. Sony BMG is a joint venture of Sony and Bertelsmann). All of the companies except the EMI Group still require Apple to sell their music wrapped in digital rights management software, or D.R.M., which is intended to discourage rampant copying. Some consumers say D.R.M. creates confusing problems, like a lack of compatibility between most songs and the devices sold by Apple and Microsoft. In fact, it was Mr. Jobs who, in February, called on the industry to drop its longstanding insistence on the use of the software, saying it had failed to rein in piracy. In any case, the industry is waiting to see whether  and how quickly  Amazon can grow into a credible alternative to iTunes, and whether Mr. Jobs will stand by as his service, which commands as much as 80 percent of digital download sales, is challenged. “This is really a stare-down,” said one major label executive who was briefed on the new Pepsi promotion and who requested anonymity because he had not been authorized to speak about it. Industry executives say the rivalry could intensify if the two services jockey over who will be given exclusive rights to some songs or special promotions. A senior executive at another record company, who requested anonymity out of concern about irritating Mr. Jobs, said he was prepared to keep copy restrictions on his label’s songs on iTunes for six months to a year while Amazon establishes itself. Apple insists on selling all single tracks for 99 cents, while Amazon sells them for 89 cents to over a dollar. Danny Socolof, president of Mega, the Las Vegas marketing agency that developed the promotion, which is called “Pepsi Stuff,” said the industry’s collective shift away from D.R.M. would “unleash a new age in the music business, and it’s sorely needed.” He said Pepsi’s alliance with Amazon reflected in part the record companies’ “desire to increase the retail space” online “and help level the playing field.” In the promotion, to be announced Monday, consumers who buy Pepsi drinks will receive points that can be redeemed for music downloads at a special section of the Amazon site. Amazon and Pepsi, a brand of PepsiCo, will give away up to a billion songs, along with prizes like DVDs and electronics, though only a fraction of the eligible Pepsi packages are expected to be redeemed. The biggest of the four music companies, the Universal Music Group, has declined to join the offer, executives briefed on the situation said, over a pricing disagreement. (Universal, a part of Vivendi, will still sell music through the Amazon service.) The Warner Music Group is also expected to participate. Amazon is expected to pay the record companies around 40 cents for each track that is given away in the Pepsi offer; Amazon’s usual payment ranges from 65 to 70 cents, executives briefed on the deal said. Industry analysts said they expected Apple to treat the situation as a minor annoyance. And an expansion of the digital music market is likely to increase sales of iPods, which are more lucrative than the iTunes store and dominate the digital player market. Forcing Apple to continue selling restricted music is “kind of like a couple of pebbles in the shoe,” said Michael McGuire, an analyst at Gartner. To Apple, he said, “maintaining parity is probably somewhat important, but in the end, they’re still selling iPods.” He noted that Amazon also sells many iPods. An Apple spokesman declined to discuss the company’s competitors but pointed to Mr. Jobs’s letter of February, which said Apple would embrace a D.R.M.-free world. It is far from clear that Amazon’s unrestricted music files will be an advantage. Russ Crupnick, an analyst at the NPD Group, joked that D.R.M. should stand for “doesn’t really matter.” Mr. Crupnick said he did not think many iTunes customers were bothered by copy restrictions or would defect to Amazon to buy unencumbered music. But, he said, Amazon may find an opportunity to expand the overall market. “The much bigger target is all of the people who don’t do digital downloading yet. How do I convince them that digital music is a good thing to begin with? I think Amazon is in a good position to do that, but it’s a long struggle,” Mr. Crupnick said. Others suggest that the struggle may be so long that the industry will decide to experiment with other ideas, like the offering of music free through ad-supported Web sites, or subscriptions attached to cellphones. “I’ve never thought that the pay-per-song model was really a replacement” for the CD, said David Goldberg, a former general manager of Yahoo’s music service who works at the investment firm Benchmark Capital. But the industry may endure more suffering before an answer emerges, he said. “It’s going to be a very dramatic change in the business. It’s just a question of when, not if.” John Markoff contributed reporting from San Francisco.

Throughout his career, Mr. Dusenberry emphasized entertainment in TV ad spots, believing that human stories were more attention-grabbing than product details. “I’m always going to be searching for emotion,” Mr. Dusenberry said in an interview with The New York Times in 1986. “In an age when most products aren’t very different, the difference is often in the way people feel about the product.” In one Pepsi commercial that attracted national attention in 1985, Geraldine A. Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic nominee for vice president, sat with her two daughters and talked about life. “There’s one choice I’ll never regret,” Ms. Ferraro told them. “Being a mother.” Most recently, Mr. Dusenberry worked as a volunteer on a team that created the “Generous Nation” public service announcement that featured the line, “Don’t almost give. Give.” Philip Bernard Dusenberry was born on April 28, 1936, in Brooklyn, the eldest child of a cab driver. He attended Emory &amp; Henry College, in Virginia, on a baseball scholarship, but he dropped out after the athletic program and his scholarship were discontinued. After taking voice lessons to try to lose his Brooklyn accent, Mr. Dusenberry worked as a radio disc jockey. He got his first taste of writing for commercials when the station manager asked him to fill in for the ad writer. Mr. Dusenberry followed a radio colleague to BBDO, which was then called Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn. One of his early commercials for Gillette Right Guard is still remembered as a standout spot in the 1960s. It featured two men chatting through a bathroom medicine chest. Mr. Dusenberry rose to prominence at BBDO in the 1980s, when he was executive creative director. The advertising industry began a wave of consolidations during those years, and many advertising executives were afraid that the trend might hurt creativity. Mr. Dusenberry, on the other hand, publicly supported the idea of mergers. “Bigness is not an enemy,” he told The Times in 1986. Mr. Dusenberry was an early advocate of using cinematic techniques and special effects in TV spots, and he often cast celebrities in ads. PepsiCo was one of his longtime clients, and the ads starred celebrities like Lionel Richie, Don Johnson, Madonna and Michael J. Fox. Mr. Jackson was sent to the hospital in 1984 while taping a Pepsi commercial, after special effects meant to produce smoke accidentally exploded. In one negotiation with Mr. Jackson for a Pepsi ad, Mr. Dusenberry demanded that the singer not wear sunglasses in the spot, according to Mr. Dusenberry’s memoir, “One Great Insight Is Worth a Thousand Good Ideas,” which was originally called “Then We Set His Hair on Fire.” His ads were known for their compelling story lines. “He does the sort of commercials that you call your wife and kids in from the other room to watch by saying, ‘It’s on again,’” said John F. Bergin, the vice chairman of McCann-Erickson Worldwide, told The Times in 1986. “He simply comes up with magic.” Mr. Dusenberry’s focus on advertising as entertainment was prescient of future shifts in advertising. Today, many advertising agencies promote advertainment, commercials that are entertaining in their own right and are sought out by consumers rather than avoided. Mr. Dusenberry also dabbled in the film business. He was a co-author of the screenplay for the movies “Hail to the Chief,” a 1973 political satire, and “The Natural,” starring Robert Redford. President Ronald Reagan hired him to work on his campaign commercials and the film that introduced Mr. Reagan at the Republican National Convention in 1984. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York, Mr. Dusenberry led the team that made “The New York Miracle” public service campaign to lift the spirits of New Yorkers. And, in 2002, he oversaw the work of several agencies that designed ads to support President Bush’s USA Freedom Corps campaign, which encouraged Americans to volunteer. When Mr. Dusenberry retired in 2002, he was chairman of BBDO North America. BBDO’s New York office more than doubled its billings under his leadership and won hundreds of awards. He was inducted in 2002 into the Advertising Hall of Fame, in Washington. In October, he was inducted into the Creative Hall of Fame at the One Club, an organization in New York that promotes excellence in advertising. Mr. Dusenberry is survived by his wife, Susan; a stepson, Ben Procter; a daughter-in-law, Ilana Sparrow; a brother, Harry, and his wife, Marcy; a brother, Joseph; a sister, Jean Driscoll, and her husband, Jack.

Related More from Rob Walker at his blog, http://murketing.com/ journal/. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a certain unease could be detected about the American drift toward a culture of selling, marketing and consumerism. Even Fortune magazine opined in 1947 that “the American citizen lives in a state of siege from dawn till bedtime,” seeming to echo the sentiments raised in the best-selling novel “The Hucksters” and the celebrated play “Death of a Salesman.” One sales executive at the time, a man named Edward Boyd, later recalled leaving a performance of Arthur Miller’s famous play in tears. “I related to it,” he said. Even so, Boyd stuck with his job, possibly because his own role in the machinery of American selling was a bit more complex: He was a black man building an African-American sales force within the Pepsi-Cola Company when corporate America was anything but integrated. Boyd was hired by Pepsi, which was based in New York, in 1947, when he was 33; he grew up in California and graduated from U.C.L.A. His story is a key element of the recent book “The Real Pepsi Challenge,” from which the above anecdote is taken and in which Stephanie Capparell argues that Boyd and those he hired helped break the color barrier in big business. In the post-World War II economy, black Americans were still marginalized in two ways: in their access to better professional jobs and also as consumers. The latter point was not trivial, if you consider that lunch-counter sit-ins, lawsuits against hotels and other key tactics in the civil rights struggle were fundamentally about marketplace access. According to Capparell, “Unlike the mainstream media, the African-American press didn’t join the chorus of criticism of business.” Instead, black newspaper publishers informed the marketing trade about the untapped potential of black consumers. No doubt they wanted advertising dollars from the big companies that had previously ignored them, but the implicit message was that in a market-driven economy, consumer equality matters. Ebony went so far as to call the African-American embrace of the Cadillac, and G.M.’s supposed discomfort about that embrace, part of the “war for racial equality.” And indeed, part of what Boyd had to contend with was a perception that brands adopted by blacks might be rejected by whites. Other companies were using black entertainers and athletes in ads, but Boyd wanted to move in a different direction, with a series of ads called “Leaders in Their Fields,” highlighting black professionals, including Ralph Bunche, the diplomat and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. While these were clearly Pepsi ads, schools and universities ordered up copies. For store promotions, Capparell writes, “he wanted to show a black family in the same kind of idealized setting as those used in mainstream ads.” And while the “Leaders” campaign was extended twice, increasingly the African-Americans in Pepsi’s ads tended to be happy, young, bourgeois consumers, and inspirational copy gave way to more familiar (and banal) sales pitches: “So Much More Fun! So Much More Zest!” His job was not easy: Boyd was thrown out of hotels and had to confront his white boss about using an offensive racial epithet. But from today’s perspective, what seems remarkable isn’t the pervasiveness of ignorance and racism but the degree to which these things trumped even the profit motive. Pepsi seemed enlightened by the mere act of openly courting black consumers. Its dominant rival, the Coca-Cola Company, did not advertise in the black press at all until 1951  and its ads did not depict black faces until the mid-1950s. Boyd’s career at Pepsi ended in 1951. In the years after a management change at the company, he and much of the team he assembled left. After stints at an ad agency, the humanitarian organization CARE and in consulting, he retired in 1981 and started raising alpacas upstate. Meanwhile, the commercial-culture “state of siege” that Fortune bemoaned 60 years ago never let up, though today the world depicted in mainstream advertising has become a harmonious place, where buddies of all races happily pursue consumer dreams together. In his comments to Capparell, Boyd seemed proud of his contribution. Perhaps the world depicted in advertising, then and now, was a fantasy, but part of Boyd’s thinking seems to be that it’s a fantasy that black consumers wanted to be part of  and would respond to.

The process devours enormous amounts of energy, and creates vast amounts of wastewater, starch and potato peelings. Skip to next paragraph Jeff Topping for The New York Times The use of vacuum hoses at an Arizona plant reduces the amount of heat needed to cook potato chips. Now, Frito-Lay is embarking on an ambitious plan to change the way this factory operates, and in the process, create a new type of snack: the environmentally benign chip. Its goal is to take the Casa Grande plant off the power grid, or nearly so, and run it almost entirely on renewable fuels and recycled water. Net zero, as the concept is called, has the backing of the highest levels of corporate executives at PepsiCo, the parent company of Frito-Lay. There are benefits besides the potential energy savings. Like many other large corporations, PepsiCo is striving to establish its green credentials as consumers become more focused on climate change. There are marketing opportunities, too. The company, for example, intends to advertise that its popular SunChips snacks are made using solar energy. We dont know what the complete payoff for net zero is going to be, said Indra K. Nooyi, PepsiCos chairman and chief executive. If this works even to 50 or 60 percent of its potential, that is fantastic, and its so much better than what we already have. From coast to coast, more companies are thinking about how much fossil fuel they use and ways to conserve energy. Venture capital money is also pouring into fledgling green technology. Only a few years ago, Andy Walker, a government engineer, pleaded with companies to tackle the problems but got blank stares. Now, my phone is ringing off the hook, said Mr. Walker, who works at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory of the Department of Energy in Colorado. But advocacy groups contend that for all the interest in saving energy, many companies also exaggerate small improvements for marketing purposes. Now I think theres a transition, and its only begun and the grandstanding is ahead of the action, said Joel Swisher, director of research at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization. He said that some companies were trumpeting relatively modest changes. Not that its a bad thing, he added. It is moving in the right direction. Some companies have pursued much more ambitious changes. Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America said it had managed to reduce energy consumption for every vehicle manufactured by more than 24 percent since 2002. Texas Instruments built a green semiconductor plant in Texas in 2006 that the company expects will save $4 million a year in energy and water costs. PepsiCo, meanwhile, has become the nations biggest buyer of renewable energy credits, a financial instrument that stimulates the development of renewable energy sources, and its subsidiaries are retrofitting plants and distribution centers to reduce energy. The net zero concept, however, is the companys most ambitious environmental venture to date. Reaching its goal of taking it almost completely off the power grid will not be easy. Over the next several years, Frito-Lay plans to install high-tech filters that would recycle most of the water used to rinse and wash potatoes, as well as the corn used to make Doritos and other snacks, and then burn the leftover sludge to create methane gas to run the plants boiler. The company will also build at least 50 acres of solar concentrators behind the plant to generate solar power. A biomass generator, which will probably burn agricultural waste, is also planned to provide additional renewable fuel. The retrofit of the Casa Grande factory, scheduled to be completed by 2010, would reduce electricity and water consumption by 90 percent and its natural gas use by 80 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions would be cut by 50 percent to 75 percent, the company said. Frito-Lay hopes the project will help the company save money on energy costs, particularly as oil prices approach $100 a barrel. What works in Casa Grande, one of 37 plants it operates in the United States and Canada, would then be replicated at other sites where possible. The Casa Grande plant was built in 1984 and is bigger than two football fields. With its peelers and ovens and fryers, the plant burns enough natural gas in a year to heat 13,000 homes for the winter, and it makes 212 million bags of snack chips a year. Under a directive from Frito-Lay to cut utility costs, the managers at the Casa Grande plant have already installed skylights in conference rooms, offices and a finished goods warehouse to reduce the need for artificial light. They have also bought more fuel-efficient ovens and have begun recapturing heat from oven stacks. Vacuum hoses were installed to pull moisture from potato slices, both to recapture the water and to reduce the amount of heat needed to cook the potato chips. Since 1999, Frito-Lay companywide has reduced its water use by 38 percent, natural gas by 27 percent and electricity by 21 percent, cutting $55 million a year in utility costs. But finding new ways to save energy and water is getting harder each year. So Frito-Lay officials started exploring more ambitious  and expensive  methods. At a strategy meeting last year with Mrs. Nooyi, Frito-Lay managers proposed creating a plant with a combination of technologies that would cut water and energy use as much as possible. We said, This might not make a hell of a lot of sense initially, but long term this is where we need to go, said David Haft, Frito-Lays group vice president for sustainability and productivity. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »CASA GRANDE, Ariz.  At Frito-Lays factory here, more than 500,000 pounds of potatoes arrive every day from New Mexico to be washed, sliced, fried, seasoned and portioned into bags of Lays and Ruffles chips.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Pepsis Minisode Network on the Web will offer short versions of TV classics, tying in with the soft drinks retro repackaging. Multimedia Pepsi Spot Bewitched Minisode, Ep 28 Bewitched, in which Darrins spell-casting wife Samantha created comic havoc for eight seasons, is one of 18 vintage series that Sony Pictures Television is offering computer users on what the company calls the Minisode Network. The 150 online episodes have been edited from their original running times of 30 or 60 minutes to lengths of 4 to 6 minutes. The first version of the network has been appearing since June on MySpace (myspace.com/minisodenetwork), sponsored by the American Honda Motor Company. The series that can be watched there include Charlies Angels, Diffrent Strokes, Fantasy Island, T. J. Hooker and Whos the Boss? Starting on Monday, the mini-episodes will become available on a channel on Crackle, a Sony Web site (crackle.com), that will be sponsored by Pepsi-Cola. A 15-second ad for Pepsi-Cola will appear before each minisode. The channel is part of a campaign for a retro-look design for Pepsi packages, to go on sale next month, that will celebrate the venerable logos, slogans and commercial jingles for the brand. Bewitched will also join the Minisode Network lineup as of Monday, along with shortened episodes of I Dream of Jeannie and The Jeffersons. Sony Pictures Television will also expand the network to two Web sites, AOL and Joost, where the minisodes will be sponsored by Honda. The bite-size shows also will begin running  without commercials, for now  on V Cast, the mobile video service from Verizon Wireless. The network is an example of the growing ardor among major advertisers for sponsoring video programming on Web sites, particularly as more American homes get fast broadband Internet connections. Another example came this week when Cotton Inc., a trade association representing cotton growers and importers, introduced a Web site (mysteryfabric.com) filled with humorous video clips that present what are described as the disadvantages of wearing clothing made with fibers other than cotton. Even marketers like Pepsi-Cola, which have for decades been identified with elaborate big-budget TV commercials, are moving more of their ad spending online to try to forge closer emotional bonds with consumers. Were evolving with or, we like to think, staying ahead of the changing media landscape, said Russell Weiner, vice president for marketing of colas at Pepsi-Cola North America in Purchase, N.Y., part of PepsiCo. Consumers are multitaskers because they have busy lives, he added. Were trying to be everywhere they are, in both the traditional and nontraditional ways to communicate.  The nostalgic aspects of the programs on the Minisode Network, which were broadcast on TV from the 1960s through the 1990s, made it a no-brainer for the campaign for the retro Pepsi-Cola packages, Mr. Weiner said. Pepsi-Cola will sponsor the channel on Crackle through Dec. 24. The special retro packages are to be in stores from Nov. 4 through Nov. 24. The campaign will also be featured on a future Pepsi-Cola Web site whose address (throwbackapepsi.com) will offer a tribute to the throwback nature of the design. On Nov. 25, the packages will be replaced as part of a continuous makeover of Pepsi-Cola graphics that began in February and is planned to last through at least 2008; the Diet Pepsi brand will be added next year. The campaign has introduced new bottles, cans and cups for Pepsi-Cola every three weeks, with subjects that include cars, fashion, music and sports. Each is accompanied with its own Web site, Mr. Weiner said, so your experience with Pepsi continues after your last sip. The last design of the year will be the winning entry in an online consumer contest to create a can, which took place at designourpepsican.com and was won by Jamey Jackson, 37, of West Nyack, N.Y. The contest, which drew more than 100,000 entries, was popular enough that every package change for Pepsi-Cola and Diet Pepsi in 2008 will be designed by consumers, Mr. Weiner said. Sony Pictures Television, part of the Sony Corporation of America, is also pleased with the results for the Minisode Network. The episodes have been viewed more than three million times since June, and viewers have posted thousands of comments on the MySpace page. Amy Carney, president for advertiser sales at Sony Pictures Television in New York, said that viewer requests for The Jeffersons led to the series being added to the roster. Because the launch met, and exceeded, everyones expectations, Ms. Carney said, there was interest in expanding the network to additional Web sites and to mobile devices as well as in seeking additional sponsors. Sony has met with other potential advertisers, she added, and has talked to other studios that produce television programs to determine if they want to join the network. The minisodes are not excerpts or clip jobs; they are edited in a way that compresses the story lines and enables the viewers to follow the plots from beginning to end. The idea for Pepsi-Cola to become a sponsor came up at a meeting in June between executives of Pepsi-Cola North America and members of the Sony Pictures Television digital advertising sales group. Because Pepsi was launching the retro can, it was a perfect blend between a brand aspiration and what the contents of the Minisode Network are, Ms. Carney said. Pepsi-Cola does not often use nostalgia as a sales tool. Its principal competitor, Coca-Cola, is much more fond of retro marketing as evidenced by its plastic packages, based on the old-fashioned contoured glass bottles, and ad themes like Always Coca-Cola.  The last time Pepsi-Cola looked to its past, it came up with a 90-second Super Bowl commercial in 2002, featuring Britney Spears performing decades worth of jingles like Now its Pepsi, for those who think young. Mr. Weiner of Pepsi-Cola North America said: Pepsi has been around since 1898. We have a heritage were certainly proud of. And its a nice juxtaposition to look at where weve been as we figure out where were going. Besides, he added, throwbacks are in vogue  like the Jets uniforms, though it didnt do them any good. That was a reference to the blue and gold outfits the New York Jets wore on Sunday when they played the Philadelphia Eagles, saluting what their predecessor team, the New York Titans, wore in 1962. The Jets lost, 16-9.

In the place of soda and sugar-laden beverages, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury Schweppes agreed that only water, low-fat milk and 100 percent juice would be offered in elementary and middle schools. In high schools, sports drinks, light juices and diet drinks would also be allowed. The announcement was brokered by the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a collaboration of the American Heart Association and the William J. Clinton Foundation, and it was widely praised. Former President Bill Clinton, who attended the press conference, called the decision courageous. Shrewd was probably a better word. The truth is that full-calorie soda would have been forced out of schools eventually, either by litigation or legislation. And the beverage companies were lucky to get sports drinks in the deal since many nutritionists believe there is no reason for kids to be drinking them unless they are vigorously exercising. But that wasnt the end of it. After the deal was signed and the editorials written, the beverage makers sought a change. Under the original terms of the agreement, only sports drinks and light juices with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces were allowed to be sold in high schools. But because of a quietly executed amendment in late April, other drinks with no more than 66 calories per eight ounces are now allowed. By doing so, the beverage companies opened the door for beverages like Vitaminwater and Propel, both considered enhanced water, to be sold. Sports drinks are generally defined as sweetened drinks with electrolytes; enhanced waters have vitamins instead. The change is significant because teenagers are rejecting soda in droves in favor of a huge new variety of mid-calorie beverages like sports drinks, enhanced waters, sparkling juice and sweetened teas. The market for such beverages in the United States is so bullish that Coke forked over a whopping $4 billion in June for Glacéau, which makes Vitaminwater. The beverage industry and its nonprofit partners describe the amendment as a minor tweak  so minor that they didnt bother to tell the people who applauded them the previous year for striking such a bold deal. Nutrition advocates accuse the beverage industry of gutting the agreement. This is a huge loophole that will bring lots more sugar and calories into kids diets, said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Ms. Wootan says enhanced waters are simply sugar water with vitamins tossed in, most of which children dont need. Dr. Carlos A. Camargo, associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Harvard Medical School, says if people are concerned about teenagers consuming too many liquid calories, they should fix school drinking fountains. It has zero calories, zero artificial sweeteners, zero stimulants and  if the schools made sure that their drinking fountains actually worked  it could be provided throughout the school day at NO COST to students, Dr. Camargo wrote in an e-mail message. Dr. Camargo was part of an Institute of Medicine panel that suggested last spring that schools should offer only water, low-fat milk or 100 percent fruit juices during the school day. The beverage industry rightly points out that getting soda out of schools is a large improvement. Its much ado about nothing, said Kevin Keane, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association. All youre doing is simplifying the language to base it around calories rather than products. He noted that some juices allowed in schools contain far more calories than enhanced waters and sports drinks do. Mr. Keane also said that the amendment didnt change the calorie mix offered in schools: the deal continues to require that 50 percent of the beverage offerings in high school are water or contain 10 calories or less for eight ounces. BUT the problem is, even if 50 percent of the vending machine offers Gatorade and vitamin water, and the rest is diet soda and water, which drinks do you think most teenagers will pick? My kids would pick vitamin water or Gatorade, and I suspect most others would too. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has tried repeatedly to pass legislation that would allow the Department of Agriculture to update its standards on what kinds of foods and beverages can be sold in school vending machines and school stores. In the past, the beverage industry has been among his biggest foes. But this time around, the beverage industry isnt opposing the bill  it is encouraging Senator Harkin to adopt its standards (with the amendment included, of course) on beverage sales in schools. Voluntary nutrition standards were announced just over a year ago with great fanfare, but in a short time, there was quiet backsliding to sneak sugary beverages into our schools again, said Kate Cyrul, a spokeswoman for the Senate agriculture committee, of which Senator Harkin is the chairman. For the sake of our childrens health, Congress should pass science-based school nutrition standards that cannot be altered at the request of just a few parties and without public input. Its not so surprising that soda makers would push for such a change given their struggle to keep pace with the changing tastes and demands of the public. Like most food and beverage companies, they are trying to figure out how to promote healthy lifestyles in ways that dont discourage customers from buying their products. But you would think that an organization called the Alliance for a Healthier Generation would be more concerned with kids health than corporate profits. The deal was already signed. Why give in to the beverage companies? Robert S. Harrison, the alliances executive director, said the intent of the original agreement was to remove high-calorie drinks from schools and reduce portion sizes. Now, for instance, only 12-ounce sports drinks can be sold in high school rather than 20 ounces. The amendment is a technical amendment that is completely consistent with the original agreement, he said. We are trying to move the needle to improve the offerings that are available to kids in schools. The alliance deserved credit for moving the needle. But it could have pushed it further. I guess thats why its not called the Alliance for the Healthiest Generation.

Volume growth of Gatorade, which commands 80 percent of the sports drink market, declined slightly in this quarter compared with the same period a year ago. By comparison, Powerade, from Coca-Cola, experienced double-digit volume growth during the second quarter. “There is certainly a movement towards no- and low-calorie beverages, so trying this new version of Gatorade is certainly at least worth a shot,” said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication. But he noted that a lower-calorie version of Powerade introduced a few years ago had not sold well. PepsiCo’s chairman and chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi, said consumers had consistently requested a lower-calorie version of Gatorade. While the drink is formulated for athletes while they are working out, she said the lower-calorie version would be marketed to athletes for use when they were less active. The new beverage will be released later this year. A recent survey of 2,500 adults by Goldman Sachs suggests that there is a market: 43 percent of those who reduced their consumption of Gatorade said they were concerned with calorie content. While Gatorade remains a huge seller, it is competing with an ever-growing list of competitors, from new sports drinks to bottled water and “enhanced” water with added ingredients to increase its nutritional value. Coca-Cola is aggressively trying to expand its noncarbonated portfolio. Last month, for instance, Coke acquired Glacéau, the maker of the popular VitaminWater, an enhanced water drink. Still, Ms. Nooyi predicted that the new lower-calorie sports drink would thrive because of the Gatorade name and the brand’s marketing prowess. “It will cut through the clutter, and people will know about it,” she said. The Gatorade announcement was made as PepsiCo announced stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, fueled by vigorous overseas sales of snacks and beverages. The company reported a 13 percent increase in profit compared with the same period last year, while earnings increased 15 percent, to 94 cents a share. Sales volume of beverages sold in Pepsi’s North American division declined, however. The decrease, less than 1 percent, was caused primarily by a 4 percent drop in soft drinks and by “modest” declines in Tropicana and Gatorade for the quarter, the company said in a release. PepsiCo’s shares closed down 33 cents yesterday at $66.26. More Articles in Business »At a time of relatively sluggish sales and a profusion of new competitors, PepsiCo, the maker of Gatorade, said yesterday that it would introduce a lower-calorie version later in the year for athletes when they are not breaking a sweat. Volume growth of Gatorade, which commands 80 percent of the sports drink market, declined slightly in this quarter compared with the same period a year ago. By comparison, Powerade, from Coca-Cola, experienced double-digit volume growth during the second quarter. “There is certainly a movement towards no- and low-calorie beverages, so trying this new version of Gatorade is certainly at least worth a shot,” said John D. Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication. But he noted that a lower-calorie version of Powerade introduced a few years ago had not sold well. PepsiCo’s chairman and chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi, said consumers had consistently requested a lower-calorie version of Gatorade. While the drink is formulated for athletes while they are working out, she said the lower-calorie version would be marketed to athletes for use when they were less active.

But Cocoa Puffs are another matter. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Making the Health Cut Trying to persuade critics the industry does not need government regulation, 11 big food companies, including McDonalds, Campbell Soup and PepsiCo, have agreed to stop advertising to children under 12 products that do not meet certain nutritional standards. Some of the companies, like Coca-Cola, have already withdrawn all such commercials or are in the process of doing so. Others, like General Mills, said they would withdraw them over the next year or so, while a handful agreed to expand their self-imposed bans to radio, print and Internet advertising. Still, the agreements will probably amount to a ripple rather than a sea change in terms of what foods children see pitched on their favorite television shows and Web sites. For example, while General Mills will no longer be advertising Trix to the 12-and-under crowd, it will continue to peddle Cocoa Puffs, which have one less gram of sugar per serving. And it will be able to continue advertising Trix on television shows and other media that are considered to cater to families rather than just children. That qualifier amounts to a major loophole, given the media-watching habits of children. An episode of Nickelodons SpongeBob SquarePants, for instance, is viewed by an average audience of 876,000 children age 6 to 11, according to Nielsen Media Research, and falls in the category of shows that are off-limits to ads for junk food. But American Idol from Fox, which qualifies as a family show, attracts 2.1 million children in the age group. The companies have also agreed for the first time to open their marketing plans to the Council of Better Business Bureaus and its Childrens Advertising Review Unit, which will review them and report publicly on the findings. This scrutiny and the pledges to self-regulate, which will be announced at a Federal Trade Commission event today, are an attempt to show corporate responsiveness to growing concerns about childhood obesity. We are hopeful that people will look at this and say that the community has done a substantial, enormous amount of work, said Dan Jaffe, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers. Advertisers spend some $900 million annually on television tailored to children under 12, according to industry estimates. Together, the companies involved represent two-thirds of the total childrens advertising market, according to the Better Business Bureau. Cadbury Adams, Coca-Cola, Hershey, Kellogg, Kraft, Mars and Unilever are the other participating companies. The nutritional parameters vary by company, but are all based on the 2005 United States Dietary Guidelines developed by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. A pat on the back from critics is unlikely. The pledges, which were made under the threat of regulatory intervention and, in some cases, the threat of lawsuits, fall short of the demands from child advocacy groups. Most critics have been pushing for uniform guidelines for marketers to follow and for oversight from a body with the authority to enforce them. This is great public relations for the companies, but it doesnt go nearly far enough, said Susan Linn, co-founder of the Boston-based group Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. It is going to be impossible to monitor if the companies are actually doing what they say. To some degree, the pledges appeared to be an effort by the food companies to get out in front of a forthcoming government study on childhood obesity. Senators Sam Brownback and Tom Harkin announced July 5 that they would postpone a report from a task force they formed with the Federal Communications Commission in lieu of the companies plans to announce concessions today. At the time, Senator Brownback said, The extension will allow for a more thorough examination of new initiatives. The financial impact of the pledges on television networks like Nickelodeon, ABC Family and Cartoon Network will depend on how well the food companies can tweak their products. Many of the companies are not automatically withdrawing their products from the airwaves; rather, they are trying to reformulate the foods to meet nutritional guidelines. If they cannot do so to their satisfaction, they say they will replace ads for so-called junk foods with spots for healthier alternatives. Cadbury Adams, the maker of Bubblicious chewing gum, says it will either withdraw advertisements of the brand from certain media or will direct half of its current Bubblicious budget to the promotion of healthier eating habits. The company declined to specify how much it spends promoting Bubblicious each year, but said that a healthier habit might be choosing a smaller portion of gum. MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon and other channels popular with younger viewers, expects the agreements to have minimal impact on its bottom line. Many products sold by these companies havent been on our air for years, said Jim Perry, executive vice president for ad sales at Nickelodeon and MTV Networks Kids and Family Group. Marva Smalls, executive vice president for Nickelodeon public affairs, added, We have been on the road pressing for this. 1 2 Next Page » Elizabeth Olson contributed reporting.

Researchers at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sought the assurances after discovering studies financed by the companies that used animals like rats and chimpanzees to test taste perception and, in some cases, to bolster support for promotional health claims. PepsiCo said that it would stop directly financing animal experiments, including some it had financed through grants given to graduate students through its Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Elaine Palmer, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, said that while the company had never supported the idea of animal testing, We had not been policing it, so that part is new. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are the largest largest manufacturers to agree to the ban. Coca-Cola also said that it would discontinue a grant given to a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University who has been studying taste perception in rats, which share certain taste pathways with humans. Representatives of Coca-Cola and the university declined to say how much financing the company was providing or to elaborate on what the ultimate application of the research might be. A research associate at PETA, Shalin G. Gala, said, We see these statements from Coke and Pepsi, massive global conglomerates, as the beginning of the end of all animal tests on food. Scientists conducting basic research in animal models have cautioned against PETAs hard line, saying their work, which may have medical benefits, would not be possible in many cases without help from corporate sponsors. Its very easy to characterize scientific research like this in a bad light, said Dr. John A. DeSimone, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who had been working under the Coca-Cola grant. To do medical research, you sometimes need an animal model. Not everyone agrees with Dr. DeSimones thinking, particularly when it involves tests on highly intelligent animals, as did a study involving a Coca-Cola scientist, financed by Nutrasweet, that cut open the faces of chimpanzees to study nerve impulses used in the perception of sweet tastes. I have never found chimpanzee work justifiable, said Dr. Alan Goldberg, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Goldberg said that over the last 30 years, advances in alternatives to animal models, many of which are usually more scientifically precise, have already reduced the number of lab animals in use by 50 percent. The bottom line for me is that Id love to see animal studies disappear entirely, Dr. Goldberg said. In vitro models are cleaner. The two soft drink giants are the latest companies to respond to scrutiny by PETA, which has mounted a campaign to denounce animal testing practices in the beverage industry, an industry that, unlike cosmetics or pharmaceuticals, had largely been unpublicized in the animal testing arena. In January, Roll International, the company that makes Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice, agreed to cease tests on animals after PETA disclosed a 2005 study financed by the company that tested the juice to see if it might relieve artificially induced erectile dysfunction in rabbits.

Sure enough, a woman wearing a red-and-white Coke pantsuit, with a matching purse, is among the viewers at a recent screening of the film. Visitors can also create personalized Coke artwork on a computer screen or jot down memories about their first Coke, some of which are posted nearby. One example: I remember my first kiss in 1972. I was with Joey Zawadski from Chicago. He was visiting his grandmother who lived in my town. He leaned over to give me a kiss and it tasted like Coke. Joey is gone but I still have my Coke. Betty. But while it still maintains its enviable pop-culture status, the Coca-Cola Company no longer wields the kind of business clout it did decades ago, when Coke, as jingle after jingle told us, was the real thing that graciously taught the world to sing in perfect harmony. Instead, lashed to a product and a corporate culture that is older than many of its most well-known marketing pitches, Coke has found itself outmaneuvered, at least in the United States, by a host of more creative competitors, like PepsiCo. As those rivals have diversified and taken risks, Coke, the beverage industrys Goliath, has struggled to reinvent itself. Some, like E. Neville Isdell, Cokes chairman and chief executive, say the company has a good playbook in hand. When he is not talking about transformational wellness platforms and the need state map, Mr. Isdell likes to sprinkle the word fun into his speeches. He refers to his days as a rugby player as fun. He likes a Coke ad because its absolutely brand-centric and its fun. Working in the soft-drink business is fun, too, he says. But Mr. Isdells words arent entirely convincing: fun has been hard to come by at Coke headquarters here for quite some time. A towering 63-year-old from Ireland, Mr. Isdell left a comfortable, tropical retirement in Barbados three years ago to return to one of the worlds most recognizable companies, but one that was in disarray after years of turnover, misdirection and internal squabbles. In doing so, he became the caretaker of one of the most storied legacies in corporate America, and a business that has set standards for savvy global expansion, lithe, and inventive brand management and marketing panache. Yet the future of the company that Mr. Isdell took over in 2004 was in jeopardy. Cokes tightly knit and long-serving board selected him after it had unsuccessfully pursued several other big-name chief executives. Meanwhile, PepsiCo, Cokes longtime nemesis, was clobbering it in the United States, helping to cause Cokes stock to lose nearly half of its value from its 1998 high of $88. Now, nearly three years after Mr. Isdell created a Manifesto for Change, it remains unclear whether he can reclaim Cokes former glory. He and his team have largely borrowed their turnaround strategy from the heroes of Cokes past: blanket the landscape with Coke signs, push the product in developing markets abroad and spend more money on advertising  to recapture, as Mr. Isdell puts it, the idea that there is a magic around the brand. Analysts widely credit Mr. Isdell with improving morale and stabilizing what many considered a dysfunctional company. Coke has a hit in a new product, Coke Zero, and a catchy ad in The Coke Side of Life, which focuses on its distinctive bottle; the company is also enjoying brisk overseas sales. Its most recent quarterly earnings were its best in years. To be sure, Coke  which racked up earnings of about $5 billion on sales of $24 billion last year  remains a formidable presence, in the United States and overseas. The companys own number-crunchers are fond of saying that a Coca-Cola beverage of some sort is swallowed 1.4 billion times a day in various spots on the planet. (That translates to 58,333,333 servings an hour; or 972,222 a minute; or 16,204 a second.) But Coke is at a crossroads, and it has been slow to make its mark in the booming American market for energy drinks, bottled water and other noncarbonated drinks. Mr. Isdell took a step toward addressing that problem on Friday when Coke announced a $4.1 billion takeover of Glacéau, a producer of vitamin-enhanced water. The Glacéau deal is a milestone for a company that has never pulled off a takeover of this magnitude before. Even so, some analysts still wonder whether Mr. Isdell and his board remain too conservative to break from traditions that once served them well but may no longer be suited to a world in which consumer tastes are rapidly  sometimes constantly  shifting. Tom Pirko, the president of the consulting firm Bevmark and a frequent critic of Cokes soda-dominated strategy, says the Glacéau deal is a good move for the company. But he says Coke needs to be more innovative and invest more resources in emerging markets. With all of the new drinks flooding the market, he likens the beverage industry to television: there were once only three major networks, but now there is cable, the Internet, DVD, and TiVo, among others. Fabulous icon, but even icons must change with the times and new generations of young consumers, he says of Coke. Even a cursory examination of the Coke portfolio shows little creativity in taking risks or sinking serious funds into new products. Instead, Isdell has satisfied himself with baby steps. Not to worry, Mr. Isdell counters. In an interview in Cokes sumptuous 25th-floor executive offices here, where he sits surrounded by Coke-themed artwork, he says Coke is now prepared to do more than take baby steps  as the Glacéau deal shows. And, he adds, Coke is large enough and has been around long enough act with deliberation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Page » More Articles in Business »A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking.

(That translates to 58,333,333 servings an hour; or 972,222 a minute; or 16,204 a second.) But Coke is at a crossroads, and it has been slow to make its mark in the booming American market for energy drinks, bottled water and other noncarbonated drinks. Mr. Isdell took a step toward addressing that problem on Friday when Coke announced a $4.1 billion takeover of Glacéau, a producer of vitamin-enhanced water. The Glacéau deal is a milestone for a company that has never pulled off a takeover of this magnitude before. Even so, some analysts still wonder whether Mr. Isdell and his board remain too conservative to break from traditions that once served them well but may no longer be suited to a world in which consumer tastes are rapidly  sometimes constantly  shifting. Tom Pirko, the president of the consulting firm Bevmark and a frequent critic of Cokes soda-dominated strategy, says the Glacéau deal is a good move for the company. But he says Coke needs to be more innovative and invest more resources in emerging markets. With all of the new drinks flooding the market, he likens the beverage industry to television: there were once only three major networks, but now there is cable, the Internet, DVD, and TiVo, among others. Fabulous icon, but even icons must change with the times and new generations of young consumers, he says of Coke. Even a cursory examination of the Coke portfolio shows little creativity in taking risks or sinking serious funds into new products. Instead, Isdell has satisfied himself with baby steps. Not to worry, Mr. Isdell counters. In an interview in Cokes sumptuous 25th-floor executive offices here, where he sits surrounded by Coke-themed artwork, he says Coke is now prepared to do more than take baby steps  as the Glacéau deal shows. And, he adds, Coke is large enough and has been around long enough act with deliberation. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/business/26pepsi.html?ref=pepsicoinc">Some Frito-Lay Food Labels to Address Possible Heart Benefits<date>Published: May 26, 2007</date><text>WASHINGTON, May 25 (Reuters)  Vegetable oils, salad dressings, crackers and other oil-containing foods made by the Frito-Lay unit of PepsiCo will now carry claims that products with unsaturated fat can curb heart disease risk, regulators said on Friday. The Food and Drug Administration, in a statement, said the company notified the agency in January about its intent to add the claim to some products. The agency said that any food that meets its requirements could carry the claim. The F.D.A. said that “Frito-Lay intends to apply the claim to vegetable oils, spreads and shortenings that have a total unsaturated fat content” of 80 percent or more of total fat. It would also apply to sauces, dips and other snacks that also contain the oil, the F.D.A. said. According to the agency, the packaging of such foods would say: “Replacing saturated fat with similar amounts of unsaturated fats may reduce the risk of heart disease. To achieve this benefit, total daily calories should not increase.” A spokesman for Frito-Lay had no immediate comment. It was not immediately clear which products would carry the claim. Frito-Lay brands include a number of potato chips, including Fritos, Lay’s, Ruffles, Doritos and Tostitos, as well as Rold Gold pretzels, Grandma’s cookies and Cracker Jack popcorn.
