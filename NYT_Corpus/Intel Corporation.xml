Intel’s third-quarter earnings swept past Wall’s Street’s forecast, and its sales hit a new high once again as semiconductor shipments to China and other emerging markets helped offset weakness in United States sales. “Enterprise PC demand remains strong, and consumer demand in emerging markets continues to be strong,” Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. “The global PC landscape is changing.” Mr. Otellini said China and Brazil were now two out of the three biggest computer markets today. The third, the United States, remained steady for chips going into products destined for offices and data centers as American corporations continued to update their systems. Mr. Otellini said notebook computer demand was strong, but the overall consumer PC market in United States continued to be weak. Intel’s sales rose 28 percent in the third quarter, to $14.2 billion from $11.1 billion in the same period last year. The company posted net income of $3.5 billion or 65 cents a share, a 17 percent improvement over the same period last year when Intel reported net income of $2.96 billion, or 52 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had expected net income of 61 cents a share on sales of $13.9 billion. Looking ahead, Intel said revenue in the current quarter would be $14.7 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $14.23 billion in sales. Mr. Otellini said the company was on track to reach $55 billion in revenue in 2011, a 26 percent increase from the previous year. Intel’s optimistic report comes after the market research companies Gartner and IDC cut their forecasts for the number of PCs that will be sold this year. Gartner said last month it expected PC sales to grow only 3.8 percent in 2011, down from an earlier projection of 9.3 percent. “A lot of people will be scratching their heads because of all the predictions that that PC growth will be only 4 percent for the year, and then Intel goes and forecasts double-digit growth,” Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said. Intel said revenue from its PC client group, which includes chips for personal computers, rose 22 percent, to $9.4 billion; sales to data centers increased 15 percent, to $2.5 billion. Shares of Intel rose nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading, after closing up 12 cents at $23.40 in the regular session. Intel has stumbled badly in the mobile market against chips built on a competing architecture known as ARM. Sales of its Atom processor for mobile devices fell 30 percent during the quarter. The company is now betting heavily on the ultrabook, a superthin notebook computer that combines the portability of a tablet with the power of a full-size notebook. Those devices will start trickling onto the market this year, and Intel says it expects to grab a share of the ultrabook next year with its Ivy Bridge processor.Intel’s message to Wall Street on Tuesday: What slump?

Speaking at the Web 2.0 Conference in San Francisco on Monday, Kirk Skaugen, an Intel vice president, said that the computer server market, which has more than doubled in the last 10 years to include some 16 million chips, will double again in the next five. Source: IDC WW Server Tracker (1995-2004 systems data) and internal analysis; 2005-2010 Intel shipments; 2011-2015 DCG forecast.A slide from Kirk Skaugen’s presentation shows that the computer server market will double in the next five years. This is a big deal for Intel, not just because of the good demand it represents, but for what it means to the company’s rising competition from low-power, commodity-priced servers. Executives coming out of the mobile business think that the kind of low-power chips they make will eventually end up in servers. Privately, executives at some computer companies say the same. But if Mr. Skaugen is right, and the big build is upon us this quickly, there simply will not be time for a new model of server, using non-Intel chips, to reach broad acceptance. Mr. Skaugen displayed a series of eye-popping charts about the growth in data demand, the kind of thing that will justify building all those data centers. Even if you pay attention to the increasing amount of things connected to the Internet, and all the data being loaded aboard it, these were goodies. There were 345 quintillion bytes of data zipping around the Internet in 2010, more than all that has gone before. The average car will soon have 300 microcontrollers and 12 cameras, and will be connected to the Web. There are all the phones, sensors and emerging computing devices that will also be connected. “Today we’re talking 4 billion connected devices, 15 billion by 2015, and 50 billion by 2020,” Mr. Skaugen said. “Our vision is very simple: if it consumes electricity, it’s going to end up computing, and if it’s computing it will be connected to the Internet.” Many of those devices may have Intel chips, but they will probably be of the lower-margin variety. The good money is still in Intel’s higher-end processors, those that go into personal computers and servers. Hence the need for those data center chips. Intel turned in great earnings Tuesday, with sales up 28 percent in the third quarter from the 2010 period, to $14.2 billion, and net income of $3.5 billion, up 17 percent over a year earlier. Nearly $12 billion of the revenue came from demand for personal computers, up 22 percent, and data center chips, up 15 percent. Intel did not break out numbers for some emerging architectures that are also headed into the data center, displacing traditional networking chips, but these will also contribute more to company profits if Mr. Skaugen’s slides are accurate.</text></article>

Details of the deal were not disclosed, but Israeli media said Intel was paying $300 million to $350 million. The Telmap chief executive, Oren Nissim, said the deal was expected to close before the end of the year. Telmap, which offers location-based services to provide details on traffic data and local offerings, expects to post revenue of $33 million in 2011 and be profitable for the second consecutive year. Telmap will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel, which has two plants and four development centers in Israel, and will retain its brand, management and 210 employees. “The unique thing about this transaction is that here comes a giant and says, ‘We really like what you’re doing, we believe in your strategy, we want to enhance and go forward. We’re not here to swallow you up,’ ” Mr. Nissim said. Teaming up with Intel will enable Telmap to provide a “true alternative” to offerings from giants such as Nokia and Google, Mr. Nissim said. Peter Riddle, general manager of Intel’s AppUp developer program, said in a blog post that the deal was a step toward expanding Intel’s capabilities in mobile software services. “Telmap delivers great multiplatform consumer experiences every day, and we’re looking forward to combining that focus and excellence with Intel’s to significantly grow their business,” he wrote. Intel, the world’s No. 1 chip maker, has become a larger provider of software and services after its acquisitions of McAfee and Wind River.TEL AVIV (Reuters) — The chip maker Intel has agreed to acquire Telmap, a maker of mobile navigation software based in Israel, Telmap’s chief executive said on Sunday.

    <article index="4" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/what-is-the-ultrabook/?ref=intelcorporation">What Is the Ultrabook?<date>August 10, 2011, 6:02 am</date><text>Since May there has been a nearly constant, subcellular buzz on the Internet about something called an Intel Ultrabook. But what, exactly, are we looking at here? First, let’s understand how Intel “releases” notebooks. Intel makes chips. That, in general, is all they do and all they ever want to do. However, the company often releases reference designs or plans for future products. These reference designs have included embedded systems for machinery (using Intel chips), point-of-sale systems for stores (using Intel chips) and low-power “in-vehicle infotainment systems” (using Intel chips.) In short, Intel builds something, gives manufacturers the plans (and guidelines), and then sells them a few million chips that will go inside the hardware. That’s why most laptops are, inside, essentially the same: they’re based on a reference design passed along from chipmaker to manufacturer like holy writ. Every once in a while, though, Intel releases something a bit more impressive than a point-of-sale system. Thus we have the Ultrabook. The Ultrabook is an ultra-slim laptop (think MacBook Air) that maxes out at 0.8 inches thick. Ultrabooks will cost less than $1,000 and they will, obviously, use Intel chips. Other than following those guidelines, however, manufacturers can riff on Ultrabooks like Satchmo on “Cornet Chop Suey.” However, most will depend on one of Intel’s five current reference designs on which to base their manufacturing plans. The first notebook in the Ultrabook line is the Asus UX21, a .67-inch laptop that is thinner than the Air, includes an 11.6-inch display, one USB 2.0 port and one brand new USB 3.0 port. New processors will join the line-up next year as other manufacturers begin the Ultrabook push. These laptops are expected to have instant-on features that allows you snap the laptop open and use it immediately. Most will also eschew a mechanical hard drive for one powered by SSDs. So far the promise of cheap, thin, and light is like a three-legged stool missing a leg: the UX21 and the 13-inch UX31 will cost more than $1,000 when introduced in September and manufacturers are currently struggling to price their hardware below Intel’s requested rate. This doesn’t mean that Ultrabooks won’t fall below $1,000 in the next year or so. Intel is already cracking down on manufacturers to keep their prices down and, recalling the meteoric drop in netbook prices a few years back, it’s clear that the consumer is hungry for — and expecting — cheaper and cheaper laptops every year.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/technology/intel-posts-profit-that-beats-forecasts.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Reported Income Gain in 2nd Quarter<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Intel said that the modernization of data centers — the engines behind cloud computing — were responsible for the strong worldwide sales the chip maker reported Wednesday.“This was a very strong quarter across all our product lines and throughout the world,” said Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. “Strong corporate demand for our most advanced technology, the surge of mobile devices and Internet traffic fueling data center growth, and the rapid rise of computing in emerging markets drove record results.” Intel’s results were also lifted by strong demand from corporations and first-time purchases by customers in China and other emerging markets. The company, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, said its net income after expenses rose 2 percent to $3 billion, or 54 cents a share, exceeding Wall Street estimates. Revenue increased 21 percent, to $13 billion. Intel has for several quarters experienced a surge in demand for technology used in data centers, which store and process the huge amounts of information flowing across the Internet. The importance of that market was evident this week as Intel announced plans to acquire Fulcrum Microsystems, a privately held company that designs chips for data center networks. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Revenue from data centers today accounts for roughly 20 percent of Intel’s sales. “I fully believe that it is the data center — the cloud — that is driving Intel,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst with Evercore Partners. Demand for cloud computing is created by the soaring popularity of smartphones and tablets, which provide consumers with continuous, on-the-fly access to the Internet. Mr. Otellini told analysts in May that the technology industry needs one data center server computer for every 600 smartphones in use and one server for every 122 tablets. “We believe we are very early in the cloud build-out and that Intel is well positioned to grow,” Mr. Otellini said. During the second quarter, revenue growth in Intel’s data center group accounted for $2.44 billion. Wall Street analysts had said earnings would remain flat at 51 cents a share while revenue would increase 19 percent to $12.84 billion. In the same period last year, Intel earned 51 cents a share on revenue of $10.77 billion. Mr. Otellini said he expected Intel’s revenue to grow in the mid-20 percent range for the year. Revenue will be about $14 billion, Intel said, compared with a forecast of $13.5 billion. Intel’s gross margin, the percentage of sales excluding production costs, will be about 64 percent, up from 61 percent in the second quarter. Intel reported that sales in its PC group rose 11 percent, in stark contrast to reports of sluggish PC shipments worldwide. The technology research firm Gartner said last week that shipments grew only 2.3 percent during the second quarter, to 85.2 million computers. But while Intel has continually confounded skeptics forecasting gloom in the PC market, the company has come under intense criticism lately for stumbling in the market for smartphones, where some analysts worry that it may be too late for Intel to catch up. Products based on a competing chip standard, known as ARM, have quickly dominated the market. Intel is not expected to have a viable alternative on the market for several months.  Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said on Wednesday that production of its mobile chip was on track. The financial report was issued after the close of regular trading Wednesday. Shares of Intel closed at $22.99, then declined slightly in after-hours trading. The second quarter was the first full period that included the results of McAfee and Infineon Wireless, which Intel acquired in the first quarter. Those businesses contributed about $1 billion in revenue during the second quarter.

Go to the site, allow it to access your Facebook data, and in about a minute you will be taken on a 2-plus minute walk through a collection of your photos, portraits of friends, videos, links and posts. Music is provided by Japanese multimedia artist Takagi Masakatsu, who appears to be the artist of choice in Silicon Valley, as he was profiled on Apple’s Web site as well. The Museum of Me is only as good as its subject. If you have filled your Facebook profile many images and links and other data, the exhibit will be rich and varied. If you’ve used Facebook only sparingly, the virtual museum will look almost as if it were a few days from opening, with lots of empty spaces and signs that read “Your pictures could be here.” If you are concerned about privacy, know that the Museum of Me pulls only information from what your friends can see on your Facebook profile. It’s not adding anything to that inventory. Why did Intel do this? To show off their Core i5 processors. How this site demonstrates that is unclear, but we can still bask in the glory that is us, regardless.</text></article>

The transistors on computer chips -- whether for PC's or smartphones -- have been designed in essentially the same way since 1959 when Robert Noyce, Intel's co-founder, and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments independently invented the first integrated circuits that became the basic building block of electronic devices in the information age. These early transistors were built on a flat surface. But like a real estate developer building skyscrapers to get more rentable space from a plot of land, Intel is now building up. When the space between the billions of tiny electronic switches on the flat surface of a computer chip is measured in the width of just dozens of atoms, designers needed the third dimension to find more room. The company has already begun making its microprocessors using a new 3-D transistor design, called a Finfet (for fin field-effect transistor), which is based around a remarkably small pillar, or fin, of silicon that rises above the surface of the chip. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., plans to enter general production based on the new technology some time later this year. Although the company did not give technical details about its new process in its Wednesday announcement, it said that it expected to be able to make chips that run as much as 37 percent faster in low-voltage applications and it would be able to cut power consumption as much as 50 percent. Intel currently uses a photolithographic process to make a chip, in which the smallest feature on the chip is just 32 nanometers, a level of microscopic manufacture that was reached in 2009. (By comparison a human red blood cell is 7,500 nanometers in width and a strand of DNA is 2.5 nanometers.) ''Intel is on track for 22-nanometer manufacturing later this year,'' said Mark T. Bohr, an Intel senior fellow and the scientist who has overseen the effort to develop the next generation of smaller transistors. The company's engineers said that they now felt confident that they would be able to solve the challenges of making chips through at least the 10-nanometer generation, which is likely to happen in 2015. The timing of the announcement Wednesday is significant, Dr. Bohr said, because it is evidence that the world's largest chip maker is not slipping from the pace of doubling the number of transistors that can be etched onto a sliver of silicon every two years, a phenomenon known as Moore's Law. Although not a law of physics, the 1965 observation by Intel's co-founder, Gordon Moore, has defined the speed of innovation for much of the world's economy. It has also set the computing industry apart from other types of manufacturing because it has continued to improve at an accelerating rate, offering greater computing power and lower cost at regular intervals. However, despite its promise and the company's bold claims, Intel's 3-D transistor is still a controversial technology within the chip industry. Indeed, a number of the company's competitors say they believe that Intel is taking a what could be a disastrous multibillion-dollar gamble on an unproved technology. There has been industry speculation that Finfet technology will give Intel a clear speed advantage, but possibly less control over power consumption than alternative approaches. By opting for a technology that emphasizes speed over low power, Intel faces the possibility that it could win the technology battle and yet lose the more important battle in the marketplace. The scope of Intel's gamble is underscored by the fact that while the company dominates in the markets for data center computers, desktops and laptops, it has largely been locked out of the tablet and smartphone markets, which are growing far more quickly than the traditional PC industry. Those devices use ultra-low-powered chips to conserve battery power and reduce overheating. Apple, for example, uses Intel's microprocessors for its desktops and laptops, but for the iPhone and iPad it has chosen to use a rival low-power design, built by others, that Apple originally helped pioneer in the late 1980s.</text></article>

Industry executives and analysts have said that Intel is likely to have a lead of a full generation over its rivals in the shift to 3-D transistors. For example, T.S.M.C., the Taiwan-based chip maker, has said that it does not plan to deploy Finfet transistor technology for another two years. Other companies, like ST Microelectronics, are wagering that an alternative technology based on placing a remarkably thin insulating layer below traditional transistors will chart a safer course toward the next generation of chip manufacturing. They believe that the insulation approach will excel in low-power applications, and that could be a crucial advantage in consumer-oriented markets where a vast majority of popular products are both hand-held and battery-powered. “Silicon-on-insulator could be a win in terms of power efficiency,” said David Lammers, the editor in chief of Semiconductor Manufacturing and Design Community, a Web site. “From what I am hearing from the S.O.I. camp, there is a consensus and concession that Finfets are faster. That’s the way you want to go for leading-edge performance.” In a factory tour here last week, Intel used a scanning electronic microscope to display a computer chip made using the new 22-nanometer manufacturing process. Viewed at a magnification of more than 100,000 times, the silicon fins are clearly visible as a series of walls projected above a flat surface. It is possible to make transistors out of one or a number of the tiny fins to build switches that have different characteristics, such as faster switching speeds or extremely low power. Looking at the chip under less magnification, it is possible to see the wiring design, which appears much like a street map displaying millions of intersections. Despite the impressive display, Intel’s executives acknowledge the challenge the company is facing in trying to catch up in the new consumer markets that so far have eluded it. “The ecosystem right now is not aligned in our favor,” said Andy D. Bryant, Intel’s chief administrative officer, who now runs the company’s technology and manufacturing group. “It has to be good enough for the ecosystem to take notice and say, ‘We better pay attention to those guys.’ ” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: May 4, 2011 An earlier version of this article misspelled the dateline as Hillsborough.HILLSBORO, Ore. — Intel announced on Wednesday that it had again found a way to make computer chips that could process information more quickly and with less power in less space.</text></article>

Which is faster for data transfer, the new Thunderbolt ports or USB 3.0? A. Thunderbolt input-output technology, which was developed by the Intel Corporation in collaboration with Apple, can transfer data at up to 10 gigabits per second. Although hardware limitations can slow things down, this data-transfer rate is fast enough, in theory, to copy a 25-gigabyte high-definition movie file from one device to another in less than 30 seconds. USB 3.0, on the other hand, has data-transfer speeds of around 5 gigabits per second, making it about half as fast as Thunderbolt. But USB 3.0 is much faster than the popular USB 2.0 standard, which has a top speed of 480 megabits per second. Thunderbolt, which recently began appearing on some of Apple’s new laptop models, is 12 times faster than the older FireWire 800 ports found on earlier Mac desktop and laptop computers; FireWire 800 has a top speed of 800 megabits per second. The new technology (which was called “Light Peak” in its development days) is geared for people like video editors who need to fling large files around. Thunderbolt uses one cable to handle both the fast data transfer speeds and also connections to monitors to display high-definition video. If you want to see Thunderbolt in action, Intel has a demonstration video on YouTube. Apple has its own page of Thunderbolt information as well.</text></article>

The results surprised many investors, as well as Intel executives, who had projected a far bleaker quarter after a product recall, consolidation after two acquisitions and the effects of the Japanese earthquake on production. The first quarter “was a very strong quarter and significantly better than we expected,” Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said in an interview on Tuesday. The company had exceptionally strong sales of chips for high-end server computers that power corporate data centers and the Internet. This market for “cloud computing” is helping Intel weather the slowdown in other areas of the computer market. “Intel continues to have a very strong position in the higher end of the market,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. “Their position there is golden.” Intel appears to have managed to turn a disastrous product introduction into one of its most successful chips. A technical error in a companion chipset to the company’s long-awaited Sandy Bridge processor led the company to quickly issue a recall, fix those chips and then to reissue the product. The problem, Intel executives said, did not hurt Intel’s bottom line. “Early demand has been outstanding,” said Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. Quarterly profit rose 29 percent to $3.16 billion, or 56 cents a share, up from a profit of $2.44 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the first quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter was $12.8 billion, up 25 percent from $10.3 billion a year ago. Revenue in Intel’s data center group grew 32 percent. The report beat Wall Street’s forecasts handily. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $11.6 billion and earnings of 46 cents a share for the quarter. Intel’s profit margin was 61 percent for the quarter, in line with expectations. Intel forecast second-quarter revenue of $12.5 billion to $13.3 billion. The company announced the results after the close of the markets on Tuesday. Shares of Intel rose almost 5 percent in after-hours trading, after closing up 24 cents at $19.86. With the PC industry facing mounting pressure from low-price tablet computers and smartphones, Intel executives said that the company planned to pursue both those areas. “We remain committed to success in the smartphone market,” Mr. Otellini said. Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, said the strong results showed that smaller devices had not hurt PC demand as much as some might have thought. “It shows there’s still a need for PCs in the world,” he said. During the quarter, Intel closed on the acquisitions of Infineon Wireless Solutions and McAfee. The combination of both acquisitions contributed revenue of $496 million. Mr. Otellini told analysts that the earthquake and tsunami in Japan had closed its offices in the area but that Intel’s supply chain was not seriously affected. Intel’s results come amid concerns about the overall health of the PC market. Just last week, the research company IDC released a report saying that the global PC market declined 3.2 percent during the first quarter, the first major contraction since the economic recession began. The company originally predicted quarterly growth of 1.5 percent over last year. In explaining its gloomier view, the report pointed to rising fuel and commodity prices, combined with supply constraints caused by the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The Intel executives assured analysts that the company was not experiencing such a contraction, but rather the opposite, particularly in emerging markets. However, demand in the United States market remained soft, the executives said. In the fourth quarter, Mr. Otellini said that he expected Intel’s revenue to grow about 10 percent for the full year. But in January, company executives said growth would probably be in the mid- to high teens. On Tuesday, Mr. Otellini adjusted that forecast yet again, projecting revenue growth of more than 20 percent. “All of our product segments are growing,” Mr. Otellini said. “Over all, we are beginning 2011 with great momentum.”Despite facing one challenge after another in the first quarter, Intel posted strong profits on higher sales across its product line.

Mr. Canada, a world-renowned educator whose program in Harlem has been widely lauded for its efforts to close the achievement gap, offered jurors their first glimpse of a generous and big-hearted Mr. Rajaratnam. That depiction was in sharp contrast to what prosecutors have described as a greedy tycoon who had made millions trading on inside information when he ran the Galleon Group hedge fund. Mr. Canada told jurors that he met Mr. Rajaratnam about seven years ago while fund-raising for his program. They chatted at Mr. Rajaratnam’s office in Midtown Manhattan, and “hit it off right away,” Mr. Canada said. They talked about how children from impoverished backgrounds do not have the same opportunities as those with more comfortable upbringings, he testified. Mr. Rajaratnam’s concern for children was immediately apparent, Mr. Canada testified, in part, he said he believed, because Mr. Rajaratnam had children of his own.

Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “His wish was that we could level the playing field for kids,” Mr. Canada said. “He wanted our kids to have the same support his kids had.” Though Mr. Canada did not disclose how much money Mr. Rajaratnam had given to his cause, he described Mr. Rajaratnam, a former board member of the Harlem Children’s Zone, as generous and said that his support was “extraordinary” and “spontaneous.” He said he considered Mr. Rajaratnam a “dear friend,” and even helped guarantee part of Mr. Rajaratnam’s $100 million bail after his arrest in October 2009. Mr. Canada’s testimony could stand out for jurors, who have grown accustomed to hearing mainly from Wall Street executives, including Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Wall Street has been particularly fond of supporting Mr. Canada’s cause, which helps administer a range of social and educational services to families within a roughly 100-block area of Harlem. Though some researchers have said that there is not enough evidence to measure the effect of the costly initiative, the program has attracted admirers from Harvard to the White House. More broadly, Mr. Canada is something of a darling among a certain set of politicians, educators and academics for his efforts to create a pipeline for urban youth from the “cradle to college.” He was prominently featured in a recent documentary on urban education, “Waiting for Superman.” The rest of Wednesday’s session in Federal District Court in Manhattan could not have stood in sharper contrast. The government declined to cross-examine Mr. Canada, whose appeared briefly between the earlier and later parts of the testimony of Richard Schutte, the former president of Galleon. No such courtesy was extended to Mr. Schutte, who, from virtually the start of cross-examination, butted heads with Reed Brodsky, the prosecutor. On the stand, Mr. Schutte has cut a stoic figure, offering little in the way of colorful descriptions or humorous anecdotes that some of earlier witnesses had. That attention to precision served him well in the defense’s direct examination of him, when he often corrected a defense lawyer, Michael Starr, when he was asked technical questions. During that time, Mr. Starr presented hundreds of exhibits relating to stocks about which prosecutors contend Mr. Rajaratnam received confidential information. Among them were research reports and news articles that, the defense has argued, were reason enough for Mr. Rajaratnam to make the trades at the center of the case. Mr. Brodsky spent a much time Wednesday offering a different set of exhibits that conflicted with those presented by the defense. Mr. Brodsky repeatedly asserted that the defense exhibits had been cherry-picked, and that they represented a small fraction of the research and notes that Galleon analysts received. For instance, the defense showed research reports that expected poor quarterly financial results for Xilinx, a semiconductor company whose shares Mr. Rajaratnam is accused of betting against using insider tips. Mr. Brodsky offered several reports where analysts said they saw potential upside for the company, including one by an analyst from Bear Stearns who predicted the company would perform according to Wall Street expectations. Mr. Schutte said he did not recognize the analyst’s name. As it turned out, the company revised its outlook down, and the Bear Stearns analyst was wrong. “Now I know why I didn’t recognize the guy’s name,” Mr. Schutte said. Mr. Brodsky also challenged assertions by the defense in connection to the sale of shares in Goldman Sachs. Mr. Rajaratnam is accused of selling shares in Goldman in late October, after a tip from a former board member, Rajat K. Gupta, that the bank would soon report its first quarterly loss as a public company. Defense lawyers sought to deflect that accusation, in part, by suggesting that Mr. Rajaratnam sold shares because the firm had a large investment in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, whose stock was faring poorly. Mr. Brodsky tried to demonstrate the inconsistency of that argument. He showed jurors that just two days earlier, with Goldman’s investment in the Chinese bank performing nearly as poorly, Mr. Rajaratnam had actually bought 150,000 shares of Goldman stock.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/technology/companies/11chips.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel, on the Outside, Takes Aim at Smartphones<date>Published: April 10, 2011</date><text>With an “Intel Inside” sticker affixed to their PCs, computer buyers in the 1990s could hardly avoid knowing whose microchip was making their machines work. The campaign made Intel one of the most recognizable brands and cemented its position in the PC industry.As long as PCs were dominant, Intel was dominant. But it’s now a new world in which tiny hand-held computers, more commonly known as smartphones, are outselling personal computers. And usually, there is no Intel inside. Instead, the processors in smartphones and tablets these days are more likely to be made by companies that few consumers would recognize, like Qualcomm, Nvidia and Marvell. And those companies are fighting to gain market dominance in much the same way Intel did with chips for personal computers: by making what’s inside the phone matter to consumers. “It’s become an arms race, like the early days of the PC industry,” said Chris Jones, vice president and principal analyst at Canalys, a market research company. These chip companies are racing to improve the speed and performance of their processors so they can boast of having the fastest application processor on the market. With smartphones and tablets increasingly performing the tasks of full-size computers, they have an additional obsession: making energy-efficient chips that will prolong the battery life of a mobile device. So far, the obsession with speed and energy efficiency has paid off for everybody but Intel. The PC chip giant has been conspicuously late to the mobile market, having canceled plans to ship a smartphone version of its Atom processor after a demonstration of it running in an LG phone over a year ago. The difficulty for Intel, say analysts, has been to get its chips’ power consumption down to a level reasonable for a phone. Still, Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, vowed recently that Intel-powered smartphones would be on the market before the year is out. With those phones, Intel hopes to rebuild credibility in a business some customers had thought it would never get right. But meanwhile, the company has just recently lost its mobile champion, Anand Chandrasekher, the 24-year Intel stalwart who has long headed up the company’s mobile processor development, including the wildly successful Centrino product that made Wi-Fi a household name. While industry analysts were divided on whether Mr. Chandrasekher had resigned or had been pushed out, they were in agreement on one thing: The company has a lot of catching up to do in the mobile market. “It’s clear that Intel’s mobile business is not going as well has they had hoped,” said Linley Gwennap, an industry analyst and head of the Linley Group in Mountain View, Calif. “But this is not an indication of a change of strategy, just of leadership.” Intel executives quickly assured the industry that the company remained committed to smartphones, despite the sudden departure of Mr. Chandrasekher. Competitors say they will be ready for Intel when it arrives. “I always assume they’ll show up,” said Michael Rayfield, general manager of Nvidia’s mobile group. “All I can do is innovate rapidly to stay ahead.” Intel’s competitors are also hoping that a recent decision by Nokia, the largest phone maker, to use Windows Phone 7 rather than the Symbian operating system, will help them fend off Intel, given that the Microsoft program is currently optimized for ARM-based cellphones. “Nokia used to be a nonopportunity for us,” said Jen-Hsun Huang, chief executive of Nvidia. “Our market opportunity just got 33 percent bigger.” Qualcomm has the same idea. Anything that expands the “Microsoft phone ecosystem,” said Steven M. Mollenkopf, executive vice president and group president at Qualcomm, based in San Diego, is a “positive thing for Qualcomm.” In contrast to the PC market, in which Intel and Advanced Micro Devices slugged it out through the 1980s and 1990s, the list of companies supplying chips for smartphones is long. Qualcomm, Texas Instruments and Samsung lead the market with a combined market share of 87 percent — with the biggest share of that belonging to Qualcomm. Nvidia, Broadcom, Samsung, Marvell and others are vying for the remainder, according to the market researcher Strategy Analytics. 1 2 Next Page » Damon Darlin contributed reporting.With an “Intel Inside” sticker affixed to their PCs, computer buyers in the 1990s could hardly avoid knowing whose microchip was making their machines work.

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, as a witness in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group hedge fund manager. Mr. Blankfein is expected to take the stand Wednesday morning. In a letter sent to a federal judge, prosecutors said they would ask Mr. Blankfein to testify about Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman director who this month was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of passing along confidential information about the bank to Mr. Rajaratnam. Federal prosecutors asked Judge Richard J. Holwell, who is presiding over the trial, to prohibit the defense from asking Mr. Blankfein whether Goldman Sachs bore responsibility for the financial crisis and whether the bank was the subject of any pending government investigation. In the letter, prosecutors also said they had “not notified Mr. Blankfein or Goldman Sachs that either is a target (or, for that matter, a subject) of any pending criminal investigation.” On the issue of the financial crisis, the government argued that whether Goldman played any role in that crisis was wholly irrelevant to testimony about Mr. Gupta, and any evidence on this topic could prejudice the jury against Mr. Blankfein’s testimony. Regardless of the substance of Mr. Blankfein’s testimony, his presence on the witness stand will add to the already intense attention surrounding the prominent trial, which is in its third week in United States District Court in Manhattan.

Blankfein On Tuesday, the government called to the witness stand Rajiv Goel, a former Intel executive and business school classmate of Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Goel, a soft-spoken Indian-born businessman who has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges, is a main cooperating witness for the government. Mr. Goel testified that he provided assistance to Mr. Rajaratnam by feeding him secret business information about Intel, including crucial financial data in advance of a quarterly earnings announcement. But the bulk of Mr. Goel’s testimony was about how Mr. Rajaratnam, a hedge fund billionaire, provided financial support to him. Mr. Goel, 52, described how in 2005 Mr. Rajaratnam lent him $100,000 to buy a house. A year later, said Mr. Goel, Mr. Rajaratnam gave him $500,000 as a gift to help him with a family matter. Around that same time, Mr. Rajaratnam offered his trading expertise and began buying and selling stocks in Mr. Goel’s brokerage account. When Reed Brodsky, the prosecutor, asked Mr. Goel why he gave Mr. Rajaratnam inside tips, he said his motivation was friendship. “Raj and I were very good friends,” Mr. Goel said. “We shared a lot and I gave him information.” The two met in the early 1980s in Philadelphia as South Asian immigrants who had come to the United States for an elite business education at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. While Mr. Rajaratnam ascended on Wall Street, Mr. Goel was a journeyman finance executive. Over nearly two decades, Mr. Goel held a series of midlevel executive posts, some in the United States and some in India, at companies including Met Life and Bank of America. In 2000, he landed a job in Intel’s treasury group. Despite his consistent employment, Mr. Goel looked to Mr. Rajaratnam for financial support. In 2005, Mr. Goel, who said he did not know how to trade, asked Mr. Rajaratnam if he could make him some money in his brokerage account. Mr. Rajaratnam agreed, and over five years he made Mr. Goel about $750,000 in trading profits, according to Tuesday’s testimony. The government spent much of Tuesday afternoon dissecting two of Mr. Rajaratnam’s profitable trades in Mr. Goel’s account. The first was the purchase of ATI Technologies in March 2006, just before its acquisition by Advanced Micro Devices. The second was buying shares of @Road Inc. just before it was bought by Trimble. Those trades, the government said, were the fruits of insider trading. Much of Tuesday morning’s testimony touched on the legal question of what exactly constituted insider trading. The prosecution and defense continued to battle over whether stock tips provided to Mr. Rajaratnam were material nonpublic information or merely confidential information. The former constitutes insider trading under federal securities law. The stock at the center of the debate was Clearwire. The government questioned Sriram Viswanathan, an executive at Intel, which owned a minority stake in Clearwire and was in talks to invest $1 billion more in a new venture with the wireless company. Prosecutors played a secretly recorded telephone conversation between Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Goel during which Mr. Goel divulged details about the precise amount of money that Intel and other companies were investing in the venture. Mr. Viswanathan told the jury that this was confidential information, and that if Intel had know Mr. Goel was sharing it he would have been fired “spontaneously.” During cross examination, Terence J. Lynam, Mr. Rajaratnam’s lawyer, argued that Mr. Goel’s tips were not information that Mr. Rajaratnam, or any money manager for that matter, would have considered material. Besides, Mr. Lynam argued, much of the confidential information that Mr. Goel provided Mr. Rajaratnam was already in the public sphere in newspaper articles and analyst reports. As Mr. Goel leaked internal goings-on at Intel, he also appeared to be frustrated with his career. In one recorded phone conversation, Mr. Goel told Mr. Rajaratnam: “Hey get me a job with one of your powerful friends, man. I’m tired of this company.” He also asked Mr. Rajaratnam for an introduction to his powerful friends. In one e-mail, Mr. Goel asked Mr. Rajaratnam, “if you have any connection to Milken, I would truly appreciate that,” an apparent reference to Michael R. Milken, the 1980s financier who served prison time for securities violations relating to that era’s insider-trading scandal. Prosecutors’ Letter About Lloyd Blankfein</text></article>

Mr. Goel said that his children always made fun of him whenever he spoke to Mr. Rajaratnam because “I talk so softly.” The two men continued their quiet conversation. Mr. Goel told Mr. Rajaratnam about a $1 billion investment that Intel was planning to make in a new joint venture with Clearwire and others to develop an ultra-fast wireless Internet service. Federal prosecutors played a recording of that call on Monday afternoon as the third week of Mr. Rajaratnam’s trial got under way in Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Rajaratnam, who is fighting charges that he made $45 million in illegal profits trading more than 30 stocks, is the most prominent defendant in the government’s years-long investigation into insider trading on Wall Street. Azam Ahmed and Guilbert Gates/The New York Times Click on the above graphic to get a visual overview of the Galleon information network Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Monday’s court session underscored the strategies that have emerged in the trial’s opening weeks. The government, through testimony of cooperating witnesses and scores of secretly recorded telephone conversations, is presenting the jury with what it believes is vast evidence of insider trading by Mr. Rajaratnam and his associates. Mr. Rajaratnam’s defense team has sought to rebut that testimony on cross examination through a multitude of newspaper articles and analysts’ reports intended to show that the supposed inside information was already in the public domain. A government witness, Sriram Viswanathan, a senior Intel executive, told the jury about secret discussions — nicknamed “Project Rain” — that Intel was having about creating a new 4G wireless network. He explained that Mr. Goel, who worked in Intel’s treasury group, had access to confidential information regarding the deal. (Mr. Goel has pleaded guilty to insider trading charges, but has yet to testify.) That information included details like how much money Intel might invest, details that Mr. Goel shared with Mr. Rajaratnam during their taped phone calls. On one call, Mr. Rajaratnam gave Mr. Goel his detailed assessment of the proposal, including an estimate of who would own what, including Intel’s stake after a proposed $1 billion investment. He noted that Clearwire’s stock was trading around $10 a share, and that the proposed company was seeking a target price of $20 a share. “So that’s the math,” he told Mr. Goel. Responding to government questions about the nature of the information, Mr. Viswanathan said the details of the conversation were littered with “confidential information.” On cross-examination, the defense offered report after report that raised the possibility of a deal in order to demonstrate that the information was already public. “The press was following the developments in regards to Intel and Clearwire and reporting on them regularly,” said Terence J. Lynam, a lawyer for Mr. Rajaratnam. “It was out there.” “These were public speculation, combined with a couple of facts,” Mr. Viswanathan said in response to one report. At one point Mr. Lynam presented as evidence a so-called list of knowers, an internal document listing people at Intel who knew about plans for the 4G company. Rajiv Goel did not appear on the list. Although technology stocks formed the bulk of the government’s insider trading case against Mr. Rajaratnam, prosecutors say that he also traded illegally in several nontechnology companies, including Hilton Worldwide, which was the focus of Monday morning’s testimony. Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Rajaratnam’s hedge fund, the Galleon Group, bought up shares in the hotel chain ahead of its 2007 buyout by the Blackstone Group after a tip Mr. Rajaratnam received from a woman named Roomy Khan. She received the information from an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service who was privy to the deal since Hilton required the firm’s services, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers argued that Galleon’s position in Hilton had nothing to do with any illegal tip emanating from Moody’s. Late on Monday, prosecutors filed a letter asking the judge to prevent the defense from playing tapes that were recorded in January between the Galleon traders Adam Smith, who has pleaded guilty, and Ian Horowitz. The calls took place at the behest of the F.B.I., shortly after Mr. Smith agreed to cooperate with the government, and they center on Galleon’s purchase of shares in Starent, a company that was acquired by Cisco in October 2009. Suspecting that there was a tipper, the government had Mr. Smith call his former colleague about the source of those tips. According to a transcript of the call, Mr. Smith asked him about the purchase and how Galleon came to buy shares in the company. Mr. Horowitz said that it was research: “Like I had no idea …like zero clue that they were going to be acquired. I had no idea,” Mr. Horowitz said. “Yeah, but they probably did, right?” Mr. Smith persisted. “I have no idea, it’s not, but they never relay that to me … they never said to me oh this is … it was never like that,” Mr. Horowitz responded. At one point, Mr. Horowitz told Mr. Smith: “Like, I feel like that you’re … the questions you are asking me are like you are tapping me on the phone trying to get me to say some things.” The government is also seeking to prohibit the defense from bringing up an out-of-court statement made by Joe Liu, in which he denied any insider trading allegations to the F.B.I. Prosecutors contend that both denials amount to hearsay, and that both Mr. Liu and Mr. Horowitz should be called to testify if the defense wants to use their comments. “It is not surprising that Horowitz and Liu denied knowledge of wrongdoing, given that the government’s investigation was fully public at the time of these statements,” according to the letter.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/is-thunderbolt-really-a-thunderbolt/?ref=intelcorporation">Is Thunderbolt Really a Thunderbolt?<date>February 28, 2011, 10:53 am</date><text>A big hat tip to Farhad Manjoo of Slate, who first raised doubts about the value of Thunderbolt in this post. My two cents are below. Apple‘s new MacBook Pros have faster processors, a better camera and improved graphics performance. But no one’s talking about that, really. What they’re talking about is the new Thunderbolt port. You see, in addition to the usual USB ports you use to connect things to your computer, Apple has a new connection standard, one developed in collaboration with Intel. The idea behind Thunderbolt is that current connection speeds between computers and peripherals are too slow. External hard drives, for example, can hold an obscene amount of data, but are constrained by the comparatively sluggish pipe they rely on to connect to a computer. Thunderbolt’s going to change all that, Apple and Intel say, and how: The new standard is up to 20 times faster than USB 2.0, which is the most popular connection format. But we’re dealing in abstractions so far. Let’s see if Apple’s Web site can explain the payoff. You can connect external devices like RAID arrays and video capture solutions directly to MacBook Pro — and get PCI Express performance. That’s a first for notebooks. Thunderbolt also provides 10 watts of power to peripherals, so you can tackle workstation-class projects on the go. With PCI Express technology, you can use existing USB and FireWire peripherals — even connect to Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel networks — using simple adapters. Let me get this straight: RAID arrays, video capture solutions, PCI Express performance, workstation-class projects (on the go, no less), Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel networks. I know it’s called MacBook Pro, but, really? Not a lot here sounds like it has any relevance to your average consumer. That’s not to say Thunderbolt is not without value to some. Hardcore users of laptops and people who work in video (the kind of people the MacBook Pro is designed for) will love what Thunderbolt can do, but what about the rest of us? What’s in it for regular folks? One practical benefit would be Thunderbolt’s ability to reduce cable clutter. You can daisy chain Thunderbolt devices, so one cord goes to an external drive, then another cable goes from the drive to a display, then another cable can go from a display to a, say, digital audio receiver. That’s nice. But not entirely groundbreaking. HDMI has already done wonders behind my TV, with its single-cable capabilities for both audio and video. But I will grant you that Thunderbolt adds data to the mix, eliminates the need for hubs and radically improves the transferring capabilities with its fat pipes (10 Gbps, both ways, at the same time). Still, this is incremental stuff. Intel likes to put Thunderbolt’s advantages in more practical terms, saying that, using Thunderbolt, you could transfer a full-length HD movie from, say, drive to PC in less than 30 seconds. Impressive, but how often am I doing that? Some have suggested that a future iPhones and iPads could be equipped with Thunderbolt ports, allowing syncs to take only seconds, as opposed to minutes. But really, isn’t syncing itself out of date? With the growth of cloud-based platforms, data should be shared and updated on the fly. And other wireless technologies are also available, from Bluetooth to near-field communication, that will expand devices’ abilities to share data without a physical connection. If Apple and Intel get their way, much of this doubting won’t much matter: Thunderbolt will become the dominant connection standard, allowing a single cable to do all the heavy lifting between devices. We will have a versatile, robust way to move data around at speeds that will make such transfers almost instantaneous. Just don’t expect me to get all excited about it.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/apple-announces-new-macbook-pros/?ref=intelcorporation">Apple Announces New MacBook Pros<date>February 24, 2011, 11:35 am</date><text>Apple today announced a refresh of its MacBook Pro line of laptops. The highlights? New, faster processors, more powerful graphics processors, an HD camera and a new port for a technology that Apple is calling Thunderbolt. Cosmetically, the new Pros look very similar to their predecessors. There are still 13-, 15- and 17-inch models (starting at $1,199, $1,799 and $2,499, respectively), and they still have the same aluminum unibody construction and full-width glass across the display. To look at them, you wouldn’t notice a whole lot that’s different. It’s under the hood where things change. The new Intel processors, the Core i5 and Core i7, are dual- and quad-core chips that promise up to twice the performance of the chips in the earlier models. One of the new features of the Intel chips is an integrated graphics processor. But in the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pros, Apple doubled down on graphics by adding a discrete AMD Radeon graphics chip. Models with both chips seamlessly and automatically switch between the two processors, depending on performance needs. There is also a new FaceTime camera, which can stream video in 720p resolution and display it in a new widescreen format. The new Thunderbolt port on MacBook Pros. It’s the last addition to the MacBook Pro line that is perhaps the most intriguing: the Thunderbolt port. Apple collaborated with Intel on its Light Peak project to create a new high-speed data and display port that would be adaptable to existing connection standards. The MacBook Pros are the first computers to feature the technology, but it will roll out across manufacturers next year. The performance specs of Thunderbolt are striking: At 10 Gbps, it’s twice as fast as USB 3.0, 12 times as fast as FireWire 800 and 20 times faster than USB 2.0. As Intel calculated in their press release, a Thunderbolt connection can transfer a full-length high-definition movie in 30 seconds. Thunderbolt is also a native Mini DisplayPort, so any display with that connection can hook up easily. HDMI, DVI, DisplayPort and VGA displays can use adapters. Thunderbolt also provides up to 10 watts of power to peripherals and can be daisy-chained to up to six peripherals. The new MacBook Pros are available now.</text></article>

My laptop was recently stolen by a cab driver who was dropping me off at an airport. But airports aren’t the only place where consumers should make sure to carefully guard their portable computers. According to a new nonstatistical Intel study of laptop theft among businesses, the largest percentage of business laptops were lost when an employee was working out of the office, followed by when an employee was traveling. According to the study, about 40 percent of laptops were lost off-site, while another third were lost in transit or travel, like an airport, train station or in a taxi. Other laptop disappearances occurred in offices or without explanation. So what does this mean for how you can better protect your laptop, besides securing it before it gets stolen? Intel also recently released tips for safeguarding laptops, including not leaving it unattended and in view in a hotel room or in a car as well as stowing it in a trunk before you leave for your destination. Among other advice, Intel’s security expert also recommended keeping your laptop in front of you during airport inspections, personalizing your actual laptop and, above all, protecting it as you would a child.

The loss in revenue and the fixing of the nearly half a million laptop and desktop computers that contain the chipset are expected to cost Intel $1 billion. Intel said that the Series 6, or Cougar Point, chipset, which controls the movement of data to hard drives, DVD drives and monitors, has a failure rate of 5 percent over the typical three- to five-year lifespan of a computer. Over time, some of the connection ports on the chipset can degrade, potentially blocking consumers from reaching their stored data. However, Intel said that the problem did not delete the data and that consumers would still be able to get to it by moving a hard drive to another computer. Computers with the flawed chip, which is for use with second-generation I5 and I7 quad core processors, started shipping on Jan. 9. By the time Intel identified the flaw and stopped production, it had already shipped eight million chipsets, not all of which had been placed in new computers. A modified version of the chipset will start shipping late this month, Intel said. Full production is expected in April. Intel, the largest maker of chips, had hoped that its new chips would help widen its lead over its nearest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. Although analysts described the halt in production as an embarrassment, they said it was unlikely to have a long-term impact. “I think Intel is being safe rather than sorry,” said Craig Berger, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp; Company. “They’re doing the right thing, rather than have customer problems down the road.” Intel said that tests of the chipset before its public release uncovered no issues. Only after computer makers returned a few problem chips, after their tests, did Intel discover the flaw, said Stephen L. Smith, vice president for Intel’s personal computer client operations. “Intel believes that consumers can continue to use their systems with confidence while working with computer manufacturers for a solution,” he said on a conference call on Monday. Consumers who believe they may have bought a computer with one of the Intel’s flawed chipsets are advised to contact the support desk of the computer manufacturer or that of Intel. The interruption in production is expected to reduce Intel’s first-quarter revenue by $300 million, Intel said. And $700 million more is expected to be spent on fixing the chipsets and replacing those already built into computers. Because of the chipset design flaw, Intel said it will take a charge that will reduce its fourth quarter 2010 gross profit margins by around 4 percentage points from the 67.5 percent it previously reported. Separately, Intel tempered the bad news with an updated first-quarter forecast. It expects to gain from the acquisitions of Infineon Technologies’ wireless unit and McAfee, the computer security company, which should offset the loss from the chip flaw. The McAfee deal should close by the end of March, Intel said. First-quarter revenue is expected to be $11.3 billion to $12.1 billion, up from an earlier forecast of $11.1 billion to $11.9 billion. Gross margins should be around 61 percent, compared with the previous forecast of about 64 percent, Intel said. For the full year, Intel said it expected the percentage growth in revenue would be in the mid- to high teens, versus about 10 percent growth, which it had previously predicted. Intel’s shares were unchanged on Monday at $21.46.

Next up is the administration’s courtship of the nation’s start-up economy, with a public-private sector initiative it calls “Startup America,” announced on Monday at the White House. Senior administration officials were there in force, including Gary Locke, the commerce secretary; Steven  Chu, the energy secretary; Karen Mills, director of the Small Business Administration; Gene Sperling, head of the National Economic Council; and Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Orchestrating private-sector efforts will be Steve Case, founder of AOL and head of the Case Foundation, and Carl Schramm, chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation. In his remarks, Mr. Case nodded toward the skepticism that will understandably greet the efforts to champion job-creating small businesses — a singularly uncontroversial initiative. “There is a mom and apple pie aspect to this,” Mr. Case noted. So strip away the political packaging and what remains? The money itself is meaningful, but not large in the context of the economy. The government funding is pulled from agency budgets and aimed at start-ups. The Small Business Administration, for example, will use $1 billion from an “impact investment fund” to provide up to $2 for every dollar of private capital for start-ups. There was a lot of talk about sweeping aside or lowering “barriers to innovation.” For example, Mr. Locke, the commerce secretary, mentioned the need to “dramatically lower” the three years, on average, that it now takes to process a patent. The United States patent office, he noted, is adapting a fast-track approach that will allow some patent applications to be processed within 12 months. Companies, including Intel, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Facebook and Google, have pledged funds and assistance for American start-ups as part of the initiative. The private-sector money comes to more than $400 million. Nonprofits like the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship will receive support to expand programs. Recent economic studies have concluded that nearly all the net new job creation in the American economy comes not really so much from small companies but from young ones. And the field of entrepreneurial economics has grown and is becoming increasingly mainstream, a trend accelerated by the Kauffman Foundation, the leading philanthropic sponsor of research on entrepreneurial activity, innovation and growth. The administration initiative, said Robert E. Litan, an economist and director of research at Kauffman, “validates this shift in emphasis from small business to new business. That’s significant. The administration is saying yes, we understand, and we’re going to try to do something about it.”</text></article>

Look at the engines behind cloud computing — vast, distributed armies of server computers. Even at the chip level, the wave of the recent past and the future is, as they say in the industry, multicore — microprocessors with multiple data-processing cores, for lower-power consumption and better performance. So Intel, the chip giant, has decided to take a more distributed approach to financing university research. The company said this week that it would pour $100 million over the next five years into projects at universities. Each of the projects will involve a few Intel researchers, typically four, with far-flung teams of researchers from several universities. Some of the money will be additional financing, but Intel is also shutting down its previous company-university collaborations. These were small labs set up in partnership with three institutions — Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Washington and the University of California, Berkeley. They were called “lablets,” and they were stand-alone facilities. The new approach, Justin Rattner, Intel’s chief technology officer, explained in an interview “allows us to include more institutions, get broader coverage and get more money to university researchers.” Much of the financing for the lablets, he said, went to pay for the lab operations themselves. The first of the new projects, Intel Science and Technology Centers, will be based at Stanford. It will be financed at $2.5 million a year for five years, and focus on research in visual computing. Thirty faculty members and 50 graduate students from eight universities will collaborate. The other universities are Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, the University of Washington and three institutions in the University of California system — Davis, Berkeley and Irvine. “What we really want to do is create an entire community of researchers focusing on an area of research,” Mr. Rattner said. Visual computing is a broad field, to be sure. But Mr. Rattner said targets of research would include improving the user experience on devices like Internet-connected televisions, digital tablets and even digital signs. New user interfaces and tools, he said, were likely subjects. In particular, Mr. Rattner said he would like to see better tools for non-professional users to create 3-D content. “It’s amazing what people have built in Second Life, given how primitive the tools are,” he said. In the future, Mr. Rattner said, he would like to see tools both powerful and easy enough to use so that a 10-year-old could build his or her own 3-D game. In retailing, he said, improved 3-D imagery and tools could “really transform the fashion industry.” Someday, he added, “We’ll all have our own anatomically correct avatars and clothe them.” You look at how a garment really would look on you — front, back, moving around — then you push a button to order it and have it made. That, he said, will drastically change the sales, design and manufacturing of clothing. “That is coming,” Mr. Rattner predicted. The project is the first of perhaps six to eight similar efforts. Others, Mr. Ratter said, could focus on fields like cloud computing, secure computing and perceptual computing — “devices that can recognize and move about the world in intelligent ways,” he explained. Most major technology companies finance collaborative research with universities. But Intel’s distributed approach seems to stand out. “This assembling of multi-university dream teams to work on big computer science problems is unusual for industry,” said Edward Lazowska, a professor at the University of Washington. “But the government’s National Science Foundation certainly does it.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/nyregion/27towns.html?ref=intelcorporation">Ossining High School Leads Way in Science<date>Published: January 26, 2011</date><text>OSSINING, N.Y.When the semifinalists were announced this month for the prestigious Intel Science Talent Search, two high schools had more — eight each — than any other in the country. One was the selective and celebrated Bronx High School of Science. No huge surprise. The other was Ossining High School, part of a very diverse, increasingly Hispanic town in Westchester, best known for Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Much more of a surprise. Most of the props go to the students who did astoundingly sophisticated work. Ossining’s semifinalists included topics like Jessica Brill’s “Development and Function of Extrathymic T-Cells in Athymic Bone Marrow Transplantation Recipients” and Hayley Zullow’s “Ecat11 Plays a Role in the Epigenetic Regulation of Retrotransposons.” At this level, even astoundingly sophisticated isn’t necessarily good enough. When the 40 finalists were announced Wednesday, none of the students from Ossining or Bronx Science made the list. But Ossining is a reminder of just how much goes into succeeding, inevitably including at least one maniacally dedicated science teacher and a decision by local officials — for whatever reason — to make science research a priority. “We need to teach our kids that it’s not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated, but the winner of the science fair,” President Obama said Tuesday in his State of the Union address. Actually, if not quite at a Steelers-Packers level, science awards are becoming a bigger deal. So if you look on Ossining’s Web site, you’ll find forever shuttling back and forth “OHS Has 8 Intel Semifinalists!” The district, not always so forthcoming with the news media, has been hungry for publicity. And there is a lot to be proud of, starting with the semifinalists, the other students doing worthy projects and Angelo Piccirillo, the science teacher who started Ossining’s science research program in 1998. “We started with three students, and they all dropped out,” he said. “We thought, well, we tried and it didn’t work. Who could have imagined we’d have 90 students 12 years later?” Mr. Piccirillo has built something of a machine that yearly accepts 30 freshmen out of more than 100 applicants. It includes guidance on research topics, mentors, and help with writing papers and presenting them. Ossining now regularly wins its share of prizes. “It’s difficult to explain, but the best way I can put it to you is that science research is now part of our culture,” he said. “One thing they say in administration is to make sure everyone is a stockholder in whatever you’re trying to do. That’s what we’ve managed to build.” When it began, Mr. Piccirillo advised students in addition to teaching. Now he and a second teacher, Valerie Holmes, work on the science research full time — and a good deal more than eight hours a day. At Bronx Science, the advising is done by one of seven teachers who work with science research in addition to carrying a full teaching load. It would be nice if a fabulous science research program translates to a fabulous school and district, but Ossining’s overall test scores do not compare with those of the most successful districts. Its achievement gap between largely affluent whites and less affluent minorities, who make up a majority of the district, remains stubbornly wide. This year’s Intel semifinalists come overwhelmingly on the favored side of the demographic divide. In the most recent Regents tests, 11 percent of Ossining students scored above 85 on the chemistry test. In Scarsdale, 65 percent did. But then, there are more than a few parents in neighboring districts with higher test scores who are envious of the richer real-world experience students get in Ossining, where students come from an estimated 53 countries and speak 39 languages. Maybe, as budgets get tighter and tighter, someone will question whether closing the achievement gap and maintaining the expensive science research program can coexist. Many parents realize there’s a bit of marketing and branding here in the erstwhile home of “Mad Men’s” dream couple of Don and Betty Draper. Nothing’s simple, but success does tend to sell. “I think it’s money well spent,” said Peter Capek, a retired I.B.M. computer scientist whose son graduated from the high school last year. “I don’t know what the specific expense is, and I don’t really care. I wouldn’t say I’m 100 percent happy with the schools, but I’m happy with this aspect of them.” E-mail: peappl@nytimes.comOSSINING, N.Y.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/realestate/commercial/19space.html?ref=intelcorporation">Redesigning, and Shrinking, Office Work Space<date>Published: January 18, 2011</date><text>HILLSBORO, Ore. — Intel was never one of those technology companies where employees had beanbag chairs, designer desks and pinball machines. Its offices were known for their endless rows of gray cubicles, low ceilings and fluorescent lighting. For decades it resisted any changes to its office environment.In the last two years, however, Intel has quietly been trying to inject a little more fun into its offices and make them places where employees can be more collaborative. The company has remade one million square feet of office space thus far in a sweeping redesign. At its campus here outside of Portland, where it designs computer chips, gray walls have been repainted yellow, purple and white, cubicle walls are lower so employees can be seen, and lounges have been outfitted with flat-screen TVs, armchairs and sleek kitchens that would not look out of place in a design magazine. The changes are being made for more than cosmetic reasons. To promote innovation, Intel wanted to create plenty of space where people could work in groups, rather than be isolated at their desks. Neil Tunmore, the director of corporate services at Intel, who oversees the company’s 30 million square feet of office space, said, “We realized that we were inefficient and not as collaborative as we would have liked.” As employees become more mobile and less tied to their desks, the average amount of space per employee nationwide, in all industries, has dropped to 250 square feet from 400 square feet in 1985, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial brokerage and property manager. Within 10 years, that is expected to drop further, to 150 square feet. “The office status symbol seems not to be as important. People are living for more flexibility in their lives,” said Peter Miscovich, a managing director for corporate solutions at Jones Lang LaSalle. By allotting less space per person, companies can squeeze more employees — sometimes double or triple as many — onto a floor. One newly redesigned floor of Intel’s campus can now accommodate 1,000 people, up from 600. In some departments where employees are often on the road, two people may be assigned to a desk. Of course, sometimes the downsizing in office space is not voluntary. Companies that went through rounds of layoffs are renegotiating leases, moving into smaller offices and mothballing large real estate projects to save money. In the last three years, companies have given up 137.8 million square feet nationwide, according to the real estate research firm Reis, and would most likely put more on the market if they could. Other companies are reducing their real estate expenses, which are generally the second-largest cost after employees. Many companies are redesigning the workplaces that remain, opening them up to make them flexible for multiple uses. Even tradition-bound firms in accounting and banking are embracing open-plan offices and other changes. They have shut sections of floors to save money on utilities, squeezed remaining employees closer together, torn down walls and downsized cubicles or gotten rid of them entirely. “Companies that were dragging their feet changed their minds with the bottom line,” said Richard Kadzis, a spokesman for CoreNet Global, an association of real estate executives in Atlanta. “Now that we’re on the other side of the recession, companies are asking themselves, ‘How do we be smarter?’ Cost has driven traditional companies to free the reins.” The accounting and consulting company Deloitte is trimming real estate costs at its San Francisco offices. Deloitte terminated a lease there five years early even though it carried a $12 million penalty and required a move. Its new landlord is paying part of the fee, according to the CoStar Group, a commercial real estate firm. At its new San Francisco office, at 555 Mission Street, which opens this year, employees have less personal space and there are more community areas where accountants can meet clients. At nearly 182,000 square feet, the office is about 100,000 square feet smaller than the previous one. Saving money, though, is not the only reason to downsize. Opening up an office makes people interact more and, the thinking goes, be more productive. It also makes it possible to eliminate some seldom-used desks or turn them into shared work spaces. Around 60 percent of a company’s desks are vacant at one time, according to CoreNet Global, because workers are either on the road or in meetings. 1 2 Next Page »HILLSBORO, Ore. — Intel was never one of those technology companies where employees had beanbag chairs, designer desks and pinball machines. Its offices were known for their endless rows of gray cubicles, low ceilings and fluorescent lighting. For decades it resisted any changes to its office environment.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/technology/14chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Strong Corporate Demand Lifts Intel Results<date>Published: January 13, 2011</date><text>Intel set records for profit and revenue in its latest quarter, offering evidence that businesses were gaining confidence and investing more heavily in technology.The company said on Thursday that demand was exceptionally strong in the market for machines used in data centers, which store and process the huge amounts of information that flow across the Internet. Intel’s fourth-quarter profit rose to $3.39 billion, or 59 cents a share, up from a year-ago profit of $2.28 billion, or 40 cents a share. Revenue for the quarter rose to $11.46 billion, beating analysts’ estimates. Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, noted in a conference call with financial analysts that it was the company’s third consecutive quarter of record sales and profits. The PC market was continuing to expand, he said, growing roughly 17 percent in 2010. “In 2011, everything gets a little better,” Mr. Otellini said. “The economy is forecast to improve.” Intel said it expected the strong sales gains to continue through the first quarter, forecasting revenue of $11.1 billion to $11.9 billion, as corporations continue to replace aging PCs with more powerful ones based on Microsoft’s latest version of Windows. Analysts have forecast $10.74 billion in revenue for the first quarter. Mr. Otellini said he expected Intel’s revenues to grow by about 10 percent for the full year. “It just shows the PC is not done yet,” said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. Intel’s data-center group reported sales of $2.5 billion, up 24 percent from the same quarter the previous year, growth that was driven largely by the continued rise of the Internet. Mr. Otellini said more data had crossed the Internet in 2010 than in all the previous years of Internet activity combined. “This dynamic will require high-performance servers from Intel for years to come,” he said. “Intel is very well positioned to benefit from the growth in data centers.” Shares of Intel rose about 2 percent in after-hours trading, after remaining essentially unchanged in regular trading, before the report was released. Wednesday’s closing share price of $21.29 is roughly the same as the price a year ago. Intel said it bought back $1.5 billion in stock during the quarter. “This tells us they’ve got a lot of confidence,” said Patrick Wang, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. Mr. Wang said the company’s optimistic forecast showed that it had products that would drive growth, like Sandy Bridge, Intel’s name for some advanced processor technology that it revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show last week. Intel says the chips will offer a new level of performance to servers and other high-end computers, and they are a major leap in manufacturing capability. Mr. Otellini has in recent months described the PC industry as robust and growing, with as many as a million PCs sold daily. But investors had been watching for signs of slowing sales at Intel amid brisk sales of Apple’s iPad tablet, which uses competing chip technology and is believed to be hurting sales of more expensive PCs and laptops. Those concerns were compounded Wednesday when market researchers warned that sales of PCs grew less than they had expected in the fourth quarter. The results at Intel’s PC client group, which makes chips for desktop and notebook computers, were less than spectacular. It had sales of $8 billion, little changed from the third quarter, and up 3.5 percent from the fourth quarter of last year. Intel reported gross margins of 67.5 percent in the fourth quarter, close to analysts’ forecasts. For the first quarter, the company forecast gross margins of 64 percent, plus or minus two percentage points. Analysts have forecast gross margins of 63.5 percent for the first quarter. Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said that in the coming years he expected the company’s sales to emerging markets to outpace sales to more established markets by a factor of two to one. He said consumer sales had been sluggish through the holidays.Intel set records for profit and revenue in its latest quarter, offering evidence that businesses were gaining confidence and investing more heavily in technology.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/qualcomm-atheros-deal-anticipates-more-mobile-devices/?ref=intelcorporation">Qualcomm Deal May Spur Takeovers of Chip Makers<date>January 5, 2011, 8:51 pm</date><text>Qualcomm’s $3.1 billion deal to acquire the chip maker Atheros Communications is a long-term play on the increasingly wired nature of consumers’ lives. The deal, formally announced on Wednesday, is the largest takeover yet by Qualcomm, a leading wireless technology company. It also comes on the heels of Intel’s $1.4 billion purchase in August of Infineon’s wireless chip business, which competes with Atheros. Many industry analysts believe Qualcomm’s takeover of Atheros is the first of several potential deals in the semiconductor industry this year. They say big technology companies, flush with cash and eager to acquire high-margin businesses, may find attractive opportunities among small and midsize chip makers. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink As people spend more hours perusing Facebook, searching the Web, sending messages via Twitter and streaming videos online, the digital connection — and the ability to stay online throughout the day — is becoming increasingly important, as Qualcomm’s deal for Atheros shows. “From a vision standpoint, we believe that communications capability will go into more and more devices in the world around us and that the phone will be used to interact with these devices,” Paul E. Jacobs, chief executive of Qualcomm, said on Wednesday in a conference call with analysts and investors. Like Qualcomm, Atheros is a major player in connecting devices to the Internet. Atheros specializes in Wi-Fi connectivity chips and installs its technology in a broad range of consumer devices, including laptops, home electronics and mobile devices, where it has started to gain market share. According to analysts, the addition of Atheros will significantly bolster Qualcomm’s Wi-Fi technology, which has been a glaring weakness in its portfolio. Qualcomm also has products for Bluetooth and GPS devices, but the bulk of its business is in 3G technology and the design of core chipset processors that allow cellphones to transmit data to radio towers and run applications. Although the technology industry has enjoyed strong deal activity in the last 12 months, particularly in the remote, or cloud, computing and data storage sectors, the semiconductor business has been relatively quiet. With several major companies holding significant cash, however, many analysts believe the pace of acquisitions will pick up in 2011. “Most chip companies are at record levels of profit margin, and if these cash-rich companies can go out and blow $3 billion and get 15 percent in pretax margins, the acquisitions can be very accretive” to earnings, said Gary Mobley, an analyst at the Benchmark Company. Qualcomm had $18 billion in cash as of the end of September; its rival Intel, which has become increasingly aggressive in the mobile sector, has $20 billion in cash. From a strategic standpoint, there is also a significant incentive for chip makers to consolidate. Global demand for mobile devices, in particular smartphones and tablet computers, is surging. The research firm International Data Corporation estimates that the smartphone market grew more than 55 percent in the last year, with 269.6 million units sold worldwide. Sales will most likely reach 330 million in 2011. This booming market for devices has intensified competition, as handset, chip makers and everyone else down the chain tries to secure a larger slice of the pie. Furthermore, as data needs grow and the number of connectivity technologies expand (like 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), companies will feel pressure to make acquisitions to compensate for holes in their product lines, said Anil Doradla, a research analyst at William Blair &amp; Company. “Within the semiconductor world, most of the mergers and acquisitions are centered around strengthening their ability to address the need for processing greater amounts of data along with the richness in applications,” he said. With hundreds of companies in the chip market, experts say, there are dozens of possible pairings. According to Mr. Doradla, the most likely acquisition candidates among small and midsize companies are Cavium Networks, Silicon Laboratories and NetLogic Microsystems. Like Atheros, Cavium Networks has networking and Bluetooth technology that goes into consumer electronics, like remote controls. Mr. Mobley of the Benchmark Company said his top picks included the acquisition of Entropic Communications by Intel or STMicroelectronics; a takeover of MIPS Technologies by Synopsys or ARM Holdings; or the purchase of EZchip Semiconductor by the Marvell Technology Group. According to Mr. Mobley, EZchip, which makes network processors, would complement Marvell’s portfolio of Ethernet switches. “You’re going to see an unprecedented amount of merger and acquisition in 2011, relative to anything we’ve seen before,” said Craig A. Ellis, an analyst at Caris &amp; Company.</text></article>

Computer chip makers like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices tried to outdo each other by putting out ever faster chips, and then by improving battery life and making smaller, cheaper laptops. These days, though, it’s all about graphics and how well computers can process and display photos, videos and other types of media. And the competition is putting marketing departments to the test. Gone are the crisp pitches about faster, thinner and longer-lasting products, which allowed consumers who wanted the latest and greatest computer to look for simple metrics like more gigahertz, more hours of battery life or lighter weight. Instead, now there is baffling talk about things that improve visual performance like breathtaking tessellation, zippy transcoding speeds and DirectX 11 support — all of which will be highlighted by the chip makers at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, opening in Las Vegas on Thursday. “It is certainly a challenge,” conceded Deborah S. Conrad, the chief marketing officer at Intel. “When we talk about graphics, we see people scrunch up their noses. It is just not language people outside of our industry use.” The focus on graphics and the visual skills of computers reflects a pair of trends taking place in the computing market. For one, the chips in the computers to be displayed at the electronics show, and which will soon hit retail shelves, have more graphics oomph. They represent the first wave of mainstream chips that combine top-of-the-line computation and graphics functions on the same piece of silicon. The result is that even low-cost laptops will have visual performance on par with some of yesteryear’s costliest, most powerful computers equipped with specialized graphics cards aimed at video gamers. Second, consumers have driven an explosion in high-definition Web video and digital photo sharing. By some forecasts, video will account for about 90 percent of all consumer Internet traffic by 2013. Facebook says that people upload more than 100 million photos a day to its site alone. And so, the chip makers are scrambling to meet consumers’ needs and do away with the hiccups people sometimes see when watching a video stream or the long wait to shift a home video from a camera or phone onto their PC. “We think the new norm is this constant visual experience,” Ms. Conrad said. “You are not waiting for things to happen and getting that pinwheel on a Mac or hourglass on the PC.” Intel, for example, is using this week’s electronics show as a platform to talk about its latest generation of chips, which include features like “Quick Think Video.” That’s the humanized name for a new transcoding engine, which is something that alters the size or makeup of a file. In this particular case, Intel brags that its new engine can take a five-minute video from a phone and, in 18 seconds, turn it into something a computer can use. By another measure, the new Intel chips can rework an hourlong home video in about four minutes. Other features in the new Intel chips are aimed at helping movie studios deliver high-definition versions of their films and to move video streams between computers and TV screens. Advanced Micro Devices, meanwhile, makes some of the fastest stand-alone graphics products in the industry and has included much of that technology in its latest batch of laptop chips. Rick Bergman, a senior vice president at A.M.D., has tried to emphasize the performance of the new products by saying they offer consumers the equivalent of a hotel room with an ocean view. “Some people are usually willing to pay a premium for that ocean view,” Mr. Bergman said, during a recent meeting with Wall Street analysts. “Well, all of us deserve the ocean view.” A.M.D. has been working with software makers to help them rework their applications to take advantage of the new chips that include graphics engines. The company claims a lead over Intel with this type of technology, and says common programs from Microsoft, game developers and Web browser makers will display visuals better on computers based on A.M.D. chips. For instance, technology in A.M.D.’s chips can automatically remove some of the hand-holding jiggle from movies on Web sites like YouTube. The revamped videos come out smoother and more vibrant. To emphasize such features with consumers, A.M.D. has also spent the better part of a year trying to train retail sales representatives in the art of marketing visual performance. According to the company’s own data, about half have mastered A.M.D.’s graphics-heavy pitch. Intel has developed what it bills as more nuanced marketing programs that target 18- to 24-year-olds with the message that top-of-the-line computers let people “write better songs, design better clothes and design better buildings,” Ms. Conrad said. The company has set up a Web site called the Creators Project where young people can promote their creations at Intel’s expense. Ms. Conrad said all of the attention on the visual performance of chips and investment in the accompanying technology meant that amazing graphics would be commonplace in a couple of years. “That’s the good news,” Ms. Conrad said, before lamenting that the chip makers will then need to find the next big thing to promote.In the good old days, it was all about speed.

Previews Intel's New Chip<date>December 29, 2010, 7:41 pm</date><text>Intel’s Sandy Bridge processing chip will have its formal debut at next week’s Consumer Electronics Show when it arrives in a number of high-end, $1,000-plus, laptop computers. Of course, there had to be a leak before CES formally opens and Intel draws the curtain, and this time, Hewlett-Packard has shown its goods early. H.P. released some details about two variations of the new Pavilion dv7, which were subsequently taken off its product support pages. The chips, based on Core i7 technology and architecture, have graphics technology integrated on the same die as the main processing chip, or C.P.U. A result is a smaller chip, improved graphics performance and more efficient use of power. There is also a feature in the Core 17 chips called Turbo Boost, which bumps up the clock speeds by about a third. Advanced Micro Devices will begin offering its own integrated graphics range of chips, called Fusion, at CES as well. Official pricing and availability of the H.P.’s 4000 and 5000 series models, as well as laptops from several other companies, including Acer, Asus and Lenovo, will likely be coming next week at the show.</text></article>

The chip giant has created a new business unit that it calls the netbook and tablet group. The unit will be run by Douglas L. Davis, the current head of Intel's embedded and communications group, who will be charged with making sure Intel can fend off all kinds of competition in the burgeoning market for PC offshoots. Intel often formally announces the formation of such groups, but kept this one quiet. Bill Kircos, a company spokesman, confirmed the move. ''Netbook shipments will be heading north of 100 million, and we'll all soon will find out what kind of market potential there is for tablets and these increasingly popular hybrid designs,'' Mr. Kircos said. ''It makes sense for us to sharpen our focus on these friends of the PC, and Doug's experience running a similar and very successful embedded division makes him the right guy to lead the group.'' A certain amount of symbolism accompanies the formation of this group because Intel is one of the companies most associated with the rise of the classic PC. It would seem that Intel wants its share of the weird and wacky computer pie. When netbooks first hit the scene, analysts were quick to predict possible doom-and-gloom for Intel. The cheap, little netbooks run on cheap, little chips. And the thinking was that Intel's profits would sink as people bought netbooks instead of proper laptops with fancier chips. As it turns, most netbooks were bought as complements to existing computers. As a result, Intel simply sold more chips and piggybacked on computers that played well in some regions that had been cool to the PC. The netbooks have also boosted Intel's long-standing push in the education market. The San Diego public school system, for example, has bought 35,000 netbooks for third and fourth graders and is expected to buy 100,000 more as it expands a program aimed at giving all students access to computers. Tablets are more challenging for Intel. The iPad from Apple has proved the dominant device in this category, and it runs on Apple's own ARM chip, the A4. A number of companies designing tablets have eyed ARM chips as lower-power, lower-cost alternatives to Intel's Atom chip that can still provide enough computing oomph to keep people happy. But at next month's consumer electronics show in Las Vegas, a number of Atom-based tablets should appear from the usual suspects and some unusual ones. Intel expects more than 100 netbook and tablet designs based on Atom to hit the market over the next six months. Hewlett-Packard sells once such device aimed at business people. And Dell has the Inspiron duo, which is sort of a hybrid tablet and netbook. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/business/global/26tax.html?ref=intelcorporation">In Ireland, Low Corporate Taxes Go Untouched<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>DUBLIN — Cut Ireland’s minimum wage? Check. Collect more in property taxes from beleaguered homeowners? Check. Raise the corporate tax rate, which could plug the gaping hole in Ireland’s tattered balance sheets even faster? Well, no.The austerity plan Ireland unveiled on Wednesday to secure a bailout from its international partners makes one thing clear: much of the 15 billion euros (or $20 billion) in savings the government has pledged to find over the next four years will come from the welfare state and the working class. But the measures will not touch large businesses like Microsoft, Intel and Pfizer, which have created thousands of jobs and fueled exports in Ireland for years, thanks to one of the lowest corporate tax rates in Europe. Germany, France and other European countries have long complained that Ireland’s tax structure has distorted competition. Some politicians have seized on the troubles by pushing for an increase in the 12.5 percent rate as part of a rescue package of about 85 billion euros (or $114 billion), the terms of which are still being negotiated. Some of that external pressure subsided this week as the political crisis in Ireland worsened. But if Ireland cannot meet its budget-cutting targets, or if its troubled banks require even more financing than expected, some countries might push the issue back into the spotlight. From Ireland’s perspective, any future effort by its European partners to revive the issue would damage the country’s prospects for recovery once the banking crisis eases. “The corporate tax is one of the pillars of Ireland’s economy, because it drives exports and jobs, and creates tax revenues for the government,” said Paul Duffy, a vice president at Pfizer in Ireland, one of the biggest multinational employers here. Raising the tax could scare away companies and “would damage a recovery and our ability to repay the massive debts we’ve taken on,” he said. Critics, however, say that in addition to siphoning business from countries with higher corporate tax rates, some multinationals operating under Ireland’s tax rules use complicated schemes to move profits in and out of subsidiaries there. In some cases, that allows them to lower their effective tax rate, they say. That has opened Ireland to criticism from countries like Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel must justify why taxpayers should help pay for another bailout package. The argument is that Ireland could be collecting more money from the companies it has lured. Tax rates have become a contentious issue in Europe, where governments are competing as never before to lure badly needed foreign investments as the economic crisis weighs on growth. Economic activity has declined sharply in the housing and banking industries. That leaves manufacturing and exports as two of the few channels to stimulate the necessary growth. Ireland’s exports grew 6 percent over the last year and manufacturing output increased by more than 10 percent. Philip R. Lane, a professor of international macroeconomics at Trinity College Dublin, said that if the tax rate were nudged a little higher it would help the country collect significant revenue. “But in the context of a devastated economy, where it’s the only thing driving the multinational sector, trying to tweak that rate is not something that any of the political parties want to do,” he said. Ireland’s has long pursued a strategy of luring business by helping major corporations from the United States and elsewhere reduce the tax they pay on profits. While the rate is well below that of Germany and France, it is higher than in Hungary and other countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Ireland’s edge, businesses and politicians say, is that it is a small, open economy with a well-educated, nimble and English-speaking work force and with a relatively stable social compact between unions and companies. That combination has attracted drug companies like Pfizer and Forest Laboratories, and technology firms like Google and, more recently, Facebook and LinkedIn. Multinational corporations employ more than a quarter of a million people in Ireland. Google, for instance, established its European beachhead in Ireland in 2003 and has been reinvesting and expanding operations. This summer, the company announced it would hire 200 people to run a new operations center on top of the 1,500 staff members already there.. About 70 percent of the nation’s exports, and 70 percent of business spending on research and development here, comes from foreign direct investment, according to the country’s Industrial Development Agency, or I.D.A. Ireland, the body responsible for luring foreign investment to Ireland. Foreign-owned firms that are members of I.D.A. Ireland pay workers about $7.1 billion each year and provide one in seven of the country’s jobs, either directly or indirectly. All told, multinationals paid about 5 billion euros in corporate tax to Ireland last year, more than 50 percent of all corporate tax receipts, according to the group’s figures. Pfizer, which has been in Ireland for decades, is among the many multinationals monitoring the tax debate. “When you’re a company like Pfizer, you make billions of dollars of investments for the long term because Ireland has provided certainty” about the tax rate, said Mr. Duffy, the vice president. “When you start to mess with that, you raise issues of trust” that could cause some companies to reconsider the wisdom of investing in Ireland, he said. Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett-Packard recently indicated that they would reconsider whether Ireland was the best base for their main European operations if the corporate tax were to rise. Companies could find it more attractive to relocate outside of the European Union to countries whose low tax rates are not menaced by political haggling in the European Union. “The difficult calculus the Irish government has to make is if they raise the rate to siphon in more money, will that be a deterrent to future generations of foreign investors,” said Iain Begg, a professor at the London School of Economics. Mr. Begg said other countries had quickly recognized that pressing the issue further with Ireland now would be counterproductive. Some officials are instead mulling the idea of a levy on Ireland’s banks, which would theoretically raise money once they returned to profitability. Tax policy is a matter of state autonomy, Mr. Begg added, and any future effort to persuade Ireland to revisit the matter would probably raise hackles in Britain and in Central and Eastern Europe, which have insisted that sovereign matters like these cannot be dictated by other countries. Irish voters have mixed feelings about the government’s decision to keep the corporate tax rate steady, even as many fret that income and property tax increases will affect their personal finances, said Paul Sweeney, economic advisor at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. “People feel that on the one hand, corporations, including Irish banks, caused the crisis, and therefore the whole corporate sector should pay,” said Mr. Sweeney. “On the other hand, because people are so nervous about the future, they know that the corporate tax is one of the factors that attracts foreign direct investment, and therefore it would be a delicate time to touch it.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/13/technology/13chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Raises Dividend 14% and Predicts ‘Best Year Ever.’<date>Published: November 12, 2010</date><text>The Intel Corporation, the big chip maker, announced on Friday that it would raise its dividend by 14 percent as its chief executive said the company expected its “best year ever.”Intel said it would raise its quarterly payout for investors to 18 cents a share from 15.75 cents starting with the first quarter of 2011. With the latest move, Intel has raised its dividend 60 percent over the last three years. Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said the company “remains on track to have our best year ever and we continue to generate strong cash flows.” Intel shares rose 32 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $21.53. As a barometer for the technology sector, Intel has flashed some mixed signals over the last few months. In August, the company cut its quarterly sales forecast, citing “weaker-than-expected demand for consumer PCs in mature markets,” including the United States and Europe. Then last month it offered a more encouraging fourth-quarter forecast that met expectations. Intel’s move to raise its dividend Friday provided a positive counterpoint to Cisco Systems, which prompted a slide in stock prices this week by issuing a disappointing sales forecast. Cisco forecast revenue growth of 3 to 5 percent for the current quarter and 9 to 12 percent for its 2011 fiscal year. That was less than the 13 percent that analysts had expected. Both Intel and Cisco are bellwethers for broader technology spending and investment. Cisco provides big companies, government agencies and service providers with the equipment that routes data over the Internet. Intel is the world’s biggest maker of microprocessors — the “brains” — of personal computers. Cisco shares fell 37 cents, or 1.8 percent, to close at $20.15.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/business/01chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Takes a Wider Role, Making Chips for Others<date>Published: November 1, 2010</date><text>Intel, for the first time, has agreed to manufacture another company’s chips at its most advanced factories. The move thrusts Intel, the largest and wealthiest chip maker, into the contract manufacturing business dominated by Taiwanese and Chinese companies.Starting next year, Intel will make chips for Achronix Semiconductor, a small company based in Silicon Valley that designs a specialized type of microprocessor used to accelerate computing tasks like shuttling network traffic and encrypting data. The tie-up, which the two companies plan to make public on Monday, would require Intel to give up only a small fraction of its manufacturing capacity, but it still is a major departure from Intel’s tradition of keeping its prized chip-making expertise to itself. “We totally appreciate that our manufacturing techniques and factory network are the envy of the chip-making industry,” said Bill Kircos, an Intel spokesman. Mr. Kircos played down the scope of the deal and the notion that Intel had become a contract chip maker. “For proper perspective, this agreement makes up much less than 1 percent of Intel’s total capacity,” he said. But some analysts see the deal with Achronix as an indication that Intel intends to enter the contract manufacturing business in a more meaningful way. “I think this is only the beginning of Intel manufacturing for others,” said Gus Richard, a microprocessor industry analyst with Piper Jaffray. Intel has long held a manufacturing lead over its competitors in the PC and server chip markets, building chips with smaller components before rivals do. Those smaller pieces result in faster, cheaper, lower-power products. Historically, Intel has kept its collection of multibillion-dollar chip fabrication plants, or fabs, to itself to build the chips it designs in-house. Meanwhile, a few other companies, most of them located in Taiwan and China, have specialized in building chips that other companies design. These companies engage in a fierce, expensive battle to attract customers like Apple, Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. Mr. Richard said that Intel had struggled to build a major business beyond PC and server chips, and that working with other designers could help it simultaneously learn new markets while offsetting the cost of its factories. “Manufacturing is their crown jewel, and they’re finding new ways to monetize it,” he said. He and other analysts characterized the move as a mere dip of the toe into accepting business from other chip designers. Achronix is a minor player in the relatively modest-size market for F.P.G.A., or field programmable gate array, chips. These chips fill a niche because they can be tweaked to push through specialized tasks at faster rates than the general purpose chips founds in PCs. Companies use these customizable chips to speed up things like routers and switches, and systems that handle digital signals and video. Increasingly, Wall Street has turned to them to speed their financial calculations, while oil and gas companies use the chips to power through geological data. The worldwide market for these chips is about $3 billion, about one-tenth of the size of Intel’s annual revenue. Intel does not currently compete in the market. By branching into manufacturing, even at a modest level, the company can gain some experience in building products for other designers, said Joseph Byrne, a chip industry analyst with the Linley Group. He said that came with challenges because Intel for the first time would need to meet the needs of external customers. Mr. Byrne added that the move had the chance to heighten competition in the F.P.G.A. market, is currently dominated by two companies: Xilinx and Altera. Both companies rely on contract manufacturers for the chips they design. John L. Holt, the chief executive of Achronix, said that tapping Intel as a manufacturing partner should allow the company to make faster, cheaper products than its rivals and expand the market for these chips. “F.P.G.A.’s have been too expensive because the top ones cost in the $1,000 range,” Mr. Holt said. “We will sell them for $400.” Mr. Byrne said Achronix in 2009 had virtually no market share but that it could make up ground quickly if the chips manufactured by Intel did deliver the expected cost and performance increases. “This will greatly heighten the threat” that Achronix poses, he said. But Mr. Richard of Piper Jaffray said that Xilinx and Altera remained well positioned and that it would be a “long stretch” to say that Achronix could quickly catch up. Intel, on rare occasions, has made chips for other companies in the past, but never at its most advanced manufacturing facilities.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/technology/20chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel to Upgrade Plants and Build New One<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>The Intel Corporation said on Tuesday that it planned to invest $6 billion to $8 billion to upgrade manufacturing plants in the United States and build a new one in Oregon, adding as many as 1,000 new high-tech positions and thousands of construction jobs. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has historically used its substantial cash reserves to invest in its manufacturing plants through economic downturns, advancing its technology while rivals struggled to stay afloat. It is a strategy that has been largely successful. Indeed, last week, the company reported better-than-expected earnings on a sharp increase in revenue. “These investments will create capacity for innovation we haven’t yet imagined,” said Brian M. Krzanich, senior vice president and general manager of Intel’s manufacturing and supply chain. A similar $7 billion investment by Intel about 20 months ago was focused on making chips using 32-nanometer process technology. Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, vowed at that time to invest in chip factories in the United States rather than send the business abroad. He also urged other companies to follow Intel’s model of investing in future products despite the recession. In recent months, Mr. Otellini has railed against incentives and other practices that make it far cheaper for companies to build and operate chip plants abroad. He has estimated it costs $1 billion less to operate a chip factory overseas than in the United States, not because of lower labor costs but because of incentives from foreign governments. Intel generates three-fourths of its revenue from overseas business, but three-fourths of its chip-making employees are in the United States. Mr. Krzanich told reporters in a conference call that Intel benefited from the large manufacturing base in the United States despite the potential cost savings of manufacturing abroad. He called the plants a great asset “from a hardware standpoint,” but also because the employees were highly skilled. “We’re going to utilize that,” he said. The upgraded plants will pave the way for higher-performing and sleeker electronic devices by allowing Intel to produce a new generation of 22-nanometer chips. The new Hillsboro, Ore., plant — Intel’s first new plant since 2007 — is scheduled to start production in 2013.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/technology/13chipweb.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel’s Quarterly Profit Topped Forecasts<date>Published: October 12, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) — The chipmaker Intel posted stronger-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday and said its sales could rise about 2.7 percent sequentially in the final quarter of the year. The first major technology company to post its third-quarter results, Intel forecast revenue of $11 billion to $11.8 billion in the final three months of 2010, in line with analysts’ expectations of $11.32 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Third-quarter net profit was $2.955 billion, or 52 cents a share, compared with $1.86 billion in the year-ago quarter. That was slightly higher than the 50 cents a share expected by analysts. “It looks fairly well in line with consensus, a little upside,” said Chris Caso, an analyst at the Susquehanna Financial Group. “The revenue guidance for the December quarter is about in line with the Street, or a little better.” Since the bellwether Intel warned in August about weak consumer demand for personal computers, semiconductor stocks have surged in part on expectations that the worst may be over for the technology sector, and investors are looking for signs of strength to back their bets — or sell. Intel’s revenue in the quarter ended on Sept 25 was $11.1 billion, a bit above the $10.99 billion expected by analysts. The PC industry has struggled with soft demand in the United States and Europe as well as rising inventories for chips and other components that have led some customers to reduce their orders for new parts. Global semiconductor sales could grow 5 percent next year as the economy continues to struggle, according to market research firm iSuppli. Intel’s results were buoyed by a 3 percent sequential increase in data center sales in the quarter, a business with higher margins than chips for PCs.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/technology/13chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Moves Into New Products, Tries Anonymity<date>Published: October 12, 2010</date><text>An average laptop contains about 1,800 components, but only one garners much brand awareness from typical consumers: the chip made by Intel.Over the years, Intel has used aggressive and catchy marketing programs to help elevate its position in the computing marketplace. This cachet has served Intel well, allowing it to command top dollar for its products, which power the vast majority of PCs. The Intel juggernaut was apparent on Tuesday as the company reported earnings better than expected on a sharp revenue increase. But these days, Intel is moving into a new business — putting its chips inside products like TVs and other consumer electronics. In these areas, that familiar “Intel Inside” sticker found on so many PCs is often missing since it seems out of place on the sleek devices anchoring living rooms. And so Intel’s expansion plans include an unfamiliar level of anonymity. “Our customers are really trying to deliver industrial designs that are beautiful and elegant,” said Jim Nucci, a brand manager at Intel. “We don’t want to be an obtrusive element.” With encouraging strong sales of personal computers in the latest quarter and cautious optimism about the next quarter, Intel reported an 18 percent rise in revenue in the third quarter, to $11.1 billion, from a year earlier. Intel’s net income rose to $3 billion, or 52 cents a share, ahead of the 50 cents projected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. The company’s shares, which rose 1 percent during regular trading, rose another 1 percent to $19.97 in the after-hours market. “We had record revenue,” Stacy J. Smith, the chief financial officer at Intel, said in an interview. “It was a very good quarter.” More than two years ago, Intel unveiled a new type of low-power chip, Atom. Intel hoped the product would carry it into growing areas like smartphones, Web-ready TVs and set-top-boxes. The company’s growth plans hinged on success in these types of devices, and the flashy release of the Atom brand reflected Intel’s lofty aspirations. A host of rival chip makers like Broadcom and Freescale toil away in relative obscurity making the chips that go into household objects and consumer electronics devices. These companies tend to let device manufacturers enjoy the limelight and spend little on building their own consumer brand. Intel, by contrast, has established one of the most well-known brands on the planet. A recent survey from Interbrand, a brand consulting firm, ranked Intel as the seventh-best global brand, just behind companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald’s. Intel’s brand ranked higher than that of most of its customers, including Apple, Hewlett-Packard and Dell, and higher than Nike and Disney. And no other company that makes only computing components appears on Interbrand’s list of the top 100 brands. “Intel benefited from a unique time and place through the incredible rise of the PC,” said Regis McKenna, a veteran Silicon Valley marketing and strategy expert. “It was able to put its name out there and sort of drive the marketplace, and it took advantage of that.” But in recent weeks, a number of Intel-based products have arrived that make little mention of the company’s presence. Sony, for example, just started championing its Internet TV, a shimmering, flat-screen television with only a white Sony logo amid a sea of black. Sony’s Web site showcasing the new TV points first to the set’s ability to run software from Google and buries a mention of Intel’s chip at the bottom of the page. Similarly, Cisco just released its Umi video conferencing system, which allows consumers to make high-quality calls through their TVs. An Intel-based set-top-box handles the tough work processing video data. When promoting the new system, Cisco executives did not talk about Intel’s helping hand. Such behavior is unheard-of in the PC market, where Intel’s logo appears on the products and in the ads of companies like H.P. and Dell. Intel’s lavish co-marketing deals are well-known in the PC business and have sat at the heart of antitrust lawsuits against the company. Intel has been accused of using co-marketing deals and rebates to keep customers from switching to rival chips. When it comes to TVs, Intel has started an extensive ad campaign that highlights its behind-the-scenes role in a number of products, including the gear from Sony, Google and Boxee. The Intel ads talk about the merits of “smart,” personalized television fueled by a Web connection. “We think, in fact, that there will be a way to make a huge impact on consumers,” Mr. Nucci said. “We’ve given ourselves permission to start with a fresh set of eyes as we started moving into these new spaces instead of just borrowing from the past.” Logitech has also made a device that runs Google’s TV software, and has opted to engrave Intel’s name and the Atom logo on the top of the product. “Intel stands for quality and performance,” said Eric Kintz, a vice president at Logitech. “It is a little early to tell if it will resonate with consumers, but I think there’s some additional value.” Mr. Kintz pointed out that the set-top boxes coming to market resemble full-fledged computers in the amount of work they handle and the software they run. Such traits play to Intel’s strengths in making fast chips and to its reputation with consumers and software developers, Mr. Kintz added. The flurry of sales of the company’s chips in TV and set-top boxes seems to bode well for Intel’s consumer aspirations. The company sold one million chips aimed at smart TVs last quarter, and its only prominent loss was getting shut out of Apple TV. If Intel can string together enough of these deals and establish its technological dominance in the market, it may well be able to extend its brand once again, according to marketing experts. “Certain brands have the permission to do things, and Intel has the permission to have this discussion with consumers,” said Peter Sealey, a former chief marketing officer of Coca-Cola. “It’s only a matter of time until it’s off and running here.” Prepare for the 3.0-gigahertz, Web-ready, Intel Inside toaster.</text></article>

Sprint said the resignations were only to comply with new developments in antitrust laws on director independence and were unrelated to any negotiations Clearwire might be having with potential investors. But the news sent shares of Clearwire up 3 percent as investors bet the resignations would make it easier for Clearwire to do a deal with a company such as Sprint’s rival T-Mobile USA, a venture of Deutsche Telekom. The companies said on Thursday that Dan Hesse, chief executive of Sprint, Clearwire’s majority owner, resigned from the venture’s board on Sept 28 along with Sprint’s strategy chief Keith Cowan and top networks executive Steven Elfman. Reuters continued: The move comes after Clearwire, which needs new funding to continue expanding a network it is building, said last week it was in talks with T-Mobile USA about a potential deal in which the No. 4 US mobile service could invest in Clearwire to rent space on its network at discount rates. “People are interpreting this as paving the way for some kind of additional negotiations with T-Mobile USA, which has been talking to Clearwire and Lightsquared about its 4G wireless strategy,” Watts said. Lightsquared is a private company that is setting itself up as a Clearwire rival. T-Mobile spokesman Andreas Fuchs confirmed T-Mobile USA is looking at different options and that Clearwire was one of them. Clearwire declined comment on speculation related to the resignations but said the decision was made to address legal questions that had originally been raised by Clearwire. The news comes amid speculation about tensions over strategy between Sprint and Clearwire, whose investors include cable providers such as Comcast, and technology companies Intel Corp and Google.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/technology/25hiring.html?ref=intelcorporation">6 Tech Firms Agree To More Hiring Competition<date>Published: September 24, 2010</date><text>The American job market is tough for many workers, but things are looking even better than usual for highly paid engineers and scientists in Silicon Valley. Six leading technology companies, including Apple, Google and Intel, reached an antitrust settlement on Friday with the Justice Department that promises to increase the competition for sought-after technology workers. The government had conducted a yearlong investigation into agreements among companies not to poach employees from each other. The investigation focused on five agreements by the companies not to make cold calls to employees that each company had placed on a do-not-call list. Each of the pacts, according to the Justice Department filing, involved a pair of companies: Apple and Google, Apple and Adobe, Apple and Pixar, Google and Intel, and Google and Intuit. The agreements to curb cold-calling of each others’ workers, the Justice Department complaint said, “diminished competition to the detriment of the affected employees who were likely deprived of competitively important information and access to better job opportunities.” Silicon Valley is among the most flexible and fast-moving labor markets in the world, and job-hopping is commonplace. The movement of workers from company to company facilitates the flow of ideas and generation of products. Agreements that inhibit that movement, antitrust officials said, restrains not only labor but also the pace of innovation. Laws that prohibit restraints on workers go back to the origins of antitrust law, centuries ago, in England, when the “restraint of trade” literally meant “unreasonable restraint” on people practicing their trades — like bakers and blacksmiths. “This shows that the oldest ideas in antitrust still apply to today’s high-tech industries,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a professor of law at Howard University. “These people may be well paid, but this is not an insignificant matter.” Yet Silicon Valley companies both compete and cooperate with each other, to jointly develop new products and services. And a company, analysts say, may be less likely to collaborate on a project if it fears the partner company is intent on hiring away its best employees, thus undermining innovation. In a statement, Google portrayed its agreements against cold-calling employees at other high-technology companies as a temporary program to maintain good relations with other companies at a time it was hiring aggressively. “Google grew by more than 16,000 people between 2005 and 2009 — a fivefold increase in the size of our company,” Google said. Hiring reached a peak of 40 new recruits a day in 2007, it added, when it was also building ties with other technology companies to jointly develop services. “While there’s no evidence that our policy hindered hiring or affected wages, we abandoned our ‘no cold calling’ policy in late 2009 once the Justice Department raised concerns, and we are happy to continue with this approach as part of this settlement,” the company said. Intuit, in a statement, said it had “agreed to disagree” with the Justice Department on the issue of wrongdoing in the case. But Intuit will not “enter into the types of broad nonsolicit agreements that are prohibited by the settlement,” said Laura Fennell, Intuit’s senior vice president and general counsel. Intuit, she said, shared the Justice Department’s desire “to maintain an open, fair, competitive market for talent.”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/technology/20arm.html?ref=intelcorporation">ARM Chips May Spread Into Everyday Items<date>Published: September 19, 2010</date><text>CAMBRIDGE, England — Near the southeastern edge of Cambridge, where this idyllic university town gives way to fields of green, sits the headquarters of ARM Holdings. Neither the modest three-building campus nor its surroundings evoke notions of a thriving hotbed of computing.But ARM, which designs the low-power chips that go into just about every cellphone sold today, commands a prime position when it comes to one of the next major technological revolutions. This is the so-called Internet of Things, when all sorts of everyday objects will have tiny chips placed inside them and gain the ability to process information and talk to the Web. In this post-PC era, some analysts say, Intel’s familiar jingle — bummmm, bum, bum, bum, bum — will fade as the central soundtrack of computing. Instead, people will hear nothing, or rather the understated silence that has accompanied ARM’s rise as one of the most important technology companies. ARM bases its business on licensing chip designs to companies like Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm, which often tweak them to suit their needs. In addition to cellphones, a host of other devices these days run on ARM chips, including TVs from Sony, the Kindle from Amazon and products as varied as hotel door locks, printers, slot machines and cars. “Our customers sell about 4 billion chips a year,” said Warren East, the chief executive of ARM, during a recent interview. Investors appear enthralled by ARM’s business. Over the last year, the company’s shares have nearly tripled, to a close on Friday of $18.34, from a low of $6.52. Rumors have swirled that Apple may acquire ARM, though such a move seems unlikely given ARM’s broad partnership model. “I laughed about it with the folks at Apple,” Mr. East said. “It is completely nonsensical.” The number of ARM chips produced a year, which go into many different products, dwarfs the hundreds of millions of chips sold by Intel, the world’s largest chip maker in terms of revenue. Inevitably, analysts often portray the companies as mortal enemies, dueling for dominance in the chip market. ARM executives play down such a dramatic story line in their typical, low-key fashion. “People want there to be this David and Goliath struggle between us and Intel,” Mr. East said. “It just isn’t that way.” Mr. East and other ARM executives point to the difference in the companies’ business models. Intel designs and manufactures its own PC and computer server products, commanding about $50 to $1,000 for each chip. ARM chips, by contrast, are made by a handful of contract chip manufacturers and cost 65 cents to $20 each. ARM earns pennies or fractions of a penny off each chip through its licensing deals. Last year, ARM’s revenue came in at $490 million, while Intel posted revenue of $35 billion. Still, Mr. East pointed out, the total value of chips sold by ARM’s licensees just about matched those of Intel. “We don’t look like Intel,” he said. “We’re never going to be a $100 billion outfit.” Yet ARM just unveiled new chip designs that could carry its products into servers and networking equipment — Intel’s turf. And Intel, seeing a future dominated by the smaller, cheaper chips that are ARM’s stock in trade, and has started a forceful move into smartphones, TVs and consumer electronics through new lines of low-power chips. “Even conservative estimates predict billions of devices coming online soon,” said Bill Kircos, an Intel spokesman. “That’s a great opportunity for all of us in the chip business.” Mr. Kircos maintained that Intel’s manufacturing strengths would allow it to produce lower-power, cheaper chips at regular intervals, resulting in plenty of competition for ARM and its partners. Intel has partnerships with companies like Nokia, BMW and Google as it looks to expand into new devices. ARM executives agree that the future is with the billions of coming things — cars, refrigerators, TVs, clothes, buildings — that will have full-blown chips or at least Web-ready sensors inside them. In many cases, they say, these things will need the lowest-power chips possible because they will be out in the world and away from a plug. Energy has replaced horsepower as the prime concern, and it is here, ARM executives said, that the company’s skills will really shine. “We evolved under these low-power pressures,” said Krisztian Flautner, a vice president of research at ARM. “It set us on a different evolutionary path.” Since its inception in 1990, ARM has nurtured a low-power religion. The company was spun out of the failing British PC maker Acorn Computers and stumbled upon Apple, which was in the process of making its Newton hand-held device, as an early customer and investor. “Apple and the Newton made the company exist,” said Mike Muller, one of the founders of ARM and its chief technology officer. “The Newton never went anywhere, but it got ARM started and gave us some credibility.” Dealing with hand-held devices and cellphones forced ARM to operate under severe power restrictions. It chased milliwatts, while Intel chased horsepower.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/18/technology/18google.html?ref=intelcorporation">Apple and Google May Settle Antitrust Case on Staff Poaching<date>Published: September 17, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — A number of Silicon Valley companies including Apple, Google and Intel are in advanced negotiations with the Justice Department to avoid facing charges that they violated antitrust laws by agreeing not to poach employees from each other, according to two people briefed on the negotiations. A settlement would end an investigation that began more than a year ago over concerns that such agreements would have the effect of holding down wages. While the talks are in advanced stages, they could still fall apart, as one or more companies may refuse to sign on to a settlement, said the people briefed on the talks, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential. The terms of any proposed settlement could not be learned. The employment market in Silicon Valley is among the most competitive in the country, and job hopping of engineers and other employees among the companies under investigation, which also include Adobe Systems and Intuit, is common. The companies were being investigated over agreements not to recruit each other’s employees. Representatives of Apple, Google, Intel and Intuit all declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Adobe did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. News of the settlement talks was first reported Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The initial Justice Department investigation was broader, involving Microsoft and Yahoo. But both said that they were no longer part of the inquiry. “Last year, following its investigation and detailed review of materials produced by it, Yahoo was advised by the department that it did not intend to bring a case against Yahoo,” May Petry, a Yahoo spokeswoman, said in a statement. A Microsoft spokesman said that the company was not part of the investigation. A settlement would avert a lawsuit that would be risky for all involved. To win its case, the Justice Department would have to show not only that the companies had agreements not to actively recruit each other’s workers, but also that those agreements held down wages. The companies have privately argued that such agreements are necessary to allow them to collaborate without the risk of losing their best employees to one another. But that argument might not have prevailed in court, and a loss could have exposed them to further litigation. The close ties between some of these companies, especially Google and Apple, have been the subject of other antitrust investigations in the last year.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/31/science/31compute.html?ref=intelcorporation">Computer Chips Seem Poised to Shrink Again<date>Published: August 30, 2010</date><text>Scientists at Rice University and Hewlett-Packard are reporting this week that they can overcome a fundamental barrier to the continued rapid miniaturization of computer memory that has been the basis for the consumer electronics revolution.In recent years the limits of physics and finance faced by chip makers had loomed so large that experts feared a slowdown in the pace of miniaturization that would act like a brake on the ability to pack ever more power into ever smaller devices like laptops, smartphones and digital cameras. But the new announcements, along with competing technologies being pursued by companies like IBM and Intel, offer hope that the brake will not be applied any time soon. In one of the two new developments, Rice researchers are reporting in Nano Letters, a journal of the American Chemical Society, that they have succeeded in building reliable small digital switches — an essential part of computer memory — that could shrink to a significantly smaller scale than is possible using conventional methods. More important, the advance is based on silicon oxide, one of the basic building blocks of today’s chip industry, thus easing a move toward commercialization. The scientists said that PrivaTran, a Texas startup company, has made experimental chips using the technique that can store and retrieve information. These chips store only 1,000 bits of data, but if the new technology fulfills the promise its inventors see, single chips that store as much as today’s highest capacity disk drives could be possible in five years. The new method involves filaments as thin as five nanometers in width — thinner than what the industry hopes to achieve by the end of the decade using standard techniques. The initial discovery was made by Jun Yao, a graduate researcher at Rice. Mr. Yao said he stumbled on the switch by accident. Separately, H.P. is to announce on Tuesday that it will enter into a commercial partnership with a major semiconductor company to produce a related technology that also has the potential of pushing computer data storage to astronomical densities in the next decade. H.P. and the Rice scientists are making what are called memristors, or memory resistors, switches that retain information without a source of power. “There are a lot of new technologies pawing for attention,” said Richard Doherty, president of the Envisioneering Group, a consumer electronics market research company in Seaford, N.Y. “When you get down to these scales, you’re talking about the ability to store hundreds of movies on a single chip.” The announcements are significant in part because they indicate that the chip industry may find a way to preserve the validity of Moore’s Law. Formulated in 1965 by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, the law is an observation that the industry has the ability to roughly double the number of transistors that can be printed on a wafer of silicon every 18 months. That has been the basis for vast improvements in technological and economic capacities in the past four and a half decades. But industry consensus had shifted in recent years to a widespread belief that the end of physical progress in shrinking the size modern semiconductors was imminent. Chip makers are now confronted by such severe physical and financial challenges that they are spending $4 billion or more for each new advanced chip-making factory. I.B.M., Intel and other companies are already pursuing a competing technology called phase-change memory, which uses heat to transform a glassy material from an amorphous state to a crystalline one and back. Phase-change memory has been the most promising technology for so-called flash chips, which retain information after power is switched off. The flash memory industry has used a number of approaches to keep up with Moore’s law without having a new technology. But it is as if the industry has been speeding toward a wall, without a way to get over it. To keep up speed on the way to the wall, the industry has begun building three-dimensional chips by stacking circuits on top of one another to increase densities. It has also found ways to get single transistors to store more information. But these methods would not be enough in the long run. The new technology being pursued by H.P. and Rice is thought to be a dark horse by industry powerhouses like Intel, I.B.M., Numonyx and Samsung. Researchers at those competing companies said that the phenomenon exploited by the Rice scientists had been seen in the literature as early as the 1960s. “This is something that I.B.M. studied before and which is still in the research stage,” said Charles Lam, an I.B.M. specialist in semiconductor memories. H.P. has for several years been making claims that its memristor technology can compete with traditional transistors, but the company will report this week that it is now more confident that its technology can compete commercially in the future. In contrast, the Rice advance must still be proved. Acknowledging that researchers must overcome skepticism because silicon oxide has been known as an insulator by the industry until now, Jim Tour, a nanomaterials specialist at Rice said he believed the industry would have to look seriously at the research team’s new approach. “It’s a hard sell, because at first it’s obvious it won’t work,” he said. “But my hope is that this is so simple they will have to put it in their portfolio to explore.”</text></article>

Paul Otellini, the head of Intel, said that more and more devices were connecting to the Internet and that wireless connectivity was a sector where the company saw “growth potential.” The Infineon unit makes chips used in laptops, netbooks and smartphones, including the Apple iPhone, and will strengthen Intel’s lineup of 3G, 4G, Wimax and Wi-Fi cards. Intel expects the deal to close in the first quarter of next year, pending regulatory approvals. Bernd Laux, a research analyst with Cheuvreux in Frankfurt, said the price tag was “fair,” and called the deal “smart and well-timed,” but predicted “the equity market will give Infineon only very brief credit for the disposal.” Infineon rose 9 cents, or 1.88 percent, to €4.65, or $5.91, in morning trading in Frankfurt. For Intel, the deal would give it a powerful foothold in the market for smartphone chips, a segment of the business that is experiencing strong growth, with smartphone sales in the second quarter of 2010 rising 50.5 percent from the same period in 2009, according to the research firm Gartner. Infineon said the wireless unit accounted for about €917 million in earnings — about a third of the company’s revenue — in the last fiscal year. Its sales in the third quarter jumped 38 percent. Intel’s own efforts to build a wireless chip business through its Atom processors have faltered, analysts say. Intel has deals with LG and Nokia to provide wireless chips. Mr. Otellini has been seeking ways to get into this market and diversify the company beyond PC chips. Infineon, based in Neubiberg, Germany, had said this month that it was seeking “a potential transaction” for the wireless chip unit.</text></article>

The deal could be announced as soon as Monday, people involved in the negotiations said, though they cautioned that it was possible that the talks could be delayed or collapse entirely. These people were granted anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks. Intel and Infineon officials could not be immediately reached for comment. For Intel, the deal would give it a powerful foothold in the market for smartphone chips, a segment of the business that is experiencing double-digit annual growth. Infineon’s wireless chip unit reported $1.2 billion in revenue last year. Its sales in the third quarter jumped 38 percent. Intel’s own efforts to build a wireless chip business through its Atom processors have faltered, analysts say. Intel has deals with LG and Nokia to provide wireless chips. Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, has been seeking ways to get into this market and diversify the company beyond PC chips. Infineon, based in Neubiberg, Germany, said this month that it was seeking “a potential transaction” for the wireless chip unit. Intel has also faced antitrust scrutiny in its primary chip business. This month it reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve regulators’ complaints that the company had thwarted the efforts of competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia. Under that settlement, Intel agreed to refrain from a variety of business practices in an effort to resolve accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the market for computer processor and graphics chips.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/28/technology/companies/28chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Cut 3rd-Quarter Sales Estimate<date>Published: August 27, 2010</date><text>The chip maker Intel said Friday that it was cutting its sales forecast for the third quarter, evidence that a sluggish economy was putting a damper on the back-to-school shopping season. Intel is the world’s biggest provider of microprocessors for PCs and a bellwether for the broader technology industry. In a statement Friday, Intel said it was seeing “weaker-than-expected demand for consumer PCs in mature markets,” like the United States and Europe. The warning comes a little more than a month after Intel reported its biggest quarterly profit in a decade. But those results were fueled by a rebound in technology spending at corporations, many of which held off replacing older computers during the recession. Home computer purchases are another matter. Uncertainty about jobs is keeping consumer spending in check. Intel said it now expected revenue of $10.8 billion to $11.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with a previous forecast of $11.2 billion to $12 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected $11.5 billion. Intel is scheduled to report results on Oct. 12 and plans to update its fourth-quarter and full-year outlook then. Intel’s downgrade of its guidance was not entirely a surprise. Many investors simply did not believe that Intel would be able to hit the higher numbers because of signals from other PC industry suppliers that PC sales were collapsing. Those concerns were the main reason Intel’s stock had fallen about 13 percent since Intel issued its original guidance on July 13. After the company released its revised outlook, its shares rose 19 cents, or 1.05 percent, to $18.35. Last week, the PC makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard also raised red flags about what was normally a robust season for sales. Brian T. Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer, said that the back-to-school shopping season had been “a little weaker than we would have expected.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/business/27views.html?ref=intelcorporation">Looking Askance at Acquisitions<date>Published: August 26, 2010</date><text>Looking AskanceAt Acquisitions Conventional wisdom has it that bulging corporate cash balances will bring a spate of acquisitions. Yet many companies announcing deals lately have taken it on the chin from shareholders. That reflects a mood in which cash, caution and skepticism dominate, making expectations of a merger and acquisition boom look overdone. Investors should not necessarily be jumping for joy. Most of the big August transactions — from Intel’s $7.7 billion deal for the security software group McAfee to BHP Billiton’s almost $40 billion hostile bid for the Canadian fertilizer maker the Potash Corporation — are fraught with risk and don’t offer the cost-cutting opportunities investors usually prize. Even so, some of the negative market reactions seem to have gone too far. Take Intel. It is paying a premium of $2.75 billion over McAfee’s market value before the deal was announced. Yet Intel’s value, even after adjusting for the decline in Nasdaq stocks since then, is off some $3.3 billion. McAfee may be a strategic stretch for the chip maker, but it’s hard to see how Intel’s value will suffer beyond what it is paying to gain control. Hewlett-Packard is in a similar position. It outbid rival Dell for 3Par, a data storage business, on Monday, sending its own shares tumbling. Dell then offered more to keep its deal to buy 3Par on track, before H.P. returned with a higher bid after markets closed on Thursday. Even accounting for the Nasdaq’s slide, H.P. is still worth about $1.7 billion less than before it entered the frame for 3Par — about equal to the entire amount it is splashing out on 3Par. Then there’s BHP. The Anglo-Australian mining giant has suffered a drop in stock market value of about $15 billion since news of its bid for Potash emerged. Yet even if it sweetens its offer for the fertilizer group by 15 percent, to around $150 a share, BHP would be paying a premium of only around $11 billion over Potash’s predeal value. Investors may think BHP will end up paying still more. But pricing in an additional $4 billion — theoretically covering a further wasted premium that could take the bid price as high as $180 a share — seems excessive. There are exceptions. Dell’s stock, for example, remains about where it was when the company agreed to its first offer for 3Par. But the broader message seems pretty clear: buyers beware. Joining the Club The South African president, Jacob Zuma, wants to join the BRIC nations. The likely deluge of foreign investment from being a member of this club — Brazil, Russia, India and China — of the biggest fast-growing economies would bring huge benefits. But Mr. Zuma has plenty to prove. The Goldman Sachs-coined BRIC nations have attracted heavy global investment flows. That has sped their growth, although sometimes, as with Russia in 2007, has also produced dangerous bubbles. With 25 percent unemployment and one of the world’s biggest gaps between rich and poor, South Africa would greatly benefit from a similar surge in foreign investment to employ its people and improve their living standards. South Africa is already included in an emerging market grouping known as Civet — Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt and Turkey. South Africa’s economy is too small to fit comfortably among the far larger BRICs. It also lacks the huge natural resource base of Russia or Brazil. However, its literacy rate, at 86 percent, is much higher than India’s and close to China’s. Qualitatively, at least, BRIC membership would therefore seem plausible. But South Africa is not achieving BRIC-like growth rates, and falls well short of The Economist panel’s BRIC projections. To heighten investment and growth, Mr. Zuma needs to improve his country’s investment climate. The potential is there. South Africa rates higher than all four BRICs when it comes to corruption and economic freedom, as concluded respectively by Transparency International and the Heritage Foundation. But Mr. Zuma will need to avoid the temptation to copy the worst failings of the BRICs, like China’s overbearing state apparatus or Russia’s disregard for property rights. Mr. Zuma’s efforts to build closer links with China will be helpful, given its plentiful coffers and thirst for natural resources. But to reduce poverty, South Africa needs investment in manufacturing and services as well. That points to a need for Western-style private sector investors also — and Mr. Zuma should align his policies to welcome them. ROB COX and MARTIN HUTCHINSON</text></article>

Dump Its 3Par Bid for McAfee?<date>August 25, 2010, 5:31 pm</date><text>Sure, Hewlett-Packard appears to have made an aggressive play by trumping Dell‘s bid for 3Par, a data storage company. Indeed, the bidding war seemed to be heating up even further on Wednesday, with Reuters reporting that Dell was getting ready to come back with a higher bid. But an analyst at the 451 Group, a technology investment research firm, has dismissed H.P.’s move as “fairly defensive” and he wonders why the company did not try to steal McAfee away from Intel instead. The analyst, Brenon Daly, notes that H.P. is “already pretty well covered on the storage side” of the computer business, but that it has “a giant hole in its security portfolio” that McAfee, a security software maker, would fill. Mr. Daly offers this argument why H.P. should pursue McAfee instead of 3Par: All in all, looking to derail Dell’s offer for 3PAR appears to be at odds with much of H.P.’s previous strategy and rationale around storage. And while it pursues that deal (cost what it may), H.P. passes on McAfee, a one-of-a-kind security asset that would instantly make it much more competitive with IBM, EMC and Cisco Systems. If H.P. has sincere aspirations about outfitting the next generation of data centers, we might suggest that it needs to actually own its intellectual property (IP) for security. Of course, there is a little matter of money that separates the two target companies. H.P. is offering about $1.6 billion for 3Par, while Intel has agreed to pay about $7.7 billion for McAfee. But Mr. Daly notes that H.P. has been willing to pay heavily for other things it has wanted, and he asks, “Couldn’t the same rationale be used for McAfee?” Go to Report from the 451 Group »</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/business/20views.html?ref=intelcorporation">For Intel, a Merger of Fish and Fowl<date>Published: August 19, 2010</date><text>Intel’s $7.7 billion deal to buy the security firm McAfee is a surprising gamble. Mobile devices are the chip industry’s future, and Intel has fallen behind. It is betting that combining McAfee’s security software with its hardware will give it a leg up. But investors who knocked down Intel’s shares are rightly skeptical the chip maker can pull it off.Theoretically, devices should be safer if a chip company worries about security from the start. Instead of papering over holes with software, the idea is to eliminate more of them at the source. Intel thinks McAfee’s expertise will allow that. Another potential benefit — running the software closer to the silicon, as the jargon goes — could mean it works faster and uses less power. Both are important factors for mobile devices. Yet hardware and software makers are fish and fowl. Few manage to cross the divide successfully. Microsoft’s continued flailing in consumer electronics hardware is a prime example. Integrating Intel’s engineers of intricate devices made in clean rooms with the technicians at McAfee who figure out how hackers break software security seems intuitively problematic. Intel, though, says it has been collaborating closely with McAfee for some time and likes the results. It’s not clear the best way to enhance them is with an acquisition at a 60 percent premium to McAfee’s closing price on Wednesday. A joint venture might have captured many of the benefits with less risk, even if slower and more difficult to arrange. But Intel is now locked into McAfee, when some customers may prefer another company’s software. Moreover, Intel is paying plenty. The median takeover premium in the technology sector over the last decade was 40 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. And Intel investors appear unconvinced, wiping almost $4 billion off the company’s market capitalization on Thursday, though a down day for stocks generally didn’t help. They may worry that a big war chest — more than $18 billion in cash and tradable securities at the end of June — was just burning a hole in Intel’s pocket. Prospects for Potash The Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan in Canada is willing to sell at the right price — and that’s higher than the $39 billion offered by BHP Billiton. A competitive auction is the Canadian company’s best bet to get the fullest price. But the fertilizer group could struggle to get one going. With less than $4 billion of debt, Potash has other options. BHP has lined up syndicated financing to back its bid. The Canadian company could borrow on its own and return cash to investors. But such plans have a mixed record at generating shareholder value. Alternatively, Potash owns about $7.5 billion in minority stakes in several listed overseas companies. If executives believe the market doesn’t fully recognize how bright the future is for its products, it could borrow to buy stakes in more SQM, a fertilizer company in Chile. This might make it that much harder for BHP to swallow its quarry. But the idea of accumulating noncontrolling stakes might not please Potash’s investors. The simplest defense is to convince the market it is worth more. Potash is the biggest and one of the lowest-cost producers in a market with bright prospects. Furthermore, its shares are trading far below their 2008 peak. They closed on Thursday more than 14 percent above BHP’s initial offer price of $130 apiece, suggesting investors believe the story. If it really wants to get top dollar, however, Potash needs a counter bid. There are few obvious candidates, especially given the price tag. Rio Tinto, for instance, is still digesting Alcan. Vale, partly owned by the Brazilian government, could find it difficult with elections looming. A consortium could be another option, but organizing one takes time and BHP is hoping to force a shareholder vote within a few months. Potential Chinese bidders such as Sinofert might be leery of jumping so heavily into a cross-border merger or acquisition — and any bid could create political concern in Canada. Then again, although BHP is promising to run Potash’s mines at full capacity if it buys the company, food and farming are intensely political areas. With a nod from officials at home, a strategic bidder from China or elsewhere just may join the fray. ROBERT CYRAN</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/20/technology/20chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Buys McAfee for More Than $7.6 Billion<date>Published: August 19, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Hoping to accelerate its move into smartphones and consumer electronics, the chip maker Intel has turned to security software and services as a way to separate its products from those of its rivals.On Thursday, Intel paid $7.68 billion to acquire McAfee, one of the leading sellers of antivirus and other computer security software. The companies, both based in Santa Clara, Calif., plan to create tight links between Intel’s chips and McAfee’s security technology. Such ties will be crucial as millions of products, including phones, cars and home appliances, gain more computing horsepower and access to the Web, according to the chief executive at Intel, Paul S. Otellini. “This will better protect Internet users and their devices,” Mr. Otellini told Wall Street analysts. Investors appeared flummoxed by the purchase, Intel’s biggest ever, sending the company’s shares down about 3.5 percent, to $18.90, in afternoon trading. McAfee shares rose 57.07 percent, to $47.01. With the purchase, Intel is spending a huge chunk of the $12.2 billion in cash and short-term investments it had on hand as of last quarter. Analysts expect that other technology companies sitting on large cash hoards, like Microsoft, Apple, Cisco and Google, are primed to make more major acquisitions, though some analysts have urged the companies to give shareholders some of the money in dividends. Analysts doubted that McAfee’s business would have much near-term impact on Intel’s bottom line. Intel’s fortunes are tied to PCs and the computer servers that go into data centers. As such, Intel, with revenue of $35.1 billion in 2009, goes through boom-and-bust cycles as demand waxes and wanes. McAfee, with revenue of $1.93 billion last year, sells a great deal of software on a subscription basis, which can smooth out financial results from quarter to quarter and year to year. “There are no immediate synergies that I can see,” said Stacy A. Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “It is a strategic deal, and it is a pretty rich price for a strategic buy.” Intel will pay $48 a share in cash, a 60 percent premium over McAfee’s Wednesday closing stock price of $29.93. The deal hinges on standard regulatory approvals. Demand for McAfee’s core security products should rise as people look to protect their smartphones, cars and Web-ready products from Internet threats, said David G. DeWalt, the chief executive at McAfee. Consumer electronics products like phones and hand-held gadgets face fewer threats than PCs, although it is expected they will be subjected to the same torments from hackers as they gain access to the Internet. McAfee has 17.7 percent of the market for securing computing devices, trailing the market leader Symantec, which has 36.2 percent, according to the research firm IDC. In the last couple of years, McAfee has gained ground on Symantec by signing a large number of deals with PC makers and Internet service providers to offer its security software to consumers and workers. Intel already builds a number of security hooks into its chips. These tools can help block malicious software from disrupting a computer or give a technician the ability to fix a computer from a remote location. The purchase of McAfee would give Intel access to more security specialists and the ability to hardwire more of these types of tools into its chips. Still, analysts noted that Intel spent plenty to obtain these security skills. “Eventually the software features will get embedded in the hardware,” said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. “So maybe this is an expensive way for Intel to acquire domain expertise.” With its share price stagnant for years, Intel has been hunting for growth outside of the PC and computer server markets. In particular, Intel has decided to go after the smartphone and consumer electronics segments, which are dominated by rival chip designs. Intel’s growth push has been met with resistance, largely because its chips remain more expensive and power-hungry than those of rivals. McAfee will operate as an Intel subsidiary, reporting to Renée J. James, the head of Intel’s software and services group. In an interview, Ms. James declined to provide details on how Intel products would gain an edge over the competition through the McAfee technology. She has led Intel’s transformation into a software powerhouse. Last year, Intel bought Wind River for $884 million, giving it a software maker that played in the consumer electronics and wireless markets. Earlier, Intel purchased Havok, a company that provided software tools to video game makers. Intel and Nokia also work together on the MeeGo operating system for smartphones and other consumer electronics devices, placing the companies in competition with Apple, Google and Microsoft.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/technology/16chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Smooth-Stone Aims to Make Low-Power Chip<date>Published: August 15, 2010</date><text>A group of investors, including companies from the United States, Europe and the United Arab Emirates, has formed in a bid to disrupt one of Intel’s most lucrative franchises.The companies have put $48 million into Smooth-Stone, a start-up based in Austin, Tex., betting that it can modify low-power smartphone chips to run servers, the computers in corporate data centers. If successful, Smooth-Stone would undermine Intel’s server-chip business and offer companies, especially those with vast data centers like Google, Amazon.com, Facebook and Microsoft, enormous energy cost savings. Acknowledging the David vs. Goliath struggle ahead, the company’s name is a nod to David’s weapon. “He approached things in a totally different way,” said Barry Evans, the new venture’s chief executive. “His approach was efficient — one shot.” The risks of taking on Intel run so high that financing for this type of chip start-up has almost completely disappeared. This diverse consortium of companies plans to tackle the titan Intel by spreading the risk. Battery Ventures, Flybridge Capital Partners and Highland Capital Partners represent the traditional venture capitalists behind Smooth-Stone. They have been joined by ARM in Britain, the most prominent designer of smartphone chip technology, and the chip maker Texas Instruments. In an eye-catching move, the Advanced Technology Investment Company, or ATIC, will contribute as well. Based in Abu Dhabi, ATIC has already poured billions of dollars into the chip industry in the last two years. It took over the chip manufacturing business of Intel’s main rival, Advanced Micro Devices, through its majority ownership of GlobalFoundries, which has chip plants throughout the world. “Those of us that are crazy enough to want to continue to invest have been looking for a new model that will make start-up chip investing work,” said Ken Lawler, a general partner at Battery Ventures. “The answer is this collaboration between traditional venture groups and strategic partners.” All of these companies now share a singular focus — power. Or rather, less power. ARM chips operate on less electricity and emit less heat. These attributes could allow companies to cram many more ARM chips in a data center, saving on space and power compared with traditional server chips. Smooth-Stone has set to work modifying the ARM chips found in the most popular smartphones to handle jobs typically done on server computers. Just a few years ago, the technology industry would have considered such a proposal daft. Servers do heavy work running business software and require serious horsepower. As it happens, chips based on Intel’s architecture have such horsepower and tend to run faster than anything else on the market. These chips churn away inside 90 percent of the servers sold every year, leaving 10 percent of the market for specialized chips made to handle mainframe-like operations. But companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon.com and Microsoft buy servers by the thousands as they try to keep up with demand from Internet users. They have found that power consumption, even more than raw horsepower, is their top concern, since their electricity bills swell each time the delivery truck shows up with crates of new servers. And much of the software needed to present a Web page requires far less computing muscle than typical business software. So why rev up a Ferrari when a Prius will do the trick? Mr. Evans, who worked at Intel for almost two decades, said ARM chips have matured to the point where they give certain customers a better balance of cost, performance and power consumption than Intel chips. “The ARM products have their roots in the superhigh-volume cellphone space,” Mr. Evans said. “You have a lot of momentum around software because of that, and the costs of the chips are at that consumer electronics price point.” Historically, Intel’s chips have consumed a great deal of power, and many start-ups have tried to seize on this weakness, primarily in the laptop market. These well-promoted start-ups have tended to burn through large amounts of investment capital only to get clobbered by Intel’s marketing and engineering might. And Intel does not always play fair. The company has paid close to $3 billion in the last 18 months in fines and settlements tied to charges of anticompetitive behavior. Apart from chip design, a major part of Smooth-Stone’s battle for survival will hinge on software. Most software makers write applications specifically for Intel’s chips. They would need to rework their products to run on the ARM chips that have a different architecture. Linley Gwennap, a well-known chip analyst and founder of the Linley Group analyst company, said that Web companies might just be willing to do this extra work if it translated into power savings. Many of these companies, including Google and Facebook, already customize a great deal of their software and release it for anyone to use. “You don’t need these chips to run 18,000 different applications like standard server chips,” Mr. Gwennap said. “You’re talking about specialized applications.” Mr. Gwennap added that Intel can charge higher prices for its chips because of its reputation and dominant position in the market. But a company with a true low-price, low-power alternative could force Intel’s hand. “Intel’s profit margins are vulnerable to a sneak attack from underneath,” Mr. Gwennap said. Another start-up called SeaMicro recently unveiled a server aimed at Web companies that runs on Intel’s Atom chips, which typically go into low-cost laptops and hand-held devices. “Servers absolutely require raw performance, complete software consistency, energy efficiency and unquestionable reliability,” said Nick Knupffer, an Intel spokesman. “Outside of good battery life for single-function cellphones, it’s unclear how well ARM-based chips will do in these key areas." ATIC, backed by oil riches, has demonstrated a willingness to take on Intel even after watching its close partner A.M.D. get trampled time and again. GlobalFoundries, the company majority owned by ATIC, is one of a handful of foundries, or companies that make chips for other companies that design them. Intel is the last mainstream chip maker to both design and manufacture its own products. Chip start-ups could use a friend with deep pockets. The number of venture-backed chip companies in the United States has fallen from 94 in 2000, to 31 in 2005 to just two in 2009, as the cost and complexity of building chips has risen. Analysts expect it will take Smooth-Stone about two years to deliver its new products.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/07/opinion/07sat2.html?ref=intelcorporation">A Worthy Chip Deal<date>Published: August 6, 2010</date><text>It took a long time, but the settlement between the Federal Trade Commission and Intel, the microchip company, on Wednesday stands a reasonably good chance of curtailing the company’s tactics to keep its dominance of the microprocessor market and of bolstering competition and innovation in this vital segment of the economy.The settlement of the suit brought by the F.T.C. in December forbids Intel from rewarding computer makers that use only Intel computer processing chips and punishing those that buy processors from Advanced Micro Devices, its main rival. But the deal extends beyond the market for processing chips — computers’ core building blocks — where Intel has an 80 percent share. It also aims to ensure that powerful graphics processors made by Intel’s rivals can work well with its computer chips, the industry standard. Graphics chips, which can process lots of information at the same time, are at the cutting edge of computing technology. Intel has about 50 percent of the market, but its chips are mostly confined to cheaper PCs and are less technologically advanced than those of rivals, such as Nvidia, that have taken over many tasks from Intel’s chips. The F.T.C. accused Intel of changing processing chips so that rival graphics chips would not run smoothly on them and selling bundles of processing chips and graphics chips below cost to keep rivals out. The agreement forbids these sorts of tactics. And it orders Intel to maintain an access point to its chips — known as a PCI Express Bus — for at least six years to ensure rivals’ processors will be able to work atop Intel’s chips without suffering any diminished performance. The settlement does not compel Intel to license its x86 chip technology so rivals could build their own innovations to work on it. But it aims to ensure competitors reasonable access to Intel’s intellectual property. Rivals like A.M.D., Nvidia and Taiwan’s Via Technologies should be able to outsource the making of their chips — which rely in part on technology licensed from Intel — without fear of Intel suing the manufacturers for patent infringement. If A.M.D. or Via were to merge with another company, Intel would be forced to enter negotiations to extend the licensing agreements to the new entity. A settlement as complex as this one will be difficult to police. Still, the settlement and the increased oversight that comes with it offer a fair chance that Intel won’t be able to suppress competition in the future. The deal gives makers of graphics chips some assurance that their processors will work with the majority of PCs, and could lead to a growing variety of alternative chips. And, after all, lowering barriers to competition and innovation is the ultimate goal of antitrust policy.</text></article>

From its headquarters in a former warehouse in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the company oversees magazines covering youth culture in 23 editions distributed in 26 countries, an online television network and a record label.Vice’s identity — and skill at content creation — is precisely what makes its current partnerships with Dell and Intel both possible and surprising. The deals call for Vice to create sites filled with images, videos and text that evoke a cool-kid image those companies want to connect with, although not necessarily with specific products. It’s an unusual arrangement for a media company. But Shane Smith, a co-founder of Vice, said his pitches to clients usually start simply: “Every company is now a media company.” Getting companies to agree with that sentiment is the easy part, Mr. Smith said, as most are now familiar with the opportunity to get their message out through social media. Much tougher is getting a company to move away from the usual marketing tropes, like 30-second advertisements and online banner ads. That approach is much easier when the target is the so-called millennial generation, those in their late teens to their early 30s, a notoriously tough demographic to reach, and the one that Vice considers to be its core audience. “We have to appreciate that it’s not a passive age group, sitting in front of the TV with ads blaring at them,” said Deborah Conrad, chief marketing officer at Intel, which started talking to Vice a couple of years ago. “We trust that Vice knows their audience.” So last year Intel decided to put its faith in the idea that Vice could produce events and populate a Web site with material that would appeal to that demographic. Intel is not alone in investing in content. In 2009, companies spent $47.2 billion on custom marketing — from magazines to Web sites — according to a survey conducted by the Custom Content Council, an industry group in New York, and ContentWise, a newsletter. “I think a lot of brands are realizing that they have to create content, and when they do it, it works,” said Gene Liebel, a partner in the Brooklyn agency Huge, which is not working with Vice or the two technology companies, though it has worked with Intel previously. The partnership between Intel and Vice includes the creation of a Web site, thecreatorsproject.com, which began in May. Earlier this year, the partnership also began producing events in five cities around the world — New York, London, São Paulo, Seoul and Beijing — that are one part concert, one part art exhibit, one part conference and many parts party, as the doors open in early afternoon and close after midnight. The Intel and Vice logos are present, but subdued. The drinks are free. Still, it’s the Web site, Ms. Conrad said, that’s really the “nerve center” for the partnership. The site says it is meant to “continually identify and celebrate the work of visionary artists.” Each week, it introduces a new short video — often around six minutes long — presenting a profile of one of those artists. Vice decides which artists to consider visionary, and then produces the video. One of them is the musician Alan Palomo, a composer for Neon Indian, a band that relies heavily on electronic sounds made with synthesizers and other technology and who performed at the New York event in late June. In a video on the Creators Project site, Mr. Palomo describes how video games from the 1980s influenced his music and how the band uses projectors at its concerts. And in an interview, he said that he found the Intel connection at the New York event “refreshing,” because it did not seem that the company was selling any product. “It’s like you’re expecting the usual suspects, like a Converse banner,” he said.  The deal with Dell is similar. On motherboard.tv, a site that describes itself as devoted to “sniffing out the smartest, most groundbreaking arbiters and advances of tech-related culture,” Vice oversees the blog posts and videos. Dell’s logo is incorporated into the site’s logo, but the connection is otherwise out of sight. Artists and topics that can connect with a young demographic are valuable assets, said Ian Schafer, chief executive of Deep Focus, an ad agency that has worked with Vice in the past, but is not involved in the Dell or Intel deals. It’s a model, he said, that more media companies may need to consider. “With something as scarce as good and quality content, the price has upward pressure on it,” Mr. Schafer said. “It’s what prevents all of advertising from a race to the bottom.” Neither Vice, Intel nor Dell would discuss the financial terms of their deals. Ms. Conrad and Michael Tatelman, vice president for sales and marketing at Dell, said they knew there was an inherent risk in handing over the content oversight to Vice, whose magazine and Web site have a long history of running occasional nude images. These relationships do not always work out for the best. Last year, Microsoft teamed up with the television show “Family Guy” to promote the Windows 7 operating system. A special commercial-free show was to include references to the Windows 7. But Microsoft executives backed out of the show, reportedly after finding some of the topics distasteful.  “We have values and norms that support our brand,” Mr. Tatelman said. “Vice has been great about staying within those brand tenets.” But at the same time, Ms. Conrad and Mr. Tatelman said the value of working with Vice was the ability to capitalize on the media company’s cachet with the chic crowd. They said that the two sides must find a middle ground that did not tarnish either Vice’s brand or theirs. So far, no interventions have been necessary. And walking that fine line has also allowed the companies to touch the trend-setters, a group usually out of their reach. “It’s so cool, when you think about it for us, to see how people are using technology,” Ms. Conrad said. “You can only get so excited about spreadsheets.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/technology/05chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Settles With F.T.C. on Antitrust Complaint<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Intel agreed to refrain from a host of business practices to settle accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the market for computer processing and graphics chips, under a settlement announced on Wednesday with the Federal Trade Commission. Capping several settlements by Intel, the agreement resolves regulators’ complaints that the company thwarted the efforts of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and other competitors. But it was unclear whether Intel was any worse off for having been charged with flexing its monopoly muscles. The company has thrived in many ways since the actions came to light. The settlement prohibits Intel from paying customers to buy its computer chips exclusively or paying them to reject chips from other manufacturers. It also prohibits Intel from redesigning its chips purely to harm a competitor. Intel agreed not to retaliate against computer makers if they did business with other suppliers. Intel must modify agreements with other makers of computer chips so they are free to merge or form joint ventures without the threat of patent infringement lawsuits from Intel. The company is also required to maintain for at least six years a feature that will not limit the performance of graphics processing chips made by others, and to disclose that its computer compilers might discriminate between its chips and those of other companies, and therefore not might register all of the features of non-Intel chips. The company accepted all the terms of the settlement without admitting that it had committed any anticompetitive acts. The trade commission brought its suit in December, claiming that Intel, the world’s leading maker of computer chips, had illegally used its dominant market position for at least a decade to stifle competition and strengthen its monopoly. The agency has no legal authority to assess fines, although it can bring a civil suit for violations of its settlement order. The settlement requires Intel to establish a $10 million fund to help business customers reformulate their software products if they were misled by Intel. Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the F.T.C., said that the settlement “provides ‘fencing-in’ protection to ensure that Intel doesn’t come up with new ways to undermine competition.” “Just as important, it provides this relief right away, so it helps consumers now, which is critical in a dynamic industry such as this one,” Mr. Leibowitz said. The commission will seek public comment before the settlement is completed. In a statement, Intel’s general counsel, A. Douglas Melamed, said the settlement allowed the company “to put an end to the expense and distraction of the F.T.C. litigation.” “This agreement provides a framework that will allow us to continue to compete and to provide our customers the best possible products at the best prices,” Mr. Melamed said. The agency brought its claims under Section 5 of the F.T.C. Act, a law that is broader than the antitrust laws and that affords Intel a measure of protection against private lawsuits that could subject it to stiff financial penalties. Unlike an antitrust violation, a violation of Section 5 may not be used to establish liability for plaintiffs to seek triple damages in private litigation against the same defendant. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival, settled its own antitrust complaint against Intel in November with Intel agreeing to pay $1.25 billion. Harry Wolin, general counsel at A.M.D., said the company was pleased with the Intel settlement, which should help to level the playing field. “A.M.D.’s critical remaining concern was Intel’s use of all-or-nothing discounts to deny competitors access to the marketplace,” Mr. Wolin said. “The F.T.C.’s order clearly and firmly prohibits such abuse and guarantees ongoing monitoring of Intel’s conduct.” New York State still has litigation pending against Intel. Intel has spent years squaring off against regulators in Asia, Europe and the United States over charges related to anticompetitive practices. Last May, the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion, concluding that it had hampered competition in the market for PC and computer server chips. Most of the previous actions against Intel focused on claims that it had used rebates and other payment programs to keep computer makers and retailers from selling products with A.M.D. chips. From about 2003 to 2006, A.M.D. offered a line of chips that analysts and many computer makers hailed as superior to Intel’s products. Executives from A.M.D. contended that Intel blunted the adoption of these chips through its financial arrangements. The F.T.C.’s complaint trod familiar ground but also raised questions about Intel’s behavior in the graphics chip market, which is dominated by Nvidia and A.M.D. Since the agency filed its complaints, Intel has tempered an effort to enter the market for stand-alone graphics chips that go into home and business computers. Instead, Intel has declared its intention to focus on competing against Nvidia and A.M.D. through a niche chip made to handle scientific and industrial applications. The legal actions against Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., have brought to light many unflattering e-mails exchanged between its top executives and customers. In particular, communications between Intel and Dell have shown executives talking about rebates bestowed on Dell for its decision to abstain from using A.M.D. products. In one such exchange, Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive at Intel, described Dell as “the best friend money can buy.” Last month, Dell paid $100 million to settle accounting fraud charges leveled by the Securities and Exchange Commission tied to the rebates it received from Intel. Intel has recovered well from a severe drop in sales during the heart of the recession and has posted record results in recent quarters. A.M.D. has spent the last couple of years trying to restructure its business and improve its financial performance. The company withdrew from the expensive chip manufacturing business and now concentrates on designing chips.</text></article>

Antitrust Case<date>Published: August 3, 2010</date><text>The Intel Corporation, the world’s largest maker of computer chips, has agreed to settle its antitrust case with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency said Tuesday. The F.T.C. said details of the settlement would be disclosed at a news conference on Wednesday. The commission sued Intel in December, accusing it of using its dominance for a decade to block customers from buying competitors’ products. The commission said Intel had forced computer makers into exclusive deals and blocked rivals from making their chips work with Intel’s. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., accounts for more than 80 percent of global sales of computer chips, dwarfing Advanced Micro Devices, its closest competitor. Intel agreed to pay Advanced Micro Devices $1.25 billion in November to settle a lawsuit by the company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. In May 2009, the European Union fined Intel 1.06 billion euros, or $1.45 billion at the time. In addition to the penalty, Intel was ordered to stop using illegal rebates to thwart competitors.</text></article>

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/business/23dell.html?ref=intelcorporation">Dell to Pay $100 Million to Settle Fraud Case<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Dell, several former executives, and its founder, Michael S. Dell, agreed Thursday to pay more than $100 million in penalties to settle charges of disclosure accounting fraud filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The S.E.C. had accused Dell of misleading investors by using money the company received from the chip maker Intel to pad its quarterly earnings statements. Company executives, according to the S.E.C., relied on the payments from Intel to meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations. Intel paid Dell in the form of rebates as part of an agreement to ensure that Dell would not use computer chips made by Advanced Micro Devices in its personal computers and computer servers, according to the civil charges. Those rebates are the subject of federal and state antitrust inquiries of Intel. When Dell eventually picked A.M.D. as a second supplier, Intel cut the rebates, and Dell’s financial performance suffered, the complaint said. The S.E.C. said in its charges that investors were not aware of the extent of the payments and how they were being used. “Dell manipulated its accounting over an extended period to project financial results that the company wished it had achieved but could not,” said Christopher Conte, associate director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, in a statement announcing the settlement. “Dell was only able to meet Wall Street targets consistently during this period by breaking the rules.” Without the Intel payments, Dell would have missed the consensus estimate for earnings per share published by Wall Street analysts who followed the company in every quarter during its fiscal years from 2002 through 2006. The exclusivity payments constituted a steadily growing part of what Dell reported as its operating earnings, from 10 percent in fiscal 2003 to 38 percent in the fiscal 2006, then jumping to 76 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the S.E.C. said. To settle the S.E.C. charges, which were filed Thursday in Federal District Court here, Dell agreed to pay a $100 million penalty. As is common in S.E.C. settlements, the company did not admit or deny the accusations, and agreed to an order permanently enjoining it from future similar violations. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., announced last month that it had set aside the amount of the penalty for a potential settlement. In 2007, it also had restated its earnings results from 2003, through the first quarter of 2007, to admit manipulating earnings. Mr. Dell, the company’s chairman and chief executive, and Kevin Rollins, the former chief executive, each agreed to pay a $4 million penalty. They did not admit or deny the charges but agreed to an order prohibiting them from violating federal securities laws. Dell’s former chief financial officer, James M. Schneider, agreed to pay a $3 million fine under similar settlement terms, and paid an additional $83,096 in disgorgement and $38,640 in prejudgment interest. Nicholas A. R. Dunning, a former regional vice president for finance, agreed to pay $50,000 in penalties. Leslie L. Jackson, a former assistant controller, agreed to settle charges of improper accounting without admitting or denying guilt and is barred from appearing or practicing before the S.E.C. for three years. The S.E.C. credited the Federal Trade Commission with assistance on the Dell case, a sign that the two agencies shared considerable information about the practices by Intel that are the subject of a pending antitrust lawsuit by the F.T.C. Though that lawsuit is scheduled for trial in September, Intel and the F.T.C. are discussing a settlement, and this week extended the deadline to reach an agreement to Aug. 6. The F.T.C. investigation is one of at least five government antitrust investigations of Intel, including in Europe, Asia and New York State. Intel also was the subject of a private antitrust suit by A.M.D., the Intel competitor that was involved in the case settled on Thursday. In a statement, the presiding director of Dell’s board, Sam Nunn, the former senator from Georgia, said the board “reaffirms its unanimous support for Mr. Dell’s continued leadership.” Mr. Nunn said the settlement “is in the best interest of the company, its customers and its shareholders, as it brings a five-year S.E.C. investigation to closure.” From 2003 through 2007, the payments to Dell from Intel totaled $4.3 billion, the S.E.C. said. Though the payments were said by the two companies to be based on complex pricing assessments, the S.E.C. said detailed schedules drawn up by the companies were “a meaningless exercise” to make the payments appear to be something other than what they were. Although the payments were intended to keep Dell from using computer chips made by A.M.D., according to the S.E.C. charges, in 2003, Dell was in talks with Microsoft, A.M.D. and I.B.M. on a deal that would have had Dell take an ownership interest in A.M.D. During the talks, though, Intel offered to substantially increase its payments to Dell, and Mr. Dell ordered the negotiations with A.M.D. and the other companies to end, the S.E.C. said. Dell frequently sought additional rebates from Intel near the end of the quarter to meet earnings targets, according to the S.E.C. complaint, which also said, “Dell was quite open with Intel about the reasons it was requesting additional money.” When Dell announced in May 2006 that it would use A.M.D. products in its computers, Intel immediately cut its payments by a quarter of a billion dollars, an amount that accounted for three-quarters of the decline in Dell operating profits that period, the S.E.C. said.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/technology/22chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">F.T.C. Wants More Time for Intel Case<date>Published: July 21, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators will take at least two more weeks to work out the details of a proposed agreement with Intel to settle charges that the chip maker violated antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission said late Wednesday that it needed more time to consider and negotiate the proposed settlement, which was first announced last month. The agency brought antitrust charges against Intel last year, accusing the company of using illegal sales tactics to preserve its dominant share of the market for computer chips. The case, which is before an administrative law judge at the trade commission, had been delayed for a month while the two sides tried to reach an agreement. That timeline was set to run out at midnight on Thursday.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/business/15views.html?ref=intelcorporation">Humble Pie for the Concert Beast Live Nation<date>Published: July 14, 2010</date><text>Who’s still afraid of Live Nation? The January merger of America’s leading concert promoter with the dominant ticket seller, Ticketmaster, was supposed to create a dangerously powerful monster in the rock ’n’ roll business. That’s why critics like Bruce Springsteen turned the dial up to 11 on their unsuccessful protests of the deal. But a handful of stumbles — and a decline of as much as 40 percent in the value of the combined group since April — have humbled the music behemoth, which is led by Irving Azoff, who is meeting Thursday with investors at Irving Plaza in Manhattan. Ticket sales for the biggest musical acts, where Live Nation reaps the bulk of its money, have fallen short of expectations. This isn’t simply a reflection of the economy’s broader woes, though the concert industry is suffering. In the first half, the concert trade publication Pollstar estimated that ticket sales for the Top 100 tours fell 17 percent, to a combined gross of $966 million. But as Pollstar noted, “Larger shows are feeling the economic pain more than their smaller counterparts.” Club shows, it said, are still attracting sizable audiences. The worry for Live Nation is that while concert-goers may be avoiding the expensive, highly commercialized events the firm organizes in giant arenas for 40,000 or more fans at a time. There’s evidence of this in the success of some less mainstream productions. For instance, the Electric Daisy Carnival, a two-day electronic music party, drew 185,000 people to the Los Angeles Coliseum. While the event was marred by the death of a teenager, apparently drug-related, its promoters are taking the show to Puerto Rico in August; tickets are $15 and $40 plus service fees. Or there’s this weekend’s Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. Three-day passes, at the low cost of $90, sold out long ago. But the curators of the event at Pitchfork, the musical criticism Web site, said they were determined to cap ticket sales at 18,000 a day to keep the experience low-key, even if that means missing out on profit. On Wednesday, Pitchfork even asked customers needing to sell their tickets to “do the right thing for the music community and only ask for face value” rather than scalping them at a profit. As a big public company, Live Nation can’t do business that way. Concert-goers, fed up with sky-high ticket prices and added Ticketmaster fees, may be starting to understand that. That’s a risk Live Nation’s executives must address at Thursday’s meeting. A Little Optimism A strong economic recovery is beginning. Ask the folks at Intel. The chip maker is smiling because companies “have some breathing room in the economy and their budgets,” said Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive at Intel. Or, maybe it’s the end of a weak recovery. Tom Albanese, chief executive of the mining company Rio Tinto, has noted “fears about a possible double-dip recession” in developed countries and “a slight slowdown” in China. Both chiefs are optimistic for the long term. Why not? If their companies can enrich most of the world’s five billion or so relatively poor people, it will be great news for suppliers of both the most basic raw materials and sophisticated electronic components. But for the next few quarters, investors have much to worry about. Tech companies may be doing better — the Dutch chip equipment maker ASML increased its forecast for 2010 on Wednesday — but the macroeconomic data from the United States and much of Europe remains mediocre. Euro zone industrial production in May, released Wednesday, grew less than expected. Investors are torn. They’ve been optimistic for almost two weeks, but that hardly makes a trend. The improvement in mood came after a pretty bad second quarter. Since last September stocks have been up and down, but have generally made little progress while credit spreads have widened. Financial markets look more fragile than markets for goods, despite nearly the best possible fiscal and monetary support from governments and central banks — or maybe because that support could end. Modest tightening in China is probably hurting asset prices there and in commodity markets. The fear of similar policy moves elsewhere, especially if they come before economic growth is well established, seems to be restraining investors’ exuberance. It would not take much to darken the market’s mood — a misstep from a central bank here, a bit too much deflation there or an unexpected bank problem somewhere else. But for now, liquidity is still ample and there are just enough signs of growth to keep up investors’ spirits. ROB COX and EDWARD HADAS</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/technology/14chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">Saying Demand Was Strong, Intel Tops Forecast<date>Published: July 13, 2010</date><text>That most elusive object of the workplace during the recent recession-racked years, the new personal computer, is being spotted with increased regularity.Some of the best evidence that companies are spending again: on Tuesday, Intel, the world’s largest computer chip maker, reported record sales during its second quarter. The company also predicted that sales in its third quarter would end up far better than expected, as large companies had finally started to buy new PCs. “We see clear signs that the corporate market for PCs is strengthening,” said Stacy J. Smith, the chief financial officer at Intel, during an interview. In the second quarter, ended June 26, Intel’s net income rose to $2.89 billion, or 51 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $398 million, or 7 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago that included charges tied to a fine paid to the European Commission. Intel’s revenue rose 34 percent, to $10.77 billion, from the $8.02 billion reported in the quarter a year ago. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected earnings of 43 cents a share on revenue of $10.25 billion. Shares of Intel jumped 7 percent in after-hours trading. They had ended regular trading Tuesday at $21, up 44 cents, or 2.09 percent. Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, hailed the quarter as the best in Intel’s 42-year history in his remarks to Wall Street analysts. Intel also said it expected revenue in the current quarter of $11.2 billion to $12 billion, surpassing analysts’ forecasts of $10.92 billion. Over the last three years, the dominant companies in the PC industry have faced a constant stream of disappointment as their largest corporate customers put off replacing computers. A generation of faster chips, new software and bigger hard drives came and went with disappointing sales, as the big corporate buyers gave up on their tradition of replacing two-year-old machines. These companies, executives in the technology industry contended, could not survive forever on their old machines. And, at long last, it seems that the technology sector has worn down the resolve of big business. Mr. Smith said that Intel first caught whiffs of corporate interest in PC upgrades about nine months ago and that the signals had grown stronger with each passing quarter. Over the last three months, Intel noted a particular spike in PC sales to large customers and in sales of its computer server chips that go into data centers, Mr. Smith said. “It does seem like the long-awaited upgrade cycle is starting to manifest itself a little bit,” said Michael McConnell, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. In the last 18 months, Intel’s fortunes have undergone a profound shift. The company was one of the first to feel the brunt of the recession and a global clampdown on technology spending. As a result, its sales plummeted at record rates. But it was also one of the first technology companies to benefit from renewed consumer interest in computers, specifically laptops, and its results so far this year have reflected this enthusiasm for new machines. Wall Street analysts, however, have been waiting and waiting for companies sitting on four- and five-year-old computers to begin upgrading their machines as well. Such purchases could provide an even bigger boost to the fortunes of Intel, Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, since businesses tend to buy more expensive computers. “The corporate refresh has been the million-dollar question,” said Stacy A. Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Mr. Rasgon added that investors had been cautious when it came to technology companies because they feared that the economy could experience another slump and that the increased recent demand for technology products would vanish. “People are worried about Europe, austerity measures and whether China will slow down,” he said. Still, analysts said that Intel could withstand some amount of broader economic turmoil better than some of its peers. The company made one of the smoothest transitions in its history to a set of new chip manufacturing plants, allowing it to produce faster chips at a lower cost. In addition, it has seen diverse demand for its laptop, desktop and server chips, which has helped keep its prices up and the plants humming, said Craig A. Ellis, an analyst at Caris &amp; Company. “Intel is executing very well in a wide array of areas,” he said. Intel continues to face investor doubts about its long-term prospects. Executives at Intel have maintained that the PC industry has plenty of life left as a growth market, especially as developing countries begin buying large quantities of computers. Investors, however, have yet to buy into this vision. In addition, there’s skepticism about Intel’s ability to crack new markets like those for chips in smartphones, televisions and electronics. “I think people are really skeptical about their long-term growth,” Mr. Rasgon said. “You sort of have to believe they are a fundamentally different company than they have been over the past 10 years or so,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/opinion/12mon2.html?ref=intelcorporation">Settling With Intel<date>Published: July 11, 2010</date><text>The Federal Trade Commission has an opportunity to reach a settlement in the litigation over Intel’s dominance in the microchip industry, an important sector of the American economy. It has until July 22 to do so. It is crucial that the agency get it right.Merely forcing Intel to stop behavior that has hindered competition in the industry will not do. The F.T.C. must close off Intel’s ability to leverage its near monopoly in C.P.U. chips to foreclose competition in other fast-developing technologies. While the agency cannot foresee every tactic that might smother competition, its objective should be to lower the barriers to entry for new competitors. Such a deal, however, would probably require imposing structural changes, like forcing Intel to license the technology to its x86 chips — the cornerstone of the computer architecture — on reasonable terms so rivals can design processors that will operate smoothly on Intel’s platform. Intel may resist, but there is no point reaching a settlement if it cannot protect future innovation. If the company will not agree to these changes, the F.T.C. should not settle. The F.T.C.’s suit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to Intel’s practices around the world. Antitrust authorities in Japan and South Korea have accused the company of using illegal tactics. The European Commission fined Intel $1.5 billion for abuse of monopoly power. Last year, Intel paid $1.25 billion to its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices to settle charges that it used illegal tactics to shut A.M.D. out of computer markets. But the challenges have mostly been narrow, centered on the C.P.U. market — where Intel has an 80 percent market share. They revolve around its practice of offering rebates and other incentives to reward computer makers that used only Intel chips and punish those that used A.M.D. processors. As part of its settlement with A.M.D., Intel agreed not to use such tactics. The F.T.C. said Intel’s abuses extend to graphics processors, which are faster and can handle more data than standard chips and have been taking over many tasks formerly done by C.P.U.’s. Intel’s graphics chips are technologically behind those of cutting-edge rivals like Nvidia, but have about a 50 percent market share. According to the F.T.C., Intel corrupted its chips so rival processors would not run smoothly with them. It misled Nvidia about technical specs — leading it to waste time and money. It charged more for its C.P.U.’s to computer makers that used rival processors for graphics. Intel should probably commit to some standard of inter-operability or at least guarantee it will not to do anything to degrade the operation of rival processors. But the F.T.C.’s ultimate objective should be to ensure competition that prevails in the computer processor market. In a world in which Intel has four-fifths of the market for the basic building block, the task is to ensure that innovative chip designers have reasonable access to the Intel technology they need for their innovations to work.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/intel-working-on-black-box-for-your-car/?ref=intelcorporation">Intel Working on Black Box for Your Car<date>July 7, 2010, 11:05 am</date><text>Intel’s event recorder, a sort of airplane-style black box for automobiles, is part of its Connected Car research. Bad news for one company may be good news for another. Case in point: Toyota’s woes with recalls and mysterious acceleration problems may turn out to be a boon to tech companies like Intel, which already has its sights set on getting into your next car. At a series of press events last month, Intel demonstrated some of its auto-oriented technologies, including an event recorder, or so-called black box, which Congress is pushing as part of a piece of auto safety legislation inspired by the Toyota unintended acceleration issue. Intel sees such a black box as a natural part of its Connected Car research. To show off how it works, Intel outfitted a Smart Fortwo with WiMax, the 4G wireless system that can provide high-speed data and Internet connections to anything that moves. As part of the system, Intel’s event recorder would be able to record basic telemetry of the vehicle and information like whether the seat belts were being used at the time of an accident, and a whole lot more. “With new vehicles, there will very likely be video cameras inside and outside,” said Intel’s chief technology office, Justin Rattner, in an interview. “It’s not particularly new or stunning, but when you combine the cameras with GPS, you’re geo-tagging the video.” Essentially, the Intel event recorder would record 30 seconds or more of video and know exactly where and when an accident occurred. While Mr. Rattner doesn’t expect the videos to be sent directly to insurance companies, they do make it easier for the police and insurance investigators to reconcile discrepancies in eyewitness accounts. The event recorder would also be tied directly into a car’s existing computer control modules, so that investigators would know when or if the brakes were applied, for example, or if there was some mechanical malfunction. With sophisticated computer vision systems, the event recorder would also be possible to see what a traffic signal indicated at the time of impact or whether the driver ignored an important road sign, like driving the wrong way on an exit ramp. Other applications could also be tied to the connected car, including remote start, the ability to report the position of potholes to local road crews and the ability to send a video of a car thief directly to the owner’s cellphone. But just how much would such a fancy black box cost? Mr. Rattner said reports of such a device increasing a car’s cost by thousands of dollars were unrealistic, even though car event recorders could potentially be more sophisticated than airplane black boxes (which do not record video, for example). “Most of the hardware costs will already be in these vehicles,” said Mr. Rattner, pointing out that drowsy driver warning systems and parking assist packages in luxury cars already deploy several video cameras. Within a few years these are likely to be standard features, with lower costs. “Even in the aftermarket, I would be surprised if it cost more than a decent security system or navigation system in a few years,” he said.

With throngs waiting in lines in the last few days to buy the latest iPhone, I’m thinking: What if we could harness that desperation for new technologies to the desperate need to curb the killing in central Africa? I’ve never reported on a war more barbaric than Congo’s, and it haunts me. In Congo, I’ve seen women who have been mutilated, children who have been forced to eat their parents’ flesh, girls who have been subjected to rapes that destroyed their insides. Warlords finance their predations in part through the sale of mineral ore containing tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold. For example, tantalum from Congo is used to make electrical capacitors that go into phones, computers and gaming devices. Electronics manufacturers have tried to hush all this up. They want you to look at a gadget and think “sleek,” not “blood.” Yet now there’s a grass-roots movement pressuring companies to keep these “conflict minerals” out of high-tech supply chains. Using Facebook and YouTube, activists are harassing companies like Apple, Intel and Research in Motion (which makes the BlackBerry) to get them to lean on their suppliers and ensure the use of, say, Australian tantalum rather than tantalum peddled by a Congolese militia. A humorous new video taunting Apple and PC computers alike goes online this weekend on YouTube, with hopes that it will go viral. Put together by a group of Hollywood actors, it’s a spoof on the famous “I’m a Mac”/”I’m a PC” ad and suggests that both are sometimes built from conflict minerals. “Guess we have some things in common after all,” Mac admits. Protesters demonstrated outside the grand opening of Apple’s new store in Washington, demanding that the company commit to using only clean minerals. Last month, activists blanketed Intel’s Facebook page with calls to support tough legislation to curb trade in conflict minerals. For a time, Intel disabled comments — creating a stink that called more attention to blood minerals than human rights campaigners ever could. Partly as a result, requirements that companies report on their use of conflict minerals were accepted as an amendment to financial reform legislation. A word of background: Eastern Congo is the site of the most lethal conflict since World War II, and is widely described as the rape capital of the world. The war had claimed 5.4 million deaths as of April 2007, with the toll mounting by 45,000 a month, according to a study by the International Rescue Committee. It’s not that American tech companies are responsible for the slaughter, or that eliminating conflict minerals from Americans’ phones will immediately end the war. Even the Enough Project, an anti-genocide organization that has been a leading force in the current campaign, estimates that only one-fifth of the world’s tantalum comes from Congo. “There’s no magic-bullet solution to peace in Congo,” notes David Sullivan of the Enough Project, “but this is one of the drivers of the conflict.” The economics of the war should be addressed to resolve it. The Obama administration also should put more pressure on Rwanda to play a constructive role next door in Congo (it has, inexcusably, backed one militia and bolstered others by dealing extensively in the conflict minerals trade). Impeding trade in conflict minerals is also a piece of the Congo puzzle, and because of public pressure, a group of companies led by Intel and Motorola is now developing a process to audit origins of tantalum in supply chains. Manufacturers previously settled for statements from suppliers that they do not source in eastern Congo, with no verification. Auditing the supply chains at smelters to determine whether minerals are clean or bloody would add about a penny to the price of a cellphone, according to the Enough Project, which says the figure originated with the industry. “Apple is claiming that their products don’t contain conflict minerals because their suppliers say so,” said Jonathan Hutson, of the Enough Project. “People are saying that answer is not good enough. That’s why there’s this grass-roots movement, so that we as consumers can choose to buy conflict free.” Some ideas about what consumers can do are at raisehopeforCongo.org — starting with spreading the word. We may be able to undercut some of the world’s most brutal militias simply by making it clear to electronics manufacturers that we don’t want our beloved gadgets to enrich sadistic gunmen. No phone or tablet computer can be considered “cool” if it may be helping perpetuate one of the most brutal wars on the planet.</text></article>

Dell, engaged in financial irregularities related to the company’s dealings with Intel. The company said that any settlement would not bar Mr. Dell’s service as an officer and director of a public company, and would be made without admitting or denying the agency’s allegations. The disclosure that the S.E.C. has been investigating aspects of the relationship between the two companies is new, as is its focus on Mr. Dell. A person briefed on the case, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential, said that the S.E.C.’s allegations related to how Dell accounted for payments and rebates that it had received from Intel. The allegations are not criminal. Dell also said that it had set aside $100 million for a possible settlement of these allegations, as well a separate long-standing investigation by the S.E.C. into its accounting practices. That investigation, which began in 2005 and became formal in 2006, has already led to admissions of misconduct by Dell and prompted the computer maker to restate financial results from 2003 to the first quarter of 2007. “We are hopeful that these settlement discussions will achieve a comprehensive resolution in the near future,” Sam Nunn, director of Dell’s board said in a news release and a former United States senator. As to Mr. Dell’s standing with the board’s independent directors. Mr. Nunn said, “He continues to have our complete confidence and support.” The relationship between Dell and Intel had already come under scrutiny in an antitrust lawsuit filed in November by Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, against Intel. In that suit, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, was accused of using rebates and co-marketing arrangements as bribes to persuade Dell and other manufacturers to use its products in computers and servers rather than switching to lower-cost chips from its rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Intel has denied the allegations. Intel declined to comment. Dell declined to comment beyond its news release. A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Nester, also declined to comment. The company said that Mr. Dell’s settlement with the S.E.C. would relate to the “company’s disclosures and alleged omissions” and “would involve alleged violations of negligence-based fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as other nonfraud-based provisions.” Dell also said that it would record a $100 million liability for the settlement of its long-standing accounting problems. As a result, it will reduce its net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 by the same amount, or 5 cents a share. Dell’s shares dropped about 2 percent in after-hours trading following the company’s disclosure. But analysts said the news of a possible settlement should be seen as positive by investors. Since Dell’s troubles with the S.E.C. began in 2005, the company stock has lost about two-thirds of its value. “We didn’t know much about the S.E.C. investigation,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “I view this as good news. Uncertainty has been taken off the table, and a $100 million fine is nothing for investors.” Dell had nearly $11 billion in cash and short-term investments as of April 30. Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit against Intel revealed e-mail messages between Mr. Dell and Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, in which Mr. Dell complained of losing business to rivals using A.M.D. chips. In those conversations, Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $1 billion in the last year and said that was “more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues.” According to the suit, Dell delayed buying chips from A.M.D. and Mr. Otellini later wrote an e-mail message to a colleague describing Dell as “the best friend money can buy.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/technology/21google.html?ref=intelcorporation">Calling on Sony and Others, Google Makes a TV Move<date>Published: May 20, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Google recruited a solid lineup of high-tech companies on Thursday to help it introduce Google TV, a new service that merges the predictable world of television programming with the more chaotic expanse of the Web.Now it has to persuade the TV audience to turn the living room television into the newest on-ramp to the Internet. Google TV, which the company introduced at its annual developer conference here, lets people visit any Web site from their televisions and easily search for programs and Web video without scrolling through unwieldy on-screen TV directories. The service will be built into high-definition TVs and Blu-ray players made by Sony and a set-top box made by Logitech, which also makes PC peripherals like keyboards. It is powered by Google’s Android software, originally developed for smartphones. The devices will go on sale in the fall. The effort is likely to face formidable challenges. Google must persuade television manufacturers other than Sony to use its software, and retailers other than the electronics chain Best Buy to sell the devices. And consumers have demonstrated little interest, so far, in connecting to the Web through their TVs. What they have shown is price sensitivity, and the high-powered Intel Atom chips that will be at the heart of devices running Google TV are likely to add to their cost. Intel has spent billions of dollars developing those chips over the last few years in a high-stakes push to crack the market for consumer electronics. The companies declined to discuss prices. Howard Stringer, chief executive of Sony, the third-largest maker of flat-panel televisions in the United States market, appeared on Google’s stage to say Sony would build Google’s software into a high-definition television called the Sony Internet TV, as well as a Blu-ray player. He also said Sony was likely to gradually adopt Google’s software, which he cited as more robust and comprehensive than the company’s own Bravia Internet service, for its other Internet-connected TVs. Mr. Stringer was joined on the stage by the chief executives of Best Buy, Adobe, Intel, Dish Networks and Logitech, where they were interviewed about their plans by Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive. Mr. Schmidt said that people had been talking about bringing the Web to the TV for two decades. “It’s much harder to marry a 50-year-old technology and a brand-new technology than those of us from the brand-new technology industry thought,” he said. Devices running Google TV will also be able to run applications written for Android phones and will feature Google’s Chrome Web browser. Logitech’s set-top box will allow people to receive Google TV without having to buy a new television set. The company said it was also working on keyboard-equipped remote controls and peripherals to allow people to surf the Web from the couch Many companies have already tried to bridge the gap between the television and the Web. TiVo, Boxee, Roku and Vudu, now a division of Wal-Mart, all make devices that offer a variety of Internet video on the television. All have struggled to gain broad adoption, in part because most consumers do not want to hook another set-top box to their TVs. Roku has sold more than 500,000 set-top boxes, but its sales took off only when the price sank below $100, said Anthony Wood, the company’s chief executive. Noting the premium prices that devices running Google TV would probably sell for, Mr. Wood said, “I don’t think it’s a threat as it is today, but certainly over time Google is going to get market share.” Television manufacturers already sell so-called connected TVs with limited Internet ability, which in some cases is provided by a Google rival, Yahoo. Such models are likely to make up a quarter of all televisions sold this year, according to analysts. But many consumers do not even know they are buying that feature and usually make their shopping decisions based on the size and appearance of the set. If Google’s effort is successful, it could create problems for traditional cable companies, as more people could look to the wealth of content on the Internet and bypass their cable provider’s profitable video-on-demand offerings. “The video-on-demand experience has always been antiquated at best,” said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG, a financial services firm. Google TV and similar efforts “put pressure squarely on cable operators and anyone in the business of distributing video content to improve their user experience.” Google did not talk about its advertising strategy for Google TV, but it could use its formidable data-collection abilities to aim new types of ads at television-watching consumers. The company said users would have control over what information was shared with advertisers. One advantage Google believes it has in courting other television manufacturers is the success of its Android platform for mobile phones — and the fact that TV makers like LG Electronics and Samsung already sell phones running Android. On Thursday, Google said that 100,000 new Android phones were activated every day, up from 60,000 in April — second in the industry only to phones from Research In Motion. Google executives promoted the notion that Google seemed to have already surpassed its rival Apple in this respect, although Apple still has a far larger base of devices running the iPhone operating system. It recently reported that it had shipped 85 million iPhones and iPod Touches, and more than a million iPad tablet computers. Apple could invest more in the TV business soon. It sells an Apple TV set-top box, which it deems a hobby and which most analysts view as a lackluster product. It would now make sense for Apple to update that product, adding a Blu-ray player, for example. Or Apple could offer its iTunes service to other set-top box and TV makers, or manufacture its own flat-panel television that links to iTunes. “Google TV is more than anything finally going to create some energy over at Apple to make a television, or at least a version of the iPad that docks with a TV,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. In an interview, Vic Gundotra, vice president for engineering at Google, used the momentum of Android, a free open-source platform with few rules governing its use, to draw a sharp distinction with the control Apple exerts over devices running the iPhone operating system. “If you believe that the only way to get a good smartphone is to bet on one man, one device, one carrier and one choice, that is a different model than we believe in,” Mr. Gundotra said. “We believe innovation doesn’t come from one man; it comes from all of us.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/dining/14sfdine.html?ref=intelcorporation">A High-Tech Mogul’s Low-Tech Wine Trail<date>Published: May 13, 2010</date><text>Some have grumbled that Silicon Valley moguls have helped turn the Napa Valley from an agricultural paradise into a winery theme park.But the captains of high tech have also created some amenities that nobody could complain about. Take the planned Vine Trail, a 44-mile hike-and-bike path between the ferry terminal in Vallejo and Calistoga, at the top of the valley. One month ago, in Yountville, ground was broken on its first dedicated mile. “From our viewpoint,” said Lou Penning of the Napa County Bicycle Coalition, “I think it’s the greatest thing to ever come along.” Mr. Penning lauded the path for providing a practical alternative for cyclists wary of Napa’s two main roads, one a busy highway. There’s also tourist appeal. For someone like me, who whizzes around San Francisco on a bicycle daily, the thought of putting my ride on a boat and disembarking at Vallejo for a day of cruising through vineyards is intoxicating, the fear of bridge traffic just a breeze in my hair. The Vine Trail is taking off thanks in large part to the leadership of Chuck McMinn of Vineyard 29, who spent 25 years in Silicon Valley at Intel and running start-ups. Mr. McMinn first came to Napa 10 years ago looking for a weekend house, but quickly recognized that he could live there full time as long as he had a project to occupy him. “I was 48, not ready to retire,” he said. “I hate playing golf. I needed something else to do.” “At the end of the day, I’m a start-up junkie,” he continued. “I just love to start with a blank sheet of paper and end up with something.” So he jumped headfirst into the wine industry, leveraging his high-tech skill and start-up fearlessness to build a gravity-flow winery with microturbine technology allowing it to generate its own electricity with extreme efficiency. The required technical complexity and capital outlay would intimidate most winery owners, but it’s second nature to a former semiconductor producer. Vineyard 29 became one of the hottest high-end wine brands. But waiting for grapes to ripen didn’t keep Mr. McMinn busy enough. While he claims to appreciate that the wine business is hectic only once a year (during harvest), he can’t quite shake the Silicon Valley mentality that “if you’re not working 20 hours a day, somebody’s running past you.” So, he began to pick up philanthropic projects like the Vine Trail. It turned out that Mr. McMinn’s vision and expertise were the exact requirements to build the low-tech Vine Trail, which Mr. McMinn hopes to see finished within 10 years. “People have been talking about this for many years, but now we finally have the leader who’s pulling everyone together to make it happen,” said Linda Reiff of the Napa Valley Vintners, one of the 19 groups that Mr. McMinn has gotten to sign off on the project. Others include the Napa Farm Bureau, the Sierra Club and the Napa Bicycle Coalition, whose staff members have all contributed to the “thousands of volunteer hours that have gone into this so far,” Ms. Reiff said. While it might seem that navigating the forest of property rights would be the Vine Trail’s biggest challenge, financing is the larger issue. This year’s mile was paid for with federal stimulus money, while the rest will require state and local money as well as the 20 to 30 percent that Mr. McMinn wants to raise philanthropically. The total bill is around $45 million, or about a million a mile. It seems like a lot, but Mr. McMinn points out that it is comparable to the price of a proposed highway interchange south of the town of Napa. Biking and walking trails are “definitely underfunded” relative to the frequency of use, Mr. McMinn said. This from a guy who didn’t even own a bicycle until the Vine Trail board gave him one last Christmas. And the Vine Trail is but one of three nonprofit projects Mr. McMinn works with. He makes pretty good wine, too. Vineyard 29’s are cult wines, selling for hundreds of dollars a bottle. But Mr. McMinn is particularly excited about a more recent project, Cru, a delicious cabernet sauvignon blend made from fruit bought from vineyards throughout the valley. At the relatively low price (for Napa) of $54 a bottle, it aims to provide a taste of Vineyard 29’s expertise for a wider audience. “Both in price and taste, it’s about accessibility,” he said. “Compared to our other wines, it’s a little more rustic, but still very smooth and easygoing.” Just like a good bike trail.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/business/18digi.html?ref=intelcorporation">Two Billion Laptops? It May Not Be Enough<date>Published: April 17, 2010</date><text>ONE LAPTOP PER CHILD is a nonprofit group that thinks big. Since 2007, it has sold inexpensive but rugged laptop computers to the governments of less-developed countries. The goal is to equip each of the two billion children in the developing world with his or her own computer.It’s been slow going. About 1.6 million of the group’s laptops have been distributed to date, said Matt Keller, vice president for global advocacy at the O.L.P.C. Foundation, based in Cambridge, Mass. Today, the largest concentrations are in Uruguay, at around 400,000, and Peru, at 280,000, followed by Rwanda (110,000) and Haiti and Mongolia (15,000 each). In 2006, the O.L.P.C. Web site pitched its laptop as a technology that “could revolutionize how we educate the world’s children.” Today, the “R” word is gone. Now the site speaks in more muted language of “developing an essential resource — educated, empowered children.” “The biggest obstacle to our spreading the dream is cost,” Mr. Keller said. Ninety percent of the machines have been paid for by the recipient countries’ governments, whose resources are extremely limited. I asked Mr. Keller if project leaders had reconsidered the “per child” part of the program. “One Laptop Per Classroom” certainly doesn’t have the same ring, to be sure, but it would better diffuse the benefits in the short term, helping a greater share of those almost two billion children who have not been reached. He said that such a change was out of the question. “One-on-one, child-to-laptop — the interactive nature of that experience is the heart of what we do,” he said. When a child owns a laptop, he added, the school day is effectively extended from a few hours to 12 to 14 hours — however long the child is awake, and wherever he or she happens to be. Some Microsoft researchers in India have investigated how to give those same children better use of PCs that are already in place, even though one machine is shared by many. In one project, Microsoft’s programmers developed software that added multiple cursors on the screen, each controlled by a separate mouse. Software written for the paradigm allows students to compete or collaborate on multiple-choice questions. It was well received in schools, and Microsoft turned it into a free product called MultiPoint. “We jokingly call it ‘One Mouse Per Child,’ ” said Kentaro Toyama, who led the project while he spent five years in the Technology for Emerging Markets group at Microsoft Research India. Mr. Toyama, who received a computer-science doctorate at Yale, left Microsoft last December and is now a research fellow at the School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley. He has been giving talks at American universities about the “technological utopianism” that he sees in initiatives like One Laptop Per Child, Intel’s Classmate PC, and even MultiPoint. He says such initiatives rest upon a myth that “technology is the bottleneck in developing countries.” Lots of other things are bottlenecks, too, he says — including institutional limitations, economics, the basic service infrastructure and politics. Nor is technology synonymous with education. “Initially, we had the idea that PCs could make up for teacher absenteeism or poor training,” he said. “But studies of PCs in schools are mixed, at best. Most show that a good school with good teachers can do positive things with PCs, but that PCs don’t fix bad schools.” Describing technological utopianism, he said, “What it comes down to is this: Everybody is looking for a shortcut.” Mr. Keller said of Mr. Toyama’s remarks: “There is no silver bullet, he’s right.” But Mr. Keller argued that literacy skills and access to information were prerequisites for economic and political growth and that “technology can help foster these things.” Among the infrastructure problems that the Microsoft research team saw in rural India was unreliable electrical power. It spurred another Microsoft research project that provided farmers in one district with cellphones that supplied the same information via text messaging that the farmers had obtained from PC centers. Many O.L.P.C. laptops are equipped with solar panels that can recharge the machine in three hours, providing four to six hours of use. Mr. Keller said a new model would be introduced early next year that would demand much less power. The new machines will have cranks and charge quickly: a minute of cranking will yield 10 minutes of use. MR. KELLER has some moving stories to tell about his visits to villages that have received laptops — and about the natural facility with computers of children everywhere. “I’ve been in Rwanda where the laptop was introduced into an environment where previously there had been no electronic devices,” he said, “and within three to four days you have 10-year-old girls and 8-year-old boys who are using the laptop as efficiently and effectively and creatively as I can.” He is now lobbying to secure funding from the United States government to provide an Internet-connected laptop for every child in Afghanistan. At a cost of $250 a laptop, the project would cost about $750 million. In Kabul, Mr. Keller said, Afghanistan’s education minister told him that the project “would allow girls to study and connect within the safety of their own homes.” It’s an almost irresistible vision. But a skeptic would point to the lessons of history and say that technology never works in isolation.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/technology/15computer.html?ref=intelcorporation">PC Sales Are on Course for Big Increase in 2010<date>Published: April 14, 2010</date><text>The personal computer was beginning to look like yesteryear’s gizmo, a technology relic overshadowed by smartphones, e-readers and, lately, Apple’s iPad. But the old beige box has proved remarkably resilient and relevant.The PC industry shrugged off the recession last year to post a surprising rise in worldwide computer sales. In a sign of the vibrancy of the market, companies like Google and Nokia — not traditionally makers of PCs — have jumped into the competition; Google is developing an operating system to compete with Microsoft’s Windows, and Nokia now sells a laptop. Meanwhile, the early indicators for this year show PC sales surging. On Tuesday, Intel, the world’s largest PC chip maker, reported the highest first-quarter sales, $10.3 billion, and profit, $2.4 billion, in its history. After digesting Intel’s results, a number of Wall Street analysts said on Wednesday that the PC market could grow as much as 25 percent this year. Also on Wednesday, the research firm Gartner said worldwide PC shipments climbed by 27.4 percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, surpassing expectations by more than 5 percent. While experts engage in a fierce debate about the health of the overall economy, the technology sector has marched on in recovery mode. Intel, as a major supplier, tends to provide an early glimpse into the overall health of the sector and with its latest results has posted sales figures that surpass pre-recession levels. Consumers have led the PC charge through their fondness for netbooks, the cheap, tiny laptops that were introduced about three years ago. Rather than eating into laptop sales, these devices have attracted consumers to a new category of complementary computers. And now Apple, with its iPad, and other companies are seeking to lure even more buyers with their interpretations on a thinner, lighter computer. Intel officials attributed the first-quarter results to record purchases of laptop chips and of more expensive, faster chips. At the same time, they said, large corporations, many of which have four-year-old computers, have finally started upgrading their aging machines. “We are seeing signs of life in the corporate market,” said Stacy J. Smith, the chief financial officer at Intel, during an interview. Last April, Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive at Intel, proclaimed that the PC industry had hit bottom in early 2009, and would recover throughout the year. With sales across the technology sector at record lows and the worldwide economy mired in a slump, Mr. Otellini’s optimism was questioned as premature. Just one month earlier, Gartner had forecast that PC sales would fall by 12 percent in 2009, which would have been their steepest decline in history. Ultimately, global PC sales rose more than 5 percent in 2009. The PC market’s relative health stood in contrast to depressed markets for cars, cellphones, televisions and other goods used by people on a daily basis. Even on tight budgets, consumers continued to buy laptops in large quantities and flocked to netbooks, which accounted for more than one-fifth of laptop sales in regions like Europe. Companies like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft make less money from the low-cost netbooks, but the devices have kept shipment numbers high by creating a new niche for computers. About 95 percent of people buy netbooks as an additional computer rather than as a laptop replacement, according to Intel’s surveys of its customers. Companies like Apple, H.P. and Nokia want to use trimmed-down, specialized versions of laptops as a way to offer people access to their content and software services, creating a deeper customer relationships. “The hardware is a type of Trojan horse to give these companies access to consumers and their wallets,” said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. In addition to Google’s expected release of its PC operating system and Nokia’s laptop, both companies are also preparing competitors to the iPad, according to people who have been briefed on the companies’ plans but are not authorized to speak publicly about them. It remains difficult, however, to draw any conclusions about the vibrancy of the PC market and the overall economy, some analysts say. Roger L. Kay, a longtime PC industry analyst, said that in the 1990s, computers were often viewed as a leading indicator for the economy’s behavior. “Corporations would buy them to invest in higher productivity in the future,” he said. But he warned that it was difficult in the previous decade to connect the health of the PC market to the health of the broader economy. PC sales, he said, “have slipped from leading to concurrent indicators.” Mr. Smith from Intel said PCs had become such crucial devices to everyday life that they could withstand the gyrations of the economy better than most products and seemed to recover early. “The telling data point is one from last year when the PC market bottomed out and then recovered quickly in comparison to things like TVs, cars and washing machines,” Mr. Smith said. “I can only take away that at least in this downturn, PCs were a leading indicator.” Mr. Smith’s son learned about his father’s lofty view of the PC’s importance the hard way. “Over the last decade, the PC has gone from an interesting device to a necessary device,” he said. “When I want to ground my son, I take away his PC for the night, not his TV.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/technology/14chip.html?ref=intelcorporation">High-End Demand Gives Intel a Lift<date>Published: April 13, 2010</date><text>The Intel Corporation said on Tuesday that its net income in the first quarter nearly quadrupled over last year and reflected an overall bump in business spending on technology.Among other things, Intel was lifted by sales of new chips for computer servers — the kind of purchase that many companies delayed in the recession. And Intel’s chief financial officer, Stacy J. Smith, said in an interview that demand for processors for higher-end laptops was stronger than expected as corporations upgraded their workers’ computers. That is a change from the last few quarters, when Intel’s growth was largely driven by consumer demand for netbooks, stripped-down laptops used mostly for surfing the Internet. Chips for those machines are less profitable than chips for regular laptops. Mr. Smith also said the company expected to hire about 1,000 people this year. Intel currently has 79,900 employees, down from 82,500 a year ago. Intel became the first major technology company to report earnings for the first quarter when it said after the market closed Tuesday that it earned $2.4 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the first three months of 2010. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting profit of 38 cents a share. In the same period last year, Intel earned $629 million, or 11 cents a share. At the time, Intel was muddling through the recession, but the chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, predicted that personal computer sales had “bottomed out” — an early forecast that proved true. Intel’s revenue in the latest period rose 44 percent, to $10.3 billion, ahead of analysts’ forecast for $9.8 billion. The company also raised its forecast for its gross profit margin, an important performance measurement. Intel now predicts a margin of 62 to 66 percent of revenue in 2010, up from its previous forecast of 58 to 64 percent of revenue. Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., posted its results after the close of market trading. In after-hours trading, its stock rose 89 cents, or 4 percent, to $23.66 a share. Intel’s numbers could be an early preview of a healthy quarter for the technology industry, because many kinds of suppliers would benefit if large companies were beginning to spend more money on computers and other equipment after freezing their budgets during the recession. Worldwide information technology spending is expected to rise more than 5 percent in 2010, after falling 1 percent in 2009, according to the market research firm Gartner.</text></article>

Because when you mix all of these energetic, high-aspiring people with a democratic system and free markets, magic happens. If we hope to keep that magic, we need immigration reform that guarantees that we will always attract and retain, in an orderly fashion, the world’s first-round aspirational and intellectual draft choices. This isn’t complicated. In today’s wired world, the most important economic competition is no longer between countries or companies. The most important economic competition is actually between you and your own imagination.

I can get a factory in China to produce a prototype. I can get a factory in Vietnam to mass manufacture it. I can use Amazon.com to handle fulfillment.

Before the dinner started, each contestant stood by a storyboard explaining their specific project. Namrata Anand, a 17-year-old from the Harker School in California, patiently explained to me her research, which used spectral analysis and other data to expose information about the chemical enrichment history of “Andromeda Galaxy.” I did not understand a word she said, but I sure caught the gleam in her eye. My favorite chat, though, was with Amanda Alonzo, a 30-year-old biology teacher at Lynbrook High School in San Jose, Calif. She had taught two of the finalists.

And finally, with great drama, the overall winner of the $100,000 award for the best project of the 40 is identified.

The move is an effort by Google and Intel to extend their dominance of computing to television, an arena where they have little sway. For Sony, which has struggled to retain a pricing and technological advantage in the competitive TV hardware market, the partnership is an effort to get a leg up on competitors. The partners envision technology that will make it as easy for TV users to navigate Web applications, like the Twitter social network and the Picasa photo site, as it is to change the channel. Some existing televisions and set-top boxes offer access to Web content, but the choice of sites is limited. Google intends to open its TV platform, which is based on its Android operating system for smartphones, to software developers. The company hopes the move will spur the same outpouring of creativity that consumers have seen in applications for cellphones. Google is expected to deliver a toolkit to outside programmers within the next couple of months, and products based on the software could appear as soon as this summer. The three companies have tapped Logitech, which specializes in remote controls and computer speakers, for peripheral devices, including a remote with a tiny keyboard. The project, which has been under way for several months, was described by people with knowledge of it. They requested anonymity because the partners were not allowed to speak publicly at this point, and details remained under negotiation. Spokesmen for Google, Intel and Logitech declined to comment. A Sony spokesman said he was not familiar with the project. The companies appear to be hiring for Android-related jobs. Intel, for example, has listed jobs for senior application engineers with Android programming experience who can help extend Intel's technology ''from PC screen to mobile screen and TV screen.'' Logitech also has several job listings for Android developers, including a position for an ''embedded software engineer'' with experience building ''audio and video products based on the Android platform.'' Jacob Hsu, chief executive of Symbio, a contract engineering firm that does work for consumer electronics companies, said there was rising interest in set-top box technology among the traditional computing players. ''The boxes are just getting more and more powerful, so there's more you can do with them,'' he said. For Google, the project is a pre-emptive move to get a foothold in the living room as more consumers start exploring ways to bring Web content to their television sets. Google wants to aggressively ensure that its services, in particular its search and advertising systems, play a central role. ''Google wants to be everywhere the Internet is so they can put ads there,'' said one of the people with knowledge of the project. Based on Google's Android operating system, the TV technology runs on Intel's Atom chips. Google has built a prototype set-top box, but the technology may be incorporated directly into TVs or other devices. The Google TV software will present users with a new interface for TVs that lets them perform Internet functions like search while also pulling down Web programming like YouTube videos or TV shows from Hulu.com. The technology will also allow downloadable Web applications, like games and social networks, to run on the devices. A person with knowledge of the project said that Google TV would use a version of Google's Chrome Web browser, which currently does not work on Android phones. Google's efforts to break into television advertising date back three years. Through a program called Google TV Ads, the company sells advertising on a handful of satellite and small cable television systems, as well as some cable networks. Google says thousands of advertisers have signed up for the program, but analysts say they believe the amount of revenue generated is too small to have a significant impact on Google's overall business.</text></article>

But Mark R. Pinto is moving in the opposite direction.Mr. Pinto is the first chief technology officer of a major American tech company to move to China. The company, Applied Materials, is one of Silicon Valley’s most prominent firms. It supplied equipment used to perfect the first computer chips. Today, it is the world’s biggest supplier of the equipment used to make semiconductors, solar panels and flat-panel displays. In addition to moving Mr. Pinto and his family to Beijing in January, Applied Materials, whose headquarters are in Santa Clara, Calif., has just built its newest and largest research labs here. Last week, it even held its annual shareholders’ meeting in Xi’an. It is hardly alone. Companies — and their engineers — are being drawn here more and more as China develops a high-tech economy that increasingly competes directly with the United States. A few American companies are even making deals with Chinese companies to license Chinese technology. The Chinese market is surging for electricity, cars and much more, and companies are concluding that their researchers need to be close to factories and consumers alike. Applied Materials set up its latest solar research labs here after estimating that China would be producing two-thirds of the world’s solar panels by the end of this year. “We’re obviously not giving up on the U.S.,” Mr. Pinto said. “China needs more electricity. It’s as simple as that.” China has become the world’s largest auto market, and General Motors has a large and growing auto research center in Shanghai. The country is also the biggest market for desktop computers and has the most Internet users. Intel has opened research labs in Beijing for semiconductors and server networks. Not just drawn by China’s markets, Western companies are also attracted to China’s huge reservoirs of cheap, highly skilled engineers — and the subsidies offered by many Chinese cities and regions, particularly for green energy companies. Now, Mr. Pinto said, researchers from the United States and Europe have to be ready to move to China if they want to do cutting-edge work on solar manufacturing because the new Applied Materials complex here is the only research center that can fit an entire solar panel assembly line. “If you really want to have an impact on this field, this is just such a tremendous laboratory,” he said. Xi’an — a city about 600 miles southwest of Beijing known for the discovery nearby of 2,200-year-old terra cotta warriors — has 47 universities and other institutions of higher learning, churning out engineers with master’s degrees who can be hired for $730 a month. On the other side of Xi’an from Applied Materials sits Thermal Power Research Institute, China’s world-leading laboratory on cleaner coal. The company has just licensed its latest design to Future Fuels in the United States. The American company plans to pay about $100 million to import from China a 130-foot-high maze of equipment that turns coal into a gas before burning it. This method reduces toxic pollution and makes it easier to capture and sequester gases like carbon dioxide under ground. Future Fuels will ship the equipment to Pennsylvania and have Chinese engineers teach American workers how to assemble and operate it. Small clean-energy companies are headed to China, too. NatCore Technology of Red Bank, N.J., recently discovered a way to make solar panels much thinner, reducing the energy and toxic materials required to manufacture them. American companies did not even come look at the technology, so NatCore reached a deal with a consortium of Chinese companies to finish developing its invention and mass-produce it in Changsha, China. “These other countries — China, Taiwan, Brazil — were all over us,” said Chuck Provini, the company’s chief executive. President Obama has often spoken about creating clean-energy jobs in the United States. But China has shown the political will to do so, said Mr. Pinto, 49, who is also Applied Materials’ executive vice president for solar systems and flat-panel displays. Locally, the Xi’an city government sold a 75-year land lease to Applied Materials at a deep discount and is reimbursing the company for roughly a quarter of the lab complex’s operating costs for five years, said Gang Zou, the site’s general manager. The two labs, the first of their kind anywhere in the world, are each bigger than two American football fields. Applied Materials continues to develop the electronic guts of its complex machines at laboratories in the United States and Europe. But putting all the machines together and figuring out processes to make them work in unison will be done in Xi’an. The two labs, one on top of the other, will become operational once they are fully outfitted late this year. Applied Materials has built a 360-employee operation here in Xi’an after announcing an 18-month program last year to reduce employment by 10 to 12 percent, or 1,300 to 1,500 jobs, including layoffs in the United States and Europe. Mr. Pinto said that the company was readjusting its work force as manufacturing shifted to Asia, but that the Xi’an facility involved a new approach to researching the design of an entire assembly line and was not replacing laboratories elsewhere. Mr. Pinto is a well-known figure in Silicon Valley in his own right. While still a doctoral student at Stanford in the early 1980s, he wrote the first widely used two-dimensional computer simulation of how semiconductors work. This allowed engineers to test each one on a computer before building prototypes, shortening the semiconductor development process. Later, he became a celebrated researcher at Bell Labs. With China’s economy gaining strength, Mr. Pinto and his wife, then living in Santa Clara, began insisting in 2005 that their sons study Chinese once a week. Now 10 and 11, the boys are improving their Chinese and mastering the art of eating with chopsticks. Applied Materials has greater challenges, including fighting technological theft, a chronic problem in China. The company has taken measures, including sealing its computers’ ports here, to prevent the easy use of flash drives to record data. Employees are not allowed to take computers from the building without special permission, and an elaborate system of computer passwords and electronic door keys limits access to certain technological secrets. But none of that changes the sense that tectonic shifts are under way. When Xie Lina, a 26-year-old Applied Materials engineer here, was asked recently whether China would play a big role in clean energy in the future, she was surprised by the question. “Most of the graduate students in China are chasing this area,” she said. “Of course, China will lead everything.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/business/14novel.html?ref=intelcorporation">From Camera to Computer, With Fiber Optic Links<date>Published: March 13, 2010</date><text>HIGH-SPEED data communication isn’t so speedy by the time it reaches your video player or smartphone.Lasers may send information flying in tiny bursts of light through optical fibers across oceans and cities. But you’re still in the electronic slow lane when you’re transferring high-definition videos or other large files between devices. Then the content travels only at the rate permitted by the U.S.B. or other cord. But soon, some data exchanges between consumer gadgets may travel at the higher rate of fiber optics, letting people transfer a Blu-ray version of “Gone With the Wind,” for example, or the complete family photo archive in less than a minute. Later this year, Intel will introduce its Light Peak fiber optic link, in a bid to replace U.S.B. and other electrical cables that now connect computers with digital cameras, music players, smartphones and dozens of other devices, said Jason Ziller, Intel’s director for the optical input-output program office. Light Peak optical cable technology, which includes computer chips and miniature lasers, will be available to manufacturers later this year, he said, for installation in products next year. Prices are not yet available from Intel. The first version of the optical cable will transmit 10 gigabits per second of data both ways, and is expected to scale to 100 gigabits a second in the next decade, Mr. Ziller said. By contrast, the high-bandwidth U.S.B. 2.0 cables now in wide use have a rate of 480 megabits a second. The new U.S.B. 3.0 specification now in development has a theoretical maximum data rate of up to 5 gigabits a second, said Richard Brown, vice president for marketing at VIA Technologies, a semiconductor design house in Taiwan that is using the U.S.B. 3.0 standard in two new chips. He said the chips would soon be available in consumer products. Optics may also get a boost from new technology that is still in the laboratory and is intended to integrate lasers directly into silicon chips as they are manufactured. Typically, lasers must be either packaged separately, or grafted onto a chip after it is formed, a relatively expensive procedure. But at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a research group has achieved a breakthrough, creating lasers directly on silicon chips as part of their manufacturing, said Lionel C. Kimerling, a professor of materials science and engineering and director of the MIT Microphotonics Center. Dr. Kimerling and colleagues, including Jurgen Michel and Jifeng Liu, have developed and demonstrated lasers made from germanium, a material used in advanced silicon chip manufacturing processes. Chips are made in layers, and the germanium lasers are built into the chip during the layering process. The germanium laser is an unusual and significant discovery, said Michael Hochberg, an assistant professor of electrical engineering at the University of Washington in Seattle. “Integrating lasers onto silicon chips this way is a milestone in the field,” he said, one that might result in inexpensive ways to bring the high bandwidth of optics to many consumer items. PHILIPPE M. FAUCHET, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Rochester, agreed that the germanium laser was an important advance. “For 20 years there has been an intense search for how we could make a light source out of silicon,” Professor Fauchet said. “Meanwhile, Kimerling has taken a different path” with germanium, which can be used with standard lithographic techniques for fabricating wafers. Germanium lasers may speed communication by eliminating the need for many of the tiny copper pathways on each high-performance computer chip that connect its different areas, carrying data, for instance, from the processor to memory, he said. “As much as 11 miles of copper can be on a chip,” he said. Fiber-optic communication could also connect different chips, providing, for instance, a high-bandwidth path between a computer’s central processing unit and the graphics processor. The germanium in the Kimerling laser was coaxed to make light by adding phosphorus, then by applying a small amount of mechanical strain to pull its atoms a bit apart, Dr. Kimerling said. Many steps lie ahead before the laser can be produced commercially, Dr. Fauchet said, including demonstrating that the efficiency of conversion from electrical power to optical power is reasonable. If used successfully, inexpensive optical connections could drastically change the speed at which consumer devices and the chips within them exchange information. “The bottom line here is bandwidth density,” Professor Hochberg said. “With optics, you will get big pipes — many more bits per second.”</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Thomas L. Friedman Go to Columnist Page » And this contrast is playing out in the worst way  just slowly enough so the crisis never seems acute enough to take urgent action. But, eventually, infrastructure, education and innovation policies matter. Businesses prefer to invest with the Jetsons more than the Flintstones, which brings me to the subject of this column. I had a chance last week to listen to Paul Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, the microchip maker and one of America’s crown jewel companies. Otellini was in Washington to talk about competitiveness at Brookings and the Aspen Institute. At a time when so much of our public policy discussion is dominated by health care and bailouts, my public service for the week is to share Mr. Otellini’s views on start-ups. While America still has the quality work force, political stability and natural resources a company like Intel needs, said Otellini, the U.S. is badly lagging in developing the next generation of scientific talent and incentives to induce big multinationals to create lots more jobs here. “The things that are not conducive to investments here are [corporate] taxes and capital equipment credits,” he said. “A new semiconductor factory at world scale built from scratch is about $4.5 billion  in the United States. If I build that factory in almost any other country in the world, where they have significant incentive programs, I could save $1 billion,” because of all the tax breaks these governments throw in. Not surprisingly, the last factory Intel built from scratch was in China. “That comes online in October,” he said. “And it wasn’t because the labor costs are lower. Yeah, the construction costs were a little bit lower, but the cost of operating when you look at it after tax was substantially lower and you have local market access.” These local incentives matter because smart, skilled labor is everywhere now. Intel can thrive today  not just survive, but thrive  and never hire another American. Asked if his company was being held back by weak science and math education in America’s K-12 schools, Otellini explained: “As a citizen, I hate it. As a global employer, I have the luxury of hiring the best engineers anywhere on earth. If I can’t get them out of M.I.T., I’ll get them out of Tsing Hua”  Beijing’s M.I.T. It gets worse. Otellini noted that a 2009 study done by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and cited recently in Democracy Journal “ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness  not great, but not bad. Yet that same study also measured what they call ‘the rate of change in innovation capacity’ over the last decade  in effect, how much countries were doing to make themselves more innovative for the future. The study relied on 16 different metrics of human capital  I.T. infrastructure, economic performance and so on. On this scale, the U.S. ranked dead last out of the same 40 nations. ... When you take a hard look at the things that make any country competitive. ... we are slipping.” If the government just boosted the research and development tax credit by 5 percent and lowered corporate taxes, argued Otellini, and we “started one or two more projects in companies around the country that made them more productive and more competitive, the government’s tax revenues are going to grow.” With the generous research and development tax credits and lower corporate taxes they receive, Intel’s chief competitors in South Korea basically have “zero cost of money,” said Otellini. Intel can compete against that with superior technology, but many other U.S. firms can’t. Does the Obama team get it? Otellini compared the Obama administration to a “diode”  an electronic device that conducts electric current in only one direction. They are very good at listening to Silicon Valley, he said, but not so good at responding. “I’d like to see competitiveness and education take a higher role than they are today,” he said. “Right now, they’re going to try to push this health care thing over the line, and, after that, deal with the next thing. God, I’d just like this [our competitiveness] to be the next thing. Something has to pay for” everything government is doing today. We had to do the bailouts, the buy-ups and the jobs bills to stop the bleeding. But now we need to focus on the policies that spawn new firms and keep our best at the top. “Having run a company through a major transition, it’s a lot easier to change when you can than when you have to,” said Otellini. “The cost is less. You have more time. I am a little worried that by the time we wake up to the crisis we will be in the abyss.” More Articles in Opinion » A version of this article appeared in print on March 3, 2010, on page A31 of the New York edition.I was traveling via Los Angeles International Airport  LAX  last week.

Intel can thrive today  not just survive, but thrive  and never hire another American. Asked if his company was being held back by weak science and math education in America’s K-12 schools, Otellini explained: “As a citizen, I hate it. As a global employer, I have the luxury of hiring the best engineers anywhere on earth. If I can’t get them out of M.I.T., I’ll get them out of Tsing Hua”  Beijing’s M.I.T. It gets worse. Otellini noted that a 2009 study done by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation and cited recently in Democracy Journal “ranked the U.S. sixth among the top 40 industrialized nations in innovative competitiveness  not great, but not bad. Yet that same study also measured what they call ‘the rate of change in innovation capacity’ over the last decade  in effect, how much countries were doing to make themselves more innovative for the future. The study relied on 16 different metrics of human capital  I.T. infrastructure, economic performance and so on. On this scale, the U.S. ranked dead last out of the same 40 nations. ... When you take a hard look at the things that make any country competitive. ... we are slipping.” If the government just boosted the research and development tax credit by 5 percent and lowered corporate taxes, argued Otellini, and we “started one or two more projects in companies around the country that made them more productive and more competitive, the government’s tax revenues are going to grow.” With the generous research and development tax credits and lower corporate taxes they receive, Intel’s chief competitors in South Korea basically have “zero cost of money,” said Otellini. Intel can compete against that with superior technology, but many other U.S. firms can’t. Does the Obama team get it? Otellini compared the Obama administration to a “diode”  an electronic device that conducts electric current in only one direction. They are very good at listening to Silicon Valley, he said, but not so good at responding. “I’d like to see competitiveness and education take a higher role than they are today,” he said. “Right now, they’re going to try to push this health care thing over the line, and, after that, deal with the next thing. God, I’d just like this [our competitiveness] to be the next thing. Something has to pay for” everything government is doing today. We had to do the bailouts, the buy-ups and the jobs bills to stop the bleeding. But now we need to focus on the policies that spawn new firms and keep our best at the top. “Having run a company through a major transition, it’s a lot easier to change when you can than when you have to,” said Otellini. “The cost is less. You have more time. I am a little worried that by the time we wake up to the crisis we will be in the abyss.”</text></article>

Intel, which loves to make its own chips, tapped TSMC, which loves to make chips for other companies, to make variants of its Atom processor. The deal was seen as a response by Intel to the growing popularity of customized chips from ARM Holdings. It hasn't worked out all that well for Intel or TSMC, based in Taiwan. Intel confirmed last week that a lack of customer demand had put the partnership on hiatus for the short term. Which is to say, there will be no jointly developed Atoms arriving any time soon, although Intel continues to hope for the best down the road. ''I think we had a lot of key learnings from the partnership so far,'' Robert B. Crooke, Intel's Atom chief, said in an interview. ''We haven't given up. These things never happen superfast.'' Intel's take on Atom works fine in laptops, but the company wanted help tweaking it for other markets, like cellphones and consumer electronics devices. The deal with TSMC would have let other companies attach their custom add-ons to Atom chips. This is a common phenomenon in the ARM world, where companies license the main chip core from ARM and attach whatever bits and bobs they want, be it extra video processing or graphics. These types of products are often referred to as an SoC, or System on a Chip, because they bundle just about everything you need to run a given device on a single chip. Intel is more accustomed to settling on a PC or server chip design and then pumping out hundreds of millions of the products. Analysts point out that the System on a Chip market comes with a steep learning curve, including building up expertise in new areas of chip design. Intel has created a handful of these chips and has every intention of burrowing deep into the consumer electronics market, but it's playing the role of the underdog, to be sure.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Intel's prototype for a home energy monitor gathers data from appliances. Enlarge This Image The Picowatt, from Tenrehte Technologies, makes it possible to use smartphones or laptop computers to control lighting and small appliances. But those meters aren’t yet in all that many homes. There will soon be new options, though, for consumers who want to save money by using energy more efficiently. Companies are coming up with dozens of computer-based devices that monitor electricity costs, outlet by outlet, inside a home. Intel has created a prototype for a home energy monitor that gathers information beamed to it from the appliances plugged into wall sockets, said Joe Jensen, general manager of Intel’s embedded-computing division in Chandler, Ariz. This sleek touch screen can hang on the kitchen wall or sit on a countertop. It can show, for example, which appliances are on and what they are costing to operate, he said. The panel communicates wirelessly with the outlets, turning appliances off or on when instructed, or suggesting ways to change energy use in the house, he said. The Intel display is meant to entertain as well as instruct, Mr. Jensen said. Family members may use its built-in camera to leave video messages for one another. They can also run dozens of applications on the monitor, just as they would on a smartphone, looking up addresses in the Yellow Pages, tracking packages and checking for weather and traffic conditions. Intel won’t be offering the home monitors directly to consumers. It is working with manufacturers that will use its designs and its processors to run their devices, Mr. Jensen said. A high-end version could cost consumers $400 or more, he said, but the company is working with a high-volume manufacturer on a cheaper version. He said some of the cost might eventually be underwritten by utilities that could charge a small monthly fee for the unit, as part of campaigns to conserve energy. Tenrehte Technologies, a company based near Rochester, has developed an alternative device, called the Picowatt, that lets people use their smartphones or laptop computers, for example, to control lighting and appliances like air-conditioners. The Picowatt, which plugs into an ordinary wall outlet, is small  slightly larger than a cellphone charger. But it can communicate with the Wi-Fi router on a home network just as laptops do, said Jennifer Indovina, chief executive of Tenrehte. Plug an audio system, for example, into the Picowatt, then plug the Picowatt into a wall outlet, and it will calculate information on energy use and beam it to the router, she said. Each Picowatt hosts its own Web page on the Internet. The page’s address is generated based on the serial number of the plug. “You can see current settings in real time,” Ms. Indovina said, “and what it is costing right now to run anything on that plug.” The plugs will be on sale starting on Earth Day, April 22, at Amazon, Best Buy and other outlets, she said. The price will probably be $79.99, she said. Once a Picowatt is plugged in, “it pulls the voltage to turn itself on and look for the router,” Ms. Indovina said. This process should be automatic, but because so many routers are on the market, she said, the Picowatt comes with a USB thumb drive and a CD to use as a backup during installation to help routers identify its signals. Manufacturers are also making appliances that might someday be adapted to communicate directly with utilities or with smart meters when they are installed. General Electric sells a water heater with a built-in communications port to take advantage of utilities’ discount rates for off-peak use. “When you get these variable rates,” said Kevin Nolan, a vice president of technology at G.E. in Louisville, Ky., “we will have a low-cost communications module that will hook into the heater and communicate with whatever smart meter you have in your home.” Steve McMaster, the chief executive of Sam Six, a company in Portland, Ore., that develops software for utilities to make distribution and transmission of electricity more efficient, would like to see devices throughout a home fitted with computer chips so that they could use a wireless network to report directly to utilities. “This is a cheaper way to get information back to the power stations, bypassing the need for physical installation of smart meters.” Mr. McMaster said. “The utility could talk directly to the dishwasher, for example,” he said, running it at a less expensive time of day. The potential nationwide savings from such conservation are tremendous, he said. “By using the power that we have efficiently,” he said, “we could avoid the need to build power stations just for peak demand.” E-mail: novelties@nytimes.com.

To counter that trend, Intel and 24 venture capital firms said Tuesday that they planned to invest $3.5 billion in American start-ups over the next two years. In addition, Intel, Google, Cisco Systems, Microsoft and 13 other employers pledged to add jobs in 2010  specifically by hiring 10,500 graduates of American colleges, largely those with computer science and engineering degrees. The initiative, called the Invest in America Alliance, is spearheaded by Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, and was announced on Tuesday by the company’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, in a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington. “Unfortunately, long-term investments in education, research, digital technology and human capital have been steadily declining in the U.S.,” Mr. Otellini said, according to a transcript of the speech. “So, too, has the commitment to policies that made us such an entrepreneurial powerhouse for more than a century.” Other countries, including China, India, Taiwan, Finland, Korea and the Netherlands, have become “far more potent competitors in the next phase of the global economy,” he said. As part of the alliance, two dozen venture capital firms  including top-tier names like Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, Venrock and DCM  have committed to investing portions of their funds in start-ups founded in the United States. Intel Capital, the company’s venture capital arm, will invest $200 million. The United States is quickly losing ground to China and India, said Robert Compton, a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who produced a documentary on education in the three countries. Fewer than 10 percent of college graduates in the United States have engineering degrees, compared with more than one-third in India and China, and more foreign-born graduates of United States universities are returning to their home countries, he said. “Early indicators are that we are not the center of innovation anymore,” Mr. Compton said. “It is shifting to the East.” Another indicator of the shift is patent filings, which increased 30 percent in China last year while declining 11 percent in the United States, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. But some analysts say they doubt that more venture capital for American start-ups is the solution. “If they were really serious about it, they would be fixing visa systems so foreign students would stay here,” said Vivek Wadhwa, an executive-in-residence at Duke University, where he researches the impact of globalization on engineering and the competitive advantage of the United States. And others say that the competitive threat from abroad is overblown. The United States benefits no matter where new technologies are invented, because Americans are more innovative at using and commercializing technologies, said Amar Bhidé, a visiting professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, who expands on that argument in his book, “The Venturesome Economy.” “The World Wide Web was invented in Switzerland, and I think we have taken far greater advantage of that than Switzerland,” he said. Whether or not American innovation is under siege, it is unclear how much of a difference Intel’s initiative will make. Hiring 10,500 people will make only a small dent in the nation’s unemployment rolls. And most of the venture firms are not raising new funds to invest in start-ups, but committing money that would most likely have gone to American start-ups anyway. Venture capital firms based in the United States already invest 70 percent of their money in start-ups in this country, while Chinese and Indian companies each receive just 3 percent, according to the National Venture Capital Association. “We’re not changing our behavior,” said Dixon Doll, co-founder of DCM, which has committed $200 million to the alliance. “We’re all just saying this is something we can get behind for the good of the country.” The announcement from Mr. Otellini comes as both Intel and its venture capital arm could use a public relations lift. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust complaint against Intel. Rajiv Goel, a former managing director at Intel who worked closely with Intel Capital, has admitted to leaking confidential corporate information in the Galleon insider-trading case.

Enlarge This Image Albert Gea/Reuters The HTC Desire smartphone, which impressed show-goers last week at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The going rate for a state-of-the-art chip factory is about $3 billion. The plants typically take years to build. And the microscopic size of chip circuitry requires engineering that practically defies the laws of physics. Over the decades, legions of companies have found themselves reeling, even wiped out financially, from trying to produce some of the most complex objects made by humans for the lowest possible price. Now, the chip wars are about to become even more bloody. In this next phase, the manufacturers will be fighting to supply the silicon for one of the fastest-growing segments of computing: smartphones, tiny laptops and tablet-style devices. The fight pits several big chip companies  each trying to put its own stamp on the same basic design for mobile chips  against Intel, the dominant maker of PC chips, which is using an entirely different design to enter a market segment in which it has a minuscule presence. Consumers are likely to benefit from the battle, which should increase competition and innovation, according to industry players. But it will be costly to the chip manufacturers involved. “I worry about that,” said Ian Drew, an executive vice president at ARM Holdings, which owns the rights to the core chip design used in most smartphones and licenses that technology to manufacturers. “But ultimately, these chip makers are all pushing each other, and if one falls over, there are still two or three left.” Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has long been held up as the gold standard when it comes to ultra-efficient, advanced chip manufacturing plants. The company is the last mainstream chip maker to both design and build its own products, which go into the vast majority of the PCs and servers sold each year. Most other chips, for items as diverse as cars and printers, are built by a group of contract manufacturers, based primarily in Asia, to meet the specifications of other companies that design and market them. Traditionally, these companies, known as foundries, have trailed Intel in terms of manufacturing technology and have handled chips with simpler designs. But with mobile technology, an expensive race is on to build smaller chips that consume less power, run faster and cost less than products made at older factories. For example, GlobalFoundries plans to start making chips this year in Dresden, Germany, at what is arguably the most advanced chip factory ever built. The initial chips coming out of the plant will make their way into smartphones and tabletlike devices rather than mainstream computers. “The first one out there with these types of products is really the one that wins in the marketplace,” said Jim Ballingall, vice president for marketing at GlobalFoundries. “This is a game changer.” The company, a new player in the contract chip-making business, was formed last year when Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival in the PC chip market, spun off its manufacturing operations. GlobalFoundries, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has been helped by close to $10 billion in current and promised investments from the government of Abu Dhabi. The vast resources at GlobalFoundries’ disposal have put pressure on companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, United Microelectronics and Samsung Electronics, which also make smartphone chips. The message from GlobalFoundries is clear: as the newcomer in the market, it will spend what it takes to pull business away from these rivals. At the same time, Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm are designing their own takes on ARM-based mobile chips that will be made by the contract foundries. Even without the direct investment of a factory, it can cost these companies about $1 billion to create a smartphone chip from scratch. Recently, these types of chips have made their way from smartphones like the iPhone to other types of devices because of their low power consumption and cost. For example, Apple’s coming iPad tablet computer will run on an ARM chip. So, too, will new tiny laptops from Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo. A couple of start-ups have even started to explore the idea of using ARM chips in computer servers. “Apple was the first company to make a really aspirational device that wasn’t based on Intel chips and Microsoft’s Windows,” said Fred Weber, a chip industry veteran. “The iPhone broke some psychological barriers people had about trying new products and helped drive this consumer electronics push.” Companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm want to get their chips into as many types of consumer electronics as possible, including entertainment systems in cars, and home phones with screens and Web access. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last week, manufacturers displayed a wide range of slick devices based on ARM chips, including a host of tablets and laptops. In addition, HTC released its Desire smartphone, built on a Qualcomm ARM chip called Snapdragon, which impressed show-goers with its big touch-screen display. Meanwhile, Intel is about to enter the phone fray, both to expand its market and defend itself against the ARM chip makers. Its Atom line of chips, used in most netbooks and now coming to smartphones, can cost two to three times as much as the ARM chips, according to analysts. In addition, the Atom chips consume too much power for many smaller gadgets. Intel executives argue that consumers will demand more robust mobile computing experiences, requiring chips with more oomph and PC-friendly software, both traditional Intel strengths. “As these things look more like computers, they will value some of the capabilities we have and want increasing levels of performance,” said Robert B. Crooke, the Intel vice president in charge of the Atom chip. “We’re seeing that from our customers in a number of spaces, including digital TVs and hand-held devices.” Intel also has deep pockets. As of December, the company had more than $9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Mr. Crooke said that Intel’s manufacturing expertise would allow it to produce a new crop of chips every 18 months or so that would be cheaper and use less power. As rivals shift to more cutting-edge chip-making techniques, he said, they are likely to run into problems that Intel solved years ago. At the same time, competition from other chip makers will pressure them to lower their prices. “I don’t know whether it will make it harder for these guys to invest in the future, but you certainly would think so,” Mr. Crooke said.

Over the decades, legions of companies have found themselves reeling, even wiped out financially, from trying to produce some of the most complex objects made by humans for the lowest possible price. Now, the chip wars are about to become even more bloody. In this next phase, the manufacturers will be fighting to supply the silicon for one of the fastest-growing segments of computing: smartphones, tiny laptops and tablet-style devices. The fight pits several big chip companies  each trying to put its own stamp on the same basic design for mobile chips  against Intel, the dominant maker of PC chips, which is using an entirely different design to enter a market segment in which it has a minuscule presence. Consumers are likely to benefit from the battle, which should increase competition and innovation, according to industry players. But it will be costly to the chip manufacturers involved. “I worry about that,” said Ian Drew, an executive vice president at ARM Holdings, which owns the rights to the core chip design used in most smartphones and licenses that technology to manufacturers. “But ultimately, these chip makers are all pushing each other, and if one falls over, there are still two or three left.” Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has long been held up as the gold standard when it comes to ultra-efficient, advanced chip manufacturing plants. The company is the last mainstream chip maker to both design and build its own products, which go into the vast majority of the PCs and servers sold each year. Most other chips, for items as diverse as cars and printers, are built by a group of contract manufacturers, based primarily in Asia, to meet the specifications of other companies that design and market them. Traditionally, these companies, known as foundries, have trailed Intel in terms of manufacturing technology and have handled chips with simpler designs. But with mobile technology, an expensive race is on to build smaller chips that consume less power, run faster and cost less than products made at older factories. For example, GlobalFoundries plans to start making chips this year in Dresden, Germany, at what is arguably the most advanced chip factory ever built. The initial chips coming out of the plant will make their way into smartphones and tabletlike devices rather than mainstream computers. “The first one out there with these types of products is really the one that wins in the marketplace,” said Jim Ballingall, vice president for marketing at GlobalFoundries. “This is a game changer.” The company, a new player in the contract chip-making business, was formed last year when Advanced Micro Devices, Intel’s main rival in the PC chip market, spun off its manufacturing operations. GlobalFoundries, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has been helped by close to $10 billion in current and promised investments from the government of Abu Dhabi. The vast resources at GlobalFoundries’ disposal have put pressure on companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, United Microelectronics and Samsung Electronics, which also make smartphone chips. The message from GlobalFoundries is clear: as the newcomer in the market, it will spend what it takes to pull business away from these rivals. At the same time, Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm are designing their own takes on ARM-based mobile chips that will be made by the contract foundries. Even without the direct investment of a factory, it can cost these companies about $1 billion to create a smartphone chip from scratch. Recently, these types of chips have made their way from smartphones like the iPhone to other types of devices because of their low power consumption and cost. For example, Apple’s coming iPad tablet computer will run on an ARM chip. So, too, will new tiny laptops from Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo. A couple of start-ups have even started to explore the idea of using ARM chips in computer servers. “Apple was the first company to make a really aspirational device that wasn’t based on Intel chips and Microsoft’s Windows,” said Fred Weber, a chip industry veteran. “The iPhone broke some psychological barriers people had about trying new products and helped drive this consumer electronics push.” Companies like Nvidia and Qualcomm want to get their chips into as many types of consumer electronics as possible, including entertainment systems in cars, and home phones with screens and Web access. At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, last week, manufacturers displayed a wide range of slick devices based on ARM chips, including a host of tablets and laptops. In addition, HTC released its Desire smartphone, built on a Qualcomm ARM chip called Snapdragon, which impressed show-goers with its big touch-screen display. Meanwhile, Intel is about to enter the phone fray, both to expand its market and defend itself against the ARM chip makers. Its Atom line of chips, used in most netbooks and now coming to smartphones, can cost two to three times as much as the ARM chips, according to analysts. In addition, the Atom chips consume too much power for many smaller gadgets. Intel executives argue that consumers will demand more robust mobile computing experiences, requiring chips with more oomph and PC-friendly software, both traditional Intel strengths. “As these things look more like computers, they will value some of the capabilities we have and want increasing levels of performance,” said Robert B. Crooke, the Intel vice president in charge of the Atom chip. “We’re seeing that from our customers in a number of spaces, including digital TVs and hand-held devices.” Intel also has deep pockets. As of December, the company had more than $9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Mr. Crooke said that Intel’s manufacturing expertise would allow it to produce a new crop of chips every 18 months or so that would be cheaper and use less power. As rivals shift to more cutting-edge chip-making techniques, he said, they are likely to run into problems that Intel solved years ago. At the same time, competition from other chip makers will pressure them to lower their prices. “I don’t know whether it will make it harder for these guys to invest in the future, but you certainly would think so,” Mr. Crooke said.</text></article>

Microsoft, Intel and Nokia  all leaders in their respective markets  have struggled to capitalize on the rise of a new class of smartphones that can tap into a vast pool of software. Those companies have come to the world’s largest mobile technology conference here with a message: they are willing to abandon tradition if it means getting another shot at the fast-growing mobile device market and blunting the advance of companies like Apple and Google. On Monday at the Mobile World Congress, Microsoft presented new smartphone software, the Windows Phone 7 Series, that succeeds its Windows Mobile line. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, introduced the software to a room overflowing with journalists curious to see if it could live up to months of hype. “There is no question in our minds that we needed and wanted to do some things that were out of the box and clearly differentiated from our past and  hopefully you will agree  clearly differentiated from other things going on in the market,” Mr. Ballmer told the group. Windows Phone has a cleaner look than most of today’s smartphone software, with just a handful of large, colorful icons atop a black background. Icons used to start tasks like e-mail or the calling functions are labeled with text, while bigger icons are used for services like photos and music. Microsoft executives described the icons as “live tiles” that will update with relevant information, be it a new calendar appointment or a status update from a friend on Facebook. The software borrows heavily from the interface on Microsoft’s Zune music player, and all of the new Windows Phone products will have built-in music functions. Microsoft has tied its Xbox Live gaming service into the phone software as well. Company executives also highlighted “hubs,” which are something like multilayered folders on the phone. A photo hub, for example, would contain albums of images downloaded to the phone from a camera as well as images pulled from social networking sites. In a counterintuitive moment, Microsoft’s executives called the software a departure from traditional PC software, saying past fixations on Windows traditions had stifled the company. Still, the mobile software links into Microsoft’s business products like Office and corporate e-mail, something the company pitches as a major advantage over other phones that tend to lean more toward the consumer. Mr. Ballmer said that all of the major carriers would offer products based on Windows Phone 7, while hardware makers including Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Samsung and HTC had committed to the software. Microsoft expects its hardware and network partners to create products with unique looks by modifying the hubs and other areas and to ship phones close to the end of this year. The revamped software represents a rarity for Microsoft  it scrapped previous versions of its software to build something from scratch. Microsoft spent the last 18 months trying to add gloss and sophistication to a product that had been ridiculed as clunky and too wedded to the company’s PC roots. “We think there is a really big opportunity for a fresh start,” said Todd Peters, the vice president at Microsoft in charge of mobile product marketing. “Consumers have an amazing capacity for retrying things.” Intel and Nokia, too, have opted for a fresh start. The companies have decided to create a software platform called MeeGo that they hope will make its way into cars, home phones, smartphones and computers. At its core, MeeGo is a broad attempt to outflank mobile phone software from Google, Apple and Microsoft by creating a product that can bring a similar interface to a wider range of computing devices. “The next evolution of mobile computing, which is way beyond smartphones, tablets and netbooks, will require a truly open platform,” said Kai Oistamo, Nokia’s head of devices. Historically, Microsoft and Intel have dominated the computing industry hand-in-hand, with Microsoft producing the most-used software and Intel building the most popular chips. But this Wintel duopoly, as it is sometimes called, has not carried over to the mobile world. Instead, with its share of the market for cellphone operating systems declining, Microsoft finds itself struggling to be the innovator rather than an also-ran mimicking Apple and Google. Intel has been forced into the software game to ensure that enough good applications exist for its Atom chips, which are in laptops today but have yet to make their way into mobile phones. Nokia emerged as a natural partner for Intel given the company’s recent struggles in the smartphone arena. While it leads in overall smartphone market share, Nokia has watched as interest skyrocketed in Apple’s iPhone and phones based on Google’s Android software. The iPhone, in particular, also opened the market for mobile applications through Apple’s App Store, which has served more than three billion downloads. Intel and Nokia look to attract software developers to MeeGo, and Intel has even backed the idea of running MeeGo on rival chips if it helps the software gain broader interest. Analysts contend that the mobile market remains in a state of flux, leaving plenty of room for these companies to build momentum if they can create something that catches the attention of consumers. Microsoft has intended to do just that by reorganizing its mobile division and presenting people a phone interface unlike anything else on the market. More than two years ago, Microsoft started plucking top executives from companies in a variety of industries, hoping they could revitalize its mobile software group. Mr. Peters brought some marketing muscle from Staples, where he helped to create the popular “Easy Button” campaign. Other executives arrived from Procter &amp; Gamble and Nike, as Microsoft sought to find a new way of talking to consumers, since about 86 percent of phones running Windows are sold through retail outlets. While studies show that consumers tend to react favorably to the Windows brand, they’ve been less enamored of how Microsoft’s phone software works. “We need to have a degree of humility as we go about our business,” Mr. Peters said. “It has been painful, but it’s getting better.” Microsoft has also transferred some of its top engineers to the phone group from other divisions, hoping they could provide inspiration and structure to the processes needed to make a polished product on time. With months to go before phones based on the new software go on sale, Microsoft has provided its rivals with a valuable peek at its plans. Still, Mr. Ballmer pledged that Microsoft’s engineers would continue tweaking the software and that they would soon have more surprises about how developers could build applications for this latest version of Windows.

Will Maintain Strict Policy on Antitrust Behavior, Official Says<date>Published: February 15, 2010</date><text>PARIS — Joaquín Almunia, the European Union’s new commissioner for competition policy, warned Monday that despite the weak economy, companies would continue to face high fines if they broke antitrust law. Mr. Almunia’s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, imposed about €1.6 billion in fines on cartels last year. In addition, the European Commission levied a fine of more than €1 billion, or $1.4 billion, on Intel for antitrust violations. That penalty remains the highest the E.U. has ever imposed on a single company. Intel is appealing the decision. U.S. antitrust authorities are still investigating Intel to determine whether the company's practices hamper rivals and undermine competition. Mr. Almunia said in his first speech in his new position that there was no need to back away from the E.U.’s strict competition policy because of the economic crisis, and he vowed to impose “dissuasive fines” on companies engaging in antitrust violations. Market-rigging not only penalizes consumers, in the form of higher prices and reduced choice, Mr. Almunia added, but it also makes it harder for business sectors to restructure in order “to ensure a prompt and lasting exit from the crisis.” Mr. Almunia’s previous job was overseeing economic and monetary policy for the Union. Under E.U. rules, regulators can fine companies up to 10 percent of their annual global revenue, although most fines, including the one brought against Intel, have not reached that level. In the United States, authorities like the Department of Justice often impose much lower fines than in Europe for cartels and other antitrust abuses. But unlike in Europe, companies, shareholders and consumers in the United States frequently sue companies and win significant damage claims. Mr. Almunia said he would push for ways to make it easier for consumers and companies hurt by anticompetitive behavior to bring similar damage claims in Europe. The European Commission “cannot remain indifferent to the absence of effective reparations for victims of infractions,” Mr. Almunia said. But “it will be necessary to guard against excess that can exist in certain jurisdictions,” he added. Mr. Almunia also said he would keep an eye on developments in the area of online commerce, suggesting there was a need to strike a better balance to ensure that traditional retailers were able to compete with merchants selling goods over the Internet.

Not Quite, but We’re Getting There<date>Published: January 30, 2010</date><text>In computing, the vision always precedes the reality by a decade or more. The pattern has held true from the personal computer to the Internet, as it takes time, brainpower and investment to conquer the scientific and economic obstacles to nudging a game-changing technology toward the mainstream.The same pattern, according to scientists in universities and corporate laboratories, is unfolding in the field of sensor-based computing. Years ago, enthusiasts predicted the coming of “smart dust” — tiny digital sensors, strewn around the globe, gathering all sorts of information and communicating with powerful computer networks to monitor, measure and understand the physical world in new ways. But this intriguing vision seemed plucked from the realm of science fiction. Smart dust, to be sure, remains a ways off. But technology’s virtuous cycle of smaller, faster and cheaper has reached the point that experts say sensors may soon be powerful enough to be the equivalent of tiny computers. Some ambitious sensor research projects provide a glimpse of where things are headed. Last year, Hewlett-Packard began a project it grandly calls “Central Nervous System for the Earth,” a 10-year initiative to embed up to a trillion pushpin-size sensors around the globe. H.P. researchers, combining electronics and nanotechnology expertise, announced in November that they had developed sensors with accelerometers that were up to 1,000 times more sensitive than the commercial motion detectors used in Nintendo Wii video game controllers and some smartphones. The use of accelerometers in consumer products points to the changing economics of sensors, notes Peter Hartwell, a senior researcher at H.P. Labs. In the 1980s, accelerometers began to be used in automobiles, to detect crashes so that air bags would inflate. That was a specialized, costly application of motion sensing. But today’s low-cost sensors, Mr. Hartwell says, are opening the door to widespread use, linking the physical world to computing as never before. In places like desktops and data centers, computing power marches ahead relentlessly. “But it is still as if the computer is a brain that is blind, deaf and dumb to its surroundings,” Mr. Hartwell says. “Closing that gap is what the sensor revolution is all about.” Microchip-equipped sensors can be designed to monitor and measure not only motion, but also temperature, chemical contamination or biological changes. The applications for sensor-based computing, experts say, include buildings that manage their own energy use, bridges that sense motion and metal fatigue to tell engineers they need repairs, cars that track traffic patterns and report potholes, and fruit and vegetable shipments that tell grocers when they ripen and begin to spoil. Power consumption has long been the Achilles’ heel of sensor-based computing. Smart dust, observed Joshua Smith, a principal engineer at Intel Labs in Seattle, proved impossible because the clever sensors needed batteries. Instead of dust, he said, the sensor nodules would be the size of grapefruits. But the power barrier, Mr. Smith says, is rapidly eroding. Advances in sensor chips are delivering predictable, rapid progress in the amount of data processing that can be done per unit of energy. That, he said, expands the potential data workloads that sensors can handle and the distance over which they can communicate — without batteries. At Intel, Mr. Smith is doing sensor research that builds on commercial RFID technology (for remote identification) and adds an accelerometer and a programmable chip — in a package measured in millimeters. Its power, he explains, can come from either a radio-frequency reader, as in RFID, or the ambient radio power from television, FM radio and WiFi networks. (For the latter, Intel is developing “power-harvesting circuits,” he adds.) “The ability to eliminate batteries for these sensors brings the vision of smart dust closer to reality,” Mr. Smith says. In this model of computing, the sensors are servants. They exist to generate data. And the more sensors there are, the better the data quality should be. When mined and analyzed, better data should in turn help people make smarter decisions about things as diverse as energy policy and product marketing. If sensor-based computing takes off, it will ignite fresh demand for a wide range of hardware and software to store, process and search the new oceans of data for nuggets of useful knowledge. So it could be a boon to business, a foundation for what analysts call “the Internet of Things.” “It does feel almost like the beginning of the Internet,” says Katharine Frase, vice president for emerging technologies at I.B.M. Research. “You can see that sensor computing is going to be important and useful, but it’s not possible to see in advance just how it will transform things.” The recent advances in stand-alone sensors may be impressive, but some researchers are pursuing a different path. “We already have massively distributed wireless sensors — they’re called cellphones,” explains Deborah Estrin, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Ms. Estrin and her colleagues at the university’s Center for Embedded Networked Sensing have designed several projects that use cellphones and people in data-gathering and analysis. Cellphones, they say, are versatile data collectors and are becoming more powerful all the time — with cameras, GPS, accelerometers and Internet connectivity. Their work is at the forefront of an emerging field called participatory sensing. One project involves collecting travel, time and location data that is fed into Web databases to calculate an individual’s personal environmental impact and exposure to pollutants (peir.cens.ucla.edu). Another project, in cooperation with the National Park Service, uses a smartphone application to identify, photograph and track the advance of invasive plants, like Harding grass and poison hemlock, which can crowd out local species and undermine biodiversity (whatsinvasive.com). STILL another is a Twitter application for self-reported data on one’s daily life (your.flowingdata.com), which can be assembled into small graphs that show a person’s behavior over time. The most common use since the site went up last fall, says Nathan Yau, a graduate student who created the application, has been to track personal health — eating habits, weight, blood pressure, glucose and sleep times. The cellphone is a constant companion — immediate and intimate, always there to inform, remind and prompt. “The killer app for this is personalized health and wellness,” Ms. Estrin says. “The potential to help people make behavior changes and lead healthier lives is tremendous.”</text></article>

Mr. Goel left the company in late 2009, the spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said, declining to elaborate. Intel had suspended Mr. Goel around the time he was arrested in November along with five other individuals, including Galleon’s founder, Raj Rajaratnam. According to prosecutors, in 2006, Mr. Goel gave information about Intel’s investment in Clearwire to Mr. Rajaratnam. Mr. Goel has not been indicted in the Galleon case. To date, only Mr. Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund consultant also accused of improperly passing along tips, have been indicted. Two other defendants — Anil Kumar, former McKinsey director, and Mark Kurland, a hedge fund executive — have struck plea agreements, though only Mr. Kumar is cooperating with prosecutors. – Michael J. de la Merced</text></article>

A.M.D. said that it would have lost money were it not for the payment it received from Intel to end a long-running antitrust battle. But A.M.D. also appeared to benefit from an upturn in the overall computer market. Revenue was up 42 percent from last year, and unit sales of microprocessors and graphics chips rose, even though prices fell. Intel, which kicked off the technology earnings season last week, reported better sales in all its major product categories and the highest gross profit margin in the company's history. This week I.B.M. raised its profit forecast for 2010 and reported better sales of the types of computer servers that use A.M.D. and Intel chips. And on Thursday, Gartner, the technology research firm, predicted that worldwide spending on information technology in 2010 would improve at a faster rate than expected. A.M.D. said after the market closed that it made $1.2 billion, or $1.52 a share, in the period ended Dec. 26, compared with $1.4 billion, or $2.36 a share, last year. Excluding the settlement and other items, A.M.D. lost $57 million, or 8 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 18 cents a share, excluding items. For the full year, A.M.D.'s net income was $304 million, with revenue of $5.4 billion. In 2008, A.M.D. had a net loss of $3.1 billion and revenue of $5.8 billion.</text></article>

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image James W. Prichard for The New York Times A worker at a plant in Oregon, where Intel invested heavily. Enlarge This Image James W. Prichard for The New York Times Peter Kirdan, center, prepares to report for his job as a manufacturing technician at Intel’s chip plant in Hillsboro, Ore. With the global economy reeling, businesses and consumers had pulled way back on their typical technology spending, and sales of personal computers had started to decline at their steepest rates in history. The major two-year investment was a matter of faith  in an economic recovery and in the Internet continuing to drive a long-term increase in demand for computers, smartphones and other devices with chips inside. “As you can imagine, there was a lot of uncertainty in that January board meeting,” said Jane E. Shaw, the chairman of Intel’s board and former chief executive at the pharmaceutical company Aerogen, in an interview. Today, Intel’s bet on the future is looking as if it will pay off big. The first chips from the plants arrived this month, made with techniques that let the company create smaller, faster and lower-power products than its main competitors. Just as it has in past downturns, Intel has used its hefty pile of cash to advance its manufacturing prowess and technology while rival chip makers have struggled to stay afloat. Meanwhile, broader technology spending is on the rebound, suggesting that both companies and consumers are more optimistic about their own futures. On Thursday, Intel, the first major tech company to report earnings, said that revenue rose 28 percent to $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter, and the company earned the largest gross profit margin in its history. Net income was $2.3 billion, or 40 cents a share, up tenfold from the $234 million, or 4 cents a share, it earned in the last quarter of 2008. This week, Gartner, a technology research firm, reported that worldwide PC shipments rose 22 percent to 90 million units during the fourth quarter, which is a healthy recovery from the dismal fourth quarter of 2008. Because of its investment in the downturn, Intel, which makes the chips at the heart of most PCs, is poised to benefit from that surge more than most tech firms. “They continued to innovate while many of their competitors were swimming in debt and reducing their head count,” said Bill Kreher, an analyst with Edward Jones. “The big and strong will emerge even stronger from the downturn, and Intel is no exception.” Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Intel to earn 30 cents a share on revenue of $10.17 billion, significantly underestimating Intel’s performance. Company executives attributed the gains to its manufacturing strengths and a long-term plan that lowered the company’s annual operations spending. “The cumulative impact has left us more nimble, more competitive and more flexible that I can ever recall  certainly since the ’70s,” wrote Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in an e-mail interview before the earnings report. But Intel also showed especially strong gains from one of its riskiest bets in recent memory  the Atom chip, a cheaper processor that is used in the small laptops known as netbooks and is being adapted for use in smartphones. The company said it sold $1.4 billion of Atom chips over the last year. Intel executives had feared that the Atom and netbooks could undermine the company’s more profitable business with traditional laptops, but they pushed hard on the products anyway. The new plants produce the chip at a lower cost, and Intel is the leading player in the fast-growing netbook market. “I have to give them a pat on the back for having the guts to go with Atom despite the fact that it could have hurt their business,” said Fred Weber, a former executive with Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices. “They built the right chip for the right time.” But there are clouds on the horizon. Although Intel recently paid A.M.D. $1.25 billion to settle long-running litigation, the Federal Trade Commission and the New York attorney general’s office have filed sweeping antitrust lawsuits against the company. The European Union fined Intel $1.45 billion last May. The governments charge that the company, the world’s largest chip maker, has abused its market power to squelch competition and charge higher prices to its customers. Industry experts also wonder how long Intel can continue to leverage its manufacturing muscle. Contract chip makers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing continue to improve their production skills and have a wide variety of customers that help keep their plants full. Intel’s rivals like A.M.D. and Qualcomm are reducing capital costs by using such contract chip makers. Indeed, A.M.D. spun off its factories into a new chip-making venture called Globalfoundries, which is backed by large investments from the government of Abu Dhabi. China continues to invest in contract chip makers as well. More significantly, demand for chips that use the ARM architecture, a competitor to Intel’s architecture, has been rising. Most commonly found in cellphones, ARM chips have started to make their way into computers and even computer servers  two markets where Intel commands an approximately 80 percent share. “There is a possibility that Intel’s financial monopoly will be broken,” said Mr. Weber, who has also received past investments from Intel for a start-up. “Was this Intel’s last chance to crank that old model? I highly doubt it. But it’s actually getting interesting to speculate about now.” Intel generated in $11 billion in cash from its operations last year, and its financial strength has enabled it to withstand the economic and political winds and still pour money into some of the most expensive manufacturing facilities ever built. The company’s critics have long contended that it has earned such a luxury through anticompetitive practices. But other large tech firms are in similarly strong positions and have used the recession as an opportunity to get a leg up on competitors. Oracle, the leader in database software, has moved to acquire the fallen angel Sun Microsystems, adding a large hardware business to its portfolio. Cisco Systems, the largest networking equipment seller, spent more than $7 billion last year on acquisitions that bolstered its positions in new markets. And Hewlett-Packard, the largest technology company, added the vast services business of Electronic Data Systems to complement its hardware and software product lines. Mr. Otellini makes no apologies about Intel’s favorable position and said the company would march on into new areas like cellphones, cars and consumer devices on the back of its manufacturing might. “Everyone in the company knows that innovation is our lifeblood and did a fabulous job on delivering it,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Olivier Hoslet/European Pressphoto Agency Despite her successful five-year term as competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes remains relatively unknown in Parliament. But that is exactly what Ms. Kroes, a 68-year-old Dutch economist, is expected to do Thursday when she answers questions from a committee of the European Parliament considering her nomination as commissioner for the bloc’s digital agenda, which includes telecommunications and the Internet. And despite bringing the technology giants Intel and Microsoft to heel, as well as reining in Europe’s largest energy and asphalt companies, support for Ms. Kroes is not a given. “I am optimistic Mrs. Kroes will do a good job, but make no mistake, the hearing is not going to be a formality — it will be hot,” said Paul Rübig, an Austrian lawmaker and member of the Industry, Research and Energy Committee, which is holding the confirmation hearing. Despite her successful five-year tenure, which cemented Europe’s position as the world’s technology regulator, Ms. Kroes remains relatively unknown among many in Parliament, who play no direct role in competition cases and until now have had few dealings with her. In December, Ms. Kroes met with key lawmakers in Strasbourg but did not divulge her position on issues like copyright protection, expanding the availability of broadband, the use of E.U. broadcast spectrum for the mobile Internet and price limits on voice and data roaming charges, which were championed and passed by the previous telecom commissioner, Viviane Reding. Through a spokesman, Ms. Kroes declined an interview before the hearing. Although she proved a formidable administrator in her largely executive role as competition commissioner, in her new post Ms. Kroes will have to prove that she has the negotiating skills needed to win support for her initiatives from Parliament and the other commissioners. Ms. Kroes is a member of the European Liberal Democratic Alliance, a party that makes up only 11 percent of Parliament, which is dominated by the conservative and socialist blocs. Though her own Dutch party, the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy, is in opposition in the Netherlands, her country’s governing coalition, recognizing her seniority and established clout, recommended her for a second term as commissioner in Brussels. Most are betting that Ms. Kroes’s record as a tough, determined negotiator willing to levy big fines and penalties against companies like Microsoft and Intel will win her the post. “She has an extremely good reputation for defending the internal markets,” said Lena Ek, a Swedish member of the parliamentary committee considering the nomination and also a Liberal Democrat. “We all know Mrs. Kroes is a tough lady. She took on the fight with Microsoft. Her nomination is not controversial.” But reputation alone will not ensure Ms. Kroes a smooth hearing given the pro-consumer bias of Parliament, whose members overwhelmingly supported Ms. Reding on controversial changes like placing limits on mobile phone roaming charges and creating an E.U.-wide telecommunications regulator. Ms. Kroes, a market centrist who opposed consumer price caps on roaming — she said wholesale limits, or limits on the charges operators impose on each other using each other’s networks, should have been attempted first — has held seats on the boards of more than 20 global companies, including the telecom operator O2 and a subsidiary of the network equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent. Some are watching to see whether Ms. Kroes will be as willing as Ms. Reding to intervene for consumers. “She has a very strong background in enforcing competition rules against dominant firms,” said Ilsa Godlovitch, the legislative affairs director of ECTA, a Brussels association that represents smaller telecommunications companies. “Her big challenge over next five years will be to show the same determination and strength in making sure these kinds of abuses don’t happen in the first place.” But lawmakers and others who have worked closely with Ms. Kroes during her tenure as competition commissioner said she would not hesitate to intervene on behalf of consumers. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on January 14, 2010, in The International Herald Tribune.BERLIN — With her aggressive antitrust prosecutions, Neelie Kroes, the European Union’s former competition commissioner, should be one of the last officeholders on the Continent who needed to prove her pro-consumer credentials.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/technology/07distracted.html?ref=intelcorporation">Despite Risks, Internet Creeps Onto Car Dashboards<date>Published: January 6, 2010</date><text>LAS VEGAS  To the dismay of safety advocates already worried about driver distraction, automakers and high-tech companies have found a new place to put sophisticated Internet-connected computers: the front seat. Skip to next paragraph The Times at C.E.S. 2010 Coverage of the worlds largest gadget show, including news, blogs and videos.Complete Coverage » Driven to Distraction The Car as a PC This series examines the dangers of drivers using cellphones and other electronic devices, and efforts to deal with the problem. Previous Articles in the Series » Enlarge This Image Ford The MyFord system lets a driver make a call while the car is in motion, but its Web browser works only when the car is parked. Technology giants like Intel and Google are turning their attention from the desktop to the dashboard, hoping to bring the power of the PC to the car. They see vast opportunity for profit in working with automakers to create the next generation of irresistible devices. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, the neon-drenched annual trade show here, these companies are demonstrating the breadth of their ambitions, like 10-inch screens above the gearshift showing high-definition videos, 3-D maps and Web pages. The first wave of these “infotainment systems,” as the tech and car industries call them, will hit the market this year. While built-in navigation features were once costly options, the new systems are likely to be standard equipment in a wide range of cars before long. They prevent drivers from watching video and using some other functions while the car is moving, but they can still pull up content as varied as restaurant reviews and the covers of music albums with the tap of a finger. Safety advocates say the companies behind these technologies are tone-deaf to mounting research showing the risks of distracted driving  and to a growing national debate about the use of mobile devices in cars and how to avoid the thousands of wrecks and injuries this distraction causes each year. “This is irresponsible at best and pernicious at worst,” Nicholas A. Ashford, a professor of technology and policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the new efforts to marry cars and computers. “Unfortunately and sadly, it is a continuation of the pursuit of profit over safety  for both drivers and pedestrians.” One system on the way this fall from Audi lets drivers pull up information as they drive. Heading to Madison Square Garden for a basketball game? Pop down the touch pad, finger-scribble the word “Knicks” and get a Wikipedia entry on the arena, photos and reviews of nearby restaurants, and animations of the ways to get there. A notice that pops up when the Audi system is turned on reads: “Please only use the online services when traffic conditions allow you to do so safely.” The technology and car companies say that safety remains a priority. They note that they are building in or working on technology like voice commands and screens that can simultaneously show a map to the driver and a movie to a front-seat passenger, as in the new Jaguar XJ. “We are trying to make that driving experience one that is very engaging,” said Jim Buczkowski, the director of global electrical and electronics systems engineering at Ford. “We also want to make sure it is safer and safer. It is part of what our DNA will be going forward.” Ford’s new MyFord system lets the driver adjust temperature settings or call a friend while the car is in motion, while its built-in Web browser works only when the car is parked. Audi says it will similarly restrict access to complex and potentially distracting functions. But in general, drivers will bear much of the responsibility for limiting their use of these devices. Computer chips and other components improve every year while dropping in cost, allowing carmakers to introduce more sophisticated devices. Harman, based in Stamford, Conn., and a maker of such systems for cars, has created a pair of high-end multimedia systems due out this year that use full-fledged PC chips from Intel and Nvidia. Such chips once consumed too much electricity to be used in cars. “We have always looked at the PC market with envy,” said Sachin Lawande, the chief technology officer at Harman, which works with Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota and others. “They’ve always had these great chips we could not use, but now that’s changing.” A complex new dashboard console from Ford, which it plans to unveil Thursday, brings the car firmly into the land of electronic gadgets.

Skip to next paragraph The Times at C.E.S. 2010 Coverage of the worlds largest gadget show, including news, blogs and videos.Complete Coverage » Driven to Distraction The Car as a PC This series examines the dangers of drivers using cellphones and other electronic devices, and efforts to deal with the problem. Previous Articles in the Series » Enlarge This Image Ford The MyFord system lets a driver make a call while the car is in motion, but its Web browser works only when the car is parked. Technology giants like Intel and Google are turning their attention from the desktop to the dashboard, hoping to bring the power of the PC to the car. They see vast opportunity for profit in working with automakers to create the next generation of irresistible devices. This week at the Consumer Electronics Show, the neon-drenched annual trade show here, these companies are demonstrating the breadth of their ambitions, like 10-inch screens above the gearshift showing high-definition videos, 3-D maps and Web pages. The first wave of these “infotainment systems,” as the tech and car industries call them, will hit the market this year. While built-in navigation features were once costly options, the new systems are likely to be standard equipment in a wide range of cars before long. They prevent drivers from watching video and using some other functions while the car is moving, but they can still pull up content as varied as restaurant reviews and the covers of music albums with the tap of a finger. Safety advocates say the companies behind these technologies are tone-deaf to mounting research showing the risks of distracted driving  and to a growing national debate about the use of mobile devices in cars and how to avoid the thousands of wrecks and injuries this distraction causes each year. “This is irresponsible at best and pernicious at worst,” Nicholas A. Ashford, a professor of technology and policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said of the new efforts to marry cars and computers. “Unfortunately and sadly, it is a continuation of the pursuit of profit over safety  for both drivers and pedestrians.” One system on the way this fall from Audi lets drivers pull up information as they drive. Heading to Madison Square Garden for a basketball game? Pop down the touch pad, finger-scribble the word “Knicks” and get a Wikipedia entry on the arena, photos and reviews of nearby restaurants, and animations of the ways to get there. A notice that pops up when the Audi system is turned on reads: “Please only use the online services when traffic conditions allow you to do so safely.” The technology and car companies say that safety remains a priority. They note that they are building in or working on technology like voice commands and screens that can simultaneously show a map to the driver and a movie to a front-seat passenger, as in the new Jaguar XJ. “We are trying to make that driving experience one that is very engaging,” said Jim Buczkowski, the director of global electrical and electronics systems engineering at Ford. “We also want to make sure it is safer and safer. It is part of what our DNA will be going forward.” Ford’s new MyFord system lets the driver adjust temperature settings or call a friend while the car is in motion, while its built-in Web browser works only when the car is parked. Audi says it will similarly restrict access to complex and potentially distracting functions. But in general, drivers will bear much of the responsibility for limiting their use of these devices. Computer chips and other components improve every year while dropping in cost, allowing carmakers to introduce more sophisticated devices. Harman, based in Stamford, Conn., and a maker of such systems for cars, has created a pair of high-end multimedia systems due out this year that use full-fledged PC chips from Intel and Nvidia. Such chips once consumed too much electricity to be used in cars. “We have always looked at the PC market with envy,” said Sachin Lawande, the chief technology officer at Harman, which works with Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Toyota and others. “They’ve always had these great chips we could not use, but now that’s changing.” A complex new dashboard console from Ford, which it plans to unveil Thursday, brings the car firmly into the land of electronic gadgets. The 4.2-inch color screen to the left of the speedometer displays information about the car, like the fuel level, while a companion screen on the right shows things like the name of a cellphone caller or the title of the digital song file being played. An eight-inch touch screen tops the central console, displaying things like control panels and, when the car is not moving, Web pages.

And one of these items, relief measure No. 17, is a real doozy: ''Requiring Intel to make available technology (including whatever is necessary to interoperate with Intel's CPUs or chipsets) to others, via licensing or other means, upon such terms and conditions as the commission may order, including but not limited to extensions of terms of current licenses.'' This remedy could pave the way for a chip war the likes of which Silicon Valley has yet to encounter. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have set out on a path to combine computing and graphics functions on a single piece of silicon, instead of selling two different chips to handle these functions. That's good for Intel and A.M.D. because they both have computing chip and graphics chip expertise. Nvidia has been looking like the odd man out, since it makes only graphics chips. Nvidia does not have a license to make the x86 computing chips it would need to compete against Intel and A.M.D. in this new era of hybrid products. Parse the legalese in relief measure No. 17 and you find the F.T.C. opening the door for Nvidia to obtain an x86 license from Intel. That's important, since Intel had very little motivation in the past to grant Nvidia such a license. With an x86 license in hand, Nvidia could go the hybrid route as well, and the world would end up with not two but three chip powerhouses competing for mainstream computing devices. Making an x86 chip from scratch would be no easy feat for Nvidia. It usually takes about four years and close to $1 billion to get to the first run of such a product. Nvidia has declined to comment on heavy speculation that it has been working on such a chip since 2007. In June, Nvidia's chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, said, ''If we have such a product, I haven't found it yet. It's just not important right now.'' Mr. Huang might want to go talk to all the ex-Transmeta employees his company has hired in the last couple of years. A quick search on the professional networking site LinkedIn shows at least 70 former Transmeta employees working at Nvidia. Transmeta made x86 chips that competed against Intel in the laptop market. Their skills could be applied to any number of projects at Nvidia, including the company's new ARM-based Tegra products for mobile devices. ASHLEE VANCE</text></article>

Says Intel Stifles Competition<date>Published: December 16, 2009</date><text>The muscular giants of the technology industry often seem to be one step ahead of antitrust regulators, who must rely on century-old laws and slow-moving courts. Technology markets, by contrast, operate according to the hurry-up clock of the Internet age. Skip to next paragraph Federal Trade Commission Richard A. Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Competition, said Intel ran “roughshod” over principles of fair play. Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History Video F.T.C.'s Feinstein on Intel Suit Related Complaint (In Re: Intel Corp.) The Federal Trade Commission, one of two main agencies that enforce the antitrust laws in the United States, is trying to pick up the pace  and look to the future. In an unusual complaint filed Wednesday against Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, the F.T.C. said it wanted to address anticompetitive abuses not only in the past and present, but also down the road. Armed with a hybrid law that spans consumer protection and antitrust concerns, the agency said it was seeking to prevent Intel from using its dominance in the market for microprocessors, the main control chips in personal computers, to squelch competition in video graphics chips. The graphics-chip market is currently quite competitive, with Intel facing off against Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. In its complaint, the F.T.C. said that the statute gives the commission “a unique role in determining what constitutes unfair methods of competition” and the power “to stop in their incipiency” acts that, if allowed to continue, would violate America’s two primary antitrust laws, the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act. “The agency is very focused on the danger that these high-technology markets move on,” said George S. Cary, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton in Washington, who is a former senior F.T.C. official. “They are looking to the future.” In its complaint, the F.T.C. accused Intel of conducting a systematic campaign to block rivals from selling their microchips by cutting off access to the market. The filing goes beyond charges in cases brought recently by European regulators and the New York State attorney general, which focused on microprocessors. Intel supplies about 80 percent of the PC microprocessor chips used worldwide. The F.T.C. move, according to Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, is “very significant because it is broader in scope than any of the current cases.” The agency contends that Intel engaged in a pattern of conduct that “put the brakes on superior competitive products that threatened” its microchip market share. “Intel has engaged in a deliberate campaign to hamstring competitive threats to its monopoly,” said Richard A. Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition. “It’s been running roughshod over the principles of fair play and the laws protecting competition on the merits.” The agency’s action comes after a yearlong investigation  and one month after Intel reached a sweeping $1.25 billion settlement with its longtime rival in the chip market, A.M.D. That settlement, covering both private antitrust and patent claims, was seen as possibly deterring the agency from moving ahead. In its long-running legal fight with Intel, A.M.D. was both the principal victim of the giant chip maker and its nemesis, generating most of the evidence that was then used by government regulators around the world. Intel and the F.T.C. tried to reach a settlement, but those talks foundered in recent days. Intel contends that the agency’s staff brought up the accusations about graphics chips and chip-related software late in the talks, asking about some details as recently as Dec. 8. The F.T.C. action was “misguided and unwarranted,” said Intel’s general counsel, A. Douglas Melamed. The case, Mr. Melamed said, “could have, and should have, been settled.” The behavioral changes that the F.T.C. is seeking, he added, amount to “new rules for micromanaging business conduct” and a potentially “dangerous turn for U.S. law.” As a remedy, the commission is seeking an order that would prevent Intel from using threats, bundled prices, or other offers to encourage exclusive deals, hamper competition, or unfairly manipulate the prices of its microprocessors or graphics chips. The F.T.C. is also proposing requirements that Intel submit some business decisions for prior agency approval and agree to continuing commission monitoring of many of its practices. Mr. Melamed said that the commission’s recommended remedial steps would unfairly constrain Intel’s pricing and marketing, hinder product design and innovation, and force the company to give away its intellectual property. The complaint is an administrative action, which will be heard before a single administrative law judge within the F.T.C., with the trial starting next September. That trial is expected to be completed a few months later, much faster than if an antitrust case were tried in federal court, Mr. Feinstein said. Still, the ruling by the administrative judge can be appealed to the five commissioners, who act as judges, and later to a federal appeals court  unless Intel reaches a settlement somewhere along the way. The F.T.C. staff filing is a 24-page enumeration of Intel’s reported anticompetitive acts. It contains no quotes from seemingly incriminating e-mail messages or notes of conversations between Intel executives and personal computer makers, as did the New York State complaint, for example. But the F.T.C. accusations do extend beyond the charges in other pending complaints, which have focused mainly on claims that Intel has systematically used large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to persuade computer makers to use its microprocessor chips instead of those made by A.M.D. Besides those charges, the F.T.C. complaint accuses Intel of taking a series of steps to hinder competition in the market for graphics processing chips, which are increasingly important in running video and movies on computers. Some graphics chip makers, including Nvidia, are even building heavy-duty corporate computers from such chips.

Executive Denies Galleon Charges<date>December 10, 2009, 6:29 am</date><text>A former senior I.B.M. executive denied being involved in a sprawling hedge fund insider trading case and asked a court on Wednesday to dismiss civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Reuters reported. Robert Moffat, who was replaced as head of the I.B.M. hardware division on Oct. 30, did admit to speaking to co-defendant Danielle Chiesi of hedge fund New Castle. Some of the other defendants also denied the charges or did not answer them in court filings on Wednesday. Mr. Moffat “denies that he provided material nonpublic information” on I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices, his lawyers said in papers filed in Manhattan federal court. Mr. Moffat was arrested on civil and criminal charges on Oct. 16. He was accused of passing on insider information in a case that ensnared Galleon Management hedge fund, its billionaire founder, Raj Rajaratnam, and a score of traders and employees of some of America’s best-known companies. One defendant Rajiv Goel, who was accused of tipping Mr. Rajaratnam about Intel earnings in 2006 and 2007 while he was an executive at Intel’s venture capital arm, asserted his Fifth Amendment rights not to be a witness against himself. In answer to the market regulator’s charges on Wednesday, lawyers for Ms. Chiesi said she “denies any allegation that [she] received, distributed, or otherwise made use of material nonpublic information” and had knowledge of other allegations in the case. A former New Castle general partner, Mark Kurland, and the fund itself were also charged by the S.E.C. “New Castle did not itself engage in unlawful conduct, and New Castle is not liable for any unlawful acts that may have been committed by Danielle Chiesi and Mark Kurland,” lawyers for the fund said in court papers. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment, Reuters said. Most of the accused had expertise in technology stocks, and the allegations included passing inside information on earnings announcements, takeovers and contracts on 10 companies, generating $25 million in illegal profits, according to the S.E.C. Lawyers for Mr. Moffat said their client “admits that in January 2009 I.B.M. was conducting preliminary due diligence concerning Sun, denies knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief to the truth of allegations that Sun provided I.B.M. with its Q2 2009 earnings results in advance of a January 27, 2009 announcement.” Mr. Moffat was one of several I.B.M. executives involved in performing preliminary due diligence on Sun in January, the court document said. It said Mr. Moffat “admits that Chiesi and he communicated from time to time during early 2009.” The market regulator filed civil charges against 15 people and six funds. Prosecutors criminally charged 20 people, including five who pleaded guilty and are cooperating with the investigations. On Nov. 24, Mr. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan-born United States citizen who is free on $100 million bail, attacked the regulator’s lawsuit and said government wiretaps violated his constitutional rights. Lawyers for another defendant, former McKinsey executive Anil Kumar, said in court papers on Wednesday that the case against Mr. Kumar “is a legal conclusion to which no response is required.” Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times » Go to Article from Bloomberg News »</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/08/intel-gets-graphic-with-chip-delay/?ref=intelcorporation">Shares Rise in Graphics Firms After Intel Delays Chip<date>December 8, 2009, 5:58 am</date><text>Shares of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices jumped higher on Monday after the companies’ mighty foe Intel revealed a lengthy product delay. Intel had once looked to get a product code named Larrabee out the door this year or next. Larrabee marked Intel’s move into the standalone graphics chip market and posed a real threat to Nvidia and A.M.D., which sell most of the graphics chips. But Intel’s graphics project has now shifted from “soon to be released” to “please standby.” “Larrabee silicon and software development are behind where we had hoped to be at this point in the project,” Intel said in a statement. “As a result, our first Larrabee product will not be launched as a standalone discrete graphics product, but rather be used as a software development platform for internal and external use.” You can think of a software development platform to be kind of like the minor leagues. People can play around with Larrabee and get a sense for how it works, but the chip won’t be making it into a game anytime soon. It’s a humbling state of affairs for Intel, which added that it will release fresh details about its graphic chip products “sometime” in 2010. (So, the company is not even committing to releasing a new product in 2010, just details about a product.) Nvidia’s shares rose more than 12 percent to $16.09, while A.M.D.’s shares were up more than 8 percent to $8.52. Intel’s shares were down slightly at $20.37. Intel’s struggles with Larrabee show just how hard it is to create a new chip. The company hoped to outflank Nvidia and A.M.D. by creating a graphics chip that relied on the same, underlying x86 architecture as its standard chips. Intel has claimed that this strategy would make life easier on software developers who are familiar with its architecture. By creating a strong graphics product, Intel hoped to challenge Nvidia and A.M.D. in the gaming and engineering arenas. In addition, it wanted to keep pace with the rivals’ efforts to push graphics chips into the data center as high-powered accelerators for certain software jobs. Intel’s executives were quite brash when talking about Larrabee, even though most of its public appearances were made on PowerPoint slides. They said that Larrabee would roar onto the scene and outperform competing products. The cheerleading worked pretty well because big name customers like DreamWorks have been talking up Larrabee just as much as Intel. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks, told me in an interview earlier this year that Larrabee would likely play a key role in the company’s 3-D film efforts. But it sounds like Intel will have to wait a bit longer to meet Oscar. All in all, it’s been a rough month for Intel. New York filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company, while Intel also paid A.M.D. $1.25 billion to settle ongoing litigation.</text></article>

The Times previously reported, citing a person briefed on the matter, that an unnamed Galleon representative who received insider information about Intel from Roomy Khan, one of several cooperating witnesses in the current insider trading case, was Mr. Rajaratnam. In the earlier case, dating back to when Ms. Khan was a products marketing manager at the chip maker, the unnamed Galleon representative was discovered through extensive surveillance of Ms. Khan that linked the two individuals. Ms. Khan pleaded guilty in 2001, and was subsequently sentenced to probation. Neither Mr. Rajaratnam nor anyone else at Galleon was contacted by the authorities regarding the events in 1998, a person briefed on the matter previously told The Times. Until this week, the only document available in the case was a two-page charging document, filed in 2000 in United States District Court in Northern California. (Ms. Khan’s name was misspelled “Kahn.”) Several news organizations, including The Times, The San Jose Mercury News and The Wall Street Journal, had petitioned to have it unsealed.

Grove, the 73-year-old former chief executive of Intel, has long brought a piercing intellect and a personal passion to the subject of health care. In 1996, Mr. Grove wrote a cover article for Fortune magazine, ''Taking On Prostate Cancer,'' which chronicled his personal research, after he found out he had cancer, into state-of-the-art treatments. He discussed his new mission during an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Grove, below, is focusing on the shortcomings in the medical innovation pipeline. ''Why doesn't technology give us medical treatments,'' he asked, ''that are better, faster, cheaper? A system that works, heaven forbid, like the chip world.'' An answer, Mr. Grove says, lies in a concept called translational medicine. For years, the National Institutes of Health has been financing research projects into translational medicine, and definitions seem to vary. Mr. Grove, characteristically, offers a crisp one. ''It's the art of taking laboratory, one-off discoveries and putting them into mass production -- in higher volume and at lower cost than previous treatments.'' To promote the concept, Mr. Grove is advocating a new master's degree program in translational medicine. And he's prodding the Berkeley and San Francisco campuses of the University of California to begin offering such a joint-degree program. The degree would combine the talents mainly of the engineering and medical schools, with some business education tossed in. Students with engineering backgrounds would take tailored courses in anatomy, physiology and cell biology. Students from the medical school would take courses in project management, the engineering process and clinical trial design. Core courses, taken by all students, would have a business school flavor, including accounting, organizational behavior, and regulatory and patent laws. Mr. Grove looks at the challenges surrounding Parkinson's disease as a field that could benefit one day from the practical, multidisciplinary approach of translational medicine. Modern neurological study, he said, weighs heavily on the engineering tools of fluid mechanics and materials behavior. There are ''substantial similarities'' in the underlying engineering with the work of petroleum engineers, for example. ''So engineers who are tired of studying seepage of oil in porous rock formations could make the jump to bioengineering,'' Mr. Grove said.

Skip to next paragraph Gerard Cerles/A.F.P. — Getty Images P. Nikiforos Diamandouros has been the European Union's ombudsman since 2003. Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History The ombudsman, P. Nikiforos Diamandouros, said investigators for the European Commission failed to record in their official minutes a meeting they held in August 2006 with a senior executive for Dell, the computer maker, even though the meeting focused on the central allegations in the case. “This constituted maladministration,” he said. But Mr. Diamandouros said the oversight did not prevent Intel from mounting its defense. After a nine-year investigation, the commission ruled in May that Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, had used improper rebates and incentives to persuade computer makers to use its processors over those of Advanced Micro Devices. The commission, in a statement, said it “does not agree with the ombudsman’s position that a formal, agreed minute should have been prepared.” It added that its practices were in accordance with European legal principles and rules of procedure. A lawyer for Intel, Ian S. Forrester, said the ombudsman’s finding called into question the unchecked nature of the commission’s investigative powers and would bolster Intel’s efforts to overturn the ruling at the European Court of First Instance. “The issue raises the broader question of whether the current procedures used by the European Commission to determine facts are adequate,” said Mr. Forrester, a partner at the law firm White &amp; Case in Brussels. “The commission’s information-gathering process is in question. The European Commission has the only competition authority where the investigative team is the same one that drafts the decision.” Stephen Kinsella, a partner at Sidley Austin in Brussels, who is not representing either side in the case, said the ombudsman stopped short of ruling that Intel’s rights of defense had been infringed, limiting the finding’s effect in the appeal. He said a critical factor would be the nature of the statements made by the unidentified Dell executive  which the commission has not made public. “If it were possible to adduce evidence of what was said in that meeting and if it were seriously exculpatory, then I don’t doubt the court would take account of it,” Mr. Kinsella said. “But even then it would only be one piece of evidence among so many.” A person with knowledge of Intel’s legal strategy said the Dell executive was responsible for the computer maker’s account with Intel. According to this person, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, the executive refuted a main allegation in the case  that Intel had paid Dell, via preferential rebates, to favor its chips over A.M.D.’s. Prosecutorial errors have led the appeals court to overturn commission decisions in several prominent cases. In 2002, the court criticized the commission’s investigative work in overturning its decision to block the merger of two British travel operators, Airtours and First Choice. The same year, the court cited investigative errors in overturning the decision to block the merger of Schneider Electric and Legrand.

Grove, the 73-year-old former chief executive of Intel, has long brought a piercing intellect and a personal passion to the subject of health care. Jim Wilson/The New York Times Andrew S. Grove In 1996, Mr. Grove famously wrote a cover story in Fortune magazine, “Taking on Prostate Cancer,” which chronicled his personal research, after he found out he had cancer, into the state of the art of treatments. The piece, most of all, displayed his logical assault on a problem, combining the risk-benefit analysis of a businessman and the technical acumen of a scientist, who is the author of a widely used text, “Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices.” And after Mr. Grove was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at 64, he set up a foundation to support research in the disease. Mr. Grove will deliver a presentation on Wednesday morning at a symposium in San Francisco, “Translating Technology into Cost-Effective Healthcare.” (His talk will be Webcast live, about 9:10 a.m. to 10 a.m. West Coast time, and 12:10 p.m. to 1 p.m. East Coast time.) He talked about his new mission during an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Grove is focusing on the shortcomings in the medical innovation pipeline. “Why doesn’t technology give us medical treatments,” he asked, “that are better, faster, cheaper? A system that works, heaven forbid, like the chip world.” An answer, Mr. Grove says, lies in a concept called “translational medicine.” For years, the National Institutes of Health has been funding research projects into translational medicine, and definitions seem to vary. Mr. Grove, characteristically, offers a crisp one. “It’s the art of taking laboratory, one-off discoveries and putting them into mass production — in higher volume and at lower cost than previous treatments.” To promote the concept, Mr. Grove is advocating a new master’s degree program in translational medicine. And he’s prodding the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Francisco, to begin offering such a joint-degree program. The degree would combine the talents mainly of the engineering and medical schools, with some business know-how tossed in. Students with engineering backgrounds would take tailored courses in anatomy, physiology and cell biology. Students from the medical school would take courses in project management, the engineering process and clinical trial design. Core courses, taken by all students, would have a business-school flavor, including cost-accounting, organizational behavior, and navigating regulatory and patent laws. Mr. Grove looks at the challenges surrounding Parkinson’s disease as a field that could benefit one day from the practical, multidisciplinary approach of translational medicine. Modern neurological study, he noted, weighs heavily on the engineering tools of fluid mechanics and materials behavior. There are “substantial similarities” in the underlying engineering with the work of petroleum engineers, for example. “So engineers who are tired of studying seepage of oil in porous rock formations could make the jump to bioengineering,” Mr. Grove said. Someday, Mr. Grove said, the daunting challenge of drug delivery to specific sections of the brain to prevent the degradation of the brain, and even reverse the decline, will be solved — the key to fighting Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease. “That kind of cure will start as a $200,000 procedure, but it should quickly become a $30,000 procedure,” Mr, Grove said, noting that driving that cost curve down is the work of translational medicine. Mr. Grove has a target size for a joint program involving the two California universities, about 100 students graduating annually from a two-year program. If successful, he is hopeful the model would spread. Matthew Tirrell, chairman of the bioengineering department at Berkeley, has talked to Mr. Grove about the concept and is enthusiastic. But he said some market research with potential employers would have to be done before going ahead. “What will drive the success of this over the long term will be placement,” Mr. Tirrell said. “Can they get jobs?” At UCSF, Sarah Nelson, a professor radiology and biomedical imaging, said the idea was “extremely intriguing.” There have been initial discussions with Mr. Grove and university professors. But most of those conversations have been with people from the engineering disciplines. “As the idea progresses,” Ms. Nelson said, “it needs more input from the medical side.”</text></article>

Last Tuesday, the chip maker unveiled the Intel Reader, a hand-held device for people who struggle to read standard texts because of conditions like dyslexia and blindness. The Intel Reader can scan books and other printed material, turn the text into a digital form and read it aloud. The device costs about $1,500, which may seem expensive for a fixed-function type of computing device. But many of the text-to-speech products covered by Medicare and health insurance companies start at $5,000 and run up to $10,000. The high cost of such products, along with their limited functions, has resulted in people with a variety of conditions adding cheap text-to-speech software to iPhones and netbooks to create their own assistive devices. ''The direct sales of products is part of our strategy in the health area,'' said Ben Foss, the director of access technology in Intel's Digital Health Group. ''These markets are large and going after them is important. We are trying to get economies of scale.'' The Intel Reader has a five-megapixel camera that lets people point the device at reading material and capture the text. Software helps align pages correctly and fix things like shadows or curved pages. In addition, Intel is selling a complementary scanning station product that can digitize text and transfer the information over to the Intel Reader. Intel looks to make a variety of devices for the health care market as it tries to find more uses for its chips. The company has been going after products that make it easier for doctors and nurses to pull up digital records along with talking up home health products that can perform certain tests and link patients remotely with their doctors. For Mr. Foss, the Intel Reader arrives with a personal twist. Mr. Foss has dyslexia and went to special education classes in elementary school. In college, Mr. Foss would fax his assignments home so his mother could read them to him on the phone. ''My speech technology was my mom,'' he said.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Intel Corporation A.M.D.’s suit against Intel, which has been in the works for years, was supposed to be a major antitrust showdown. Instead, A.M.D. has agreed to call off the fireworks for a sum that means a lot more to A.M.D., whose stock price soared on the news, than to Intel. As part of the deal, Intel also agreed to adhere to some new business practices. Intel is the big gorilla of the microchip industry. Four out of five PCs in the world use its chips, which gives it an enormous amount of market clout that can be misused. Regulators have accused Intel of offering big rebates and co-marketing agreements to induce large computer makers to choose its chips over its competitors’ products. Intel’s behavior has drawn censure not just in the United States, but internationally. In May, the European Union leveled a $1.45 billion fine on Intel for using illegal, anticompetitive practices. The European Union’s competition commissioner ordered Intel to change how it does business, including not offering rebates conditioned on the purchaser buying less of a competitor’s products, or not buying them at all. Intel is appealing the European Union ruling. This month, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Intel, focusing in part on Intel payments to PC makers that are allegedly tied to the companies continuing to use Intel products. In announcing the suit, Mr. Cuomo charged Intel with using “illegal threats, coercion, fines and bullying to preserve its stranglehold on the market.” Based on what is known so far about the A.M.D. settlement, there is no reason for Mr. Cuomo to let up in that lawsuit. The Federal Trade Commission has also been considering opening formal proceedings against Intel. Like Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit, the focus of the F.T.C. investigation should be on what impact Intel’s actions have on consumers. Intel and its smaller rival, A.M.D., may well have reached an agreement that is good for both companies, but that does little for computer buyers. Antitrust law can seem like an abstraction, but in the case of computer chips the impact on ordinary Americans is very real. Chips are a significant part of the cost of new desktop and laptop computers, and the quality of those chips has a big effect on computer performance. If Intel is using its market power to keep prices high and fend off better products, it is consumers  and not just competitors like A.M.D.  who are the losers.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Paul Sakuma/Associated Press Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive of Intel. Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History Related Times Topics: Intel Corporation | Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Paul Sakuma/Associated Press Dirk Meyer, chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices. The settlement, covering both antitrust and patent claims, ends the computer industry’s most bitter legal war. But the truce may not be enough to turn around the fortunes of A.M.D, which has struggled to come up with chips that give it any significant technological or performance edge over Intel, which supplies about 80 percent of the microprocessors that sit at the heart of personal computers. At least in the short term, the settlement also does not end Intel’s antitrust problems. Governments in Europe, the United States and Asia have accused the company of systematically using large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to persuade computer makers to use its chips instead of those made by A.M.D. The regulators contend that Intel’s tactics have not only hurt competitors, but also effectively forced customers to pay higher prices. On Thursday, both the European Union and the New York attorney general’s office said they would continue to press their cases against the company. Still, legal experts say the agreementresolves some of the antitrust issues surrounding Intel and could dissuade other government agencies from bringing cases against the company. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, has been investigating the big chip maker for the past year but has taken no action. “This private settlement has probably taken a lot of wind out of the sails” of the F.T.C.’s case, said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the University of Iowa. The agreement between the two Silicon Valley companies mainly covers A.M.D.’s claims that Intel rewarded computer makers that used only Intel chips and punished those who bought from A.M.D. Intel contends that it never engaged in tactics to exclude A.M.D. from the marketplace but agreed in the settlement not to do so in the future. The pact provides for quarterly meetings between the companies and programs for mediating disputes over exclusionary practices. The firms will also cross-license each other’s patents for five years. But it’s unclear whether the deal will truly change the competitive dynamics between the companies. A.M.D., founded 40 years ago, rose to prominence as a maker of Intel-compatible chips, but it has had difficulty producing notably better products than Intel and often ended up in devastating price wars. Dirk Meyer, the chief executive of A.M.D., said the settlement opened the door to a “transformation in the way our industry operates,” though he admitted change would not be immediate. Thomas M. McCoy, A.M.D.’s executive vice president for legal affairs, said his company’s long-time goal had only been fair competition. “We’re not looking for any help, just do not hurt us,” he said. Intel executives said that settling the case was a pragmatic business decision, a careful weighing of risks. The jury trial in A.M.D.’s antitrust case against Intel was scheduled to begin in Delaware next spring. If things had gone against Intel, the chip maker could have been hit with triple damages, executives said. “We have never wavered in our position that Intel did nothing outside the law,” said Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini. “It made sense to step back and find a way to settle this.” Michael Salinger, an economist at the Boston University School of Management and a former F.T.C. official, said the substantial settlement “suggests Intel knew they faced a serious risk of losing” in the A.M.D. trial. However, analysts said that the deal was unlikely to have a significant impact on how Intel did business. “A.M.D. did very well from this settlement, but Intel’s business model is not changing,” said Stacy Rasgon, a chip analyst at Bernstein Research. The Intel settlement with A.M.D. does not cover a range of business practices, including Intel’s broad pricing policies and its marketing payments to PC makers under its Intel Inside branding campaign. Those pricing and marketing practices have drawn the scrutiny of regulators worldwide. In May, the European Union hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine, which the company is appealing. And last week, New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, filed a wide-ranging antitrust suit against Intel. Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the European Union’s competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said on Thursday that the settlement would have no effect on Europe’s case. “Intel has an ongoing obligation to comply with the commission’s antitrust decision and with E.U. competition law,” Mr. Todd said. “The commission continues to vigorously monitor Intel’s compliance with its obligations under the E.U. antitrust decision.” A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo’s office said its suit against Intel also was continuing. Intel and A.M.D. said that talks to end their disputes began in April, but negotiations got serious over the summer, after the Europeans ruled against Intel. Mr. Otellini said New York’s suit had no effect on the timing of the deal, although the state’s investigation began last year. The final negotiating point, Mr. Otellini said, was how much Intel would pay A.M.D. He said it pained him to write a big check, but $1.2 billion might be a “small multiple” of the company’s liability if it lost a jury trial. Intel and A.M.D. have wrangled legally for more than two decades, and A.M.D. has been the primary instigator behind various government investigations of its rival over the years. By now, the two sides have exchanged 200 million documents, and witness depositions run to 2,200 hours  all of which are available to government investigators. Besides cash, the settlement gives A.M.D. greater freedom to produce chips at different contract factories around the world. Under a patent cross-licensing deal with Intel, A.M.D. was restricted in producing large volumes of chips in any factory not owned by A.M.D. or a subsidiary. That part of the agreement, analysts say, could eventually allow A.M.D. to reduce its stake in its former chip-making operations, which in March were spun off into a money-losing joint venture called Globalfoundries. In the third quarter, A.M.D. had operating income of $47 million, excluding the losses from Globalfoundries, on revenue of $1.4 billion. “A stronger A.M.D. is good for competition in the industry,” said Mr. Rasgon. “The impact will depend on how well A.M.D. does in developing and producing products over time.” James Kanter reported from Brussels.

Jonathan Todd, the spokesman for the European Union’s competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, said on Thursday that the settlement would have no effect on Europe’s case. “Intel has an ongoing obligation to comply with the commission’s antitrust decision and with E.U. competition law,” Mr. Todd said. “The commission continues to vigorously monitor Intel’s compliance with its obligations under the E.U. antitrust decision.” A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo’s office said its suit against Intel also was continuing. Intel and A.M.D. said that talks to end their disputes began in April, but negotiations got serious over the summer, after the Europeans ruled against Intel. Mr. Otellini said New York’s suit had no effect on the timing of the deal, although the state’s investigation began last year. The final negotiating point, Mr. Otellini said, was how much Intel would pay A.M.D. He said it pained him to write a big check, but $1.2 billion might be a “small multiple” of the company’s liability if it lost a jury trial. Intel and A.M.D. have wrangled legally for more than two decades, and A.M.D. has been the primary instigator behind various government investigations of its rival over the years. By now, the two sides have exchanged 200 million documents, and witness depositions run to 2,200 hours  all of which are available to government investigators. Besides cash, the settlement gives A.M.D. greater freedom to produce chips at different contract factories around the world. Under a patent cross-licensing deal with Intel, A.M.D. was restricted in producing large volumes of chips in any factory not owned by A.M.D. or a subsidiary. That part of the agreement, analysts say, could eventually allow A.M.D. to reduce its stake in its former chip-making operations, which in March were spun off into a money-losing joint venture called Globalfoundries. In the third quarter, A.M.D. had operating income of $47 million, excluding the losses from Globalfoundries, on revenue of $1.4 billion. “A stronger A.M.D. is good for competition in the industry,” said Mr. Rasgon. “The impact will depend on how well A.M.D. does in developing and producing products over time.” James Kanter reported from Brussels.</text></article>

Dell’s namesake company was getting pounded. His competitors were selling personal computers and servers built on cheap, popular and powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices, while Mr. Dell had stuck loyally with slower chips from Intel. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History Related Times Topics: Intel Corporation Complaint (N.Y. v. Intel Corp.) (pdf) In an e-mail note to Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, Mr. Dell threatened to switch to A.M.D. “I am tired of losing business,” Mr. Dell wrote. “We are losing the hearts, minds and wallets of our best customers.” Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $1 billion in the last year. “This was judged by your team to be more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues,” he wrote. Dell delayed buying A.M.D. chips, and Mr. Otellini said in a later e-mail message to a colleague that Dell was “the best friend money can buy.” Such payments to PC makers, along with other aggressive business tactics, are at the heart of the antirust lawsuit filed against Intel on Wednesday by New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo’s case  the first antitrust charges against the company in the United States in more than a decade  follows similar actions by regulators in Europe and Asia. According to Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, has for years used large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to talk Dell and other manufacturers into sticking with its products rather than increasing their business with A.M.D., a much smaller chip maker. As the supplier of about 80 percent of the central chips that power PCs and servers, Intel had monopoly power, which it abused, according to Mr. Cuomo. “Intel has used illegal threats, coercion, fines and bullying to preserve its stranglehold on the market,” he said at a news conference Wednesday. “We intend to stop them.” An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said the company had done nothing wrong. “Neither consumers, who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation, nor justice are being served by the decision to file a case now,” he said. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is no stranger to antitrust controversy. The company has spent the last five years defending itself against antitrust allegations, first in Asia and then in Europe. In May, the European Commission hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine for antitrust violations, which the company is appealing. Intel also faces a four-year-old antitrust lawsuit filed by A.M.D. in Federal District Court in Delaware and a continuing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Although Intel has faced various antitrust claims for two decades, the cases against it have picked up steam in recent years because of developments in the chip industry. In 2003, A.M.D., Intel’s longtime nemesis, began selling a new line of chips widely regarded as superior in design and performance to Intel’s products. The chips were good enough to lift A.M.D. from the PC market into the higher-profit server computer market for the first time and begin selling to Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. It took Intel about four years to come up with chips that matched or surpassed A.M.D.’s products in performance. While A.M.D. did well both in sales and market share gains during that period, the company’s top executives have long argued that it could have sold far more products had Intel not used strong-arm tactics to blunt its advantage. The lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Cuomo in the Delaware court, stretches beyond the interests of A.M.D., which is building a $4.2 billion plant in Saratoga County in upstate New York through a spinoff company, GlobalFoundries. Mr. Cuomo argues that Intel’s behavior curtailed innovation in the industry and forced consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for computers. Under federal antitrust law, states have the power to bring charges independently of the federal government. The F.T.C. and other states may file similar cases, much as in the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft a decade ago. The major complaints surrounding Intel concern its use of rebates and marketing dollars to keep customers. The New York suit argues that Intel executives threatened to take away such incentives from customers if they did more business with A.M.D. In addition, the lawsuit contends that if businesses were close to buying A.M.D.-based computers from a company like H.P. or Dell, Intel would jump in to help the computer makers sell Intel-based machines at a large discount. Over all, the hardware makers often became dependent on Intel’s incentives to keep their computer businesses profitable, making them reluctant to make a meaningful shift to A.M.D., the lawsuit said. Communications cited in the lawsuit show that Dell executives turned to Intel for payments to help them meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly financial results. When Dell finally decided to make products with A.M.D. chips, Intel reduced its chip rebates for the company by $600 million, according to the suit. The suit also contends that Intel paid I.B.M. to halt the production of a server based on A.M.D.’s chips. Rebate payments and other incentives provided to customers fall into a murky area of the law, according to antitrust scholars. Intel’s critics must show that it went beyond the typical actions that one would expect from a company trying to protect its business. “A lot of what they are talking about here sounds nefarious, but others would look at it and say that is how markets work,” said John E. Lopatka, a professor and antitrust expert at Pennsylvania State University’s Dickinson School of Law. Harry First, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said Delaware was an odd venue for Mr. Cuomo to pick for the lawsuit against Intel. “I assume they filed there because A.M.D.’s litigation against Intel is pending there,” he said. Piggybacking on A.M.D.’s lawsuit could make sense since most of the current cases against Intel share much of the same evidence. More than 200 million pages of documents have been exchanged between the parties in A.M.D.’s case against Intel. Antitrust experts following Mr. Cuomo’s actions said that both A.M.D. and I.B.M.  which is based in Armonk, N.Y., and competes against Intel in the server chip market  have invested billions of dollars in chip manufacturing plants in New York. Keith N. Hylton, a professor at the Boston University School of Law, said that Mr. Cuomo could benefit politically by taking such a prominent stand on behalf of local workers and consumers. “An attorney general is understood to be an aspiring governor,” he said. “They are politicians, and they want to be on the gravy train for big cases.” During the news conference, Mr. Cuomo said that thwarting Intel’s abusive actions was important to consumers and businesses worldwide. “It is not just about New York,” he said.
