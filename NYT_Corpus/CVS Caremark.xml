A digital campaign encourages holders of the CVS ExtraCare card to redeem their ExtraBucks rebate coupons on the bottom of cash register receipts. The digital campaign is aimed at discouraging “money trashers” among the more than 67 million shoppers who carry the CVS ExtraCare loyalty program card. The trashing part refers to the fact that the coupons for what CVS calls its ExtraBucks rewards are printed out at the bottom of cash register receipts. Only about 49 percent of the ExtraBucks coupons, which are distributed quarterly, are ever redeemed, according to CVS data. That means lots of money goes unclaimed because shoppers with ExtraCare cards receive 2 percent back on future CVS purchases for most of the merchandise they buy. Exceptions include alcohol, lottery tickets and prescriptions. (Full disclosure: this reporter is a card-carrying member of the ExtraCare program. His most recent ExtraBucks rebate totaled $2.50 and was promptly redeemed.) The campaign includes entreaties like “Don’t be an ExtraBucks Money Trasher,” “Don’t let your ExtraBucks rewards go to waste” and this declaration: “Don’t be a Money Trasher. Millions throw away their ExtraBucks rewards. It’s time to stop.” The fight against “money trashing” brings to mind a long-ago campaign from General Electric to encourage consumers to buy more of its light bulbs. The G.E. campaign urged, “Don’t be a bulb snatcher” — that is, someone who replaces a bulb that burns out with a working one from another lamp or light fixture. The better course, according to G.E., was to always have plenty of packages of light bulbs on hand for such situations. The CVS campaign includes content on its Web site, cvs.com, and five video clips and other material on its Facebook fan page, facebook.com/CVS. In one video, an ExtraBucks coupon that a woman tosses away as she leaves a CVS store follows her in a “Jaws”-meets-Alfred-Hitchcock kind of thriller. In another video, not redeeming ExtraBucks coupons is likened to money-wasting mistakes like leaving lights on or water running. “It’s very easy to save money through our ExtraCare program,” Melissa Studzinski, vice president for customer relationship management at CVS, said by e-mail. “There are tens of millions of shoppers that realize this and take advantage,” she said, “yet there are still millions of customers who don’t.” “We wanted to do something fun and irreverent to help draw attention to the savings that people are ‘trashing’ and drive more customers to redeem their rewards,” she added. The campaign is being introduced in July because that is one of the quarterly periods the ExtraBucks coupons are printed on receipts. Another reason for the timing is that CVS is also redesigning the ExtraBucks coupons to use larger print and, the chain hopes, a more eye-catching design. Early results are encouraging, Ms. Studzinski said, with an increase of 5 percent in the number of ExtraCare cardholders who are redeeming their rewards. The campaign is a collaborative effort among the CVS employees who oversee ExtraCare and agencies that include Bravo, iCrossing, Matter Communications and Poptent.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/former-top-lehman-banker-arrested/?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Former Top Lehman Banker Arrested<date>June 29, 2011, 7:43 am</date><text>Fairfield Police DepartmentBradley H. Jack’s mug shot. Bradley H. Jack, a former investment banking chief at Lehman Brothers, was recently arrested after he used a forged prescription to obtain Oxycontin and Ritalin pills from a CVS store in Connecticut, a police official said. Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department said Mr. Jack was charged with second-degree forgery and forgery of a prescription drug. He was released on a promise to appear in a Bridgeport court July 11. According to Mr. Perez, on Friday Mr. Jack went to a CVS in his neighborhood in Fairfield, not far from his home. He gave the pharmacist a prescription for 12 pills of Oxycontin, a prescription painkiller, and nine pills of Ritalin, used to treat attention deficit disorder. The pharmacist told him it would take an hour or so to fill the order and Mr. Jack, dressed casually in tan khakis and a stripped shirt, indicated he would come back, Mr. Perez said. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The pharmacist quickly noticed that the prescription had been photocopied, called the doctor who had issued it and confirmed it was a fake, Mr. Perez said. Mr. Jack, 52, arrived back at the CVS an hour or so later but quickly left. “For some reason he left and didn’t pick it up,” Mr. Perez explained. “But an employee followed him out of the store and got his license plate.” The police got in touch with Mr. Jack, and he turned himself in. “Before asking Jack any questions he immediately said he knew what he had done was wrong and he apologized,” Mr. Perez said. This is an unusual turn of events for Mr. Jack, once a respected Wall Street banker and former co-chief operating officer at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Jack, who joined the investment bank in the 1980s, left Lehman in 2005, three years before the firm — weighed down by billions of dollars in soured real estate assets — filed for bankruptcy. At the time, Mr. Jack indicated that he was planning to do non-profit work. Mr. Perez said Mr. Jack did not provide a current employer to the Fairfield police. Second-degree forgery is a felony offense, and Mr. Perez said Mr. Jack could face jail time if convicted. Mr. Jack was not available for comment. His lawyer did not immediately return calls for comment. Mr. Jack’s arrest has made headlines in his hometown.

As a result, the chain said it was not planning on continuing to offer its retail pharmacies in the Express Script’s network in 2012. “While we have sought to negotiate a contract renewal agreement over the past several months, those talks have been unsuccessful,” said Greg Wasson, Walgreens’ chief executive in a statement announcing the decision. “Under the terms proposed by Express Scripts, it would not make good business sense for the strategic direction of our company to continue our relationship with them. “Walgreens is committed to providing quality, convenient and cost-effective pharmacy services to our patients, but we cannot continue to deliver these services under the terms and rates Express Scripts offered. As the largest retail provider in their pharmacy network, we were surprised by Express Scripts’ ultimate stance during our talks, which made it clear to us that they no longer had an interest in continuing a meaningful relationship.” In his statement, Express Scripts’ chairman and chief executive, George Paz, said: “In these challenging economic times, it is critical that we all work together to keep medicines affordable and accessible. It is shocking to us that Walgreens would back away from the table with six months to go in the current agreement, especially considering that negotiations are part of the normal course of business.” This is not the first impasse Walgreens has experienced with a pharmacy benefit manager. A year ago, Walgreens got into a similar showdown with CVS Caremark, which also operates a large chain of drugstores. The standoff was resolved pretty quickly, according to the article we wrote at the time. So it’s no surprise that some Wall Street analysts are predicting this dispute will again be settled. “We believe the most likely outcome to this dispute is some sort of resolution where Walgreen will remain in Express Scripts’ network,” David Larsen, an analyst with Leerink Swann Research, told investors. An article by The Associated Press has more details.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/lady-gaga-album-zooms-to-megahit-status/?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Lady Gaga Album Zooms to Megahit Status<date>May 31, 2011, 8:00 pm</date><text>“Born This Way,” released on May 23, sold more than 1.1 million copies in its first week. Pop Music Even Offstage, Lady Gaga’s Ready for the Stage Lady Gaga, the self-described “show without an intermission,” recorded her new album, “Born This Way,” while on the road performing her grueling two-year-long Monster Ball tour. Read Jon Pareles’s Article Also: Girl Pop’s Lady Gaga Makeover (July 25, 2010) Little Monsters, rejoice: Lady Gaga’s new album “Born This Way” is the fastest-selling album in six years. “Born This Way” (Interscope), released on May 23, sold 1.108 million copies in the United States, Billboard reported on Tuesday evening, citing data from Nielsen SoundScan. That is the biggest take any album has had since 50 Cent sold 1.141 million copies of “The Massacre” in March 2005. For Lady Gaga, the figures are both slightly less and a lot more than had been predicted. Going into the week of release, industry projections were for about 700,000 records sold, but once Amazon put the album on sale for 99 cents — a surprise to Lady Gaga’s record label and management, in addition to her fans — expectations shot past one million. If the album had scanned 1.15 million copies, as Billboard predicted it might, “Born This Way” would have been the best-selling release since Eminem’s album “The Eminem Show” nine years ago. Sales of “Born This Way” were also helped by a blitz of marketing through big-box retailers, traditional media outlets like HBO and lots of new media partnerships, and by a strategy of stocking the album at thousands of nontraditional retail outlets, like Hudson News, Walgreens and CVS. The idea was to make the album available everywhere, Troy Carter, Lady Gaga’s manager, said in an interview on Tuesday. “To purchase a CD now, there aren’t a lot of places you can go,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s Best Buy, it’s Target, it’s Wal-Mart. So our thing was, with Gaga being such a household name, being able to put her in places where people shop. To be on an endcap at Whole Foods, if you see a Gaga CD, you might be familiar with her as an artist, and you might give it a chance.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/28/business/28bizbriefs-CVSWINS3BILL_BRF.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS Wins $3 Billion Pharmacy Contract<date>Published: May 27, 2011</date><text>The CVS Caremark Corporation won a $3 billion contract to provide pharmacy benefits to federal employees, easing concern that the company is losing business to rivals.

Combining the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager resulted in lost contracts and Federal Trade Commission scrutiny. It has hurt investors, too. The fall in first-quarter profit reported on Thursday emphasizes the point. The $50 billion company could be worth $13 billion more carved up.The Caremark arm of the group pools customers and uses this purchasing power to demand discounts from drug makers. CVS, meanwhile, fills prescriptions and sells things as diverse as diapers and candy. The merger meant Caremark customers could be pushed into CVS stores with preferential pricing. The union also led to new services. People with diabetes, for example, could get their medicine in the mail and attend clinics in CVS stores. The deal lifted retail sales but hurt the benefits business. Caremark lost nearly $5 billion of contracts last year. The company blamed falling prices in the unit for its latest quarterly earnings decline. Moreover, regulators are concerned CVS might be using Caremark customer data to compete unfairly against rivals, though the company says it has ensured that can’t happen. While CVS stores would lose sales if the company were to split, Caremark would add customers and improve its profit margin. Instead of encouraging clients to visit stores, it could mail more prescriptions directly to customers, which is more efficient. And it would mean fewer costly legal problems in Washington. Investors attach a discount to the combined company. If the separated CVS and Caremark units traded in line with independent rivals — the pharmacy chain Walgreen and the benefits groups Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions — then, based on multiples of estimated 2011 earnings, investors would see a 25 percent increase in value. And a stand-alone Caremark might attract an additional takeover premium from a pure-play rival. The merger’s major architects are gone. A new chief executive, Larry J. Merlo, took over in March. And David Dorman, who oversaw a split-up at Motorola, is ready to start as chairman next week. While CVS Caremark says its new bosses have no plans to break it up, undoing the deal would be an easy win for them. Nigerian Example Nigeria isn’t the obvious source of sound financial advice. But as part of a postcrisis cleanup, the central bank of Africa’s most populous nation fired the bosses of flailing financial firms. Western officials might consider taking note. Many developed-world bank critics would approve of Nigeria’s approach. Warren E. Buffett said over the weekend that any companies that needed rescuing by the government — along with their spouses — should end up “dead broke.” But that hasn’t happened in the United States or, say, Britain. But it did, more or less, in Nigeria. Readers familiar with Nigeria’s infamous e-mail scams may find the comparison humorous. But against expectations, Nigerian officials managed to make last month’s elections the fairest in years, according to observers. That gives some credibility to the central bank’s efforts to clean up the financial sector. Lamido Sanusi, the Nigerian central bank governor, initially identified five banks that were in trouble. “I am satisfied these five institutions are in a grave situation and that their management have acted in a manner detrimental to the interest of their depositors and creditors,” he said in an August 2009 speech that has become a must-read among financial policy wonks in Washington and elsewhere. He fired the banks’ leaders. It’s unclear whether Mr. Sanusi’s efforts then and since, which included sacking the bosses of three more banks, bailouts on tough terms and stiffening rules on capital and proprietary trading, will ultimately stick. After all, he started with a serious mess. In one case, a bank borrowed money and bought private jets that were registered to the chief executive’s son. Such hurdles make it all the more unexpected that Mr. Sanusi and his colleagues should try so hard to fix the system. His objectives seem sensible, comprehensive and bluntly expressed, characteristics that apply to too few of the reforms carried out in the biggest financial markets. It all goes to show that ideas from Abuja deserve attention alongside those from Washington and Wall Street.  For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.The merger that created CVS Caremark never made much sense.

Attorneys general in 24 states are conducting a similar inquiry, according to CVS Caremark.

At the time of the deal, Andrew Ross Sorkin reported: The transaction would transform CVS from being primarily a retailer to becoming the nation’s leading manager of pharmacy benefits.The merger illustrates the attraction that pharmacy benefits managers — middlemen between the drug companies and employees and others with drug benefits coverage — still hold. But that dual role of retailer and middleman is now raising questions among consumer groups and investors alike. On Thursday, five consumer groups wrote a letter to the chairman of the F.T.C., Jon Leibowitz, saying that ‘there is strong evidence that the CVS Caremark merger has harmed consumers.” Reed Abelson and Natasha Singer report: The groups, which called for breaking up the $27 billion merger, also accused the company of using confidential patient information from Caremark, which manages prescription benefits for health plans, to steer consumers to CVS pharmacies. CVS Caremark’s stock price has been sluggish since the merger, prompting investors to become restless. In a note on March 31, Citigroup analysts said the for CVS Caremark, the issue “has been convincing employers that consolidation within the prescription drug value chain creates value instead of conflicts of interest.” With the issue affecting the stock price, the Citigroup analysts advocated a tax-free spinoff of the Caremark business: A spinoff provides the most ebitda upside for the CVS and Caremark businesses. This is because a spinoff would allow CVS and Caremark to continue their relationship through a joint purchasing agreement, which would likely allow the two companies to maintain their purchasing synergies (we estimate possible lost synergies of $285 million in an asset sale.)

The company says it is “cooperating fully” with the inquiries. “We remain confident that our business practices and service offerings are being conducted in compliance with antitrust laws,” said Carolyn Castel, a company spokeswoman. But on Thursday, five consumer groups wrote a letter to Jon Leibowitz, the commission’s chairman, claiming “there is strong evidence that the CVS Caremark merger has harmed consumers.” The groups, which called for breaking up the $27 billion merger, also accused the company of using confidential patient information from Caremark, which manages prescription benefits for health plans, to steer consumers to CVS pharmacies. The company’s practices effectively gave CVS an unfair advantage over other pharmacies, reducing competition and limiting consumer choice, according to the letter, which was signed by Community Catalyst, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices and U.S. Pirg. CVS Caremark denied accusations that it had engaged in improper business practices, saying the charges were “false, unfounded and misleading.” It defended its privacy protections, saying it maintained a firewall to ensure that Caremark and CVS did not share “certain competitively sensitive information,” Ms. Castel said in an e-mail. The company did not improperly steer patients to CVS pharmacies, she said. She also said “there are no plans to split up the company.” A spokeswoman for the F.T.C., Cecelia Prewett, confirmed that the commission had received the letter, but said it could not comment on an open investigation. For the last several years, some consumer groups as well as independent pharmacists, who have argued that they are now at a competitive disadvantage, have been calling for regulators to review the merger. Some investors have also been frustrated by the lack of financial results from the merger, and some industry analysts are saying the company would be valued more by investors as two distinct businesses. CVS Caremark had revenue of $96.41 billion in 2010, down from $98.73 billion in 2009. At the time of the merger, executives emphasized that the combined firm would prove itself to be more attractive to investors as well as health plans and consumers. “The real synergy here is the top line synergy, the revenue synergy,” said Thomas M. Ryan, then chief executive of CVS, when the merger was announced. “That’s how we’re going to win this game.” Although CVS Caremark asserts that the merger has allowed it to better serve health plans and consumers, some analysts say the pharmacy benefit management operations of Caremark have struggled to persuade customers of its additional value. The company lost nearly $5 billion in contracts with employers and health plans for 2010. In fact, some critics of the merger say executives are running the combined company to benefit the retail operations of CVS through programs like maintenance choice, a prescription drug benefit plan that offers savings to health plans by limiting where customers can fill prescriptions to CVS stores or Caremark’s mail-order operations. “One question is whether they are just robbing Peter to pay Paul,” said B. Kemp Dolliver, an analyst with Avondale Partners. CVS says maintenance choice is valued by its customers because it offers a retail choice beyond programs that mandate prescription delivery by mail. Given the lackluster performance of the stock, which has treaded water since the merger and closed Thursday at $35.61, some investors have grown restless and are pushing management to reconsider the merger. “The pressure is currently rising on them,” said Jeffrey Jonas, who follows CVS Caremark for the Gabelli mutual funds, one of the company’s investors. In late March, Citigroup analysts issued a report that concluded the company would be worth more as separate entities. The Citigroup analysts said any breakup would probably not occur before 2012 because of the tax advantages of waiting until the merger was at least five years old. “They now have roughly one year to make their case,” said Adam J. Fein, who runs Pembroke Consulting, a Philadelphia firm that follows the industry. He predicted that without a clear sign that customers were beginning to be persuaded that the combination delivered better results, “the clamor to separate the business will be deafening.” At the same time, CVS Caremark has been accused by consumer advocates of not fulfilling promises made at the time of the merger; executives said then they would erect a firewall between the CVS and Caremark businesses and would be agnostic about where consumers filled their prescriptions. In their letter, the consumer groups charged the merged company had engaged in unfair practices that favored company-owned pharmacies, including sharing information Caremark obtained in processing prescriptions to help solicit non-CVS customers to fill their prescriptions at CVS drugstores. The situation is one in which a pharmacy benefit manager, which manages prescription benefits, is “using the information to steer people to their own pharmacies,” said Sharon Anglin Treat, a Democratic legislator in the Maine House of Representatives, who is the executive director of the National Legislative Association on Prescription Drug Prices, a consumer group that signed the letter. “It really does appear that CVS has been unable to avoid a very significant conflict of interest.” Mark N. Cooper, the director for research at the Consumer Federation of America, one of the groups that signed the letter, said that it was important for the F.T.C. to review the original grounds — including efficiencies, cost savings and consumer benefit — for the merger and determine whether the union had been justified. “The merger was a mistake,” he said. CVS Caremark says the merger is helping its customers by reducing costs and improving health outcomes. “The innovative products we have introduced into the marketplace since the merger are gaining traction,” Ms. Castel said, and will “enhance shareholder value.” The company also said it “places a high priority on protecting the privacy of its customers and plan members.” Ms. Castel said CVS Caremark used patient data internally for “appropriate purposes,” like identifying potentially adverse drug reactions. In addition, some investors say the sharing of patient information is central to any claims by CVS Caremark that the combination of the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefit manager can better serve patients by coordinating information and reducing costs. “What some people are calling antitrust is in the customers’ favor,” Mr. Jonas said.CVS Caremark is coming under increasing pressure from consumer groups and shareholders to split up, at the same time that federal and state regulators are looking into accusations of anticompetitive behavior by the merged company.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/with-drugstore-com-purchase-walgreen-diverges-from-cvs-strategy/?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">With Drugstore.com Purchase, Walgreen Diverges From CVS Strategy<date>March 24, 2011, 3:10 pm</date><text>Updated: Walgreen’s announcement today that it plans to purchase the Web business drugstore.com for $409 million highlights the radically different business strategies of the nation’s two leading drugstore chains. Walgreen, with about 7,600 stores, is focused on retail sales. Just two weeks ago, it announced it was selling its pharmacy benefits management business for $525 million. The purchase of drugstore.com means Walgreen will essentially flip the benefit management money into Web retail expansion. Drugstore.com sells 60,000 over-the-counter health, beauty, vision and skin care products. In May 2010, it sold its prescription drug business to BioScrip in a deal valued at $10.9 million. Walgreen also sells prescription drugs on its Web site. CVS, with just over 7,000 stores, has gone deeply into the benefit management business and stayed there, to the chagrin of some analysts. CVS bought Caremark, the nation’s third-largest pharmacy benefits manager, for about $26 billion in 2007 after a bidding war. Handling benefits for more than 50 million Americans, Caremark dwarfed Walgreen’s benefit management business. But the CVS-Caremark combination raised regulatory scrutiny and concerns from community pharmacies, not to mention complaints from Walgreen over how much Caremark would reimburse customers who shopped at Walgreen instead of CVS. That dispute, potentially affecting where millions of people filled their prescriptions, was settled last June with an agreement between the companies. There has been some talk of unwinding the CVS Caremark deal because the drugstore and benefit management businesses might possibly do better independently. Last quarter’s results continued to disappoint investors, and the new president and chief executive, Larry J. Merlo, told analysts, “One of my top priorities will be to ensure that the CVS Caremark merger is financially successful for our shareholders.” Matthew Coffina, a Morningstar analyst, said in an interview on Thursday that CVS Caremark had lost market share and taken hits on margins by aggressive pricing. “If they can’t find a way to keep the business without sacrificing so much on price, it’s logical sooner or later they’ll have to spin it off,” he said. As for the Walgreen purchase of drugstore.com, Mr. Coffina is no fan of that business move, either. Drugstore.com has never had a profitable year, and Walgreen said it would lower projected earnings for the next three years as retail pharmacies face increasing competition from superstores like WalMart, Web sites like Amazon and mail-order pharmacies. ““Spending $400 million and expected to generate losses through 2013,” Mr. Coffina noted. Walgreen stock rose 0.3 percent on Thursday to $39.95 a share.

The M.S.C.I. global index has nearly doubled since March 9, 2009, the postfinancial crisis nadir. Credit markets are thriving, and economic activity has returned. Yet the government actors behind the rebound look spent. Financial markets are on their own for future shocks. A call to arms from the world’s governments pulled the financial system back from the brink two years ago. Guaranteeing bank debt, slashing interest rates, buying more than $1 trillion of assets and stress testing large banks were among the moves that restored stability and revived markets. President Obama may have seen all the activity coming: On March 3, 2009, he called stocks “a potentially good deal.” Even the derivatives index used to hedge subprime mortgage loans is up 25 percent, according to Barclays Capital. With oil up more than 120 percent in two years and gold 55 percent higher, commodities look frothy. The International Monetary Fund on Monday noted “overheating” in emerging markets. Meanwhile, there remain plenty of potential flashpoints. Turmoil in the Middle East, which has increased the price of oil, is the most immediate. Sovereign debt stresses in Europe remain worrying. And rising inflation combined with an increase in interest rates is another situation that could torpedo market sentiment. For investors from banks to hedge funds, however, the safe options that may protect them against these risks just don’t make enough money. Short-term interest rates, for instance, are mostly still low, especially the Federal Reserve’s zero to 0.25 percent. They prefer, as before the crisis, to shoulder risk in return for more yield. But this time there’s no real government safety net. Huge budget deficits in the developed world leave little ammunition for governments. Politics won’t allow further large-scale intervention, especially in the United States. True, central banks like the Fed have shown themselves prepared to print money, even though doing more of that would run the risk of further undermining confidence. The government-fueled bull run is fresh in investors’ minds. But they might do well not to forget the dark days two years ago. A Dog of a Deal Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, has showed its arch-rival a solution to its problems by selling its pharmacy benefits management arm to better focus on retailing. Walgreens’ top competitor, CVS, has taken the opposite tack since it paid $26 billion for Caremark. That dog of a deal, which has dragged down performance and led to an antitrust inquiry, looks increasingly in need of unwinding. True, Walgreens’ pharmacy benefits management business was never a big part of the company. The unit, which is selling for $525 million in cash to Catalyst Health Solutions, contributes less than 2 percent to Walgreens’ bottom line. Still, with the middleman gone, Walgreens’ managers will be better concentrated on the firm’s core business. Contrast that with CVS-Caremark. The company runs a retail operation similar in scale to Walgreens along with a giant pharmacy benefits management company. Since the two merged, the Caremark business has lost some big contracts and downgraded its earnings forecasts. It has also spent precious management time explaining to the Federal Trade Commission why the combination doesn’t hurt consumers. Investors have noticed. The shares have underperformed and trade at a discount to other drugstore chains and pure-play pharmacy benefits firms Medco Health and Express Scripts. To the market, the group is neither fish nor fowl. The solution is to let them swim their separate ways again. CVS-Caremark claimed $700 million of synergies from merging. But even if these vanished, their net present value would still amount to less than the potential upside from splitting. Moreover, the looming presence of the antitrust inquiry would vanish. Here’s a case where the market might nicely do regulators’ dirty work. AGNES T.

Or maybe some Target chicken.Reflecting a major shift in the way Americans shop for food, retailers better known for selling clothes or aspirin, including Walgreens, CVS/Pharmacy and Target, are expanding in a big way into the grocery business, with fresh produce, frozen meats and, yes, even sushi. Target invested $500 million last year alone in a new push on groceries, retrofitting some of its general merchandise stores with full-blown food sections. Sales and traffic at stores with the new grocery areas are about 6 percent higher than at similar stores without them, the company says. Walgreens began making over some stores in Chicago and New York a year ago, and added up to 500 food items. CVS/Pharmacy last year redesigned about 200 of its stores in urban areas like Boston, Detroit and New York, and expects to make over about 20 percent of its 7,100 stores in all. As a result, people who typically went to the grocery store once a week to stock up are instead stopping by places whose food items used to be limited to a bag of chips or a can of soup. And retailers are viewing it as an opportunity to increase sales by getting people in their stores more frequently. “It’s going to be a big food fight in the sense that you’re going to have so many people going after this sector,” said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst with Deutsche Bank. The changes have hit the traditional grocery businesses, stores like Supervalu and Safeway, whose profits had already been declining because of rising food prices, fixed real estate and labor costs, and more competition. Like the grocers, the convenience stores and discount stores are not making a lot of money on their groceries. Instead, the goal is to draw more customers. People shop for food on average about 2.5 times a week, Mr. Dreher said, compared with once a month or so for a drugstore or Target. So if the stores can entice shoppers to pick up some groceries on the way home from work, marketing data shows they are likely to add some paper towels or nail polish or a DVD to their carts, spending around the same amount each time they visit. “Instead of having you stop at a supermarket or a fast-food place,” said Bryan Pugh, vice president for merchandising for Walgreens, “could I potentially entice our shoppers with a better range, better assortment?” So far, the drugstore sales of grocery items are too small to be statistically significant, but they are growing, according to Janney Capital Markets, which estimates that Wal-Mart has about 33 percent of the grocery market, and Target about 3 percent; Kroger, Safeway and Supervalu each represent 4 to 9 percent. “Stomachs haven’t gotten significantly larger, yet you have, probably, at least 10 percent per capita more square footage than you did in the ’80s” devoted to grocery, said Jonathan P. Feeney, an analyst with Janney. Target began opening stores primarily devoted to groceries, called SuperTargets, in the 1990s. But two years ago, seeking to lure customers during the economic downturn, it began trying out grocery areas in its traditional multipurpose stores. It now has groceries in about 450 of its 1,750 stores. Another 400 are planned for 2011, and Annette Miller, Target’s senior vice president for grocery, said she expected an expanded food department to move into most Target stores eventually. The grocery section is laid out with islands stacked with fresh vegetables and bakery items, surrounded by refrigerated cases carrying items like pizza, burritos and chicken. Target also carries sandwiches and quick lunches in stores near office buildings. “What we’re finding with this new layout is the number of trips is really increasing,” said Ms. Miller, adding that when customers come in, they are “still shopping the entire store.” Mr. Dreher of Deutsche Bank estimated that shoppers go to Targets with groceries almost twice as often as patrons visit regular Targets. While the gross margins of the grocery business are about 18 percent, well below those of retail, which are about 30.5 percent, groceries both drive visits and make existing stores more profitable, said Colin McGranahan, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. At drugstores, the emphasis on food goes beyond increasing foot traffic, to the broader goal of selling more items outside the pharmacy. 1 2 Next Page »For dinner tonight, pick up some sushi and salad — at Walgreens.

As the first lady, Michelle Obama, highlights child obesity and urges regular exercise, providing play spaces is a winning cause for the food and beverage companies, which are under fire for high calorie snacks and drinks. Dr Pepper/Snapple Group pledged $15 million this month to build or fix 2,000 playgrounds over the next three years. “A fit and active lifestyle is one of our philanthropic goals,” said Tina Barry, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. “Playgrounds align with that.” In October, Kraft Foods made playground-building a centerpiece of its annual company “Delicious Difference Week.” About 1,300 employees, including the chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, built 13 playgrounds, including one in Washington Park on the South Side of Chicago, at a total cost of more than $1.4 million. Kraft, too, counts healthful lifestyles, along with ending hunger, as a top philanthropic priority. “It’s huge — getting children excited about play,” said Nicole Robinson, the vice president of the company’s charitable arm, the Kraft Foods Foundation. Kraft and other companies that provide money for playground construction say they have not studied whether their contributions increase public awareness of their brand. Corporate-financed playgrounds typically bear a plaque with the company’s name and receive a flurry of local news coverage. Kraft’s playground projects are “a huge boost to the company’s reputation, and add to its credibility,” Ms. Robinson says. • Foresters, the life insurance provider, also has opted for playgrounds, recently pledging $1.5 million to build 20 in the United States, where the company, which is based in Canada, has most of its clients. “It’s a good fit for us,” said George Mohacsi, its president and chief executive. “And we get more bang for the buck when we build a playground, we put in something that people can use daily for a decade or more.” A. Dennis White, president and chief executive of MetLife Foundation, said his company regularly finances playgrounds to promote physical fitness. The company has donated $850,000 in the last three years for 400 play spaces in the United States and Mexico. “It’s something that can be built in a day, and we like the visibility it gets in the local community,” Mr. White said. Once upon a time, playgrounds were largely the province of schools or municipalities, but with plummeting local tax revenues, they are ripe for corporate support. This dovetails with a recent study that found companies are allocating their charitable giving — whether it is goods, services or cash — more toward community needs instead of grand goals such as alleviating world hunger. Basic needs were the only categories in which corporate cash contributions increased last year, according to the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s annual corporate giving report, which used information from 171 major companies, including 61 of the Fortune 100. Companies financing playgrounds often work in partnership with Kaboom, a nonprofit group based in Washington, which recently drew praise from Mrs. Obama. It has a comprehensive plan to include the community and company volunteers in designing, building and maintaining play spaces. Kaboom has nearly 300 corporate partners, including Home Depot and Kimberly Clark. Darell Hammond, its chief executive, said companies need to spend $75,000 to $500,000 to create a public playground, depending on whether the floor is rubberized. Companies are drawn to the idea because “playgrounds bring the community together,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s almost a new town square.” Other companies work with nonprofit organizations like Shane’s Inspiration or Boundless Playgrounds, to create play areas that are accessible to disabled children. This fall, CVS worked with the Pepsi Refresh Project to give $70,000 to construct the playground proposal from the public that had won the most votes on the project’s Web site. A Fort Wayne, Ind., playground proposal was selected and will be built in 2011, said Eileen Howard Dunn, senior vice president for community relations for CVS Caremark. CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., has spent $3 million in recent years to finance 65 playgrounds around the country, and has pledged to build 10 more next year as part of its $25 million “All Kids Can” initiative to help disabled children. With charitable cash in shorter supply, companies are encouraging employees to volunteer. The corporate philanthropy committee report found that in the last three years, 20 percent more companies offer paid time during the workday for employees to volunteer. • Companies devoting resources to building playgrounds, which typically are in areas that are home to a concentration of their employees, say that worker engagement and satisfaction are important considerations in choosing the playground option. “Employees who participate feel a sense of community whether they participate for the one day or for the six months of planning,” Ms. Robinson, of Kraft, said. “And any company really receives a halo.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/business/15cvs.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS to Pay $77.6 Million Penalty in Methamphetamine Case<date>Published: October 14, 2010</date><text>CVS Caremark has agreed to pay $77.6 million to settle an investigation that its drugstores allowed widespread sales of cough medicines used to manufacture the stimulant methamphetamine.CVS Pharmacy, a subsidiary, acknowledged that it had sold pseudoephedrine to criminals who used it to make meth, the United States attorney in Los Angeles said Thursday. The chemical is used in various cough and cold medicines. Methamphetamine has become relatively cheap and widely available in the United States. Mexican drug cartels illegally import much of it into the United States, but many sellers also make meth at home. In 2007, Los Angeles County pharmacies experienced an epidemic of “smurfing” in which individuals made several purchases of small amounts of over-the-counter medicine containing pseudoephedrine, which was then turned into methamphetamine, the government said. At the same time, CVS began a system that failed to prevent multiple purchases by an individual customer on a single day, prosecutors said, and buyers soon inundated CVS stores in California and Nevada. CVS eventually changed its practices to prevent the sales after it became aware of the investigation, the government said. In a statement, CVS called the sales an “unacceptable breach” of company policy and “totally inconsistent with our values.” CVS agreed to pay a $75 million civil penalty and forfeit $2.6 million in profit. The government said it would not pursue criminal charges against CVS. The company will start a compliance and ethics program.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19drug.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Walgreen and CVS Reach a Deal on Prescriptions<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>Who blinked?After an unusually public showdown that threatened to restrict where millions of consumers could fill their prescriptions, Walgreen and CVS Caremark said on Friday that they had agreed to a new contract. In addition to being in the drugstore business, CVS Caremark is a leading provider of prescription benefit plans that many employers offer workers and their dependents. As a result of the deal announced Friday, people enrolled in those drug benefit plans will be able to continue shopping at Walgreen, which operates about 7,500 drugstores across the country, the two companies said. The two did not disclose the terms of the new contract and neither would elaborate beyond the joint statement they issued. Earlier this month, the rivals had threatened to stop doing business with each other. CVS operates more than 7,000 drugstores. After Walgreen said it would no longer accept customers in any new CVS Caremark drug plans because of its rival’s business practices, CVS Caremark countered by saying even people currently enrolled in its plans would no longer be able to fill prescriptions at Walgreen, starting next month. CVS Caremark said Walgreen was just holding out for higher prices. The split was potentially disruptive for many customers, and many analysts and benefit consultants saw the moves as potentially hurting both companies. Both Walgreen and CVS Caremark seem to have blinked, said Dave Shove, an analyst for BMO Capital Markets. “The obvious takeaways are that these folks need to do business with each other, whether they like each other or not,” he said. Without having the details of the new contract, he said it was impossible to know which company gave up more ground in the intense negotiations that came after the Walgreen announcement on June 7. Walgreen would have lost an important source of customers, and CVS Caremark risked its business relationships with employers intent on giving their workers a full choice of drugstores to fill their prescriptions. “There’s too much money at stake,” said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert at the Segal Company, a consultant. “There’s too much for both of them to walk away.” But others saw this as a victory for CVS Caremark because Walgreen was ultimately forced to back down from its threat to stop letting consumers buy their prescriptions through the CVS Caremark plan. “Walgreens tried to force a negotiating situation when they really had no cards,” said George Hill, an analyst at Leerink Swann. “I might even go so far as to say that Walgreen bluffed and CVS called.” What this resolution does not make clear is whether so-called pharmacy benefit managers like CVS Caremark will be able to pursue a business model in which patients will be forced to use a select network of pharmacies. Employers, especially those with many workers in CVS Caremark plans who fill prescriptions at Walgreen, were particularly distressed over the face-off. “Most Americans do not like closed networks when it comes to health care,” said Mr. Shove. Shoppers want to know that if a drugstore cannot fill their prescription, they can easily go to another, he said. Still, some benefit consultants said at least some employers were intrigued by the idea of saving money on prescription drug costs by using a plan limiting the choice of drugstores — in the same way that some health insurers allow patients to use only certain doctors or hospitals. “It’s never really happened on the pharmacy side,” said David Dross, an executive for the consultant Mercer, who advises companies on pharmacy benefits. “I think it’s time for that to happen.” The dispute also raised questions about whether CVS Caremark, because of its dual businesses, was engaging in anticompetitive behavior in the Walgreen showdown. Small drugstore operators have already voiced concerns about the company’s dual roles, and the disagreement with Walgreen drew more attention to those issues. In an earlier statement, Walgreen had complained of “being more of a competitor to CVS drugstores within their network.” CVS Caremark said earlier that it was the subject of inquiries by the Federal Trade Commission, and attorneys general in 24 states. In response to earlier questions, CVS Caremark said it remained “confident that our business practices and service offerings are being conducted in compliance with antitrust laws.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/business/10drug.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">A Dispute Over Filling Prescriptions<date>Published: June 9, 2010</date><text>A fight has broken out between the nation’s biggest drugstore chains, Walgreen and CVS Caremark, potentially affecting where millions of consumers can fill their prescriptions.On Monday, Walgreen, which operates about 7,500 drugstores across the country, announced it would not participate as a prescription drug provider for customers in new drug benefit plans administered by CVS Caremark. CVS Caremark, besides operating more than 7,000 of its own drugstores, is also a leading provider of prescription drug benefit plans that many employers offer workers and their dependents. On Wednesday, CVS Caremark countered the Walgreen move. The company said that anyone now enrolled in its drug benefit plans would have to stop filling their prescriptions at Walgreen within a month. “It’s a real big game of chicken, and I don’t know who’s going to win this one,” said Edward A. Kaplan, a benefits expert at the Segal Company, a consultant to big employers. Mr. Kaplan said he was working with employers to determine how many of their workers might be affected if they were forced to stop using Walgreen under their plans. Smaller drugstore operators had already raised antitrust concerns against CVS Caremark, citing potential conflicts caused by its dual role as a pharmacy chain and a drug plan administrator. The National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent drugstores, said the Federal Trade Commission was investigating its accusations of anti-competitive practices by CVS Caremark. The commission confirmed the investigation but declined to comment on the nature of the inquiry. Attorneys general in 24 states are conducting a similar investigation, according to CVS Caremark. In a statement, CVS Caremark said Wednesday it remained “confident that our business practices and service offerings are being conducted in compliance with antitrust laws.” While CVS Caremark said that the vast majority of customers could easily find a nearby pharmacy other than Walgreen, Mr. Kaplan and other benefits consultants said the standoff could be disruptive. In certain companies, they say, as many as 20 to 30 percent of employees enrolled in plans administered by CVS Caremark are filling their prescriptions at Walgreen. For those corporations, “it is significant,” said David Dross, an executive for the consultant Mercer who advises companies on pharmacy benefits. This dispute, of course, could be brinksmanship of the sort that frequently occurs between health insurance plans and hospitals, in which consumers are threatened with the possibility of their hospital’s being dropped from an insurer’s network until the two parties finally reach an agreement on how much the hospital should be paid. In deciding to drop Walgreen before Walgreen could drop it, CVS Caremark said it was simply reacting to its rival’s attempt to extract higher payments for the drugs that CVS Caremark enrollees buy at its stores. “Walgreen’s announcement was nothing more than a transparent attempt to try to raise the pharmacy reimbursement rates it receives from CVS Caremark,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Besides battling over drugstore customers, Walgreen and CVS Caremark compete to a lesser extent in providing employee drug benefit plans, although CVS Caremark is a much bigger player in that field. The two companies “are effectively choosing to be direct competitors in administering plan benefits as well as prescription drugs,” said George Hill, an analyst with Leerink Swann. Because employers may resist limiting the choice of pharmacies for their workers, the dispute could benefit some competing drug plan managers like Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions, analysts said. In announcing Monday that it would no longer participate in CVS Caremark drug plans, Walgreen said that its rival was essentially using its prescription coverage business to steer patients to its own CVS drugstores, discriminating against competitors. Over time, “we went from being a valued provider within CVS Caremark’s network to, we believe, being more of a competitor to CVS drugstores within their network,” Gregory D. Wasson, the chief executive of Walgreen, said in a phone interview on Wednesday. Certain CVS Caremark drug benefit plans have diverted long-standing customers away from Walgreen and the pharmacists with whom those customers have trusted relationships, Walgreen said. In particular, Walgreen cited Maintenance Choice, a CVS Caremark drug plan that requires people taking long-term medications to refill their prescriptions at a CVS pharmacy or through the company’s mail service — or to pay more, potentially full price, at a competing pharmacy. CVS Caremark said on Wednesday that those plans were meant to provide more choice for workers whose employers would otherwise restrict them to mail-order services for long-term prescriptions. The Walgreen complaints echo some of the concerns that smaller drugstores have raised about CVS Caremark, said B. Kemp Dolliver, a research analyst who follows the industry for Avondale Partners. Mr. Dolliver personally owns stock in two drug benefit competitors to CVS Caremark. The Federal Trade Commission is currently looking into some of the issues raised by the smaller pharmacies, he said, and the Walgreen dispute could draw even more attention to these potential concerns. Independent pharmacists argue CVS Caremark has limited consumers’ choices of where to refill their prescriptions. “When a patient does not have the right to choose the health care provider, in this case the pharmacy that they choose and trust, that’s not good,” said Joseph H. Harmison, the president of the National Community Pharmacists Association, a group representing nearly 23,000 independent community pharmacies and pharmacy chains. Some people who feel intimidated by physicians turn to their local pharmacists for medical advice about their prescriptions, he said. “The pharmacist is often the person a patient will wait to ask the questions to,” he said. Last May, his association filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that CVS Caremark had used its dominant position in the pharmaceutical service industry to eliminate consumer choice and drive consumers away from competing pharmacies. The F.T.C. confirmed Wednesday that it was investigating CVS Caremark, but Richard A. Feinstein, the director of the agency’s bureau of competition said the commission would not comment on the subject of the probe. Consultants and analysts say it is unclear whether the pharmacy benefit business will move toward a business model in which patients will no longer be able to fill their prescriptions at every drugstore but be forced to go to a select group of retailers.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/us/09cncpulse.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">The Pulse: Caremark Triumphs With Lucrative Contract<date>Published: May 8, 2010</date><text>Caremark has won its bid for a huge deal to provide pharmacy services for local government employees, a contest in which Walgreen Co. withdrew after an executive illicitly obtained Caremark’s bidding data. The three-year contract, with two one-year options, covers employees of the City of Chicago, Cook County government, the Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Transit Authority. The total value could reach $800 million, said Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for the school district, which managed the bidding process. For serving the school system’s employees alone, Caremark could be paid as much as $240 million in the next three years, plus another $95 million for the first option year and $100 million in the fifth year of the deal, school board documents show. The Chicago News Cooperative reported in March an unusual incident in which a Walgreen executive obtained Caremark’s financial information, which apparently was left in a room to which all bidders had access.

The ads and promotions started after she bought fertility drugs at a pharmacy in San Diego. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio CVS Corporation IMS Health Incorporated Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times Marcy Campbell Krinsk, who tried fertility drugs but did not become pregnant, later received ads for baby products. Marketers got hold of her name, and she found coupons and samples in her mail that shadowed the growth of an imaginary child  at first, for Pampers and baby formula, then for discounts on family photos, and all the way through the years to gifts suitable for an elementary school graduate. “I had three different in vitro procedures,” said Ms. Krinsk, now 55, a former telecommunications executive who lives with her husband in San Diego. “To just go to the mailbox and get that stuff, time after time after time, it was just awful.” Like many other people, Ms. Krinsk thought that her prescription information was private. But in fact, prescriptions, and all the information on them  including not only the name and dosage of the drug and the name and address of the doctor, but also the patient’s address and Social Security number  are a commodity bought and sold in a murky marketplace, often without the patients’ knowledge or permission. That may change if some little-noted protections from the Obama administration are strictly enforced. The federal stimulus law enacted in February prohibits in most cases the sale of personal health information, with a few exceptions for research and public health measures like tracking flu epidemics. It also tightens rules for telling patients when hackers or health care workers have stolen their Social Security numbers or medical information, as happened to Britney Spears, Maria Shriver and Farrah Fawcett before she died in June. “The new rules will plug some gaping holes in our federal health privacy laws,” said Deven McGraw, a health privacy expert at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. “For the first time, pharmacy benefit managers that handle most prescriptions and banks and contractors that process millions of medical claims will be held accountable for complying with federal privacy and security rules.” The law won’t shut down the medical data mining industry, but there will be more restrictions on using private information without patients’ consent and penalties for civil violations will be increased. Government agencies are still writing new regulations called for in the law. Ms. Krinsk was never able to find out who sold her information, but companies that have been accused in lawsuits of buying and selling personal medical data include drugstore chains like Walgreens and data-mining companies like IMS Health and Verispan. CVS Caremark, which handles prescriptions for corporate clients, has also been accused of violating patients’ privacy. These companies all say that names of patients are removed or encrypted before data is sold, typically to drug manufacturers. But as Ms. Krinsk’s case shows, there are leaks in the system. Before the changes, privacy regulations mainly applied to hospitals and doctors. Enforcement was weak, and there were lots of loopholes. Privacy experts cite research by Latanya Sweeney, director of the Data Privacy Lab at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, which shows that a computer-savvy snooper can easily match names, addresses, Social Security numbers and so on to “re-identify” information that had supposedly been rendered anonymous. “Our biggest concern is the complete lack of protection against re-identifying data that was supposed to be anonymous and secure,” Ms. McGraw said. TRACKING prescriptions has been a big business for decades. Data miners say their research is valuable because gathering and analyzing information from thousands of people helps identify trends and provides indications of potentially dangerous side effects of drugs. “Data stripped of patient identity is an important alternative in health research and managing quality of care,” said Randy Frankel, an IMS vice president. As for the ability to put the names back on anonymous data, he said IMS has “multiple encryptions and various ways of separating information to prevent a patient from being re-identified.” “De-identified health information is our core business,” he said. IMS Health reported operating revenue of $1.05 billion in the first half of 2009, down 10.6 percent from the period a year earlier. Mr. Frankel said he did not expect growing awareness of privacy issues to affect the business. CVS Caremark says it is careful about patient data. “In very limited circumstances, we exchange aggregated, de-identified data with third parties to assist the health care community in understanding patient use of prescription medications with the goal of achieving better health outcomes,” said Carolyn Castel, a company spokeswoman. Selling data to drug manufacturers is still allowed, if patients’ names are removed. But the stimulus law tightens one of the biggest loopholes in the old privacy rules. Pharmacy companies like Walgreens have been able to accept payments from drug makers to mail advice and reminders to customers to take their medications, without obtaining permission. Under the new law, the subsidized marketing is still permitted but it can no longer promote drugs other than those the customer already buys. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 16, 2009 An article last Sunday about the use of consumers’ health information referred incorrectly to Dr. Deborah Peel, a psychiatrist in Austin, Tex.

The ads and promotions started after she bought fertility drugs at a pharmacy in San Diego. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio CVS Corporation IMS Health Incorporated Walgreen Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times Marcy Campbell Krinsk, who tried fertility drugs but did not become pregnant, later received ads for baby products. Marketers got hold of her name, and she found coupons and samples in her mail that shadowed the growth of an imaginary child  at first, for Pampers and baby formula, then for discounts on family photos, and all the way through the years to gifts suitable for an elementary school graduate. “I had three different in vitro procedures,” said Ms. Krinsk, now 55, a former telecommunications executive who lives with her husband in San Diego. “To just go to the mailbox and get that stuff, time after time after time, it was just awful.” Like many other people, Ms. Krinsk thought that her prescription information was private. But in fact, prescriptions, and all the information on them  including not only the name and dosage of the drug and the name and address of the doctor, but also the patient’s address and Social Security number  are a commodity bought and sold in a murky marketplace, often without the patients’ knowledge or permission. That may change if some little-noted protections from the Obama administration are strictly enforced. The federal stimulus law enacted in February prohibits in most cases the sale of personal health information, with a few exceptions for research and public health measures like tracking flu epidemics. It also tightens rules for telling patients when hackers or health care workers have stolen their Social Security numbers or medical information, as happened to Britney Spears, Maria Shriver and Farrah Fawcett before she died in June. “The new rules will plug some gaping holes in our federal health privacy laws,” said Deven McGraw, a health privacy expert at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington. “For the first time, pharmacy benefit managers that handle most prescriptions and banks and contractors that process millions of medical claims will be held accountable for complying with federal privacy and security rules.” The law won’t shut down the medical data mining industry, but there will be more restrictions on using private information without patients’ consent and penalties for civil violations will be increased. Government agencies are still writing new regulations called for in the law. Ms. Krinsk was never able to find out who sold her information, but companies that have been accused in lawsuits of buying and selling personal medical data include drugstore chains like Walgreens and data-mining companies like IMS Health and Verispan. CVS Caremark, which handles prescriptions for corporate clients, has also been accused of violating patients’ privacy. These companies all say that names of patients are removed or encrypted before data is sold, typically to drug manufacturers. But as Ms. Krinsk’s case shows, there are leaks in the system. Before the changes, privacy regulations mainly applied to hospitals and doctors. Enforcement was weak, and there were lots of loopholes.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio CVS Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Elaine, a character in Seinfeld, played by Julia-Louis Dreyfus, hoarded sponges. Above, the Today Sponge in its new form. And this time it is repackaged for a younger generation who may not remember the Today Sponge  or the 1995 episode of “Seinfeld” in which Elaine hoarded her stash, for use only with boyfriends she deemed “spongeworthy.” At one time the Today Sponge, a spermicide-coated polyurethane barrier placed in the vagina to inhibit sperm, was the most popular form of over-the-counter birth control for women. Now, a new distributor is introducing it again this weekend, hoping to reclaim that status. Introduced in 1983, the sponge first disappeared from drugstores in 1994 after some manufacturing problems. It reappeared in 2005 under new ownership, which spent millions to promote the brand before selling it to another company. That new proprietor declared bankruptcy in late 2007, taking the Today Sponge out of production last year. Left stranded were any number of loyal devotees who describe themselves as “sponge fans,” eagerly awaiting its latest comeback. “I was completely devastated when it disappeared the first time,” said Louise Rozett, a freelance book editor in Brooklyn, who had used the sponge to avoid hormone-based birth control pills. “I was so angry when it disappeared again.” The new distributor hopes to bring some stability to the brand. The Today Sponge is scheduled to go on sale by this weekend at 6,500 CVS and Longs Drug Stores, the distributor said. This summer, it is scheduled to also go on sale at 6,700 Walgreens stores. Notably, though, for all of the product’s pop-culture spongeworthiness, the new distributor has only modest sales expectations. Compared with the birth control pill and condoms, the Today Sponge may generate comparatively little revenue. It can have a failure rate of more than 10 percent. And it does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. “I think the previous owners thought, ‘It’s such an iconic brand thanks to Seinfeld, it’s going to be swept off the shelves,’ ” said David Mayer, president of Mayer Laboratories in Berkeley, Calif., the distributor, whose company also makes the Kimono brand of condoms. “I think the sponge has a place, but it’s not going to become the be-all to all women.” At its height, when the brand’s original maker spent $10 million a year on advertising, the brand had annual wholesale revenue of $22 million, Mr. Mayer said. But he expects significantly decreased sales now. This is partly because his company plans to spend only $1 million on advertising this year. Another reason is that health experts who once thought the spermicide component inhibited sexually transmitted diseases now warn that the material may actually increase the risk of transmission, he said. If the reintroduction of the sponge attracts both new customers and its previous loyal audience, the brand might now sell two million sponges a year, packaged in boxes of three at a retail price of $14.99, Mr. Mayer said. At a wholesale price of $9 a package, that would work out to about $6 million annually in wholesale revenue  a minuscule amount compared with the nearly $3.5 billion that Americans spent on prescription birth control pills last year, according to IMS Health, a medical information company. And it would be far behind the approximately $263 million the nation spent on condoms in the last 12 months, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research company. Still, past experience indicates that the sponge will have a clientele among women who seek control over their own contraceptives and the convenience of a product that does not require a doctor’s prescription. And whatever its business prospects in 2009, the Today Sponge has a cultural status that transcends its role as a mere drugstore convenience. The “Seinfeld” riff helped recast birth control not as a medical decision but a lifestyle choice, suggesting a brand marketing strategy later employed by estrogen pills like Seasonale and Yaz. Moreover, despite a popular culture that freely discusses and depicts sex, “spongeworthy” has come to symbolize the rare, successful comedic send-up of pregnancy prevention. “Every one who is sexually active and has used birth control has a bad birth-control story,” said Andrea Tone, the author of “Devices and Desires: A History of Contraceptives in America” who hold the Canada research chair in the social history of medicine at McGill University in Montreal. But “we don’t do great condom scenes or great diaphragms on the ceiling scenes, even though it’s such great material for comedy.” Originally developed in the 1980s, the Today Sponge was pulled off the market in 1994 after inspectors from the Food and Drug Administration found bacterial contamination at its manufacturing plant. The brand’s owner at the time, Whitehall-Robins Healthcare, decided that the brand’s revenue was too small to justify bringing the plant into line with manufacturing standards, according to an F.D.A. statement at the time. Then came its brief revival, ending in bankruptcy. “Women become fond of certain devices and then what do you do when it is discontinued?” said Dr. Troy, the medical historian. She recounted shipping a few “sponge care packages” from Canada, where she said the Today Sponge had remained continuously on sale since 2003, to friends in the United States. “The sponge was popular enough that people missed it,” Dr. Troy said. “And there was enough underground talk about it that there is probably an expected and ready market.” Ms. Rozett in Brooklyn is one of the sponge-ready customers. On Wednesday, she sent an e-mail message to CVS customer service asking when the Today Sponge would go on sale at her local store. “I was so frustrated,” she said, “by the fact that they were giving it to us and taking it away, giving it to us and taking it away.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on May 23, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The contraceptive sponge has bounced back  yet again.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Laura Pedrick for The New York Times At a health clinic in the Kings Market in Allentown, Pa., Fred Bartholomew was seen by Janelle Sharma, a nurse practitioner. Related Wal-Mart Begins to Rebuild Health Clinic Business (May 12, 2009) Add to Portfolio CVS Corporation Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Laura Pedrick for The New York Times The clinic at the Kings Market is run by two regional medical providers, Lehigh Valley Health Network and Geisinger Clinic. Around the country, hospitals are now affiliated with more than 25 Wal-Mart clinics. The Cleveland Clinic has lent its name and backup services to a string of CVS drugstore clinics in northeastern Ohio. And the Mayo Clinic is in the game, operating one Express Care clinic at a supermarket in Rochester, Minn., and a second one across town at a shopping mall. Many primary-care doctors still denigrate the retail clinics as cheap, unworthy competitors. But hospitals see the clinics as a way to reach more patients and expand their business. And they argue that as President Obama and Congress warn of a shortage of primary-care physicians, the hospital-linked retail clinics are filling a vital public need. The walk-in centers help clear hospital emergency rooms of people seeking only basic medical care, like antibiotics for strep throat. But in contrast to E.R.’s, which in many states cannot legally turn away those unable to pay, the retail clinics typically serve only patients with insurance or money. And even if $77 throat cultures or $30 physicals do not represent a vast new source of profit for hospitals, retail clinics can play a marketing role, helping establish relationships with customers who may eventually need more lucrative in-hospital care. Consumers who use the clinics are often “exactly the customers that hospitals want  women of child-bearing age,” said Margaret Laws, a policy expert at the California Health Care Foundation. “The hospitals want to deliver babies,” she said. The idea of retail clinics took root about four years ago, and more than 1,000 are now operating around the country in drugstores, supermarkets and big-box discounters. But in the early going, few were linked to hospitals or medical centers. Now, though, about 1 in 10 has a hospital connection, according to Merchant Medicine News, an online newsletter for the clinic industry. And many more are planned. Wal-Mart, for instance, which opened its 26th hospital-connected clinic last week in Republic, Mo., in the Ozarks, says it will add dozens more in the coming months. Its hospital partners include the Christus Medical Group, in Texas; the Aurora Health System, in Wisconsin, and CoxHealth in Missouri. The Mayo Clinic, the largest private employer in Minnesota, says it opened its clinics after hearing employees and patients say they wanted more convenient treatment for minor medical problems. “We think of ourselves as a new model of care; we meet our patients at least halfway,” said Dr. David Herman, a Mayo executive who supervises the two retail clinics  along with six Mayo primary-care doctors’ offices that are now open late and on weekends. He said hospital and health care systems like Mayo should consider demand for walk-in clinics a sign that “maybe our primary-care practices in general are not as convenient and transparent as our patients want them to be.” Typically staffed by physician assistants or nurse practitioners, often supervised remotely by doctors, the hospital retail clinics can operate at relatively low cost compared with primary-care doctors’ offices or emergency rooms. The lower fees make them especially attractive right now, as an estimated 45 million to 50 million people in this country lack insurance, and the ranks of the unemployed are growing by the month. According to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, 11 percent of adults said they or someone in their immediate family had used a store clinic in the last 10 months, up from 7 percent a year earlier. “The economics in the health system are broken,” said Dr. Brian Nester, a senior vice president at the Lehigh Valley Health Network, part of a three-hospital system in Allentown, Pa., and nearby Bethlehem. “We need to find out how clinics with nurse practitioners and physicians assistants will fit in.” Lehigh Valley Health, in a collaboration with a big regional medical provider, Geisinger Clinic, operates retail clinics in two supermarkets. One recent afternoon, Melissa Marrero, 33, a social worker, and her husband Magdiel, 32, a security guard, walked in without an appointment to the King’s Market clinic in an Allentown mall. The Marreros, who are uninsured, needed physicals for their application to become foster parents. The clinic charges $30 for a physical. “It was great  fast service and real convenient,” Ms. Marrero said afterward. Janelle Sharma, the nurse practitioner in charge, said that more than one-third of the clinic’s patients were uninsured. For several years the doctors affiliated with Lehigh Valley Health opposed the hospital’s plan to start a supermarket clinic. The physicians relented after the Geisinger version showed up on their turf and Lehigh Valley Health promised that patients treated in stores would be urged to follow up with a local doctor. Dr. Will Miller, the chairman of family medicine doctors with practicing privileges at Lehigh Valley Health’s hospital in Allentown, said he still opposed the clinics. They work against the ideal of a primary-care doctor’s office that gets to know a patient’s medical needs and condition over time and coordinates his or her care, he said. Dr. John VanBrakle, the hospital’s chairman of pediatrics, noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics, a professional organization, opposed the clinics for the same reason. In some ways, the resistance of primary-care doctors might be more about principle than practice. As policy makers in Washington bemoan the shortage of such physicians, it may be difficult for doctors in many parts of the country to persuasively argue that the retail clinics pose serious competition. Dr. VanBrakle said local pediatricians in the Lehigh Valley had not, in fact, noticed the retail clinic’s having any impact on their practices. “The vast majority don’t feel very strongly about it one way or the other,” he said. Dr. Herman, of Mayo, says that rather than buck the trend, primary-care doctors should learn from it. He predicts that small groups of primary-care doctors around the country will begin working with hospitals to offer some of the same inducements as store clinics  like convenient locations and more consumer-friendly office hours, including periods of walk-in care requiring no appointment. The primary-care doctors, he said, should try to beat the store clinics at their own game. As for the ones that lack a hospital connection, "It will make it more difficult for them," Dr. Herman said.

Related Wal-Mart Begins to Rebuild Health Clinic Business (May 12, 2009) Add to Portfolio CVS Corporation Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Laura Pedrick for The New York Times The clinic at the Kings Market is run by two regional medical providers, Lehigh Valley Health Network and Geisinger Clinic. Around the country, hospitals are now affiliated with more than 25 Wal-Mart clinics. The Cleveland Clinic has lent its name and backup services to a string of CVS drugstore clinics in northeastern Ohio. And the Mayo Clinic is in the game, operating one Express Care clinic at a supermarket in Rochester, Minn., and a second one across town at a shopping mall. Many primary-care doctors still denigrate the retail clinics as cheap, unworthy competitors. But hospitals see the clinics as a way to reach more patients and expand their business. And they argue that as President Obama and Congress warn of a shortage of primary-care physicians, the hospital-linked retail clinics are filling a vital public need. The walk-in centers help clear hospital emergency rooms of people seeking only basic medical care, like antibiotics for strep throat. But in contrast to E.R.’s, which in many states cannot legally turn away those unable to pay, the retail clinics typically serve only patients with insurance or money. And even if $77 throat cultures or $30 physicals do not represent a vast new source of profit for hospitals, retail clinics can play a marketing role, helping establish relationships with customers who may eventually need more lucrative in-hospital care. Consumers who use the clinics are often “exactly the customers that hospitals want  women of child-bearing age,” said Margaret Laws, a policy expert at the California Health Care Foundation. “The hospitals want to deliver babies,” she said. The idea of retail clinics took root about four years ago, and more than 1,000 are now operating around the country in drugstores, supermarkets and big-box discounters. But in the early going, few were linked to hospitals or medical centers. Now, though, about 1 in 10 has a hospital connection, according to Merchant Medicine News, an online newsletter for the clinic industry. And many more are planned. Wal-Mart, for instance, which opened its 26th hospital-connected clinic last week in Republic, Mo., in the Ozarks, says it will add dozens more in the coming months. Its hospital partners include the Christus Medical Group, in Texas; the Aurora Health System, in Wisconsin, and CoxHealth in Missouri. The Mayo Clinic, the largest private employer in Minnesota, says it opened its clinics after hearing employees and patients say they wanted more convenient treatment for minor medical problems. “We think of ourselves as a new model of care; we meet our patients at least halfway,” said Dr. David Herman, a Mayo executive who supervises the two retail clinics  along with six Mayo primary-care doctors’ offices that are now open late and on weekends. He said hospital and health care systems like Mayo should consider demand for walk-in clinics a sign that “maybe our primary-care practices in general are not as convenient and transparent as our patients want them to be.” Typically staffed by physician assistants or nurse practitioners, often supervised remotely by doctors, the hospital retail clinics can operate at relatively low cost compared with primary-care doctors’ offices or emergency rooms. The lower fees make them especially attractive right now, as an estimated 45 million to 50 million people in this country lack insurance, and the ranks of the unemployed are growing by the month. According to a recent survey by Harris Interactive, 11 percent of adults said they or someone in their immediate family had used a store clinic in the last 10 months, up from 7 percent a year earlier. “The economics in the health system are broken,” said Dr. Brian Nester, a senior vice president at the Lehigh Valley Health Network, part of a three-hospital system in Allentown, Pa., and nearby Bethlehem. “We need to find out how clinics with nurse practitioners and physicians assistants will fit in.” Lehigh Valley Health, in a collaboration with a big regional medical provider, Geisinger Clinic, operates retail clinics in two supermarkets. One recent afternoon, Melissa Marrero, 33, a social worker, and her husband Magdiel, 32, a security guard, walked in without an appointment to the King’s Market clinic in an Allentown mall. The Marreros, who are uninsured, needed physicals for their application to become foster parents. The clinic charges $30 for a physical. “It was great  fast service and real convenient,” Ms. Marrero said afterward. Janelle Sharma, the nurse practitioner in charge, said that more than one-third of the clinic’s patients were uninsured. For several years the doctors affiliated with Lehigh Valley Health opposed the hospital’s plan to start a supermarket clinic. The physicians relented after the Geisinger version showed up on their turf and Lehigh Valley Health promised that patients treated in stores would be urged to follow up with a local doctor. Dr. Will Miller, the chairman of family medicine doctors with practicing privileges at Lehigh Valley Health’s hospital in Allentown, said he still opposed the clinics. They work against the ideal of a primary-care doctor’s office that gets to know a patient’s medical needs and condition over time and coordinates his or her care, he said. Dr. John VanBrakle, the hospital’s chairman of pediatrics, noted that the American Academy of Pediatrics, a professional organization, opposed the clinics for the same reason. In some ways, the resistance of primary-care doctors might be more about principle than practice. As policy makers in Washington bemoan the shortage of such physicians, it may be difficult for doctors in many parts of the country to persuasively argue that the retail clinics pose serious competition. Dr. VanBrakle said local pediatricians in the Lehigh Valley had not, in fact, noticed the retail clinic’s having any impact on their practices. “The vast majority don’t feel very strongly about it one way or the other,” he said. Dr. Herman, of Mayo, says that rather than buck the trend, primary-care doctors should learn from it. He predicts that small groups of primary-care doctors around the country will begin working with hospitals to offer some of the same inducements as store clinics  like convenient locations and more consumer-friendly office hours, including periods of walk-in care requiring no appointment. The primary-care doctors, he said, should try to beat the store clinics at their own game. As for the ones that lack a hospital connection, "It will make it more difficult for them," Dr. Herman said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/09walgreen.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Walgreen Withdraws Offer for Longs Drug<date>Published: October 8, 2008</date><text>The drugstore chain Walgreen said Wednesday that it had withdrawn its $2.8 billion bid to acquire Longs Drug Stores, apparently easing the path for Longs’s $2.7 billion acquisition by a rival, the CVS Caremark Corporation.

The attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, said on Thursday that he sent his staff to 1,000 pharmacies across the state in March, April and May and found expired items  including milk, eggs, infant formula and common medications  at more than 250 stores across the state, including 50 in New York City. Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Manhattan that the two worst offenders were Rite Aid and CVS, where investigators bought more than 600 items  though typically only one or two per store  that had expired. Many of the items were intended for children. “Consumers deserve what they pay for,” Mr. Cuomo said. Doctors said on Thursday that consumers would not be poisoned by taking expired medication like allergy remedies, Tylenol or cough syrup, but that the medicine might have lost its potency and might not be as effective as it should be. “I don’t think parents need to panic and think, ‘Oh, my goodness, I inadvertently harmed my child,’ ” said Catherine Tom, clinical pharmacy manager of the children’s hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, in an interview on Thursday. “More important, I think, is that the child may not get the full benefit of the medication.” Ms. Tom, who was not part of Mr. Cuomo’s investigation, said the risks also depended on how far past the expiration date the medication was, adding that two years was probably enough to reduce potency. Most of the expired medications found in the survey had expired just a month or a few months before investigators purchased them. The oldest products found in New York City were at a CVS at 224 East 161st Street in the Bronx, which was selling Bayer aspirin from January and March 2006 and Nuprin from February 2006, according to the survey. That was also the New York City drugstore with the most expired items, nine. It was followed by a Rite Aid at 7 Madison Street, on the Lower East Side, which had eight expired items, including cold and allergy tablets, sinus medication, acetaminophen and nasal decongestant, the survey found. The drugstore chains did not contest Mr. Cuomo’s findings. They said that keeping expired products on their shelves was a violation of company policy and that they would cooperate with Mr. Cuomo’s office to fix the problem. “We value the trust our customers have placed in us to sell them products that are safe and effective, and the findings of New York’s attorney general are unacceptable to us,” Michael J. DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, said in a written statement. Ashley Flower, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, said the company was checking the expiration dates of products in every store in New York and across the country. “We take the allegations in the New York attorney general’s letter very seriously,” she said. Mr. Cuomo said he had sent letters to Rite Aid and CVS on Thursday threatening legal action unless they fixed the problem. His assistants said that such action could range from a settlement to a civil lawsuit. They said a settlement might typically include fines, which could reach up to $500 for each expired product found, the development of a code of conduct, and a plan to monitor the drugstores for compliance. Mr. Cuomo’s letter to CVS said the company had violated the terms of a 2003 settlement with the state attorney general’s office, in which it agreed to refrain from selling expired over-the-counter medications and to put safeguards in place. “This persistent and flagrant defiance of the settlement calls into question CVS’s desire to alter its conduct,” Michael Berlin, a deputy attorney general, wrote to the company in the latest letter threatening litigation. Investigators visited 250 Rite Aid stores and 250 CVS stores, and found at least one expired item at 112 Rite Aids and 142 CVS stores in 41 counties, or 57 percent of the CVS stores and 45 percent of the Rite Aid stores. Of those, expired products were found at 28 CVS stores and 22 Rite Aids in New York City. Most of the medications had expired in 2007 and 2008. Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

A crucial drug, H.P. Acthar Gel, that had been selling for $1,600 a vial would now cost $23,000. The price increase, put in place over last Labor Day weekend, also jolted employers that provide health benefits to their workers and bear the brunt of drug costs. As it turned out, the exclusive distributor of H.P. Acthar Gel is Express Scripts, a company whose core business is supposed to be helping employers manage their drug insurance programs and get medicines at the best available prices. But in recent years, drug benefit managers like Express Scripts have built lucrative side businesses seemingly at odds with that best-price mission. A growing portion of their revenue comes from acting as exclusive or semi-exclusive distributors of expensive specialty drugs that can cost thousands of dollars. And the prices of such medicines are rising much faster than for the mainstream prescription drugs available through a wide variety of distributors. Critics say that distributing specialty drugs with ever-higher prices runs counter to the best interests of the employers that hire companies like Express Scripts. ''We are headed right down into conflict alley with these exclusive arrangements,'' said Gerry Purcell, an Atlanta-based health benefits consultant to big employers. As exclusive or semi-exclusive distributors of specialty drugs, the benefit managers ''can raise the prices at will,'' Mr. Purcell said, ''and the employer will have little chance but to pay the bill.'' Express Scripts' main competitors, CVSCaremark and Medco Health Solutions, have also built lucrative side businesses in specialty drugs. So have some of the biggest insurers that provide medical benefits to corporate America, including UnitedHealth Group, Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna. When asked about the potential conflicts, Express Scripts and the other companies -- which are known as pharmacy benefit managers -- tend to describe themselves as mere middlemen with little influence over what the drug makers choose to charge. Steve Miller, an Express Scripts executive vice president, said of the H.P. Acthar Gel episode: ''The increase was a manufacturing decision. I can't comment on that.'' The pharmacy benefit managers say that keeping a lid on employers' drug costs is still their top priority. And they defend their involvement with specialty drugs, saying it helps them keep better track of the medicines' use. ''I don't believe it is a conflict,'' said Dave Rickard, an executive vice president of CVS Caremark. ''We saved clients $115 million last year that would have been spent on specialty drugs that were not appropriate.'' But CVS Caremark, meanwhile, sold nearly $6 billion in specialty drugs last year through its pharmacy benefit management business -- nearly 14 percent of the company's annual revenue. The main drug benefit managers make as much as 10 to 15 percent on each sale of a specialty drug, whose prices can range from $5,000 a year for certain anemia drugs to $389,000 in the case of Soliris, a drug for a rare blood disorder, whose distributors include Express Scripts' specialty drug unit, CuraScript. Spending on specialty drugs rose 16.5 percent in 2006, growing twice as fast as traditional drug spending, and totaled about $62 billion -- which was about 23 percent of overall drug sales in this country, according to Charles Boorady, a Citigroup health care analyst. Big employers and organizations including General Motors, Caterpillar and Calpers, the large California public employees health and pension group, say their spending on specialty drugs is growing at double the rate of the rest of their drug benefits for employees. In some cases, employers are starting to push back. A group of large- and medium-size companies like Kinder Morgan Energy, a Houston pipeline company, and Enodis, an international restaurant equipment maker with United States headquarters in Florida, recently pushed CVS Caremark to agree to hand back $15 to the employers on each prescription filled for all specialty drugs listed in a Caremark contract.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/17/business/17retail.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Retailers Get Stingy With Data<date>Published: April 17, 2008</date><text>J. C. Penney says the tumultuous economy is making it impossible to predict earnings over the next year. Macy’s asserts that providing monthly sales information is too distracting and confusing. And Starbucks argues that annual profit estimates are unnecessary. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Josh Haner/The New York Times Susan Koval of Buffalo browses at J. C. Penney. Penney said Wednesday it would stop offering annual profit estimates. It will still provide monthly sales and quarterly profit estimates. In American retailing, less is suddenly more  at least when it comes to giving investors the sort of financial information they have long expected from companies. Faced with an economic slump, a growing number of national retailers are abandoning the longstanding tradition of reporting monthly store sales and forecasting annual profits. The stores say that they are eliminating outdated practices that encourage short-term decision-making and can confuse investors. But many Wall Street analysts and investors, who rely on these numbers to gauge a company’s health and the mood of the American consumer, are crying foul. The motive for providing less financial insight, they suspect, is to avoid issuing embarrassing numbers in the middle of a recession, numbers that can drive down a company’s stock price. So far this year, Starbucks, Macy’s, CVS Caremark and Jos. A. Bank have ditched one or both of the financial reporting practices that were once standard in retailing. And on Wednesday, J. C. Penney joined the list, saying it would stop offering annual profit estimates, known in the industry as guidance, at least for now. (It will still provide monthly sales and quarterly profit estimates.) Myron E. Ullman, the chief executive of J. C. Penney, said that with the housing market in turmoil and gas prices surging, “there is not enough visibility to give something meaningful.” The analysts who track J. C. Penney and the rest of the retail business can barely contain their frustration with all the lip zipping. “Withholding information is not what investors want,” said Bill Dreher, a longtime retail analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. “They want clarity.” A tough economy, Mr. Dreher added, “is a time to be more communicative, not a time to deprive us of guidance or clamp down on information.” Though they have no legal obligation to do so, most publicly traded retail companies divulge their monthly sales performance and offer an estimate of their annual profits, with the figures becoming guideposts for Wall Street, economists and investors. The profit forecasts allow stores to set reasonable expectations for investors, and minimize the chances for surprises, which Wall Street tends to dislike. The monthly sales figures from retailers are especially valuable to economists, because they provide a regular snapshot of consumer finances and confidence. The first Thursday of every month, dozens of chains disclose how much sales rose or fell at stores open at least one year, a figure known as same-store sales. “It’s a barometer of the economy and a benchmark for the industry,” said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group. But monthly sales have become controversial within retailing. Stores say they encourage employees to make decisions that bolster sales within a given month, even if they may hurt the company over time. And some retailers argue that frequent quirks in the calendar can skew the numbers from one month to the next, creating a false impression of strong or weak performance. That is what happened at chains like Macy’s during the 2007 holiday season. Because Thanksgiving occurred a week earlier than normal last year, one week of holiday shopping shifted from December to November. As a result, reported sales surged in November and plunged in December. Macy’s sales, for example, rose 13.4 percent in November 2007, but fell 7.9 percent in December. When the latter figure came out, Macy’s stock fell more than 6 percent in two days. Despite warnings about the calendar shift, many investors were surprised by the December numbers. Executives at Macy’s found this agonizing  and said it contributed to their decision to stop reporting monthly store sales after January 2008. “The numbers are increasingly confusing because of the calendar shifts,” said Jim Sluzewski, a spokesman for Macy’s. He added that the monthly numbers encourage “a short-term orientation, which is not the way to run a business.” But analysts suspect another motivation for Macy’s: weak performance. The department store chain, which has experienced ups and downs since its merger with May Department Stores in 2005, reported sales declined in seven out of the last nine months that it provided such figures. It was not until Starbucks ran into business problems, in January, that it stopped offering annual profit forecasts and same-store sales for its coffee shops. With the chain experimenting with a variety of changes, like closing stores and dropping warm breakfast sandwiches, the chief executive, Howard Schultz, said monthly sales “will not be an effective indicator of our performance.” Mr. Schultz said he would consider offering a quarterly same-store sales figure, but no decision has been made so far. “The less said the better,” said Mr. Niemira, of the shopping council, summing up the new prevailing wisdom. But clamming up can backfire for companies. In mid-2006, as the housing market began to slip, Home Depot said it would no longer disclose same-store sales, which it issued every quarter alongside its earnings. The company said the figure was becoming less relevant, since Home Depot was branching out into new businesses, like a supply division focused on lumber and cement. But investors balked. Soon, Home Depot reversed itself and began offering same-store sales figures. So far, there is no sign that Macy’s, Starbucks or J. C. Penney will face similar revolts. But analysts are making their displeasure known. “Small investors will be hurt because they will not have as much information,” said Walter Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a retail consulting firm.

Macy’s asserts that providing monthly sales information is too distracting and confusing. And Starbucks argues that annual profit estimates are unnecessary. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Josh Haner/The New York Times Susan Koval of Buffalo browses at J. C. Penney. Penney said Wednesday it would stop offering annual profit estimates. It will still provide monthly sales and quarterly profit estimates. In American retailing, less is suddenly more  at least when it comes to giving investors the sort of financial information they have long expected from companies. Faced with an economic slump, a growing number of national retailers are abandoning the longstanding tradition of reporting monthly store sales and forecasting annual profits. The stores say that they are eliminating outdated practices that encourage short-term decision-making and can confuse investors. But many Wall Street analysts and investors, who rely on these numbers to gauge a company’s health and the mood of the American consumer, are crying foul. The motive for providing less financial insight, they suspect, is to avoid issuing embarrassing numbers in the middle of a recession, numbers that can drive down a company’s stock price. So far this year, Starbucks, Macy’s, CVS Caremark and Jos. A. Bank have ditched one or both of the financial reporting practices that were once standard in retailing. And on Wednesday, J. C. Penney joined the list, saying it would stop offering annual profit estimates, known in the industry as guidance, at least for now.

The settlement in the case, the first of its kind for a retail pharmacy company, came after a lengthy investigation that began in 2001, when a suburban Chicago pharmacist alerted authorities. Lawyers said that CVS, the nation’s largest pharmacy chain, gave Medicaid patients capsules of Ranitidine, a generic version of the heartburn medication Zantac, instead of tablets, which are less expensive than the generic capsules. Both generic versions of the medication have the same active ingredient. Authorities said the switch was illegal and allowed the company to charge state Medicaid programs more than four times as much for each pill, leading to a bigger profit. CVS, which admitted no wrongdoing in the case, said money had nothing to do with its dispensing decisions. “For many years, the company purchased and stocked the capsule form of Ranitidine across its chain of retail stores for dispensing to all patients, not just Medicaid recipients, due to the fact that the acquisition cost of capsules was lower than the cost of tablets,” executives said in a statement. Still, the two versions of the medication are technically considered different drugs, said Michael I. Behn, a Chicago lawyer who represented the whistle-blower in the case. “Legally, switching tablets for capsules is the same as switching Zantac for Prozac,” he said. “A prescription for a tablet is not a scrip for the capsule, just as a price for the tablet is not the price for the capsule.” CVS, which has about 6,200 stores, said the settlement would not affect its 2008 earnings.

The buyer was stunned until Mr. Leventhal pulled a prototype out of his briefcase. The product, called NXT, is sold in an arresting triangular container that lights up from the bottom, illuminating air bubbles suspended in the clear gel. The plastic is tinted blue, and when the AAA batteries in its base are lighted, the whole thing looks like a miniature lava lamp or a tiny fishless aquarium. The novelty of the light-up container worked, and NXT’s shaving gel  as well as its after-shave and face wash, similarly packaged  will hit the shelves at Target this month. It will also arrive at other retailers like Wal-Mart, CVS, Duane Reade, Winn-Dixie and Fred Meyer. To call attention to themselves, the products, which are aimed at 18- to 24-year-old men, will glow on the shelves, inviting customers to pick them up. Every 15 seconds, a light-emitting diode (LED) in the bottom of the container flares on, stays lighted for a few seconds, then fades out.  When brands get creative with packaging, the innovations are usually a one-two punch combined with advertising. That’s what Coors Light did with its labels that turn blue when properly chilled, and what Huggies did with a children’s hand soap that has a built-in light that flashes for the recommended hand-washing duration of 20 seconds. But Mr. Leventhal believes the packaging of NXT (pronounced “next”) is powerful enough to speak for itself. “It’s impossible for a new brand to spend like a Unilever or a Procter &amp; Gamble,” on promotions, said Mr. Leventhal, whose privately held company, Clio Designs, has manufactured a line of women’s electric shavers since 2002. “We as a new company could go out and raise $200 million in venture capital, but that would be ludicrous  why spend $100 million on advertising that’s speculative at best?” Such talk may send a chill through advertising agencies and media outlets, but retailers who see the new containers can barely contain themselves. “The packaging was more advanced than anything we’d seen before,” Andrea Harrison, category manager for men’s shaving at CVS, wrote in an e-mail response to questions. Ms. Harrison, describing NXT as having an “almost nightclub-friendly appearance,” said that at CVS, “we consider whether a product in a given package can have impact on our shelf, and this was potentially an impact on a new level.” While most brands want to be placed at eye level or higher, Mr. Leventhal said the ideal shelf location for NXT is lower. “When you look down at them it’s more dramatic, so what I’m doing is going into retailers and saying, ‘Let’s take the less valuable real estate on the shelf and make it more valuable,’ ” he said. Each NXT light is powered by two or three AAA batteries, and a rolling switch turns off the contraption when it’s upside down or sideways. The light will flash for about a year, so the product is shipped upside-down from its plant in China in boxes that say “This Side Up” in five languages. Mr. Leventhal declined to say how much the lights cost, but said the additional manufacturing cost was less per unit than what many brands spend on advertising. The suggested retail price for the products is $4.99 to $5.99. Lights in NXT products also are meant to telegraph their ingredients. They are formulated for sensitive skin  “generally the most popular variety across all men’s grooming products, from skin care to razors,” according to Ms. Harrison of CVS  but NXT favors the term “light” over “sensitive,” as in Light Shave Gel. “For our young consumer, the term ‘sensitive’ would seem kind of wimpy, ” Mr. Leventhal explained.  The shaving cream is also light on lather, the foam that bursts from the can of brands like Gillette Foamy or that forms when gels like Edge are slathered onto beards. While shaving creams with no lather can still do an excellent job of preventing nicks, foam helps with “tracking,” in industry parlance. Tracking, said Lou Hantman, 85, a chemist who developed shaving cream and other products for Gillette for 50 years  first as an executive and then as a consultant  and who helped formulate the NXT shaving products, is “when you make a sweep down and then you know you’ve been there.” While a thick lather tracks where your razor has been, it makes it harder to know where it’s going, like around goatees or sideburns. “We believe our target market is interested in what we call ‘improved navigation’ around existing facial hair guys want to keep,” Mr. Leventhal said, adding that he is planning to introduce an “improved” shave gel in six months that foams a bit more.

The company added seven new compounds to the list of drugs it sells for $4. Skip to next paragraph Related Helped by Generics, Inflation of Drug Costs Slows (September 21, 2007) But the announcement may give a glimpse of the future at Wal-Mart pharmacies. The company seems to be reaching out to a younger and broader drug clientele as it tries to expand its piece of the nations $250 billion retail pharmaceutical market beyond its current share of 5 to 6 percent. Many of the drugs previously on the Wal-Mart plan were heart, high blood pressure and diabetes drugs commonly used by older people. But yesterday, the company added to its $4 list methylphenidate, a drug for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder that is commonly used for school-age children. Perhaps more significant, Wal-Mart said it would start selling generic versions of two popular birth control pills for $9 a month, appealing to an estimated 11 million women in America, most of them under age 40, who use oral contraceptives. A fertility drug, clomiphene, will also be available for $9, Wal-Mart said. Versions of the two birth control pills  known by the brand names Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen  account for 20 percent of oral contraception prescriptions in this country. Although the average woman would save only $1 at Wal-Mart if she had insurance coverage for the pill, she would save $21 if she did not have coverage. The pills frequently sell for $30. Establishing a new $9 price point for certain generic drugs may prove a crucial step, according to analysts, some of whom have considered Wal-Marts pharmacies an underused asset. What theyve done here is, theyve gotten a bit more aggressive in creating a second tier, said Ronny Gal, who follows the generic drug industry for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. This is a very important development. Rather than just sell for $4 and be stuck with only the cheapest generics, theyve now created a tier and they have a business model for more expensive generics, as well. Mr. Gal predicted that the company might very well add more drugs to the $9 list and, ultimately, create a third, higher-priced, tier. A Wal-Mart senior vice president, John Agwunobi, said that there was more to come, adding that the company planned to grow the program and continue it into the future. Wal-Mart announced the programs expansion yesterday, just over a year after introducing the $4 generic plan. The discounts have prompted similar steps by many other retailers, including Target, which said yesterday that it would match Wal-Marts latest moves. Government economists recently credited the discount pricing plans with contributing to a slowdown of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs, which is currently running at about 1 percent, a three-decade low. Still, two of the nations largest prescription drug retailers, Walgreens and CVS, have said the Wal-Mart promotions have not affected their businesses and they have not matched the discount prices. A spokeswoman for Walgreens said yesterday that the companys share of the nations retail pharmaceutical market had increased a percentage point, to 17 percent, since the Wal-Mart $4 plan began last year. In a conference call with the media and investment analysts yesterday, Wal-Marts chief operating officer, Bill Simon, estimated that the company has saved individual shoppers and the nations overall health care system $610 million since the program began last year. In all, the company said its generic plan would now cover 361 prescriptions representing various formulations of 157 medications, an increase of about 24 prescriptions. Wal-Mart said its $4 program now covered about 40 percent of the prescription drugs sold at its Wal-Mart, Sams Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies. Wal-Mart has sought competitive bids from generic makers for at least some of the products, enabling it to still make money while selling the generics for $4. Two of the drugs the company added to its list yesterday  versions of the heart medication Coreg and the nail-fungus drug Lamisil  only recently became available as generics. Generic drugs are typically sold at small discounts just after their approval before falling to as low as 10 percent of the original brand-name drug cost a year or so later. In this case, however, generic versions of both Coreg and Lamisil have been heavily discounted early because of competition among the numerous generic manufacturers that received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell them. Coreg, used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertension, became available in this country as a generic drug this month. Wal-Mart, which said the brand-name version had been $119 just a month ago, said that its inclusion on the $4 list meant that customers would be saving $115 a prescription. The generic version of Coreg  made by more than a dozen manufacturers  is widely available from various Internet sources at retail prices from $37 to $102. Wal-Mart said that savings on the generic version of Lamisil would be extensive, comparing its $4 price with an average price a month ago of $337 for the branded version. Lamisil, however, has been available as a generic since July. Some retailers were selling it this week for as low as $45.

Versions of the two birth control pills  known by the brand names Ortho Cyclen and Ortho Tri-Cyclen  account for 20 percent of oral contraception prescriptions in this country. Although the average woman would save only $1 at Wal-Mart if she had insurance coverage for the pill, she would save $21 if she did not have coverage. The pills frequently sell for $30. Establishing a new $9 price point for certain generic drugs may prove a crucial step, according to analysts, some of whom have considered Wal-Marts pharmacies an underused asset. What theyve done here is, theyve gotten a bit more aggressive in creating a second tier, said Ronny Gal, who follows the generic drug industry for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. This is a very important development. Rather than just sell for $4 and be stuck with only the cheapest generics, theyve now created a tier and they have a business model for more expensive generics, as well. Mr. Gal predicted that the company might very well add more drugs to the $9 list and, ultimately, create a third, higher-priced, tier. A Wal-Mart senior vice president, John Agwunobi, said that there was more to come, adding that the company planned to grow the program and continue it into the future. Wal-Mart announced the programs expansion yesterday, just over a year after introducing the $4 generic plan. The discounts have prompted similar steps by many other retailers, including Target, which said yesterday that it would match Wal-Marts latest moves. Government economists recently credited the discount pricing plans with contributing to a slowdown of inflation in the Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs, which is currently running at about 1 percent, a three-decade low. Still, two of the nations largest prescription drug retailers, Walgreens and CVS, have said the Wal-Mart promotions have not affected their businesses and they have not matched the discount prices. A spokeswoman for Walgreens said yesterday that the companys share of the nations retail pharmaceutical market had increased a percentage point, to 17 percent, since the Wal-Mart $4 plan began last year. In a conference call with the media and investment analysts yesterday, Wal-Marts chief operating officer, Bill Simon, estimated that the company has saved individual shoppers and the nations overall health care system $610 million since the program began last year. In all, the company said its generic plan would now cover 361 prescriptions representing various formulations of 157 medications, an increase of about 24 prescriptions. Wal-Mart said its $4 program now covered about 40 percent of the prescription drugs sold at its Wal-Mart, Sams Club and Neighborhood Market pharmacies. Wal-Mart has sought competitive bids from generic makers for at least some of the products, enabling it to still make money while selling the generics for $4. Two of the drugs the company added to its list yesterday  versions of the heart medication Coreg and the nail-fungus drug Lamisil  only recently became available as generics. Generic drugs are typically sold at small discounts just after their approval before falling to as low as 10 percent of the original brand-name drug cost a year or so later. In this case, however, generic versions of both Coreg and Lamisil have been heavily discounted early because of competition among the numerous generic manufacturers that received Food and Drug Administration approval to sell them. Coreg, used to treat congestive heart failure and hypertension, became available in this country as a generic drug this month. Wal-Mart, which said the brand-name version had been $119 just a month ago, said that its inclusion on the $4 list meant that customers would be saving $115 a prescription. The generic version of Coreg  made by more than a dozen manufacturers  is widely available from various Internet sources at retail prices from $37 to $102. Wal-Mart said that savings on the generic version of Lamisil would be extensive, comparing its $4 price with an average price a month ago of $337 for the branded version. Lamisil, however, has been available as a generic since July. Some retailers were selling it this week for as low as $45.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/26toyswe.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Store Sweep Finds Some Recalled Toys Still on Shelves<date>Published: August 26, 2007</date><text>What a difference a day makes  at least for county inspectors checking shelves for recalled toys. Skip to next paragraph In the Region Long Island, Westchester, Connecticut and New Jersey Go to Complete Coverage » On Tuesday seven inspectors from the countys Consumer Protection and Health Departments visited 20 stores and found recalled toys on the shelves at Kohls in Port Chester and in Yonkers, KB Toys in Yonkers and CVS in Peekskill. The toys had either lead paint or tiny magnets that could be harmful if swallowed. On Wednesday, the second day of checks, inspectors went to 28 stores and found only two with the recalled toys: Kohls in Bedford Hills and Big K Mart in Yorktown. In both cases, there were far fewer toys than they had seen in the other stores, said Wasi Talib, a county spokeswoman. Vicki Shamion, vice president for public and community relations at Kohls, the national retailer, said the company was surprised and disappointed to learn that recalled toys had been found. She added that if a customer had attempted to buy one, the cashier would have been automatically alerted before the purchase went through. A series of toys have been recalled this month; last week alone the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission issued five recalls (Information is at the state Health Departments Web site, health.state.ny.us.) Mattel has recalled millions of toys, some because they contained small, high-powered magnets that could be a choking hazard and others because they were contaminated by lead paint. Barbie, Polly Pocket, Sarge and various Fisher-Price character toys were among the recalls. (Mattel has posted photographs and information at mattel.com/safety.) Although the recalls announced by the safety commission are voluntary, the state Health Department has ordered that the toys be removed from stores, returned to the manufacturer and destroyed. We dont want to see them next summer at flea markets or discount stores, said Claudia Hutton, a department spokeswoman. We want them gone. The county is urging parents not to throw lead-contaminated toys into the household trash. Instead they ask that they be disposed of at the next Household Chemical Clean-Up Day, which is scheduled for Sept. 15 at the countys recycling center in Yonkers. Ms. Talib said inspectors would continue visiting stores. According to the county executive, this will go on for as long as its necessary, she said.

The company said it hoped to open as many as 150 more clinics in the New York area, which would be staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants. New York law requires that nurse practitioners work closely with a physician, who oversees the practice but is not required to be at the clinic, and that the clinics operate as independent practices or professional corporations. In other states, the medical providers can work directly for a drugstore company, a practice that has touched off concern that the providers might place the interests of their employers above those of patients. MinuteClinic officials insisted that there was nothing improper in the relationships between providers and the drugstores and that medical care is not being compromised. 1 2 Next Page » Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

There is a well-maintained quaintness in Main Street's collection of mom-and-pop shops, restored 19th-century sailor's cottages with screened porches, Federalist two-stories and the occasional Greek Revival building. But near the waterfront, the big drugstore chain CVS has signed a lease with Sag Harbor Building L.L.C., the landlord of a complex of more than a dozen mostly small businesses, including a Pilates exercise studio, a computer store and a physical therapist. In addition, Donald Zucker, a Manhattan developer, has bought a complex of stores across Main Street from CVS, at the corner of Bay Street, where small businesses are worried that their days are numbered. These developments come on the heels of the proposal of three condominium projects within a two-month period in late 2006. In response, the village enacted a building moratorium in May, which gives officials time to develop new zoning laws that would control both residential and commercial development. CVS, the largest drugstore chain in the country, with $41 billion in revenue last year, plans to renovate the complex and open a 17,000-square-foot drugstore in 2009, according to Michael DeAngelis, a CVS spokesman. The CVS store would replace all of the existing businesses at the site and would be more than twice the size of the company's store in the village of East Hampton. Mr. DeAngelis said the company would create a store that fits in with Sag Harbor's historic business district. CVS may find, though, that in Sag Harbor, where the median price for a single-family home in June was $959,000, an ersatz whaling-village facade will not satisfy residents. James Henry, a lawyer who is running for Southampton town supervisor, operates a management consulting firm, Sag Harbor Group, in the complex now slated for the future CVS. He and other tenants have already received terse letters from the landlord's management company, Staller Associates, instructing them to be ready for property inspections. Some have long-term leases that the landlord is trying to break, Mr. Henry said. Sitting behind a big desk in his sunlight-filled office next to the harbor, Mr. Henry, dressed in a cap, T-shirt and shorts, said he was less concerned about his own office space than about a big chain store opening downtown and destroying the charm of an old-fashioned village that drew him from his native Minnesota 20 years ago. In a meeting held by the group he recently formed, Tenants In Common, hundreds of supporters signed petitions, urging the village to amend the zoning code to prohibit large stores. The group is also considering forming a land trust to raise funds to buy the property, Mr. Henry said. Many smaller stores ''are scared to death of having a CVS store around the corner,'' Mr. Henry said. Village residents don't want Sag Harbor to go the way of East Hampton village, he said, where all the small locally owned shops have closed and have been replaced by designer boutiques like Ralph Lauren and Elie Tahari, expensive food shops and restaurants. Barry Marcus, who owns the snug Sag Harbor Pharmacy on Main Street, said a CVS representative came to his store in June offering a cash payout for Mr. Marcus and his partner, Stan Weiss, to close up shop. When Mr. Marcus turned down the offer, the man cautioned that once CVS opens, any future offer would be far lower. ''At that point, I showed him the door and said, 'I never want to see you in this store again,' '' Mr. Marcus said. CVS is not the only outsider that has local business owners worked up. Mr. Zucker, who is doing business in the town under an unusual name, Sag Harbor Pooh, has purchased the complex at Main and Bay, where small businesses like Whaler's Cleaners, Provisions Natural Foods Market and Organic Cafe, and Style Bar Day Spa, have been operating for years. He has also bought at least one other store on Main Street.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/business/09care.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS Profit Increases 24%<date>Published: May 9, 2007</date><text>WOONSOCKET, R.I., May 8 (AP)  The pharmacy services provider CVS/Caremark Corporation said Tuesday that its first-quarter earnings rose 24 percent on strong revenue growth.

The junior investment banker, Hafiz Muhammad Zubair Naseem, 37, who worked in Credit Suisses energy banking group in Manhattan, is accused of calling an unidentified banker in Pakistan and tipping him about deals shortly before they were publicly announced. The Pakistani banker, in turn, traded on that information in accounts owned by Mr. Naseem and himself. He also leaked it to several well-known financial executives in Pakistan, who also profited. All told, the participants made more than $7.5 million, investigators said. The accusations were made in criminal and civil complaints filed late yesterday afternoon by the United States attorneys office in Manhattan and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Naseem, a native of Pakistan who lives in Rye Brook, N.Y., was arrested late yesterday at Credit Suisse offices at Madison Square Park in the Flat Iron District after returning to work from a personal trip to Pakistan, according to people close to the situation. He was taken to the Federal Bureau of Investigations offices in Lower Manhattan, where he emerged, clad in a dark slacks and white shirt, as he was transported to a federal jail in Brooklyn. He is expected to be arraigned today in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The boom in mergers and acquisitions and leveraged buyouts has produced a flurry of suspicious-trading cases. In the last two years, the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have brought several high profile insider-trading cases involving people at top Wall Street banks. One involved a former Goldman Sachs fixed-income trader, a former Merrill Lynch analyst and extended relatives in Croatia. In a case brought this year, the government accused 13 people of passing around illegal information, including Morgan Stanleys former in-house counsel, a former research executive at UBS and several former traders at Bear Stearns. And there are signs the suspicious activity continues. Earlier this week, options trading increased significantly ahead of reports that the News Corporation had offered $5 billion for the Dow Jones Company. The S.E.C has made insider trading ahead of mergers and acquisitions one of its top priorities, Linda Chatman Thomsen, the commissions director of enforcement, said in a statement. But insider-trading cases can be difficult to unravel and hard to prosecute, which makes the speed at which charges were filed in this case remarkable. The TXU transaction, for example, was announced in late February. In todays information age theres at least the perception that some people have more information than others, said Evan Barr, a lawyer at Steptoe &amp; Johnson and a former federal prosecutor. There is a sense among prosecutors that insider trading is a more attractive charge to bring in front of a jury rather than something abstract like accounting fraud. The average juror sees insider trading as someone lining their own pockets. A lawyer for Mr. Naseem, Craig S. Warkol, could not be reached. Mr. Naseem is in the process of being fired by Credit Suisse, according to a person close to the situation. In a statement, Credit Suisse said yesterday that it was shocked and extremely disappointed that an employee would violate not only our trust, but the trust of our clients. The bank said that it immediately brought the activities of this employee to the attention of the relevant authorities and would continue to work with them. After an inquiry from federal investigators in March, Credit Suisse helped identify Mr. Naseem as someone of interest. Although Mr. Naseem continued to work at the bank, he returned to Pakistan for a visit and did not return until a few days ago. He is accused of leaking information about pending deals between April 2006 and this February, prosecutors said. He joined Credit Suisse in March 2006 after a stint at J.P. Morgan. His desk at Credit Suisse was near a printer that turned out documents with information about potential deals for both his group and for others, investigators said. Mr. Naseem regularly and repeatedly called the Pakistani banker at his home and on his cellphone in advance of a potential deal, federal prosecutors and regulators contend. Shortly after receiving such a call, the banker would buy securities based on the news. Then, once a public announcement was made, he would quickly sell. He executed dozens of trades, often in an offshore account. Mr. Naseem authorized the Pakistani banker, who is identified in the criminal complaint as co-conspirator 1 to operate a brokerage account on his behalf, according to the deposition of the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in charge of the case. After confirming in an e-mail message that the banker can do whatever he wants, the agent said that Mr. Naseem concluded one message with the comment: Let the fun begin. The nine deals in the Naseem case included the mergers or buyouts of the Northwestern Corporation, Energy Partners, Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands, Trammell Crow, Hydril Company, Caremark Rx, and the John H. Harland Company. But the most notable one was the $45 billion buyout of TXU. On Feb. 26, TXU said it would be acquired by an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Texas Pacific Group, and Goldman Sachs in what is the biggest buyout deal ever. Credit Suisse, as it was for the other deals, was an adviser. In early February, Mr. Naseem had called the Pakistani bankers cellphone from his office in New York and conveyed to him confidential information about the proposed TXU deal, according to the S.E.C. complaint. He continued to call up until Feb. 23. On that date, the Pakistani banker bought 6,700 call options, which gave him the right to buy TXU shares at a prices between $57.50 and $60 by March 2007, through a brokerage account at UBS in London. When the TXU deal was announced on Feb. 26, its stock shot up $7.91 from the day before, to $67.93. The Pakistani banker realized trading profits of about $5 million, according to the S.E.C. complaint. Other investors similarly benefited,s regulators contend. From Jan. 29 to Feb. 20, Seema and Sunil Seghal, who are believed to be British citizens, bought several hundred TXU call option contracts, which expired in March and April 2007. Together, they made more $271,600 in profits. In late February, Francisco Javier Garcia, believed to be a resident of Switzerland, bought similar TXU securities through Fimat Banque Frankfurt based on inside information, according to the S.E.C. He reaped trading profits of more than $150,500. Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

He is accused of leaking information about pending deals between April 2006 and this February, prosecutors said. He joined Credit Suisse in March 2006 after a stint at J.P. Morgan. His desk at Credit Suisse was near a printer that turned out documents with information about potential deals for both his group and for others, investigators said. Mr. Naseem regularly and repeatedly called the Pakistani banker at his home and on his cellphone in advance of a potential deal, federal prosecutors and regulators contend. Shortly after receiving such a call, the banker would buy securities based on the news. Then, once a public announcement was made, he would quickly sell. He executed dozens of trades, often in an offshore account. Mr. Naseem authorized the Pakistani banker, who is identified in the criminal complaint as co-conspirator 1 to operate a brokerage account on his behalf, according to the deposition of the Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in charge of the case. After confirming in an e-mail message that the banker can do whatever he wants, the agent said that Mr. Naseem concluded one message with the comment: Let the fun begin. The nine deals in the Naseem case included the mergers or buyouts of the Northwestern Corporation, Energy Partners, Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands, Trammell Crow, Hydril Company, Caremark Rx, and the John H. Harland Company. But the most notable one was the $45 billion buyout of TXU. On Feb. 26, TXU said it would be acquired by an investor group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Texas Pacific Group, and Goldman Sachs in what is the biggest buyout deal ever. Credit Suisse, as it was for the other deals, was an adviser. In early February, Mr. Naseem had called the Pakistani bankers cellphone from his office in New York and conveyed to him confidential information about the proposed TXU deal, according to the S.E.C. complaint. He continued to call up until Feb. 23. On that date, the Pakistani banker bought 6,700 call options, which gave him the right to buy TXU shares at a prices between $57.50 and $60 by March 2007, through a brokerage account at UBS in London. When the TXU deal was announced on Feb. 26, its stock shot up $7.91 from the day before, to $67.93. The Pakistani banker realized trading profits of about $5 million, according to the S.E.C. complaint. Other investors similarly benefited,s regulators contend. From Jan. 29 to Feb. 20, Seema and Sunil Seghal, who are believed to be British citizens, bought several hundred TXU call option contracts, which expired in March and April 2007. Together, they made more $271,600 in profits. In late February, Francisco Javier Garcia, believed to be a resident of Switzerland, bought similar TXU securities through Fimat Banque Frankfurt based on inside information, according to the S.E.C. He reaped trading profits of more than $150,500.

The acquisition will produce a $75 billion drug distribution giant that could compete more effectively for customers and drive a harder bargain with drug makers, executives with the companies said. Caremark is the country’s second-largest pharmacy benefits manager and CVS operates the largest retail pharmacy chain. CVS and another distribution company, Express Scripts, have been in a bidding war for months to acquire Caremark. But increased antitrust scrutiny of the Express Scripts proposal and the decision this week not to increase its offer turned the bidding war in CVS’s favor, some analysts said. Caremark announced after a 15-minute shareholder meeting that more than 50 percent of the shares voted were cast in favor of the deal. Company executives said they would not have an exact breakdown on the votes until the tally was certified sometime next week. But they said a “substantial majority” of outstanding shares voted for the deal. There were no stockholder comments at the meeting, which was held in Nashville, where the company is based. The combined company will be called the CVS/Caremark Corporation and will be based in Woonsocket, R.I., where CVS has its headquarters. The deal is expected to close by next week. CVS shareholders approved the stock-and-cash buyout on Thursday. The bid by Express Scripts was slightly higher, valued at about $27.2 billion, but had not been approved by the Federal Trade Commission. The CVS bid has already passed F.T.C. review. Caremark executives favored the CVS deal all along, and cited concerns about F.T.C. approval in rejecting the Express Scripts offer. After the vote Express Scripts issued a statement from the company’s chief executive and chairman, George Paz, thanking stockholders of both Caremark and Express Scripts for considering the Express Scripts proposal.

He said it would add to earnings per share: 8 cents to 10 cents in 2008 and 14 cents to 18 cents in 2009.

In a report, I.S.S. said that with the $7.50 dividend, CVS had increased its offer by 9 percent since Feb. 12, when I.S.S. recommended that Caremark shareholders vote against CVS because of the low premium.

Both CVS and Express Scripts increased their offers for the company, the nation's largest drug benefits manager, in the latest round in a three-month match. On Wednesday, Express Scripts, a rival drug benefits manager, said it would pay interest on the cash portion of its $26.3 billion cash-and-stock bid, but it also said that it expected the Federal Trade Commission to delay approval of its offer. The next day, CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy chain, increased the one-time cash dividend it would pay Caremark shareholders. That raised its offer to about $26 billion-- and it noted that the F.T.C. had already approved its bid.

Caremarks shareholders are set to vote on what CVS called its best and final bid on March 16. Another drug benefits manager, Express Scripts, raised its own bid on Wednesday, but said it expected regulatory delays from the Federal Trade Commission. The advantage appears to lie with CVS. As the nations largest pharmacy chain and not another big drug benefits manger, CVS has emphasized how quickly it can complete its deal. CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., will increase for a third time the one-time cash dividend it will pay shareholders, to $7.50 from $6. In a statement, Caremark, of Nashville, valued the cash part of CVSs new offer at $3.2 billion. CVSs offer would also give Caremark shareholders 1.67 of its shares, for a total of 45.5 percent of the combined company. By contrast, Express Scripts offer, which also consists of cash and stock, remains higher at about $26.3 billion, based on yesterdays closing prices. On Wednesday, the company said it would pay interest of about 6 percent a year on the cash part of its offer from April 1 until a transaction is closed, or until 45 days after receiving regulatory approval. Express Scripts, based in Maryland Heights, Mo., is hoping that this ticking fee will appease Caremark shareholders, who would have to wait several months for a deal to close. Shares in CVS rose 3.5 percent yesterday, to $32.41. Caremark closed at $62.16, up 1.4 percent, and Express Scripts ended up 1.65 percent, at $76. Caremark has consistently supported a deal with CVS since the drug chain announced its bid in November. Caremark said yesterday that its board had reaffirmed its support for the revised CVS offer. None of the participants in this battle have escaped criticism. Caremarks management has come under fire for refusing to entertain Express Scripts higher bid. Some investors and analysts have accused CVS of undervaluing Caremark. And Express Scripts has been criticized for loading itself up with debt to make an offer that may not receive the F.T.C.s blessing. CVS stressed yesterday that its offer had already passed regulatory muster. By contrast, Express Scripts says it expects the F.T.C. to issue a second request for information. Such requests are common when two of the biggest companies in an industry propose merging, though some analysts say antitrust concerns make Express Scripts bid less appealing. In a statement, CVSs chairman, Thomas M. Ryan, said: The Express Scripts offer for Caremark remains fraught with risk, challenges and certain loss of shareholder value. In contrast, our best and final merger proposal provides Caremark shareholders with real and deliverable value, and is based on a compelling strategic rationale. Caremark, in its statement, reiterated its criticism of Express Scripts bid, saying the offer would add too much debt and might not be approved. A spokeswoman for Express Scripts declined to comment.

The company’s announcement came as the Delaware Chancery Court declined to postpone a shareholder vote on a rival $25.7 billion bid from CVS, the nation’s largest pharmacy chain. Express Scripts is now fighting the clock as well as Caremark, which has pressed its shareholders to support the CVS bid at an investors’ meeting on March 16. As an enticement to Caremark shareholders, Express Scripts said it would pay an additional 6 percent a year on the cash portion of its offer, which was announced in December. That payment, called a "ticking fee" in the parlance of corporate deals, would begin to accrue on April 1 and continue through the closing of a transaction with Express Scripts or 45 days after regulators’ approval, whichever comes first. Express Scripts’ offer, at $29.25 cash and the rest in stock, now values Caremark at $61.10 a share. Yesterday, the Caremark shares closed at $61.30. Express Scripts also said yesterday that it expected the Federal Trade Commission to issue a second request for information on its bid. Such requests are not unusual when two of the biggest companies in an industry propose combining, though some analysts say that antitrust concerns are reducing the appeal of Express Scripts’ higher offer for Caremark. Earlier, Express Scripts pulled its offer from regulators and refiled in an effort to gain time and stave off additional scrutiny. Still, the company said it was confident that it could complete an acquisition of Caremark by the third quarter of the year. “This enhanced offer demonstrates our commitment to this transaction and confidence in our ability to consummate it in a timely manner,” George Paz, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. In a statement of its own, CVS said, “Today’s announcement by Express Scripts validates the risky and highly conditional nature of its takeover offer, and serves as a stark reminder to Caremark shareholders of the substantial deficiencies in the Express Scripts bid.” A spokesman for Caremark declined to comment. The F.T.C. did not return telephone calls seeking comment. In a ruling yesterday afternoon, William B. Chandler III, the head of the Delaware Chancery Court, said he would not block Caremark’s shareholder vote on the CVS deal. Late last month, he ruled that Caremark investors had a right to an appraisal of the company’s worth, and that the company had to disclose the fees it was paying to bankers. Caremark subsequently delayed its shareholder meeting by one week to satisfy those requirements. In raising its bid, Express Scripts seeks to prolong an already tough battle for Caremark, a rival twice its size. Both it and CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., have exchanged barbed remarks as they sought to woo shareholders. Since announcing its bid in December, Express Scripts has called on Caremark’s management to meet and discuss the offer. Caremark has so far refused, saying the proposed deal with CVS was a better one. Under pressure from investors and analysts who criticized its original bid as too low, CVS has twice raised its offer through a special cash dividend to Caremark shareholders.

Judge William B. Chandler III of Chancery Court said Caremark must tell investors they have the right to an appraisal of their shares' value and how much bankers will reap in fees from the CVS sale. Caremark can hold a shareholder vote on the sale 20 days after the disclosures, Judge Chandler ruled. Investors sued in December, saying Caremark should consider a higher bid from the drug distributor, Express Scripts. CVS, the drugstore chain, raised its bid this month for Caremark, which is based in Nashville, after Caremark rejected the offer from Express Scripts, now valued at $26.8 billion. CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., and Express Scripts, based in St. Louis, could not be reached for comment.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/business/14caremark.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS Raises Its Bid for Caremark Rx as Judge Delays Vote<date>Published: February 14, 2007</date><text>The battle for Caremark Rx, the pharmacy benefits manager, moved beyond a war of words yesterday as CVS raised its bid for the company for the second time, to $25.7 billion. The new offer, an effort to counter a rival bid from Express Scripts, also a pharmacy benefits manager, came just hours before a Delaware judge made a surprise ruling that will force Caremark to postpone its shareholder vote on the CVS deal from next Tuesday to next month. The ruling, which stemmed from a shareholder lawsuit that contended the CVS-Caremark deal was unfair, will extend an already lengthy brawl and may change the tactics both CVS and Express Scripts had planned to employ over the next several days in their quest to sway shareholders. Investors are still signaling that they expect a bruising bidding war. Shares of Caremark closed at $62.88, above CVS’s new offer, which values the company at $60.26. The bid from Express Scripts is worth $61.08 a share. CVS, a drugstore chain based in Woonsocket, R.I., raised its bid by increasing a cash dividend to shareholders to $6 a share, from $2. CVS had been under pressure from shareholders and investment advisory services to increase its offer. Institutional Shareholder Services and three other firms that advise investors how to vote had come out against the deal before CVS raised its offer. Many of them have criticized Caremark’s refusal to negotiate with Express Scripts. CtW Investment Group, which had previously urged shareholders to reject the deal, maintained the same position after the new offer yesterday. Express Scripts also derided the offer: “Today’s announcement can’t paper over a flawed process, weaker currency and unproven strategic rationale. Caremark stockholders should be disappointed that instead of leveling the playing field and sitting down to discuss our superior proposal to acquire Caremark, the Caremark board continues to ignore its responsibilities to meet with us.” The next stage in the battle is unclear. Express Scripts had planned to raise its bid late yesterday afternoon, but postponed any announcement after the judge’s ruling, people briefed on the decision said yesterday. With the vote now delayed until March 9, it is possible that Express Scripts could wait until the last minute to raise its bid, giving CVS little time to respond. The new timing of the vote could also work against Express Scripts, which is seeking regulatory clearance to pursue the deal. If regulators decide to investigate the deal, they would notify the company before the March 9 vote. If Express Scripts received such notice, that could make a Caremark-Express Scripts deal less appealing to shareholders, giving a boost to CVS. More Articles in Business »The battle for Caremark Rx, the pharmacy benefits manager, moved beyond a war of words yesterday as CVS raised its bid for the company for the second time, to $25.7 billion. The new offer, an effort to counter a rival bid from Express Scripts, also a pharmacy benefits manager, came just hours before a Delaware judge made a surprise ruling that will force Caremark to postpone its shareholder vote on the CVS deal from next Tuesday to next month. The ruling, which stemmed from a shareholder lawsuit that contended the CVS-Caremark deal was unfair, will extend an already lengthy brawl and may change the tactics both CVS and Express Scripts had planned to employ over the next several days in their quest to sway shareholders. Investors are still signaling that they expect a bruising bidding war. Shares of Caremark closed at $62.88, above CVS’s new offer, which values the company at $60.26. The bid from Express Scripts is worth $61.08 a share. CVS, a drugstore chain based in Woonsocket, R.I., raised its bid by increasing a cash dividend to shareholders to $6 a share, from $2. CVS had been under pressure from shareholders and investment advisory services to increase its offer. Institutional Shareholder Services and three other firms that advise investors how to vote had come out against the deal before CVS raised its offer. Many of them have criticized Caremark’s refusal to negotiate with Express Scripts. CtW Investment Group, which had previously urged shareholders to reject the deal, maintained the same position after the new offer yesterday. Express Scripts also derided the offer: “Today’s announcement can’t paper over a flawed process, weaker currency and unproven strategic rationale.

Generally, this means that it makes money by denying benefits of various kinds, especially prescriptions, to patients and employees, thus supposedly saving money for employers and keeping a big chunk of that money for itself. (I know this is an oversimplification, but its basically true.) Skip to next paragraph Philip Anderson Since roughly 1998, Caremark Rxs chief executive has been a wonderful, kindly gentleman named Edwin M. Crawford who revived the company and made it an industry leader. His son, Andrew, also works at the company as the senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting. Roughly one and a half years ago, the elder Mr. Crawford decided to talk to people about a business combination with Caremark. One of the first entities he talked to was the fine drugstore chain CVS, whose Watergate store in Washington is one of my own main hangouts. CVS said it was interested, but only if it acquired Caremark and CVS was the surviving entity. Discussions went on, and Mr. Crawford made sure that as part of the deal, he would be chairman of the new company. Time passed, and serious backdating allegations involving hundreds of millions of dollars of Caremark stock options for Mr. Crawford and his colleagues surfaced; shareholders sued Caremark and Mr. Crawford in Nashville, where the company is based. Last month, the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System also sued Caremark, in Delaware, accusing its officers of favoring themselves over shareholders when considering the CVS offer. According to that suit, Mr. Crawford apparently made it clear that any company acquiring Caremark would have to indemnify him against such claims. CVS agreed to do so. Caremarks board was told that merger talks were going on, but CVS was not mentioned, nor was the board asked to approve specific terms early on. By April 2006, Caremarks executives brought the board into the loop and mentioned CVS, according to the suit. Then, in September, Mr. Crawford told his board by telephone that he thought he might have reached a deal with CVS  though the outline of the deal had apparently been set weeks before, the suit alleges. In October, Medco Health Solutions asked to talk to Mr. Crawford about a deal, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the situation. But the lawsuit says that when Mr. Crawford learned that he and his Caremark directors would not be part of the new company, he blew off the Medco people. In late October, Caremarks directors were briefed on the CVS deal, and were told that they would all, or almost all, be staying on as directors of the new company and that Mr. Crawford would remain chairman, even though the new company would be called CVS and CVS shareholders would own roughly 55 percent of it. In addition, while senior Caremark executives and directors would keep their jobs, the transaction would trigger change-of-control provisions that would shower them with money as if they were all thrown out of work. The deal was approved by the board at the beginning of November and immediately made public. The deal involved CVS paying no premium at all to ordinary Caremark shareholders, but it did call for paying Mr. Crawford more than $50 million, giving his son a major job at CVS and providing him with that indemnity he wanted in the backdating lawsuit. The Caremark owners were originally to get roughly $48.50 a share in CVS stock. (Amid the outcry, CVS last week added a $2-a-share special dividend in cash to be paid after its takeover closes, if it does.) The $48.50 offer came despite two fascinating facts: a month before, Caremark stock traded at $59, and in the third quarter of 2006, Caremark bought back 1.8 million shares of its stock at an average price of about $57  usually a sign that management thinks its a good price. It closed on Friday at $59.31, still well above even the revised CVS offer, suggesting investors think Caremark is worth more and that someone is likely to offer more. The agreement had a breakup fee of $675 million, to be paid to CVS if the deal did not go through. The deal also had a no shop clause preventing Caremark from actively seeking higher offers, although it could consider better offers that arrived unsolicited. 1 2 Next Page » Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist.

Congress acted to rein in oil drillers subsidies, and some of the countrys biggest companies joined traditional foes to address some of the countrys thorniest problems. Skip to next paragraph Douglas Healey/Bloomberg News Walter A. Forbes, formerly of Cendant, was sentenced to 12 years and 7 months in prison for fraud and ordered to pay billions in restitution. The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb. TOUCH AND GO The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. A tight labor market is pushing up many workers wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country. A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nations best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months  on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year. ROLLING BACK BREAKS House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies. The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade. Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Members of the group  which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&amp;E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico  have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels. Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups  including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States  proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. The environmental groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address. BURST OF BUYING General Electric announced a pair of big acquisitions, agreeing to pay $8.13 billion for two Abbott Laboratories diagnostics units and $4.8 billion for Smiths Aerospace, an aviation electronics maker in London. Including its offer earlier in the month to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas drilling services company in Houston, G.E. has committed itself to almost $15 billion worth of takeovers in January alone. The New York Times reported on Jan. 9 that G.E. was in talks to sell its plastics unit, a slow-growing business that could nonetheless sell for as much as $10 billion. Additional deals may have to wait for a decision on the plastics business because G.E.s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said last month that G.E. had $7 billion in cash on hand for industrial acquisitions this year. JUST SAY NO In a rare example of a board denying a request by a controlling shareholder, the directors of Cablevision Systems rejected an $8.9 billion buyout offer from its founding family, the Dolans. The board said in a letter to the family that the offer does not represent fair value for the companys public shareholders nor does it contemplate a transaction that is in their best interest. Cablevision remains publicly owned, but the Dolans, who own 20 percent of its equity but control 70 percent of its votes, have said they will not sell the company to anyone besides themselves. TRIBUNE BIDS Two firm bidders stepped up with offers to buy the Tribune Company, a media company with television stations and newspapers in the nations biggest media markets, but neither offered much of a premium over the companys flagging stock price. One bid came from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, two billionaires in Los Angeles, where the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTTV. The other came from the Chandler family, which sold the Los Angeles paper and several others to Tribune in 2000. A private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, offered to buy only the TV stations. Tribune directors will review the situation this weekend and may ask for new bids. RAISING THE STAKES Express Scripts began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for a rival pharmacy benefits manager, Caremark Rx, prompting a competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to raise its offer. Caremark rebuffed Express Scripts in favor of CVSs lower offer. Some shareholders sued Caremarks board, saying the directors put their financial interests ahead of shareholder interests. CVS, the drugstore chain, said it intended to conclude the takeover by April. STIFF SENTENCE A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Walter A. Forbes, the former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, to 12 years and 7 months in prison and ordered him to pay $3.275 billion in restitution for leading the largest accounting fraud of the 1990s.

CVS, the drugstore chain with the most stores in the nation, was not charged.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/business/17care.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Hostile Bid for Caremark Spurs an Offer by Drug Rival<date>Published: January 17, 2007</date><text>Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager, began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt yesterday for a rival, Caremark Rx, prompting the competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to sweeten its bid with a one-time dividend of $2 a share. The move by Express Scripts came a week after Caremark rejected the bid in favor of the deal with CVS, the drugstore chain. Express Scripts made its unsolicited offer for Caremark in December, bidding $29.25 in cash and 0.426 share of Express Scripts stock for each share of Caremark, seven weeks after Caremark accepted a bid of about $21 billion in stock from CVS. The addition of the $2 dividend would add about $853 million to the payout for Caremark’s shareholders. Express Scripts, based in Maryland Heights, Mo., said that while it would prefer to meet with the Caremark board and management to negotiate a transaction, it began the hostile offer because Caremark had refused to have discussions. A Caremark spokeswoman said yesterday: “There’s nothing new and nothing unexpected in today’s announcement, and we remain committed to the CVS merger.” A spokesman for CVS, which is based in Woonsocket, R.I., said the company intended to close its merger with Caremark in the first quarter of this year. On a conference call with analysts, Express Scripts’ chief executive, George Paz, said the company was “very comfortable” with its cost savings estimates of $500 million, with the potential for more. Caremark, which is based in Nashville, has challenged that assertion. In trading yesterday, Caremark’s stock fell 58 cents, to $56.25 a share; CVS fell 15 cents, to $31.79 a share; and Express Scripts rose 88 cents, to $65.71 a share. At those prices, the Express Scripts bid was worth about $24.4 billion, and the CVS bid, which would exchange 1.67 CVS shares for each Caremark share, was worth about $22.6 billion. CVS announced its proposed dividend after the close of trading. Caremark’s rejection of the Express Scripts bid was the subject of a lawsuit filed last week by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System, contending that the CVS deal improperly benefits Caremark executives at the expense of shareholders. Caremark said the suit, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, was without merit. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans, brokering deals in part by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also offer large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions by mail.

But stocks rallied nonetheless, suggesting investor optimism, in part because of acceleration of the sustained fall in energy prices. HEALTH CARE Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed guaranteeing health care insurance to all 36 million Californians, using a mix of private and public insurance. He said it would cost $12 billion and be paid for, in part, by taxing businesses, doctors and hospitals. Businesses with at least 10 employees but no health insurance would pay 4 percent of their total Social Security wages to subsidize the purchase of coverage by the working uninsured. Hospitals would pay 4 percent of their revenue to help cover higher reimbursements for those who treat patients enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program. Doctors would be assessed 2 percent of their revenue. Three other states  Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont  have also taken steps to provide broad health coverage for their citizens, but because of California’s size its move is likely to accelerate debate on the issue across the country this year. TRYING AGAIN Having failed to generate much excitement with its first venture into cellular phones  the Rokr, made in cooperation with Motorola  Apple tried again, this time keeping the engineering in the house. The result was the iPhone, a combination cellphone, music player and personal digital assistant that promises to seamlessly and elegantly integrate all those functions in a sleek device that fits in a pocket. Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, showed the iPhone at the Macworld conference in San Francisco. While other, cheaper gadgets perform similar functions, the announcement drove Apple’s stock up and those of its new competitors down. Analysts said that was because the iPhone integrates the functions more smoothly, using the OS X operating system from the Macintosh computer. Apple said the device would cost $499 or $599 when it goes on sale in June. KATRINA LAWSUIT A federal court judge in Mississippi said State Farm insurance had failed to show that a policyholder’s house was destroyed by flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and not by winds, as the homeowner claimed. The judge, L. T. Senter Jr. of Federal District Court in Gulfport, Miss., ordered State Farm to pay the full value of the policy, $233,292. The jury said State Farm should also pay a $2.5 million penalty. Lawyers for the homeowners argued that the house was knocked off its foundation and torn apart by winds  a hazard covered as a fundamental part of home insurance  and that flooding had merely scattered the debris. State Farm said floodwaters, which were not covered by the policy, caused the damage. The decision throws into question settlement talks intended to resolve hundreds of lawsuits filed after the hurricane, the costliest in American history. PROFIT GAP After a dismal holiday season capped a year of declining sales, Gap, the casual clothing chain, hired investment bankers to explore whether to sell the company, in whole or in parts. A sale of Gap would be one of the largest buyouts ever in the retail industry. The company’s current market value is $16.4 billion, and analysts expect that a buyer would have to pay more than $18 billion. Sales at Gap’s more than 3,000 stores have fallen every month for the last year, culminating in an 8 percent drop in December. Private equity firms, flush with billions in cash from institutional investors like pension funds, are considered the most likely bidders. The bankers’ report is expected as soon as the end of the month. PROXY WAR Escalating its battle to buy its rival, Caremark Rx, the pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts said it would nominate 4 directors to Caremark’s 11-member board to try to derail a lower competing bid by the drugstore chain CVS. In Louisiana, a public pension fund sued Caremark for having rejected Express Scripts’ $26 billion offer in favor of a $21 billion offer from CVS. The suit says the CVS bid improperly benefits Caremark executives at the expense of shareholders. Caremark’s current directors have recommended that shareholders approve the CVS deal at a special meeting before the end of March. Shareholders will not be able to vote for Express Scripts’ board members until the regular annual meeting, in May. UP IN THE AIR US Airways raised its unsolicited bid for Delta Air Lines by more than 20 percent, to over $10 billion, hoping to persuade Delta’s creditors to support its proposal over the standalone reorganization plan that Delta has endorsed. Hours later, Delta said it was discussing a merger with Northwest Airlines, apparently to fend off US Airways. The rival bids reflect the improving fortunes of airlines, which are starting to post profits again after half a decade of huge losses. They may signal the start of a wave of consolidation in the industry. The Senate Commerce Committee will meet on Jan. 24 to look into the potential effects of airline mergers. CHÁVEZ QUAKE Investors in North and South America reacted with alarm after President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela threatened to nationalize the country’s telephone and electricity companies. The Caracas stock exchange’s main index fell by almost 19 percent. Among the companies affected is Verizon, which owns 28.5 percent of Compañia Anónima Nacional Teléfonos de Venezuela. It had agreed to sell that interest for $676 million in April; but the deal has not closed so Verizon still owns it. If Mr. Chávez seizes private assets without compensating owners, companies could sue in the United States, where Venezuela owns assets, including Citgo, the energy company.

Among the benefits Caremark executives and directors will receive if the CVS deal goes through, the funds lawsuit contends, are positions at the combined company and indemnification from penalties and fines that may result when criminal and regulatory investigations into possible stock option backdating by Caremark officials are concluded. Yesterday, Express Scripts filed suit to block the CVS deal, arguing that the terms deal supported by the Caremark board prevents its directors from executing their fiduciary duties to shareholders. The lawsuits, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, will once again bring the fiduciary duties of directors in the post-Enron world to the forefront. Delaware is where most major United States companies are incorporated. Caremark accepted the CVS bid on Nov. 1, even though the stock-for-stock deal offered no premium to Caremarks market price at the time. Caremarks directors have recommended that company shareholders approve the deal at a meeting that is expected to occur before March 16. On Monday, Caremark rejected the $26 billion bid made on Dec. 18 by Express Scripts, saying that it would result in a highly leveraged and weakened business if it was approved by shareholders. The Express Scripts offer of $58.50 a share is approximately 15 percent higher than the CVS bid. The lawsuit filed by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System contends that the CVS deal is unfair to Caremark shareholders not only because its price is significantly below the rival bid. The pension funds lawyers also argue that Caremark directors improperly accepted deal protection provisions in the CVS bid that act to deter other bidders, effectively making the deal a fait accompli even before the shareholders vote. First, there is the $675 million breakup fee to be paid by Caremark in cash to CVS, if the target walks away. Then, there is a so-called last-look provision, which gives CVS the chance to come back and top any rival bid. Any potential third-party bidders will be loath to invest the time and resources necessary to pursue a superior bid while knowing full well that CVS retains control of the bidding, the pension funds lawsuit says. The Louisiana fund accuses the Caremark board of supporting the deal to benefit Edwin M. Crawford, the companys chief executive, and other executives. Under the terms of the deal, nine Caremark executives will join the combined company and Mr. Crawford will become chairman of its board and receive an estimated $57.6 million to $62.4 million in exit pay. While he would probably receive a similar amount if Caremark sold out to Express Scripts, Mr. Crawford might not be asked to join the combined company under the terms of such a deal. The Louisiana pension fund also noted that the CVS deal guarantees a job at the merged company for Mr. Crawfords son, Andrew. A Caremark proxy filed last year described the younger Mr. Crawford as senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting. The merger with CVS would also allow an unspecified number of Caremark directors  perhaps all of them  to get lucrative seats on the combined companys board. In its offer, CVS has also agreed to cover any costs associated with stock option backdating at Caremark, practices that are under federal investigation and the subject of another civil suit filed against the company in Tennessee. That lawsuit has challenged 4.6 million options granted to Mr. Crawford as having been possibly backdated. Stock sales covered by those options generated $262 million for Mr. Crawford, the Tennessee lawsuit contends. The inequities could not be more apparent, said Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer at Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger &amp; Grossmann, one of the firms representing the Louisiana fund. Shareholders get a coercive, zero-premium deal while Crawford gets a $48 million payout, jobs for himself and his son and complete indemnification for his alleged option backdating transgressions. A Caremark spokesman called the pension funds lawsuit meritless and said the company would defend against it vigorously. As for the Express Scripts suit, he said it was a frivolous attempt to interfere with the CVS merger. Contrary to allegations made by Express Scripts, the provisions of the CVS merger agreement are lawful and appropriate, the spokesman said. To be sure, many of the terms in the CVS bid for Caremark  the no-shop provisions and last-look opportunity  are common in the merger world. But the suit filed in Delaware, comes at a time when directors actions as fiduciaries for their shareholders are under increased scrutiny. As a result, the case, which is being heard by Chancellor William B. Chandler III, provides an opportunity for him to opine on the matter of directors duties broadly and whether the Caremark directors exercised those obligations in particular. This is familiar territory for Chancellor Chandler, who oversaw the Disney case of 2005. In that case he chastised the companys directors for essentially rubberstamping a contract struck by Michael D. Eisner with Michael S. Ovitz that resulted in a $140 million severance payout after Mr. Ovitz was terminated a short time later. Chancellor Chandler has asked for a hearing on the issues before Caremarks shareholders vote on the CVS bid, now scheduled to take place in mid-March. In a Dec. 29 meeting with the parties in the case, Chancellor Chandler said that while he was certain Caremark would argue forcefully that its directors exercised their duties of care and loyalty to the companys owners, he also concluded that there is a tenable argument on the other side, and nonfrivolous claims here on the other side, that at least need to be tested against a fuller record. Correction: January 12, 2007 An article in Business Day yesterday about a lawsuit filed by a pension fund over the proposed merger between Caremark RX and CVS misstated the amount of exit pay that Caremarks chief executive, Edwin M. Crawford, would receive if a rival bid was accepted. If Express Scripts succeeds in its rival bid, Mr. Crawford would receive $57.6 million to $62.4 million, not an estimated $48 million.

Express Scripts said it would nominate four directors to the 11-member board of Caremark. But Caremark said the vote would need to wait for its annual meeting, which is normally held in May but which the company said yesterday it had not yet scheduled. The action came after the Caremark board voted unanimously on Sunday to reject a $26 billion hostile takeover offer by Express Scripts, even though the offer values Caremark at about 13 percent higher than the CVS deal. Caremark said in a statement yesterday that the Express Scripts offer, which was made on Dec. 18, would create significant, if not insurmountable, antitrust risks. Express Scripts yesterday dismissed the antitrust issue as a red herring that Caremark was wielding to distract stockholders. Caremark is currently the second-largest player and Express Scripts is No. 3 in pharmacy benefits management  the business of acting as a middleman between drug companies and health plans that offer drug benefits to workers, retirees and Medicare enrollees. The current leader is Medco Health Solutions, but a combined Caremark-Express Scripts would be much larger. The question of how much competition prevails in the pharmacy benefit business is likely to be at the center of the proxy war. Express Scripts asked the Federal Trade Commission last week to review its bid and analysts expect the commission to seek further information later this month. A second request could start a lengthy process and potentially cast a pall of uncertainty over the Caremark-CVS deal, which has already received antitrust clearance from the F.T.C. Caremark has said it would ask its shareholders to approve the CVS offer at a special meeting before March 31. Edwin M. Crawford, Caremarks chairman, said in the company statement yesterday that the certainty of having the antitrust clearance and the opportunity to close our merger promptly translate in a strong financial benefit. Since the Express Scripts bid three weeks ago, Caremark investors have indicated hopes that the CVS deal would be sweetened, one way or another, but this has not yet happened. Some investors may be figuring that a higher bid is worth waiting for, even with the uncertainty of the antitrust issue, said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst with CRT Capital in Stamford. Shares of Caremark gained 29 cents, to $56.64 yesterday, which analysts noted, was well above the CVS cash and stock offer for Caremark, which was worth a total of $52.35 at yesterdays CVS price. Shares of CVS rose 18 cents, to $31.35. Express Scripts dropped 8 cents, to $68.78. In the hope of speeding the antitrust review, Express Scripts has already dispatched its lawyers to start arguing its case before the commission staff. Most people think this will get through the F.T.C.; granted it will take some time, said Kemp Dolliver, a health care analyst with Cowen &amp; Company. The pharmacy benefit business is probably less consolidated than it looked 18 months ago, Mr. Dolliver said. With the advent of Medicare Part D drug coverage last year, the largest health insurers  WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna  have aggressively expanded their in-house pharmacy benefits units. Employers and smaller health plans can choose from the insurers drug management services along with those of the big pharmacy benefit managers: Medco, Caremark and Express Scripts. Trying to reduce drug costs, the pharmacy benefit managers bargain with drug manufacturers for rebates and discounts on brand-name drugs, and they work to switch patients to lower-cost generic versions of expensive brands. With taxpayers footing much of the bill for elderly Medicare enrollees and low-income people in Medicaid programs, the benefit managers effectiveness became an issue in some Congressional races last fall. Express Scripts yesterday nominated to the Caremark board Stuart L. Bascomb, chief executive of Amerisight, a privately held laser eye surgery company and former Express Scripts executive; Duke K. Bristow, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles; John J. Jones, a former executive of the Argosy Gaming Company, and Todd E. Warnock, a health care investor and former investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston. In press releases yesterday, Express Scripts and Caremark each said that the merger it preferred could achieve $500 million in savings by cutting costs. Caremark said that combining with CVS would create an integrated health care product that would include mail-order and retail drug sales and personalized pharmaceutical and disease management services. A forced merger with Express Scripts would require debt that would diminish the financial strength of the combined company, Caremark contended. Express Scripts stressed that Citigroup and Credit Suisse had committed to fully finance the transaction. But even if Caremark and CVS shareholders reject CVS-Caremark merger, some analysts say that investor approval of the Express Scripts offer would be far from certain. I would be very surprised if Express Scripts and Caremark ever get together, said Andrew L. Speller, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis. More Articles in Business »EXPRESS SCRIPTS opened a proxy war in the pharmacy benefits industry yesterday, moving to derail the pending acquisition of its rival Caremark Rx by the drugstore chain CVS. Express Scripts said it would nominate four directors to the 11-member board of Caremark. But Caremark said the vote would need to wait for its annual meeting, which is normally held in May but which the company said yesterday it had not yet scheduled. The action came after the Caremark board voted unanimously on Sunday to reject a $26 billion hostile takeover offer by Express Scripts, even though the offer values Caremark at about 13 percent higher than the CVS deal. Caremark said in a statement yesterday that the Express Scripts offer, which was made on Dec. 18, would create significant, if not insurmountable, antitrust risks. Express Scripts yesterday dismissed the antitrust issue as a red herring that Caremark was wielding to distract stockholders. Caremark is currently the second-largest player and Express Scripts is No. 3 in pharmacy benefits management  the business of acting as a middleman between drug companies and health plans that offer drug benefits to workers, retirees and Medicare enrollees. The current leader is Medco Health Solutions, but a combined Caremark-Express Scripts would be much larger. The question of how much competition prevails in the pharmacy benefit business is likely to be at the center of the proxy war. Express Scripts asked the Federal Trade Commission last week to review its bid and analysts expect the commission to seek further information later this month. A second request could start a lengthy process and potentially cast a pall of uncertainty over the Caremark-CVS deal, which has already received antitrust clearance from the F.T.C. Caremark has said it would ask its shareholders to approve the CVS offer at a special meeting before March 31. Edwin M. Crawford, Caremarks chairman, said in the company statement yesterday that the certainty of having the antitrust clearance and the opportunity to close our merger promptly translate in a strong financial benefit. Since the Express Scripts bid three weeks ago, Caremark investors have indicated hopes that the CVS deal would be sweetened, one way or another, but this has not yet happened. Some investors may be figuring that a higher bid is worth waiting for, even with the uncertainty of the antitrust issue, said Sheryl Skolnick, a health care analyst with CRT Capital in Stamford. Shares of Caremark gained 29 cents, to $56.64 yesterday, which analysts noted, was well above the CVS cash and stock offer for Caremark, which was worth a total of $52.35 at yesterdays CVS price. Shares of CVS rose 18 cents, to $31.35. Express Scripts dropped 8 cents, to $68.78. In the hope of speeding the antitrust review, Express Scripts has already dispatched its lawyers to start arguing its case before the commission staff. Most people think this will get through the F.T.C.; granted it will take some time, said Kemp Dolliver, a health care analyst with Cowen &amp; Company. The pharmacy benefit business is probably less consolidated than it looked 18 months ago, Mr. Dolliver said. With the advent of Medicare Part D drug coverage last year, the largest health insurers  WellPoint, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna  have aggressively expanded their in-house pharmacy benefits units. Employers and smaller health plans can choose from the insurers drug management services along with those of the big pharmacy benefit managers: Medco, Caremark and Express Scripts. Trying to reduce drug costs, the pharmacy benefit managers bargain with drug manufacturers for rebates and discounts on brand-name drugs, and they work to switch patients to lower-cost generic versions of expensive brands. With taxpayers footing much of the bill for elderly Medicare enrollees and low-income people in Medicaid programs, the benefit managers effectiveness became an issue in some Congressional races last fall. Express Scripts yesterday nominated to the Caremark board Stuart L. Bascomb, chief executive of Amerisight, a privately held laser eye surgery company and former Express Scripts executive; Duke K.

They were on the mental cash registers at investment banks, which initiated a raft of multibillion-dollar takeover deals. These latest deals are closing out a record-setting year for mergers. As of Dec. 1, there were more than 32,000 transactions worth $3.3 trillion, according to Thomson Financial. The competition for deals recalls the merger frenzy of the 1980s. BLOCK THAT BID Just as CVS, the drugstore chain, was about to win antitrust approval for its $21 billion takeover of the pharmacy benefit manager Caremark Rx, a smaller benefits manager, Express Scripts, stepped up with a $26 billion offer. Pharmacy benefit managers act as middlemen between drug makers and health insurers, working to wring discounts on pharmaceuticals. Express Scripts move to buy Caremark Rx, which is double its size, would make it by far the largest benefits manager in the nation. The four largest prescription benefit mangers  Caremark, Medco, Wellpoint and Express Scripts  handle about 75 percent of the $235 billion spent on prescription medicines every year. Paradoxically, Express Scripts bid for Caremark could attract hostile bidders of its own. Analysts said Walgreen, Wal-Mart or Aetna might be interested in acquiring Express Scripts. BULKING UP With domestic supplies declining and competition for foreign supplies increasing, Statoil, Norways state-controlled oil company, agreed to buy the energy units of Norsk Hydro for about $28 billion. If the transaction is completed, it would combine the two largest oil producers in Norway, the worlds third-biggest oil exporter. Together, they have 6.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent, the companies said, but their aging North Sea oil fields are declining. Seeking to replenish their reserves, Statoil and Norsk Hydro have spent a total of about $6 billion buying reserves in the Gulf of Mexico over the last two years. Both companies will now seek the approval of their shareholders and regulators to close the deal, which they hope to do by the end of the third quarter of 2007. APPLIANCE SHOPPING Private-equity investors were also busy. A consortium of the Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group agreed to pay $10.9 billion for Biomet, which makes artificial hip and knee joints, known as appliances. Biomet said that its sales in the fiscal second quarter grew 5 percent, to $520.3 million, but added that it was delaying the release of audited financial results for that period because of a continuing review of its stock options practices since 1996. Dane A. Miller, a co-founder of Biomet and its longtime chief executive, may join the takeover team. He resigned from Biomet in April, after a disagreement with the board. PROPERTY PLAY Another private equity firm, the Apollo Group, offered about $9 billion to buy Realogy, the company that franchises the Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and Sothebys International real estate brokerage firms. The deal is the latest bet by private equity firms on the real estate business just as it appears to have peaked. Two weeks ago, Blackstone led a $36 billion deal to buy Equity Office Properties Trust, the nations largest owner and manager of office buildings. Henry R. Silverman, the architect behind Realogy, stands to make about $135 million by selling all of his shares and stock options as part of the deal. OPTIONS SCANDAL Hundreds of outside corporate directors may have received manipulated stock option grants over the last decade, suggesting they were not wholly unaware of the potentially illegal practice as many have said they were, a study found. The research, sponsored by the Harvard Law School Program on Corporate Governance, raises serious questions about corporate governance if outside directors, the final backstop against bad practices, received fraudulent option grants, often after they had formally approved the payouts. Federal officials are investigating more than 120 companies suspected of having backdated stock option grants to give executives and directors more money than they disclosed to their shareholders. At least 60 executives and directors have quit or been fired because of the practice. BONUS HUNTING The federal government sued three former executives of Fannie Mae, the mortgage lending giant, seeking to claw back more than $115 million in bonuses over their involvement in a huge accounting scandal. Among the officers being sued is Franklin D. Raines, the former chairman and chief executive. In addition to trying to recover bonuses they say were not really earned, regulators are seeking about $100 million in penalties. Mr. Rainess lawyer said that the accusations behind the suit were false and that his client would contest the action in court. CABLE COMPETITION Arguing that cable television rates have surged in the absence of robust competition, federal regulators moved to speed up the local approval process for phone companies seeking to compete. The Federal Communications Commission stopped short of requiring cities and towns to let telephone companies compete with cable television companies in delivering video to customers, but did require them to respond to phone companies applications within 90 days. Industry analysts said the decision would not prompt overnight change because it is likely to face a court challenge.

The Express Scripts power play was testimony to the pressures drug-insurance middlemen like Express Scripts and Caremark are feeling as the $200 billion pharmacy benefits business changes around them. We would unquestionably prefer to work cooperatively with you to complete a negotiated transaction, George Paz, the chairman and chief executive of Express Scripts, said in a letter yesterday to Caremarks chief executive, Edwin M. Crawford. But if cooperation is not an option, Mr. Pazs letter said, his company has hired the proxy adviser MacKenzie Partners to take the matter directly to Caremarks shareholders. The letter detailed Express Scripts offer. It would pay a premium over what Caremark shareholders would receive under the pending Caremark-CVS merger  which the two companies indicated yesterday that they still intended to pursue. Caremark said it would review the Express Scripts offer, adding that it continues to be bound by the terms of its agreement with CVS. For its part, CVS said it remained confident in the long-term strategic value of our combination as well as the benefit to shareholders of CVS and Caremark. News of Express Scripts unsolicited takeover plan was first reported Sunday evening. Yesterday, after Express Scripts formally made its offer, Caremarks shares gained 10.5 percent, to close at $55.58. Mr. Paz said in a telephone interview yesterday afternoon that he had tried unsuccessfully to reach Mr. Crawford of Caremark, but ventured that hes got to be a happier man now than he was before the market opened today. Express Scripts stock rose $1.31, or 1.9 percent, to $69.97. CVS shares lost 51 cents, or 1.7 percent, closing at $30.01. The No. 3 player to Caremarks No. 2  Medco Health Solutions is the largest pharmacy benefits manager  Express Scripts is under the same sorts of pressures that may have influenced Caremarks decision to agree to a no-premium merger deal with CVS in November. The fourth-largest company in the field is CVSs own PharmaCare unit. The deal proposed by Express Scripts would create by far the largest company in pharmacy benefits management  the business of acting as a middleman between drug companies and health plans that offer drug benefits to workers, retirees and Medicare enrollees. Mr. Paz said that combining his company with Caremark would save the two companies $500 million in reduced costs, while giving the merged entity greater clout in negotiating prices with drug makers. Cutting costs and gaining leverage with drug makers are important goals for the benefits manager. Coincidentally, the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said yesterday that the agency planned to adopt a new pricing method for what the government spends on drugs for low-income Medicaid patients. The change is expected to affect discounts and rebates received by middlemen like Express Scripts and Caremark, and possibly reduce their profits. I have to believe that these guys see that 80 percent gross margins on generic drugs are not sustainable, said Larry N. Feinberg, managing partner of Oracle Partners, a health care hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Paz declined yesterday to discuss the specifics of middleman profit margins. We do make more money on generics than on brand drugs, he said, noting that the average brand prescription costs the purchaser $130, while the average generic is around $40. Thats why clients dont get concerned when patients are switched to generic substitutes, he said. Pharmacy benefits managers are also losing some customers for drug coverage as a result of the federal governments Medicare Part D program, which helps subsidize drugs for millions of older Americans. Health insurance companies like UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint and Aetna have signed up many of these people in an age group that accounts for 60 percent of all drug spending. Mr. Paz, in fact, pointed to mounting competition from such insurance companies as a reason that antitrust regulators should not view an Express Scripts-Caremark deal as anticompetitive. Traditionally, employers that offered drug benefits to retirees typically used benefit managers like Caremark and Express Scripts. But Kemp Dolliver, a Cowen &amp; Company analyst, said that if employers start to shift their retirees into Part D, it becomes a game change that disadvantages pharmacy benefit managers. More of that retiree business would probably wind up with UnitedHealth and the other big insurers, Mr. Dolliver said. And then there is pressure from the retail front. In September, Wal-Mart began a program offering 30-day supplies of many generic drugs for $4 a prescription, an approach that has been mimicked to varying degrees by Target and Costco. Those programs could pose a threat to drugstore chains like CVS, and conceivably to companies like Caremark, if enough consumers see little reason to make co-payments of $5 or more to buy drugs covered by pharmacy benefit managers. So far, the CVS chain and other drugstores say the Wal-Mart program has not hurt them. But Mr. Feinberg said Wal-Mart was expected to add a generic version of Zocor, a popular cholesterol treatment, to its list. Its going to be bigger and bigger, he said. Against that background, Express Scripts made its offer of $26 billion in cash and stock yesterday. Caremark shareholders would receive $29.25 in cash and 0.426 share of Express Scripts stock for each share of Caremark under the offer. At yesterdays closing prices, that would make the Express Scripts offer half stock and half cash, worth a total of $59.06 a share, or 18 percent more than the CVS all-stock offer. Caremark shares closed Friday at $50.30 a share. With reported 2005 revenue of $16.3 billion, Express Scripts is much smaller than Caremark, with $33 billion last year, and Medco, with $37.9 billion. Express Scripts plans to borrow heavily to complete the deal. Citigroup and Credit Suisse have agreed to fully finance the deal with $13.4 billion in credit arrangements, Express Script said. Analysts said that Caremark shareholders had grumbled about the all-stock CVS deal, which valued Caremark at $50.12 a share based on yesterdays closing price. Andrew Speller, an A. G. Edwards analyst, sees a potential for a bidding war. I think CVS will come back with a similar type of offer, he said.

The bid by benefits manager Express Scripts for rival Caremark Rx tops a competing offer by the CVS drugstore chain in a bold move that evokes memories of the big buyout deals of the 1980s. Pharmacy benefit managers act as the middleman between drug companies and employers that offer drug subsidies to their workers as part of health-care coverage. By acquiring Caremark Rx, which is double its size, Express Scripts would by far become the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the nation. Together they would have even more clout when negotiating prices with drug makers for clients, typically big corporations and their employees. The deal would also save the combined company as much as $500 million a year by reducing overlapping costs. Both pharmacy benefit managers and drug makers are under increasing pressure to keep drug prices low from all sides. Prices offered at the pharmacy counter have also come under threat in recent months by Wal-Mart, which said it would offer certain generic drugs for $4. The takeover bid seeks to scuttle Caremark Rxs agreement last month to merge with CVS, the second-biggest drugstore chain in the country. That deal was expected to transform the drug industry. Spokesmen for Express Scripts, Caremark and CVS could not be reached for comment. The four largest prescription benefit mangers  Caremark, Medco Health Solutions, Wellpoint and Express Scripts  handle about 75 percent of the $235 billion spent on prescription medicines every year. The takeover bid comes amid a record-setting year for mergers. As of the beginning of this month, there have been $3.3 trillion worth of deals in more than 32,000 transactions, according to Thomson Financial. Not since the days of the corporate raiders of the 1980s, as captured in films like Wall Street and books like Barbarians at the Gate, have deal makers been so central in reshaping corporate America. The bid will pit Express Scripts, with a market value of $9.3 billion, against the much-larger CVS, worth some $25 billion, in a battle over Caremark Rx. It is possible that a bidding war could ensue, with both suitors ratcheting up their offers. Any deal could face scrutiny from regulators in Washington. The offer by Express Scripts is a throwback to the 1980s in two ways: it is a rare hostile bid that could spark a fierce bidding war, and it relies heavily on debt, some $14 billion. Buyers do not like to get into bidding wars: they can get expensive quickly and they can drive away important employees and customers, eroding the value of the business they want. Even as merger activity has accelerated, the number of deals in the United States that had two or more bidders has fallen sharply this year, according to Thomson. But companies are increasingly willing to use debt in deals. The $26 billion offer is a vivid illustration of the role that cheap credit is playing in fueling the explosion in takeovers. Historically, low interest rates and a flood of available cash have enabled private equity firms to buy out bigger and bigger companies. In those cases, the firms typically put up a quarter or so of the value of the company and borrow the rest, planning to use the companies revenues to pay off the loans. And even as the amount of debt used in these deals has risen to record levels, investors have stayed sanguine that the risks of default are low. Now, Express Scripts is using the same weapon employed by private equity and leveraging itself or borrowing against the combined company to try to win Caremark. Other companies have also drunken deeply from the debt pool: the mining giant Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold is essentially borrowing $15 billion to pursue its $25.9 billion takeover of Phelps Dodge. The takeover bid by Express Scripts is being orchestrated by its chief executive, George Paz, who joined the company in 1998, as senior vice president and chief financial officer before becoming president in 2003 and then chief executive in 2005. Before Express Scripts, he was a partner at the accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand and then executive vice president and finance chief for Life Partners Group. It is unclear how investors will react to Express Scripts offer. Express Scripts had widely been considered a takeover target, not an acquirer, because of its small size. Indeed, its bid for Caremark could also put it into play. Kemp Dolliver, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company, wrote in a research note after the CVS-Caremark announcement that Express Scripts could be bought by Walgreen, Wal-Mart or Aetna. The proposed merger between CVS and Caremark received a mixed reception by investors. When it was first announced, shares in both companies tumbled, but they have returned to close to where they started after the deal. In that deal, Caremark received no premium for its shares. Shares of Caremark closed Friday at $50.30. Under the proposed offer by Express Scripts, Caremark shareholders would receive just shy of $58.50 a share in Express Scripts stock and cash, people briefed on the offer said, representing a 22 percent premium. Exact terms of the breakdown between stock and cash could not be learned. Under Mr. Paz, Express Scripts has made several acquisitions, most recently acquiring Priority Healthcare Corporation for $1.3 billion in cash in July 2005. Express Scripts, with some 13,000 employees, was formed in 1986 and went public in 1992. The company is based in Maryland Heights, Mo. In 2003, New Yorks attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, began an investigation into claims that Express Scripts had over billed the states health care plans. In 2004, Mr. Spitzer sued the company in state court in Albany for breach of contract. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting. More Articles in Business »In an audacious takeover bid that could lead to lower drug prices for consumers, a company that manages employee drug plans will make a $26 billion hostile bid for a much larger rival, according to people briefed on the offer. The bid by benefits manager Express Scripts for rival Caremark Rx tops a competing offer by the CVS drugstore chain in a bold move that evokes memories of the big buyout deals of the 1980s. Pharmacy benefit managers act as the middleman between drug companies and employers that offer drug subsidies to their workers as part of health-care coverage. By acquiring Caremark Rx, which is double its size, Express Scripts would by far become the largest pharmacy benefits manager in the nation. Together they would have even more clout when negotiating prices with drug makers for clients, typically big corporations and their employees. The deal would also save the combined company as much as $500 million a year by reducing overlapping costs. Both pharmacy benefit managers and drug makers are under increasing pressure to keep drug prices low from all sides. Prices offered at the pharmacy counter have also come under threat in recent months by Wal-Mart, which said it would offer certain generic drugs for $4. The takeover bid seeks to scuttle Caremark Rxs agreement last month to merge with CVS, the second-biggest drugstore chain in the country. That deal was expected to transform the drug industry. Spokesmen for Express Scripts, Caremark and CVS could not be reached for comment. The four largest prescription benefit mangers  Caremark, Medco Health Solutions, Wellpoint and Express Scripts  handle about 75 percent of the $235 billion spent on prescription medicines every year. The takeover bid comes amid a record-setting year for mergers. As of the beginning of this month, there have been $3.3 trillion worth of deals in more than 32,000 transactions, according to Thomson Financial.

POWERFUL MEDICINE In a bid to cope with stricter efforts to contain prescription drug costs, CVS, the nations second-biggest drugstore chain, agreed to buy Caremark Rx, the leading pharmacy benefits manager, for $20.6 billion. The transaction would transform CVS, which trails only Walgreen among drugstore chains, into the countrys biggest pharmacy benefits manager. These managers, which account for three-fourths of the $235 billion spent on prescriptions every year, run drug-buying programs for corporations, unions and insurers. Pharmacy benefits managers face a powerful threat from Wal-Mart, which is cutting the cost of about 300 generic drugs to $4 a month. BUSY BANKERS Two other significant takeovers were announced. Merck &amp; Company agreed to pay $1.1 billion for Sirna Therapeutics, which is focused on developing therapeutics based on ribonucleic acid interference, a mechanism for inactivating particular genes. Merck and Sirna hope it may be used one day to kill viruses or tumors by turning off their genes.

That helped to slow the rate at which Americans were depleting their savings, although the nationwide personal savings rate remained negative. Statistics showing slowdowns in manufacturing and construction raised doubts about whether the economy would rebound later this year. A VERDICT, FINALLY A federal court jury in Bridgeport, Conn., convicted Walter A. Forbes, former chairman of the Cendant Corporation, of masterminding an accounting fraud that was, at the time it was discovered in 1998, the largest on record. The verdict came in the third trial of Mr. Forbes over eight years. Jurors could not reach a verdict in the earlier cases. This jury found Mr. Forbes, 63, of New Canaan, Conn., guilty of conspiracy and of submitting false reports to regulators. It acquitted him of securities fraud. Mr. Forbes, who is free on $1.2 million bail, is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17. He may be sent to prison for as long as 25 years. CHARGES, AT LAST Capping a 27-month investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued nine former executives at the Delphi Corporation, accusing them of having manipulated the companys finances to project a healthy facade while it descended into bankruptcy. In all, the S.E.C. charged 13 people at Delphi, an auto parts supplier, including its former chief executive, J. T. Battenberg III, and its former chief financial officer, Alan S. Dawes. Four defendants worked for companies hired by Delphi and its former parent, General Motors. The S.E.C. immediately settled charges against six defendants, including Mr. Dawes, who agreed to pay $687,000 in penalties. Mr. Battenberg said he was not guilty. Analysts said investigators might use information from Mr. Dawes and others to advance a related investigation of accounting methods used by G.M.

BP TROUBLES GROW The oil company BP had significant knowledge years ago of the problems that caused a deadly accident at its Texas City, Tex., refinery in 2005, a federal safety panel said. The explosion and fire killed 15 workers and injured 180. The panel, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, said BPs cost-cutting contributed to the disaster. BP was already under attack for an oil spill in Alaska, poor maintenance of the trans-Alaska pipeline and accusations that its traders tried to corner the propane market.

Wall Street was not as sure. By the end of the day, both companies’ stocks were down. And any thought of copycat deals sent a shudder through their competitors shares, too. That included CVS’s only national drugstore chain rival, Walgreen, and Caremark’s big competitors in the business of managing prescription drug plans, Medco and ExpressScripts. “It’s still not clear that 2 plus 2 equals something other than 4 here,” said Christopher McFadden, a Goldman Sachs analyst. After the market closed, CVS and Caremark discussed further details of the merger in a conference call that some analysts said might assuage many of the investor concerns and could enable the companies’ stocks to rebound somewhat on Thursday. Many analysts say the merger, which was first reported early yesterday morning, probably does make at least strategic sense for the companies. If it closes as expected in the next 6 to 12 months, the deal would create the CVS/Caremark Corporation, a health industry giant with $75 billion in annual sales and significant drug-buying clout. For CVS, acquiring Caremark might help it cope with the trend among drug insurance plans to demand that more and more medicines be delivered by mail. The mail-order share of drug sales has more than doubled in the past decade, to well over 20 percent, according to Kemp Dolliver, who follows the industry for Cowen &amp; Company in Boston. That trend saves money for the employers or other insurance providers whose drug plans are managed by companies like Caremark. But it can keep customers from going to CVS’s 6,200 drugstores in 43 states, where they often purchase other items along with their prescriptions. Those nonprescription sales account for about 30 percent of CVS revenue. CVS had become a small player in the mail-order business, but acquiring Caremark would position it to gain far more than it loses from the trend. For Caremark, a leading provider of drug management plans for large employers, insurers and managed care companies, the merger would add the reach of CVS’s own drug-benefit manager, PharmaCare, whose clients are primarily smaller businesses. Caremark also sees an opportunity in using CVS stories as place to offer employers and health insurers its various specialized services that go beyond managing drug plans, like helping patients learn to use self-injection medications. CVS has been expanding a line of in-store clinics, under the MinuteClinic name, that could be well suited to supporting specialized services from Caremark, the companies said. And both companies could potentially reduce overhead costs by combining subsidiaries that have been signing up patients for the Medicare Part D drug benefit program that went into place early this year. “Historically, there’s been competition bordering on antagonism,” between the retailers and pharmacy-benefit managers, Mr. McFadden said. “Now CVS is saying to employers and insurers, O.K., we’ll do it any way you want.” The companies say that together they can provide convenient drug dispensing and various patient consulting services that will help employers guide their workers toward healthier and less expensive choices and practices. “People need to understand the cost of health care,” Thomas M. Ryan, the chairman, president and chief executive of CVS, said in a telephone interview. Mr. Ryan would become chief executive of the combined companies. Edwin M. Crawford, Caremark’s chairman, chief and president, would become chairman of the new company. Mr. Ryan and Mr. Crawford said the merger talks trace to a dinner a year ago in Providence, R.I., that began with discussion of routine relations between the companies (many employees of Caremark clients had their prescriptions filled at CVS pharmacies) and escalated into shared views on the future of health care. The deal calls for Caremark shareholders to receive 1.67 CVS shares for each of their shares when the deal closes. Based on CVS’s closing price yesterday, Caremark shareholders would receive $20.8 billion in CVS stock. Although both companies’ stocks had been trading at what analysts viewed as relatively low prices after declines in the last month, CVS shares plunged 7.4 percent in regular trading, closing down $2.32 at $29.03. Caremark’s shares began the day sharply higher, after it became public that a deal was in the works. But they, too, tumbled as the details emerged. They closed down $1.06, or 2.15 percent at $48.17. After the market’s close yesterday, both companies released upbeat third-quarter earnings reports that slightly topped analysts estimates. CVS said that net income rose 12 percent from the third quarter of 2005, to $284.2 million, or 33 cents a share, as sales jumped 25 percent, to $11.2 billion. Caremark said net income grew 25 percent, to $288.6 million, or 67 cents a share, from $231.4 million a year ago. Revenue rose 13 percent, to $9.14 billion. In a conference call, the companies also explained how they planned to save $400 million a year through cost savings. “Had the earnings and the projections of $400 million in synergies from the merger been public at the beginning of the day, I think the stocks would have risen instead of falling,” said Charles Boorady, who follows Caremark for Citigroup. Investors have been nervous lately about both companies and many of their competitors. Caremark’s shares had dropped more than 17 percent from their mid-September peak by the end of trading Tuesday. CVS was down more than 13 percent over approximately the same period. One source of uncertainty had been the increasingly aggressive posture of Wal-Mart, the major nationwide retail pharmacy competitor to CVS and Walgreen. Last month, Wal-Mart began rolling out a highly publicized campaign to sell a month’s supply of several hundred generic drugs for a flat $4. Target and numerous smaller retailers have announced similar price cuts in response. But the generic discount programs do not cover the leading name-brand prescription drugs or even the generic versions of blockbuster heart drugs that have recently come off patent. In any case, analysts see the CVS-Caremark merger as an attempt to seek shelter from raw price competition. The goal, Mr. Ryan said, is to become “a destination to improve health care, not just fill a prescription.” More Articles in Business »CVS and Caremark yesterday cast their $20.8 billion dollar deal as a merger of equals that would enable them and their investors to take better advantage of upheavals in the prescription drug business.

In any case, analysts see the CVS-Caremark merger as an attempt to seek shelter from raw price competition. The goal, Mr. Ryan said, is to become “a destination to improve health care, not just fill a prescription.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/business/01deal.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS in Talks to Buy Drug Middleman<date>Published: November 1, 2006</date><text>CVS, the second-biggest drugstore chain in the country, is in advanced talks to acquire Caremark Rx, the leading pharmacy benefits manager, for more than $21 billion, people close to the negotiations said yesterday. The transaction would transform CVS from being primarily a retailer to becoming the nation’s preeminent manager of pharmacy benefits. The merger talks illustrate the attraction that pharmacy benefits managers  middlemen between the drug companies and employees and others with drug benefits coverage  still hold despite the challenges to the business that have emerged in recent weeks. A program by Wal-Mart to offer generic drugs for $4 has been seen as a threat. The negotiations were at a critical stage yesterday, people close to the talks said, and could still break down. Exact terms of the deal could not be learned. For CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., the transaction would be by far its largest yet; Caremark, based in Nashville, has a market value of $21 billion while CVS has a market value of nearly $26 billion. In recent years, CVS has already been growing its own pharmacy benefits management business, PharmaCare, which has become an increasingly important driver of profits. An acquisition of Caremark would put CVS, which as a drugstore chain is No. 2 to Walgreen, far ahead of rivals Medco Health Solutions, Express Scripts and Wellpoint in the pharmacy management business. The nation’s pharmacy benefits managers handle about 75 percent of the $235 billion spent on prescriptions every year. These companies have become increasingly important gatekeepers in Americans’ health benefits. Pharmacy benefits managers administer the drug benefits coverage to the employees or members of its customers  big corporations, unions, government agencies, insurers and other organizations. They buy the drugs directly from the pharmaceutical companies and distribute them through drugstores and mail order. In the case of Caremark, that distribution network is 60,000 pharmacies around the country and seven mail-order pharmacies. Last year, it processed more than 530 million prescriptions. Caremark currently has the contract to handle pharmacy benefits services for 4.5 million federal employees, retirees, and dependents. One of PharmaCare’s biggest contracts is administering the benefits for 144,000 employees and retires of Chrysler in the United States, as well as 136,000 dependents. Representatives for the two companies did not return calls for comment. Because of their buying power, the big pharmacy benefits managers often can obtain lower prices on a number of drugs for its members. But some recent developments may pose challenges to the company’s pricing powers. A trial program by Wal-Mart to cut the cost of about 300 generic drugs, to $4 in some states, raised fears that Wal-Mart could emerge as a powerful rival. And a settlement of a class-action suit against a company that publishes a widely followed benchmark of drug prices will cause the publisher to lower the average wholesale prices for more than 2,000 drugs by 5 percent. In recent weeks, shares of Caremark and other pharmacy benefits mangers have declined sharply. Caremark’s shares, which reached a high of $59.64 on Sept. 12, have since fallen about 17 percent, closing yesterday at $49.23. Kenneth F. Abramowitz, a health care analyst and managing general partner of NGN Capital, a health care venture capital fund, noted that Caremark, which began in 1993, might have felt that it had peaked after a decade of rapid growth. “Caremark might be anxious about the future in general,” he said. Caremark was built by Edwin Crawford, a former Auburn football player and an executive under Richard M. Scrushy, the former HealthSouth chief executive. In 1993, Mr. Scrushy founded MedPartners, which in 1996 bought Caremark, a company that at the time managed the practices of 1,000 doctors and provided pharmacy benefits management. Mr. Crawford became chief executive in 1998 and focused on the pharmacy benefits management business. He moved the company from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville and changed the company’s name to Caremark Rx. (Mr. Scrushy left Caremark’s board in 2001 before his legal troubles began.) In 2003, Caremark acquired Advance PCS for $5.6 billion in cash and stock, a deal that made Caremark the biggest in the field. Caremark’s fast growth and rising stock has made Mr. Crawford, 57, a rich man. He realized $63.84 million from exercising options last year, according to a company filing, and he sits on nearly $249 million worth of options, according to a recent estimate by Forbes magazine. “Mac Crawford has done a spectacular job of turning around Caremark in the last 10 years,” Mr. Abramowitz said.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic A Year of Healthy Gains But there is more to it than that, some analysts say. In their view, the new Medicare drug benefit, as well as a rising tide of generic drugs, may become a potent combination for drugstore profits, which are likely to keep growing as the population ages. People are looking for defensive investments now, said Patricia A. Baker, a stock analyst at Merrill Lynch who is bullish on the industry. Unlike the supermarkets, which are a recovery story, we believe the drugstores are a long-term growth story. The drugstore stocks are all up for the year. Shares of Rite Aid have swung up and down on reports that the the company planned to buy more than 1,800 drugstores in the United States from the Jean Coutu Group of Canada. Under a deal announced last month, Rite Aid will pay Coutu $1.5 billion in cash and assume $850 million of Coutus debt in exchange for the Eckerd and Brooks stores. It plans to rebrand all of them as Rite Aid stores, bringing its total number to about 5,000. Rite Aid would still be the third-largest drugstore chain in the United States, and its headquarters would remain in Camp Hill, Pa.; Coutu would own about 30 percent of Rite Aid. Even before the deal, analysts pointed out that Rite Aid had a lot of debt, the legacy of an earlier accounting scandal. John Heinbockel, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to investors last month that the merger would create a much larger, but still underperforming and highly leveraged company. Although Mr. Heinbockel started recommending Rite Aids stock in March, he removed it from his buy list once the deal was announced. Rite Aid shares now trade at $4.34 , up 24.7 percent for the year. Many analysts say broad industry trends should particularly favor the two largest American drugstore chains, Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., and CVS, in Woonsocket, R.I. Theyre defensive stocks at a time when their sales are accelerating, said John W. Ransom, an analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla. As recently as December, Mr. Ransom said, drugstore chains were widely viewed as a growth industry. But he said growth in the number of prescriptions filled each year in the United States peaked at 10 percent in 1999, then started decelerating through the first half of this decade. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the number of prescriptions actually declined, by about 0.5 percent from the period a year earlier. Mr. Ransom said pharmacists started filling more prescriptions again this spring, in part because of the new Medicare drug benefit, known as Medicare Part D, which went into effect in January. Quite a few investors took notice, bidding up the stocks of major national drug retailers. For the year to date, the gains have been roughly 15 to 35 percent. While Medicare Part D is likely to reduce the drugstore chains profit margins for individual sales, it should increase their sales volume, analysts said. For example, Mr. Heinbockel said, the new drug benefit could help the chains take back some business from discounters like Wal-Mart and Costco, which appeal particularly to customers who have to pay for prescriptions out of their own pockets. Some customers who have started receiving drug coverage through Medicare  and now pay the same co-payments wherever they go  may prefer to shop closer to home, he said. The drugstore chains may also pick up some business from small local pharmacies that do not have relationships with all the insurance providers in the Medicare Part D program. Independent pharmacies still account for about 18 percent of the domestic market for prescription drugs, and Mr. Heinbockel estimated that their share could be sliced in half over the next 10 years. Drugstore profits are also likely to benefit from a shift toward generic drugs, some analysts said. Branded drugs with annual sales around $25 billion are set to come off patent by year-end, according to Goldman Sachs. That works out to 300 million prescriptions a year in the United States, Mr. Heinbockel said, estimating that 90 percent of those would be replaced by generics. The change could put a big dent in drugstore sales while giving a huge lift to their profits. That is because the sales price of a generic drug is usually a small fraction of the cost of a similar brand drug, but a drug retailers markup can be much higher. Mr. Heinbockel estimates that the average markup on a brand-name drug is around $10, but that its closer to $14 for a generic. Ms. Baker at Merrill Lynch said that about two-thirds of the sales at CVS or Walgreen stores were made by their pharmacies, and that is probably the most predictable stable piece of retail out there. SHE estimated that CVSs stock could trade at up to $40 by the end of next year, which would be 22 times her estimate of $1.83 a share for the companys earnings in 2007. The stock closed at $35.50 on Friday, or 23.7 times trailing 12-month earnings. Ms. Baker also said she thought that Walgreens stock could rise to $56 next year, or 27 times her 2007 earnings estimate of $2.05 a share. (Walgreens uses a different fiscal calendar, but Ms. Baker based her comparison of the two companies on the 2007 calendar year.) Shares of Walgreen now trade at $50.91, or 30 times earnings over the last 12 months. Stephen C. Chick, a stock analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, recommends buying shares of Walgreen, but not those of the other companies. He said the share-price increases this year probably already reflected expectations for profit growth at both Rite Aid and Longs Drug Stores, which is based in Walnut Creek, Calif. Mr. Chick also said he preferred Walgreen because it has focused on internal growth, while CVS has relied more on acquisitions. For example, CVS bought a number of Eckerd stores in 2004, when Coutu acquired the Eckerd stores that it is now selling to Rite Aid. The longer-term case for investing in the drugstore stocks depends largely on the notion that aging Americans will gradually be consuming more pharmaceutical products. If youve got a customer and they take 20 prescriptions this year, chances are theyll take 21 next year, said Mr. Heinbockel at Goldman Sachs. Its almost like an annuity business. More Articles in Business »SHARES of big American drugstore chains have generally risen sharply this year, at least partly because skittish investors have been seeking cover in the sector, traditionally viewed as safe during turbulent times for stocks.

Mirage the first: That stock options aligned executives’ interests with those of shareholders. Nice try, but how many investors do you know who get to look back and choose the lowest prices for their stock as officials at Brocade and other companies seem to have done with insider share grants? Mirage the second: That options should not be considered an employee cost, though they were obviously compensation, because the value of the options could not be measured. Proponents of this theory often made dark predictions of job creation drying up across America if options expense had to be run through corporate income statements. Might the executives making these claims have been more concerned about their own accounts dwindling than anything else? Mirage the third: That the bulk of options were given to rank-and-file employees, not executives, as a way to attract high-quality workers and keep them motivated. Two years ago, Silicon Valley companies sent lower-level workers on “fly ins” to Washington to persuade Congress that the mandatory expensing of options would devastate everyday workers. (Wonder what those trips cost shareholders?) But as anyone who has analyzed option grants will tell you, it was executives who got the biggest grants. Indeed, an analysis by Jack T. Ciesielski, editor of The Analyst’s Accounting Observer, shows that of the 53 companies under investigation for stock option grants as of June 30, some 57 percent of them granted considerably more options to their top executives during the past five years than their peers did. So the companies that may have fiddled with their options grants also had a habit of granting options heavily at the top. Among the companies with options grants weighted toward executives is CA Inc., formerly known as Computer Associates International. High-ranking officials at CA received, on average, 40 percent of the company’s total grants each year between 2000 and 2005, according to Mr. Ciesielski; that figure is significantly above the average annual grant of 11.3 percent to executives in the information technology industry. Some former CA executives have pleaded guilty in recent months to felonies associated with a $2.2 billion accounting scandal. A CA spokeswoman said that in 2006, it began awarding restricted stock units to employees while stock options were granted to executives and that the company was among the first to expense option grants. Delta Petroleum is another standout in executive option grants, according to Mr. Ciesielski. Almost half its grants went to top executives in the past five years, on average; the industry average is 21 percent. The company declined to comment. At Caremark Rx, a health care concern, executives received an average of 40 percent of the options granted over the five years Mr. Ciesielski studied. In the health care industry, the average during that time was 22 percent. A Caremark spokesman said that in 2000, the company’s chief executive exchanged a large cash award for options, raising the grant average. Excluding that exchange, he said, brings the average annual grant to executives at the company to 27.7 percent over the period. And executives at Computer Sciences got 26.4 percent of the company’s grants, on average; that’s more than double that industry’s average of 11.3 percent. The company declined to comment. According to Mr. Ciesielski’s data, top executives at Brocade, a maker of data-storage networking products, received an average of 13.9 percent of the company’s overall grants. The average grant to executives in its sector was 11.3 percent. In addition to criminal prosecutors, the Securities and Exchange Commission also filed suit. The S.E.C. contended that from 2000 to 2004, Brocade officials falsified company records, including minutes of board meetings. As a result of options backdating, according to the suit, Brocade’s expenses were understated. Lawyers for the Brocade officials denied the charges. Big grants to executives were also common at some of the companies rocked by scandal in recent years — like WorldCom and Tyco International. Back in 2000, for example, L. Dennis Kozlowski, then the chief executive of Tyco, received almost 17 percent of all the options granted by the company that year, while Mark H. Swartz, former chief financial officer, received 8.35 percent. Both Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Swartz, found guilty last year of looting the company, are guests of the New York state prison system. OPTIONS are not inherently bad, of course. Options do not cause crookedness. But the easy money that they represented for companies and executives, especially when the awards were not accounted for as a cost or monitored by investors, seems to have encouraged some corporate chiselers to take advantage of their shareholders, whom they never had to face. “It’s like a crime where you don’t know the victim,” Mr. Ciesielski said. “It’s easier to take advantage of somebody when they don’t know what you’re doing.” Investors are getting a clearer view of what these executives were doing with their beloved options. It’s not pretty. But at least it’s the truth, not a mirage.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00EEDA143FF930A15754C0A9609C8B63&amp;ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">THE WEEK; Store Worker Arrested In Juice Tampering<date>Published: July 23, 2006</date><text>The pastor at the Calvary Baptist Church in Darien said on Monday that he was pleased that the police had arrested a man for tampering with the grape juice used in serving communion that made about 40 members of his congregation ill in February. The man, Wendell Woodroffe, below, 28, of Stamford, was not affiliated with the church. ''It just proved my original theory, that it was a random act, not necessarily aimed at the church, nor done by someone within the congregation,'' said Anthony L. Gibson, the pastor. The police in Darien arrested Mr. Woodroffe, an employee of a CVS store in Darien where the grape juice was bought, and charged him with multiple counts of second-degree assault. He was also charged with another count in an unrelated case in which a woman drank contaminated prune juice that was bought at the same store in January. The Associated Press reported that, in an arrest affidavit filed in Superior Court in Stamford, Mr. Woodroffe said he had put dishwashing soap in the juice because he was not appreciated at work. He said he had not meant to hurt anyone and felt bad that people had become sick. Mr. Woodroffe, who had worked for CVS since 1998, was fired after his arrest on Monday. The company said it examined items in the store for possible tampering in February and had been regularly checking other items since. Mr. Woodroffe was arraigned on Tuesday and released on $75,000 bond. His lawyer, Philip Russell, said he would plead not guilty. JEFF HOLTZ Photo</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/03/us/03tugboat.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">On Cape Cod, a Land Deal Leaves a Tugboat's Fate Hazy<date>Published: July 3, 2006</date><text>BOURNE, Mass., June 29  For 24 years, a landlocked green tugboat has served as an unofficial welcome sign to this gateway to Cape Cod, a signal to excited children and traffic-weary adults that summer vacation is not far away. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge this Image Jodi Hilton for The New York Times New York Central 16, built in 1924, sits near the Bourne Bridge in Massachusetts, at a site where the CVS drugstore chain plans to move in. This summer, however, will be its last in Bourne and possibly its last ever. The CVS drugstore chain plans to buy the property where the tugboat, the New York Central 16, sits, and scrap the boat to make way for a 13,000-square-foot store. "Unless an organization is able to salvage it, it will be demolished a short time after closing," said Mike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, which expects to close on the land deal with the Hegarty Family Trust by mid-July. The possibility of demolition has upset some residents and tourists, as well as a small but dedicated group of tugboat enthusiasts who are trying to save the steam-powered vessel. "It's a genuine piece of maritime history that shouldn't be lost," said Charles Schneider, an environmental consultant from Raynham, Mass., who is leading the effort. Mr. Schneider said his goal was to find a new home for the tugboat and to secure donated equipment to move it. Mystic Seaport, a museum in Mystic, Conn., has expressed interest in using it for a tugboat exhibit, he said. Officials in Bourne, however, have said they do not want the boat. It will cost about $250,000 to move the tug, which is structurally unsound, according to an analysis commissioned by the property developer; the town does not have the money. And a CVS would draw business to the area, said Thomas Moccia, president of the nearby Buzzards Bay Village Association. "The tugboat situation is regrettable," Mr. Moccia said. "But we have a major national firm coming to Buzzards Bay, an area where there is virtually no investment." Mr. DeAngelis said CVS would allow the town's historical society to take items from the tugboat and would be willing to let anyone who could pay to transport the boat have it. Jeff Monroe, director of ports and transportation for Portland, Me., has tried to find space in his city. Mr. Monroe is also on the board of directors at the Maritime Industry Museum at the State University of New York Maritime College in the Bronx, and would rather see the boat go to the museum. "I don't think people realize the value of what that tug represents," said Mr. Monroe, who added that he would like to see it as part of a memorial to tug workers. "It's the last of its kind." James J. McNamara, chairman of the museum, said he supported the museum's acquisition of the boat. "We would love to have it because of the history of not only that tugboat but the entire industry," Mr. McNamara said. "It's a typical tugboat from the 1920's, when this New York Harbor used to be filled with hundreds of them." Central 16 was built in 1924 in Elizabeth, N.J., for the New York Central Railroad and was "a very hard worker," said Tom Flagg, a maritime historian who has written several books about New York Harbor. Most of the boat's work involved moving barges carrying railroad cars, but it also moved grain to Brooklyn breweries and coal to Long Island, Mr. Flagg said. In 1968, the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroads merged and did away with steam tugs, sending them to a yard in Staten Island. In the early 1980's, Howard Shaw, a Bourne restaurant owner, wanted a tugboat to place outside his restaurant. He contacted Steve Lang, a maritime enthusiast from Maine, who helped Mr. Shaw transport the boat to Bourne. Mr. Shaw sawed off the bottom, docked the boat on a concrete pad and repainted it to its original olive green color. The restaurant closed years ago and now sits vacant. Mr. Flagg and others say the Central 16 may be the last surviving New York steam railroad tug. Most were scrapped in the 1970's. On a rainy Thursday in Bourne, locals and those who arrived early for the holiday weekend waxed nostalgic for the boat. "It's just an icon of the cape, really," said Dennis Roche, 50, a firefighter from nearby Mashpee. "It should stay. It's been here for what, 25 years? It's just changing the cape in the wrong direction." Rick McGinn, 37, a visitor from West Boylston, Mass., said the tug brought back memories of summer vacation. "I've been coming to the cape since I was a kid," Mr. McGinn said, "and it's always been there. It's just neat seeing a boat on land." More Articles in National »BOURNE, Mass., June 29  For 24 years, a landlocked green tugboat has served as an unofficial welcome sign to this gateway to Cape Cod, a signal to excited children and traffic-weary adults that summer vacation is not far away. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge this Image Jodi Hilton for The New York Times New York Central 16, built in 1924, sits near the Bourne Bridge in Massachusetts, at a site where the CVS drugstore chain plans to move in. This summer, however, will be its last in Bourne and possibly its last ever. The CVS drugstore chain plans to buy the property where the tugboat, the New York Central 16, sits, and scrap the boat to make way for a 13,000-square-foot store. "Unless an organization is able to salvage it, it will be demolished a short time after closing," said Mike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS, which expects to close on the land deal with the Hegarty Family Trust by mid-July. The possibility of demolition has upset some residents and tourists, as well as a small but dedicated group of tugboat enthusiasts who are trying to save the steam-powered vessel. "It's a genuine piece of maritime history that shouldn't be lost," said Charles Schneider, an environmental consultant from Raynham, Mass., who is leading the effort. Mr. Schneider said his goal was to find a new home for the tugboat and to secure donated equipment to move it. Mystic Seaport, a museum in Mystic, Conn., has expressed interest in using it for a tugboat exhibit, he said. Officials in Bourne, however, have said they do not want the boat. It will cost about $250,000 to move the tug, which is structurally unsound, according to an analysis commissioned by the property developer; the town does not have the money. And a CVS would draw business to the area, said Thomas Moccia, president of the nearby Buzzards Bay Village Association. "The tugboat situation is regrettable," Mr. Moccia said. "But we have a major national firm coming to Buzzards Bay, an area where there is virtually no investment." Mr. DeAngelis said CVS would allow the town's historical society to take items from the tugboat and would be willing to let anyone who could pay to transport the boat have it. Jeff Monroe, director of ports and transportation for Portland, Me., has tried to find space in his city. Mr. Monroe is also on the board of directors at the Maritime Industry Museum at the State University of New York Maritime College in the Bronx, and would rather see the boat go to the museum. "I don't think people realize the value of what that tug represents," said Mr. Monroe, who added that he would like to see it as part of a memorial to tug workers. "It's the last of its kind." James J. McNamara, chairman of the museum, said he supported the museum's acquisition of the boat. "We would love to have it because of the history of not only that tugboat but the entire industry," Mr. McNamara said. "It's a typical tugboat from the 1920's, when this New York Harbor used to be filled with hundreds of them."

Now it has a new target: the pre-potty-training set. Making an unusual foray into the infant care market, Playskool's owner, Hasbro, will introduce a line of Playskool diapers, baby wipes and sippy cups today. The venture, if successful, could help expand the reach of a marquee Hasbro brand beyond traditional toys  an increasingly urgent goal in the industry because sales of action figures and board games, a cornerstone of the toy business, have tumbled. But it will also put the toymaker in direct competition with companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Kimberly-Clark, which dominate the infant care market. Playskool is untested as a purveyor of baby care staples like diapers and wipes, and it is unclear whether parents will make the switch from popular household names like Huggies, which are handed out in hospital maternity wards. Lorrie K. Browning, general manager of preschool toys at Hasbro, said the new products would put Playskool into the hands of parents who do not regularly shop in the toy aisle. New mothers, she said, visit their neighborhood pharmacies nearly twice as often as they go to, say, Wal-Mart or Target. "For a brand all about infants and toddlers, establishing a connection with moms is critical," Ms. Browning said. With this line, Playskool "will be where mom is on a very regular basis." The new line of 50 baby care products will be sold exclusively at CVS pharmacies beginning in September, where it will compete directly with national brands like Pampers. For CVS, exclusive access to the Playskool line reflects a broader effort to bolster sales of health and beauty care products, which can deliver higher profit margins than its primary business, filling pharmacy prescriptions. Over the last several years, CVS has developed a robust licensing program that has allowed it to slap brand names like Life Fitness (the workout equipment maker) onto a line of vitamins and Christophe (the Beverly Hills stylist) onto a collection of hair care products. Michael Bloom, senior vice president of merchandising at CVS, said Playskool had the name recognition and credibility "to cross over from toys to personal care." The Playskool products will be priced slightly higher than the traditional CVS store brand but below those of national brands. Displays at all 6,000 CVS stores will feature Playskool's signature red signage, faux children's handwriting and characters like Weebles. "There are customers," Mr. Bloom said, "who will not use the CVS brand" for baby care products but might try Playskool because it is "a national mega-brand." The financial terms of the Playskool-CVS agreement  set to be announced at the annual convention of the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association, which begins today in Manhattan  were not disclosed. Hasbro, the nation's second-largest toy maker behind Mattel, has dabbled in baby accessories before with bottles and rattles. But the new line represents its first full collection of baby care products. The line  90 percent of which is new for Hasbro  will include spoons, nipples, teethers, and bottle-cleaning brushes. Playskool remains one of the fastest-growing divisions of Hasbro and a central one to its future. Hasbro reported revenue of $3 billion last year, but nearly $500 million of that, or about 16 percent, came from products tied to the release of "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith." Hasbro's game business has slipped significantly as nimble competitors have rolled out products like Scene It?, a hit video game played on DVD, and Cranium, the popular board game. At the same time, Hasbro standbys like G.I. Joe and Transformers have suffered sales declines as fickle children move on to newer fads. Analysts say Playskool is a logical brand to extend beyond toys because preschoolers (birth to 6 years old) are the least susceptible to the industry's biggest enemy, age compression, the phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at ever-younger ages. (In part because of age compression, overall toy sales fell nearly 4 percent in 2005, to $21.3 billion, according to the market research firm NPD Group.) The problem has become most acute among so-called tweens, children 8 to 12, who have tossed aside Barbie and Matchbox cars in favor of MP3 players and digital cameras. But it has also begun seeping into the preschool toy market and, to hold on to those children, Hasbro's chief rival, Mattel, has created a line of preschool electronics. So far, Playskool has chosen to emphasize traditional toys, with a few electronic bells and whistles sprinkled in. But to extend the brand's reach and protect it from age compression, Playskool is also developing clothing and book lines. Like the baby care products at CVS, those lines will take the brand beyond the toy aisle, where fierce competition has led to deep, profit-eating discounts. Sean P. McGowan, a toy analyst at Harris Nesbitt, said that Playskool's baby care line represented "smart, creative, out-of-the-box thinking" for a brand that largely sat on the sidelines as competitors like Fisher-Price and Leapfrog came to dominate emerging markets like preschool electronics. Because CVS carries the products, the risks are relatively low for Hasbro, Mr. McGowan said. And there is a strong chance, he predicted, that parents will give it a try. "The consumer," he noted, "does trust the Playskool brand."

Ryan seems almost cocky. As the chief executive of the $30 billion drugstore chain CVS, things have been looking good lately. Both sales and earnings have hit record highs. The stock price, taking into consideration a 2-for-1 split in May, is up 30 percent over last year. "We beat the Street the last six quarters," Mr. Ryan said. "Still, we're trading at about a 20 percent discount, so that makes our stock a great deal." Skip to next paragraph Robert Spencer for The New York Times Thomas Ryan. The company, based in Woonsocket, R.I., is neck and neck with Walgreen for the most prescriptions filled, and this year it plans to open 250 to 275 stores. In the last few years, Mr. Ryan has watched one of his chief rivals, Rite-Aid, go through a protracted scandal. His acquisition of another competitor, Eckerd, has been called one of the smoothest in drugstore history. Although sales at stores open at least a year - the retail industry's yardstick, known as same-store sales - disappointed a few analysts lately, Mr. Ryan recently raised the earnings projection for fiscal 2005 to $1.39 a share from $1.36. At the same time, Mr. Ryan, 53, is presiding over CVS during one of the biggest changes in his industry. This year and next, patents on many of the most popular medicines, including Zoloft and Zithromax, will run out - opening the way for generics. "I've explained it to the Street," he said in a recent interview. "Although branded drugs are priced higher, we believe we will sell many more generics in the future, more than making up for the price difference." Generics now make up 54 percent of total prescription sales at CVS and $23 billion nationally, and at some locations, CVS sells 60 percent generics - volume that will only rise, Mr. Ryan predicted. He recently answered some questions. Q. What is CVS doing to take advantage of the patent expirations? A. Generics are good for the patient, the payer and the provider - a triple win. Although the expirations will depress the top line growth, they will improve our gross margins. About $8 billion came off patent in 2005, and almost double will come off in 2006. Q. Although CVS has caught up to Walgreen in total prescription sales, you remain No. 2 in total sales. Could that be because your stores are smaller? A. Their stores are 30 percent larger, but our sales per square foot are the highest in the industry. With the Eckerd acquisition, we expect higher growth, especially in the Sun Belt states like Florida, Texas and Arizona, where we will improve our productivity in the marketplace, where Walgreen has been strong. Q. Might you increase the size of your stores, then? A. No, our stores are 12,000 square feet, and that works for us. What we have to focus on is what we don't want to sell - and weed out what doesn't. Q. Walgreen makes about 40 percent of its total sales in the so-called front of the store, which includes everything from cosmetics to lawn chairs to photo processing. What are you doing to become No. 1 in that area? A. We have launched proprietary products, like the skin care line called Lumene, the No. 1 seller in Scandinavia. Then there is Skin Effects, which was developed by a dermatologist in Boston. Remember something called Nuprin? We bought the brand. Then we have an exclusive with Christophe, the salon guru from Beverly Hills, who gives all those celebrities haircuts. Then we're coming out with Playskool Diapers, an exclusive at CVS. Q. Any other innovations planned? A. Oh, yes. We're just introducing clinics within our stores, staffed with nurse practitioners who can diagnose common ear infections, screen for high blood pressure, give school vaccinations. There are three stores up, two in Minnesota; we're partnering with the MinuteClinic in Minneapolis, and we hope to have 60 soon. Q. Isn't there an increased potential for liability in such a system? A. It's not designed to supercede physicians, but to complement them. Think of medics in the Army. Many of the customers don't even have a primary physician. We link our care to a primary physician if they have one, and we'll refer them to one if they don't. And we don't treat infants or the elderly. This is for people who can't get insurance.

The lawsuits said that the acquired company, AdvancePCS, accepted kickbacks from drug makers to promote their products over those of rivals under contracts with government programs including the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, the Mail Handlers Health Benefit Program and Medicare health maintenance plans. There was no admission of wrongdoing by Caremark or AdvancePCS. The chief executive of Caremark, Mac Crawford, said in a statement, "We are pleased with the settlement with the federal government as it allows us to avoid the expense, uncertainty and distraction of potentially time-consuming litigation." Wall Street analysts said the settlement could amount to $80 million after taxes, which they said was provided for in an adjustment to good will when Caremark bought AdvancePCS for $5.6 billion. In trading yesterday, Caremark shares lost 39 cents, to close at $48.26. The United States attorney in Philadelphia, Patrick L. Meehan, said the settlement and a similar agreement with Medco Health Solutions, another large pharmacy benefit manager, "opens the door to much more transparency" as the two companies and their competitors take on a significant role in the new federal Medicare drug program that starts in January. Caremark also agreed yesterday to be more open about business dealings involving the AdvancePCS unit - something that will be monitored by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. In return, it received assurances that it would not be excluded from serving the Medicare, Medicaid and federal employees benefits programs, said Barbara Rowland, an assistant United States attorney in Philadelphia who worked on the six-year investigation of the pharmacy benefits industry. Lawsuits filed by state attorneys general that accuse Caremark of pocketing part of the payments that health plans intended for retail pharmacies are pending in nine states - California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia - as well as the District of Columbia, said W. Scott Simmer, a lawyer for the whistle-blowers, three former employees of AdvancePCS and its predecessors, PCS Health Systems and Advance Paradigm. How much of the settlement will be shared by the three former employees - Mary Jean Brown, an AdvancePCS clinical director; Kevin Waite, an AdvancePCS director of network development; and Karl Schumann, a former vice president of Advance Paradigm - is still unresolved, Mr. Simmer said. Medco announced a $29 million settlement with attorneys general of 20 states in April 2004. A federal civil complaint involving Medco is pending, Ms. Rowland said. In addition, the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, accused Express Scripts, another drug plan manager, last year of defrauding the state of tens of millions of dollars by inflating the cost of drugs. That case is pending. Spokesmen for Caremark, Medco and Express Scripts say they already disclose the payments they receive from drug companies as the pharmacy benefit managers select certain drugs for preferred status, which translates into larger sales. With the Medicare drug benefit, Congress has asked federal officials to make sure that such practices do not result in increased costs to the program. Correction: An article in Business Day yesterday on the settlement of a federal lawsuit against Caremark Rx misstated the status of related lawsuits pending against the company.

Everyone Wants Your Business<date>Published: June 8, 2005</date><text>HERYL CONTEE has owned a digital camera for five years, and until last month, she always printed photos the same way: at home, using her Hewlett-Packard printer. But on Mother's Day, just as she was about to print snapshots from a trip to California to show her grandmother later that day, Ms. Contee, who lives in Washington, discovered she was out of photo paper and low on toner. She didn't have time to get both things and print the photos, so she went to a digital printing kiosk at a CVS pharmacy down the street. Using the kiosk, she edited, cropped and enhanced the color on some shots the way she would have done at home, then shopped while the photos were printing. She walked out the door a few minutes later, prints in hand for just 29 cents each. "I thought it would be expensive and hard," Ms. Contee said of the kiosk, "but it wasn't at all." While she plans to buy a new printer soon and still produce some photographs at home, "the kiosk is definitely in my future, too." When cameras used only film, consumers didn't have much of a choice about where to get their photos printed, unless they had a darkroom at home. Now, with 80 percent of cameras sold this year projected to be digital models, consumers have more options than ever about where, or even if, to print their snapshots. One result is an all-out war among retailers, printer manufacturers and online companies like Snapfish for a piece of the $8.2 billion pie that the Photo Marketing Association International said consumers spent on printing photos last year. Each entity is trying to bill its services as the cheapest, easiest and, most important, the highest quality. Until recently, digital-camera owners favored printing their own photos at home. About 90 percent said they printed their own photos, according to surveys by InfoTrends/CAP Ventures, a market researcher in Weymouth, Mass. But Kerry Flatley, a consultant with InfoTrends, said the share of those printing at retailers grew rapidly in the last two years - 37 percent in 2004, up from 14 percent the year before. "More retailers have the equipment, so now they're advertising," Ms. Flatley said. There are now 75,000 photo kiosks in the United States, she said, and that number is expected to increase to 121,000 by 2008. What's more, she said, early adopters of digital cameras were mostly consumers adept at using technology who were often content to print at home. Now that the cameras have become mass-market gear, new owners are more likely to want ease and convenience. Price is also a big factor. In recent months, retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco have cut their prices for digital prints. A standard 4-by-6-inch print from a digital camera currently costs 19 cents at Wal-Mart, 17 cents at Costco and 15 cents at Sam's Club, the warehouse club of Wal-Mart. By the end of this month, Costco plans to finish rolling out a service that allows its members to upload images from their computers to Costco's Web site and then pick up the prints at the store within the hour. At the same time, printer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard are trying to combat the perception that home printing is expensive and time-consuming. Hewlett-Packard sells packets of ink and photo paper that make the cost of 4-by-6-inch prints as low as 24 cents (not including the cost of the printer, of course). While Larry Lesley, a senior vice president at the company, conceded that the price was higher than some retailers charge, he said the "small incremental difference for the convenience, choice and control you get in the home is well worth it" for many customers, who sometimes need to print photos immediately. To get that speed before the arrival of digital cameras, he noted, people used to pay $1 apiece for Polaroid prints. The price advantage that retailers hold over printing at home often disappears when it comes to larger prints, said Lowrie Beacham of Durham, N.C. He produces 5-by-7-inch and 8-by-10-inch prints on his Hewlett-Packard printer because "the stores never advertise those prices in large print on their advertisements like they do the prices for 4-by-6." A 5-by-7 at Costco, for instance, costs 69 cents; it's $1.99 for 8-by-10. But for people like Mr. Beacham who like to print at home, it's more than just about price. Bill Brown of Arlington, Va., said he liked to play around with his images, mainly to correct the color by adjusting brightness and contrast in Photoshop. "When I show my photos to co-workers, they can't believe that I printed them on a creaky desktop inkjet printer that I paid $120 for," Mr. Brown said. Indeed, by printing at home, Mr. Lesley of Hewlett-Packard said customers could exercise their creative juices by using software to stitch together panoramic shots, make a video or add music. Next for the company is easing the transfer of photos from camera cellphones. "There is a sense of pride of creation about printing at home," Mr. Lesley said. Mr. Beacham and Mr. Brown agree. Mr. Brown prints his own photo Christmas cards at home "although I know it costs me a fortune, because I like the challenge." Mr. Beacham said he was not creative, "so printing at home is my one chance to be." Still, he is not totally wedded to home printing. When he wants to print a stack of 4-by-6 photos, he sends them to the online photo site Shutterfly, which charges 29 cents - or 19 cents prepaid - and mails them to him in a day or two. Another online photo site, Snapfish, owned by Hewlett-Packard, recently announced that it was lowering the price for printing a 4-by-6 digital photo to 12 cents (or 10 cents for prepaid plans). Digital photos, of course, never have to see paper to be shared, or even tossed out. Mr. Beacham notes that he prints only about one of every 20 pictures he takes. He is not alone. About 80 percent of digital pictures taken are never developed, Mr. Lesley of Hewlett-Packard said. The overall number of prints made at home and in stores last year fell 4.5 percent to 27.4 billion, according to a survey by the Photo Marketing Association International. So no matter how easy or cheap it is to print digital photos, some people seem content collecting many of their photos virtually. "A hard drive and CD's take up less space than shoeboxes and photo albums," Mr. Beacham said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4DA163CF930A25750C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">When Prescriptions Cost Less, Who Pays?<date>Published: March 13, 2005</date><text>PAUL LIVERT of Oceanside has had to dig deep into his pockets for prescription drugs. Last year, he said, he shelled out $2,643 on a variety of medications for the kinds of ailments that come with reaching age 84. ''There's a blood thinner, pills for poor circulation, a slow thyroid, arthritis and a potassium deficiency,'' said Mr. Livert, a retired musician. But in recent months Mr. Livert's prescription costs have been easier to swallow. He said that with the Nassau Rx card, a discount drug plan, instead of the $220 he previously paid in a typical month for prescription drugs, he shells out only $180. ''Forty dollars is an appreciable amount to save,'' he said. ''Nothing comes in but Social Security and the little money I have in the bank.'' The plan saves Mr. Livert and other Nassau residents about 20 percent on commonly prescribed brand-name and generic drugs sold in independent and chain pharmacies in Nassau and throughout the country. The card, introduced last July by the county comptroller, Howard Weitzman, to fight the rising cost of prescription drugs, has no age or income requirements and no enrollment fees. Residents with insurance and prescription coverage can use the Nassau card on drugs not covered by their plans, but not to reduce a co-payment or to receive an additional discount on a prescription. County officials say those who benefit the most from the card are the 350,000 residents who have no insurance or drug coverage, or inadequate coverage. There is no cost to county government, but an 85-cent administrative fee charged by Caremark Rx of Nashville, the pharmacy benefit manager Nassau County selected to oversee the prescription program, is built into the cost of the each prescription paid by the customer. Pharmacists who agree to participate in the plan have to pay the difference in drug prices, which averages about $18 per prescription. While Mr. Weitzman touts the drug card as a boon to county residents, pharmacists argue that the price breaks eat into already lean profit margins. They say it's unfair to saddle pharmacists with virtually the entire cost of the program. To remain competitive, pharmacists say they have no choice but to sign contracts to participate in national networks of drug discount cards or prescription programs sponsored by pharmacy benefit managers like Caremark. A contract obliges pharmacists to honor any card sponsored by the pharmacy benefit manager, explained Kirby Bessant, Caremark's vice president for consumer programs. Some 92 percent of pharmacy customers have insurance or prescription coverage, and only about 8 percent of customers pay for their prescriptions out of pocket, said Craig Burridge, the executive director of the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York. Mr. Weitzman said that more than 90 percent of the county's 345 pharmacies honor the Nassau discount drug card. ''This program could not be successful without their participation,'' said Mr. Weitzman, a former mayor of Great Neck Estates and a certified public accountant who once served as the chief executive of the Epic Health Group Inc., a mail-order pharmaceutical company. ''We have tried to work with them to help level the playing field, and as a result of our program, consumers who were paying retail no longer have to shop around for the best price.'' The program was unveiled to the public at a July 2004 news conference. Furious pharmacists phoned Mr. Weitzman later that month to voice their opposition to the program. ''After all, we are the ones footing the bill,'' said Howard Jacobson, a pharmacist who owns the Rockville Centre Pharmacy. Joined by the county assessor, Harvey Levinson, Mr. Weitzman met with about two dozen pharmacists in August to discuss how they could cope with the financial fallout. According to Allen Morrison, a spokesman for Mr. Weitzman, Mr. Levinson explained how the pharmacists might apply for ''tax reductions on their commercial properties, which are based on their expectations of lowered income.''</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4D91338F93AA25752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; BATTLE OVER PRESCRIPTION BENEFITS IN OHIO SPREADS TO CVS<date>Published: January 19, 2005</date><text>The CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain, will stop honoring the insurance of Ohio's state employees and the Toyota Motor Corporation workers because their prescription plans cut retailers out of the competition for long-term refills. CVS, with more than 305 Ohio stores, will not accept the state government's drug coverage through Express Scripts Inc. as of April 18. Participation in Toyota's pharmacy network, administered by WellPoint Inc., will end Feb. 18, CVS said.

Company officials said Perrigo, which makes drugs for Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreen, Kroger, Target, Kmart and Sam's Club, was acquiring Agis, based in Israel, as a way to expand into the more lucrative business of generic prescription drugs, a market that is growing by more than 10 percent a year. Growth in the market for over-the-counter store-branded drugs has slowed to about 1 percent a year because of intense competition. Perrigo makes store-branded equivalents of Tylenol, Advil, One-A-Day and Flintstones vitamins, Centrum and Ensure, among other brands. Agis also makes some over-the-counter creams and has signed contracts with multinational drug companies including Bayer and Schering-Plough. It is the second-largest pharmaceutical company in Israel, after Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Agis also has factories in Germany and New York. Dave Gibbons, Perrigo's chairman, president and chief executive, said the deal with Agis provided "the opportunity to accelerate growth." For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the combined company would have had $1.3 billion in revenue and nearly 6,000 employees. The new company will have operations in the United States, Israel, Europe and Mexico, and will be based in Allegan, Mich., where Perrigo currently is based. Under the terms of the agreement, Agis's stockholders will receive 0.8011 share of Perrigo stock and $14.93 in cash for each ordinary share of Agis they own, representing a premium of more than 20 percent over its stock price yesterday. Goldman Sachs acted as financial adviser to Perrigo, and Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius provided legal counsel. Merrill Lynch and Bank Leumi acted as financial advisers to Agis, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom provided legal counsel.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0DE4D71538F933A0575AC0A9629C8B63&amp;ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; CVS TO CLOSE 160 ECKERD STORES WITH LAGGING SALES<date>Published: September 30, 2004</date><text>The CVS Corporation, operator of the CVS chain of drugstores, said that it planned to close 160 Eckerd stores this year, or about one-eighth of those acquired from the J.C.

The concept has sparked interest from officials in New York City and elsewhere who are considering adopting their own versions.Although a few such municipal plans exist elsewhere, Nassau says its program has a unique combination of features that makes it superior to the others and even to the new federal discount cards for the elderly.Every Nassau resident is eligible for the card, regardless of age, income or insurance, unlike most other government plans.The program, called NassauRx, costs the patient nothing; others often charge fees ranging from $10 to $30 a year. The card requires no application or other paperwork, unlike most other plans. It will be accepted at 75 percent of Nassau's drugstores, and their branches around the country. It entitles customers to discounts averaging 15 to 20 percent for brand-name drugs and up to 50 percent for generics, county officials say. And there is no cost to the county, and no fee for residents to join.''Starting today, there is no need for anyone in Nassau County to pay retail prices for prescription drugs,'' County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman said at a news conference here. The discounts will help people of marginal means avoid ''making a daily choice between putting food on the table and taking the full prescribed dose of life-sustaining medications,'' he said.Nassau solicited nine bids from companies that administer drug cards and awarded the contract to AdvancePCS, a division of Caremark Rx in Nashville. The company printed and mailed the cards and is running the program under county oversight.AdvancePCS negotiated prices with drug manufacturers, including rebates for itself, and with drugstores, who pay some fees to participate. Although discounts cut profits for the stores, they join to stay competitive and hope to make up the loss on volume.The nearest counties with drug-discount cards are Westchester in New York and Bergen in New Jersey, both of which require applications and charge fees. Bergen's is for people ages 55 and older.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/27/nyregion/in-brief-nassau-residents-to-get-free-drug-discount-cards.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">IN BRIEF; Nassau Residents to Get Free Drug Discount Cards<date>Published: June 27, 2004</date><text>All Nassau County households with a registered voter will be mailed a free drug discount card during the first week of July. The cards will provide an average 20 percent discount off commonly prescribed drugs.''Once these cards are sent, there will be no reason for anyone in Nassau County to pay retail for drugs again,'' said Howard Weitzman, the Nassau County comptroller, who arranged for the cards.He said AdvancePCS, a division of Caremark Rx Inc. of Nashville, had negotiated discounts with drug manufacturers and pharmacies and would operate the program at no cost to the county. Mr. Weitzman said the county program would be available to residents of all ages.He said that about 350,000 Nassau residents have inadequate or no drug insurance.

But Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said last week that he believed that passage of legislation to allow imports of lower-cost medicines was inevitable.Representative Gil Gutknecht, Republican of Minnesota, a supporter of drug imports, said on Monday: ''There's a lot of momentum in our direction. We are at the two-yard line.''He added: ''More and more governors are joining the team. Tommy Thompson has all but conceded that something will happen. It's time to open our markets and let Americans have access to world-class drugs at world market prices.''Two of the nation's largest pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens, gave a qualified endorsement to the idea, saying commercial drug imports would be much safer than unregulated imports by individuals. And the attorneys general of 19 states pleaded with federal officials to permit imports of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration.''Either allow the states to be appointed as licensed wholesalers or allow the states to contract with licensed wholesalers for the importation of F.D.A.-approved prescription drugs from Canada,'' they said in a letter to Mr. Thompson.Under their proposal, states or their designated wholesalers would sign contracts with licensed Canadian pharmacies that met safety standards set by state health officials, and drugs would be shipped directly to the states.Insurers are also expressing interest. Dr. Alan M. Muney, executive vice president and chief medical officer of Oxford Health Plans, which insures 1.5 million people, said on Monday, ''We would strongly support importation of drugs,'' with safeguards of the type proposed in Congress.The new Medicare law bars the federal government from negotiating prices directly with drug makers on behalf of beneficiaries. But Dr. Muney said that ''importation would be an effective way for Medicare recipients, private health plans and employers to get lower drug costs,'' despite the statutory ban.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/06/business/company-news-cvs-reports-that-first-quarter-profit-climbed-25.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; CVS REPORTS THAT FIRST-QUARTER PROFIT CLIMBED 25%<date>Published: May 06, 2004</date><text>The CVS Corporation said yesterday that its first-quarter profit rose nearly 25 percent from a year ago, helped by sales of pharmacy products and goods at established stores.

Penney Sells Drugstore Chain For $4.5 Billion<date>Published: April 06, 2004</date><text>The J.C. Penney Company said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its Eckerd drugstore chain for $4.53 billion to two buyers, freeing it from what some analysts considered a strategic mismatch that slowed its march toward reinvention.After complicated negotiations, the buyers, CVS and the Jean Coutu Group, said they would divide Eckerd's 2,800 stores, as well as related businesses, creating two larger chains within the drugstore business, where Wal-Mart Stores has become an increasingly influential competitor.CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., will pay $2.15 billion for 1,260 stores, most of them in Texas and Florida, along with Eckerd's companies involved in pharmacy-benefits management and mail-order. Jean Coutu, based in Montreal, will pay $2.375 billion to acquire 1,539 stores on the East Coast and the Eckerd home office in Clearwater, Fla.The split was necessary, a CVS executive said, because CVS has many stores in the Northeast and it might have run afoul of the Federal Trade Commission if it had tried to buy every Eckerd store there as well. ''Adding anything by acquisition is going to be tough from an F.T.C. standpoint,'' said CVS's chief financial officer, David B. Rickard.With the Eckerd acquisition, CVS will grow to 5,339 stores from 4,179, an increase of nearly 30 percent. It will be the second-largest drug chain, behind Walgreen. Jean Coutu, which owns the Brooks chain of drugstores in New York and New England, will have 1,872 stores, up from 333.''We were looking for an acquisition that would allow us to pursue growth at an attractive price for our shareholders,'' Jean Coutu's president, FranÃ§ois J. Coutu, said in a statement.''The Eckerd drugstores were exactly what we were looking for,'' he said.Analysts have long said that Eckerd stores are poorly managed and have not kept up with competitors by increasing the array of food, beverages and other nondrug items they sell. Last year, the division's profits fell nearly 47 percent, to $85 million from $160 million, although the performance was better than predictions.J.C. Penney's chairman and chief executive, Allen I. Questrom, said in a statement that the sale would ''allow both J.C. Penney and Eckerd to maximize their potential.'' He said that Penney would be able to focus ''entirely on our core department store and catalog/Internet business.''In its fourth-quarter earnings report, J.C. Penney listed Eckerd as a discontinued operation and valued the business at $4.3 billion.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/05/us/deal-is-close-on-sale-of-eckerd-to-2-firms.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Deal Is Close on Sale Of Eckerd to 2 Firms<date>Published: April 05, 2004</date><text>The J. C. Penney Company is close to an agreement to sell its Eckerd drugstore division to the CVS Corporation and the Jean Coutu Group of Canada for about $4.5 billion, executives close to the negotiations say.The companies were completing the details of the deal Sunday night and hoped to announce the transaction today, the executives said.The sale involves splitting Eckerd along geographic lines. CVS is expected to pay about $2 billion for Eckerd's roughly 1,200 stores in the South while Jean Coutu, which owns the Brooks pharmaceutical chain in the United States, will pay about $2.5 billion for Eckerd's 1,500 stores in the North. The stores are expected to be renamed CVS or Brooks, and most are likely to remain open.The sale of Eckerd will send ripples across the national retail scene and could affect Wal-Mart, industry analysts and others say, by creating a smaller-scale but strong competitor on the pharmacy front.The purchase of Eckerd could speed a consolidation of other drug chains, leaving a few giants to battle Wal-Mart for customers. ''We are going to see a shakeout in the next few years,'' said Rob Culin, a principal with Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm.For J. C. Penney, shedding Eckerd will produce cash for merchandising or more department stores. But most important, Eckerd ''now no longer will be a distraction'' for J. C. Penney, said Deborah Weinswig, a retail analyst for Citigroup.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/16/business/cvs-forecasts-growth.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">CVS Forecasts Growth<date>Published: December 16, 2003</date><text>The CVS Corporation, the drugstore chain, said yesterday that profit in 2004 would increase to as much as $2.18 a share amid rising sales and cost reductions.Profit will range from $2.14 to $2.18 a share, up from this year's projected profit of $1.95 to $2.

Some critics saw another problem, the possible narrowing of competition.The two companies announced late Tuesday that Caremark, the fourth-largest pharmacy benefit manager, or P.B.M., had agreed to buy Advance, the second-largest, for $5.6 billion in stock and cash. The deal valued Advance at $54.61 a share, representing a 37 percent premium on Tuesday's closing price.''All the big P.B.M.'s are a bit overvalued,'' said Damon Ficklin, a health care analyst at Morningstar. ''For Caremark Rx to pay a significant premium is just one step further away from what we think they should be paying.''Drug benefit managers, Mr. Ficklin said, have become so big that their growth rate is slowing.Caremark shares dropped $2.10 yesterday, or 8.3 percent, to $23.30. AdvancePCS shares jumped $7.45, or 18.6 percent, to $47.45, still well below the deal's value.Pharmacy benefit managers arrange discounts and rebates from drug manufacturers for most health plan members. There is hope in the field that disease management programs will spark new growth in revenues. The programs are meant to keep down health care costs by reminding patients with conditions like diabetes and asthma to take their mediation, avoiding expensive hospital treatment.Mac Crawford, chief executive of Caremark, which is moving from Birmingham, Ala., to Nashville, will lead the new company. David D. Halbert, chief executive of Advance, based in Irving, Tex., will have a consulting role but will not join the Caremark board.Larry Marsh, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said, ''the logic of the merger makes a lot of sense.'' Still, he said he was surprised by the size of the premium.Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a managing director for the Carlyle Group, the investment firm, also said profits in drug benefit management were losing momentum. ''I don't look for their profitability to improve any more,'' he said. Long-term growth will probably shadow the drug manufacturing industry, Mr. Abramowitz added, where growth in profits has slowed to 8 percent to 12 percent, down from 15 percent in past years.He said investors were likely to be bothered by the prospect that Caremark would ''be printing a lot of new shares,'' diluting their value. Under the deal, Advance shareholders will receive 2.15 shares of Caremark for each of their shares.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/03/business/drug-plan-manager-caremark-to-buy-a-rival-for-5.6-billion.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">Drug-Plan Manager, Caremark, To Buy a Rival for $5.6 Billion<date>Published: September 03, 2003</date><text>In a deal that will combine two of the nation's largest companies that manage prescription drug benefits, Caremark Rx said last night that it had agreed to buy AdvancePCS for $5.6 billion in stock and cash.Under the terms of the deal, which must still be approved by shareholders of both companies and regulatory agencies, AdvancePCS stockholders will receive the equivalent of 2.15 shares of Caremark for each of their shares; 10 percent will be in cash and 90 percent will be in stock. Caremark will also assume about $400 million of AdvancePCS debt.Based on yesterday's stock prices, the deal values AdvancePCS at $54.61 a share, a 37 percent premium to the company's closing price of $40.Pharmacy benefit managers, or P.B.M.'s, arrange discounts and rebates from manufacturers for most health plan members. Together, the two companies handled more than 600 million prescriptions last year.Caremark and AdvancePCS hope to cash in on growing demand for programs that monitor the health status and behavior of patients with high-cost diseases like diabetes and asthma. In these disease-management programs, nurses call patients to remind them to take their pills as their doctors have ordered.Pharmacy benefit managers are also expected to play a significant role in serving elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries if Congress passes Medicare drug legislation now being debated in a Senate-House conference committee.After the deal is completed, which is expected sometime next year, Caremark Rx shareholders will own about 58 percent of the combined company, which will be based in Nashville, and AdvancePCS shareholders will have 42 percent, the companies said.Mac Crawford, the chairman and chief executive of Caremark, will be chief executive of the new company.He said the two companies had complementary strengths. ''AdvancePCS has built a strong base of managed-care customers while Caremark Rx has focused on the employer marketplace.''David D. Halbert, chief executive of AdvancePCS, based in Irving, Tex., said that by combining, the two companies would have ''a stronger infrastructure'' to help customers deal with rising drug costs, the aging population and rapid development of new health care technologies.Mr. Halbert, a longtime friend and former business associate of President Bush, will have a consulting role in the combined company.Caremark, which is moving to Nashville from Birmingham, Ala., covers about 10 million people, according to industry estimates. Caremark has a robust unit handling mail orders, the fastest-growing and most profitable sector for the drug benefit managers. AdvancePCS, itself the result of the merger of Advance Paradigm with PCS, formerly owned by McKesson, the drug wholesaler, covers about 35 million people.Benefit management companies often come up with much larger totals, reflecting double counting of health plan members who may buy some of their drugs with one company's card in retail stores and fill other prescriptions from a second company's mail pharmacy.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/31/business/company-news-cvs-says-profits-rose-on-strong-sales-of-generic-drugs.html?ref=cvscaremarkcorporation">COMPANY NEWS; CVS SAYS PROFITS ROSE ON STRONG SALES OF GENERIC DRUGS<date>Published: July 31, 2003</date><text>The CVS Corporation reported a 13 percent increase in profit for the second quarter yesterday, driven by strong sales, increased use of generic drugs and improved inventory management.
