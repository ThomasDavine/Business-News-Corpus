Hansen examined the role of good and bad fortune in business giants’ success: I like to compare tennis to real life. When you first see a good tennis player beat another champion, you begin to think he was lucky. An inch here, an inch there, and that’s it. When the same player beats another champion, you may still call it luck. But when he beats almost everybody and becomes No. 1 in the world, you have to conclude that it’s tremendous skill. And so it is with people like Bill Gates or Steve Jobs — as well as many others who aren’t necessarily as successful but who are still achieving very remarkable things. Humanity’s progress has not been a succession of lucky events. It is attributable to some enlightened leaders who ultimately led the world in the right direction. George Naniche Moraga, Calif., Oct. 31 • To the Editor: The article argued that luck did not cause Bill Gates’s success. But it did not note this “luck event”: I.B.M.’s decision, back in Microsoft’s early days, to license DOS for running royalties, rather than buying it outright. I.B.M. had the resources to buy it, but underestimated the PC’s eventual importance. If I.B.M. had bought DOS, I.B.M. would have earned the recurring profits that instead flowed to Microsoft. Rob Kunstadt Manhattan, Oct. 30 The writer is an intellectual-property lawyer. • To the Editor: The analysis of luck’s role in highly successful businesses reminded me of the wisdom of Branch Rickey, the Brooklyn Dodgers general manager who signed Jackie Robinson and thus integrated Major League Baseball. In “Branch Rickey’s Little Blue Book,” these memorable words are noted: “Things worthwhile generally just don’t happen. Luck is a fact, but should not be a factor. Good luck is what is left over after intelligence and effort have combined at their best.” “Luck,” he added, “is the residue of design.” Amy S.

DUBAI — When Hanan Abdel Meguid started her first technology company in Cairo nearly 20 years ago, the Web was not publicly available in the Middle East and many big global players like Microsoft did not operate there. Now, Ms. Meguid, 42, oversees OTVentures, one of the region’s largest technology companies, which operates in 17 countries and maintains exclusive partnerships with Facebook and Microsoft. “I started my first company with friends right after university because our dreams and our capabilities were much bigger than the opportunities in the market,” said Ms. Meguid, a mother of two. “A similar experience is happening for Arab youth today. I.T. is becoming a catalyst for change, not just a platform or business tool.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ms. Meguid has a unique perch from which to view the change. As a serial entrepreneur in the early years of the Internet, she had to develop her own playbook, learning to raise money from venture capitalists, manage multiple technology platforms and strike deals with large international companies. They are lessons she is sharing with the next generation of start-ups by guiding young entrepreneurs on how to turn ideas into commercially viable businesses. “There are a lot of depressed young people in Egypt today not finding the right work opportunities, but we have to move away from this idea that when you graduate you must find a job with a multinational company to succeed,” said Ms. Meguid, who serves as a mentor for new advisory and seed investment programs including Tahrir2, Flat6labs and Google’s Ebda2 initiative. “You can have a dream, build on it and become a major contributor to your economy without being an employee.” Ms. Meguid ended up in technology by chance. In the early 1990s as a student at the American University in Cairo, she decided to major in computer science even though she had never seen a computer. After spending nights coding, she switched to economics to try something a little easier, but a year later went back to the field, one dominated by men. She got the idea for her first venture, Microlabs, while playing squash with a classmate, Khaled Bichara, during a college trip to Sharm el Sheik, an Egyptian town on the Red Sea. Ms. Meguid and Mr. Bichara wanted to work as programmers, but the two realized that there were no companies in Egypt to develop programs for the Windows platform. I.B.M., one of the few international technology companies in Egypt at the time, had only a sales office with no development capabilities. So they decided to start their own business. “By graduation, we were all so inspired we decided to create our own lab to develop applications on Windows,” Ms. Meguid said. “And we were good.” Microlabs got off to a quick start in 1993. With only $3,500 and three computers, they landed contracts to create accounting systems for big companies and won a competition to design a time-management software for the Egyptian government. But the venture started to sour a year later when Microlabs merged with a larger software company, Pie Practical Solutions. The two businesses began working together right away to migrate a software program to the Windows platform, expecting to take care of legal paperwork later that would formalize the combination. While the business took off, everything was still legally under the name of Pie Practical, and the Microlabs team was not entitled to any of the profits. “Our partners ended up taking over the company,” said Mr. Bichara, who is currently the president of a Russian mobile service provider, VimpelCom, and group executive chairman of Orascom Telecom, a global telecommunications firm that started operations in Egypt in 1998. “We learned the hard way from this experience.” After being pushed out of the merged entity, Ms. Meguid, who had registered Microlabs in her name, was stuck winding down the operations for what was left. It was a complicated process, given that the laws about liquidating a business and settling debt were unclear at the time. Even after she thought Microlabs had been shut down, she received letters six years later from government authorities asking for outstanding taxes. Wael Amin — one of the three founders of Microlabs who stayed on with Pie — said that the merged entity eventually went broke and dissolved. With the failure fresh in her mind, she opted in 1996 for a more low-key and stable position, developing Web sites for the Egyptian government. The government role gave her access to the Internet, which was not commercially available at the time. She recalls the first Web site she saw was Yahoo, which was updated once a day with the latest news. Eventually, she was tapped to run Web development for the government. The entrepreneurial spirit remained. A year later, she joined a start-up affiliated with Orascom Telecom alongside Mr. Bichara called Link Development. It took six months for him to persuade her to join, but Ms. Meguid eventually accepted the challenge because it provided freedom to develop “dream Web sites and services” and prepare for the day when the Internet would become a commercial success. Ms. Meguid, who became the chief executive of Link, began developing cultural Web sites like yallabina.com and partnered with Microsoft at the end of 1997. “Our work together goes beyond a business partnership; I consider her an adviser or coach because she calls us out on areas that we need to fix and improve,” said Ali Faramawy, president of Microsoft’s operations in the Middle East and Africa. “I’ve seen her steadily growing in confidence and in impact.” Her past mistakes have informed her current decisions. She paid extra attention to the legal process when Link merged with InTouch Communications in 2000 to form LinkdotNet. Her network also widened when LinkdotNet acquired eight established Egyptian Internet companies two years later. After Link sold part of the business to Mobinil for $130 million last year, Ms. Meguid took on the role of chief executive of the spin-off firm, OTVentures. “She is one of very few Egyptian women who has a good knowledge of technology and of business, so she is a great inspiration to mentees,” said Wael Fakharany, head of Google’s operations in Egypt. “She’s an icon in Egypt’s Internet world.” Ms. Meguid is adapting to the changing political environment in her home country. When the Egyptian revolution began in early 2011, many of Ms. Meguid’s clients cut their budgets. But the situation also heightened the awareness of social media and entrepreneurship, all of which she thinks will drive the technology industry in the region. “The revolution turned out to be a validation of our vision,” she said.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/business/global/31iht-RCE-ROMANIA31.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">In Romania, Start-Ups Gain Strength<date>Published: October 30, 2011</date><text>PARIS — With a sparkling start-up scene and a wealth of young talent, Romanian entrepreneurs, especially in the information technologies sector, are aiming for the global market.“I am very optimistic about what start-ups can do in Romania,” Jan Muehlfeit, chairman of Microsoft Europe, said in a telephone interview. The local pool of technology talent, he said, is one of the main reasons Microsoft has invested in the country. “In the cloud, you can become a global company in a very fast way,” Mr. Muehlfeit said, referring to the services and applications that are now being provided to businesses through the Internet, by companies like Microsoft, as well as by start-ups. Shared software, data storage and other forms of cloud computing present an opportunity to outsource information technology. Microsoft has been present in Romania since 1996. Five years ago, it opened a technical center there that it says is the largest of its kind in Europe. It now acts as a partner for small businesses like software developers, sitting at the center of an array of more than 4,000 information technology companies, Mr. Muehlfeit said. As part of its Romanian operations, Microsoft provides free technology, helps companies connect with investors and supports marketing efforts through its BizSpark program for start-ups. In exchange, the partner companies have developed new applications for the Microsoft platform. Private enterprise, despised and banned by the former communist regime, emerged only two decades ago in Romania with the onset of democratic change. The country, like its neighbors, has relied heavily on foreign investment to rebuild itself from the ruins of the formerly centralized state economy. In efforts to catch up with Western competitors, a new generation of entrepreneurs still has to cope with a business culture that lags behind. Still, Romania has a number of advantages over its Western neighbors. Information technology professionals cite its large talent pool and advanced broadband infrastructure, together with low wages and an appetite for enterprise. Companies including Intel and Oracle as well as Microsoft have set up shop there, investing in call centers, software development and support services. Romanian start-ups have recently figured among the most promising in Europe. The Telegraph, a British newspaper, worked with the technology start-up blog TechCrunch to compile a 2011 ranking of the top 100 emerging technology businesses in Europe. The list included three companies from Romania. UberVU, a social media monitoring and aggregation platform, was one of the start-ups selected by the Telegraph panel. Founded in 2008, it now has offices in both Britain and Romania, with international clients and investors. Dragos Ilinca, co-founder of uberVU, said the initial financing had come from Britain. “What was difficult to do in Romania was to find the capital necessary to develop a product and take it to the market. This was in early 2008, when everyone was investing in real estate, which was generating crazy returns,” he said. When the property bubble burst, seed funds and angel investors turned their attention elsewhere and investment became more easily accessible, he said. That was too late for uberVU, which had already raised its first round of venture capital in Britain, but it presented opportunities for entrepreneurs back home. Mr. Ilinca said that for digital service start-ups seeking a larger market and more financing options, Western Europe still offered an easier environment. Still, he sees a role for companies like uberVU in Romania. “If we want to help Romania be better off economically and socially, entrepreneurship and creating high-value Romanian products and services is the way to do it,” he said. Marius Ghenea, a pioneering serial entrepreneur, has been running businesses in Romania since the early 1990s. A speaker at School for Startups, a privately run training program, he said that one of Romania’s problems was a lack of business role models. “When prompted, a lot of young people today indicate international entrepreneurial models such as Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, rather than a local model,” he said. “Entrepreneurial success is still not celebrated in Romania as it should be, for cultural reasons that will only be completely surpassed by the younger generation, born and raised after 1989.” 1 2 Next Page »PARIS — With a sparkling start-up scene and a wealth of young talent, Romanian entrepreneurs, especially in the information technologies sector, are aiming for the global market.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/luck-is-just-the-spark-for-business-giants.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Luck Is Just the Spark for Business Giants<date>Published: October 29, 2011</date><text>BETTER to be lucky than good, the adage goes.And maybe that’s true — if you just want to be merely good, not much better than average. But what if you want to build or do something great? And what if you want to do so in today’s unstable and unpredictable world? Recently, we completed a nine-year research study of some of the most extreme business successes of modern times. We examined entrepreneurs who built small enterprises into companies that outperformed their industries by a factor of 10 in highly turbulent environments. We call them 10Xers, for “10 times success.” The very nature of this study — how some people thrive in uncertainty, lead in chaos, deal with a world full of big, disruptive forces that we cannot predict or control — led us to smack into the question, “Just what is the role of luck?” Could it be that leaders’ skills account for the difference between just meeting their industry’s average performance (1X success) and doubling it (2X)? But that luck accounts for all the difference between 2X and 10X? Maybe, or maybe not. But how on Earth could we go about quantifying something as elusive as “luck”? The breakthrough came in seeing luck as an event, not as some indefinable aura. We defined a “luck event” as one that meets three tests. First, some significant aspect of the event occurs largely or entirely independent of the actions of the enterprise’s main actors. Second, the event has a potentially significant consequence — good or bad. And, third, it has some element of unpredictability. We systematically found 230 significant luck events across the history of our study’s subjects. We considered good luck, bad luck, the timing of luck and the size of “luck spikes.” Adding up the evidence, we found that the 10X cases weren’t generally “luckier” than the comparison cases. (We compared the 10X companies with a control group of companies that failed to become great in the same extreme environments.) The 10X cases and the control group both had luck, good and bad, in comparable amounts, so the evidence leads us to conclude that luck doesn’t cause 10X success. The crucial question is not, “Are you lucky?” but “Do you get a high return on luck?” Return on luck: We call it ROL. SO why did Bill Gates become a 10Xer, building a great software company in the personal computer revolution? Through one lens, you might see Mr. Gates as incredibly lucky. He just happened to have been born into an upper-middle-class American family that had the resources to send him to a private school. His family happened to enroll him at Lakeside School in Seattle, which had a Teletype connection to a computer upon which he could learn to program — something that was unusual for schools in the late 1960s and early ’70s. He also just happened to have been born at the right time, coming of age as the advancement of microelectronics made the PC inevitable. Had he been born 10 years later, or even just five years later, he would have missed the moment. Mr. Gates’s friend Paul Allen just happened to see a cover article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, titled “World’s First Microcomputer Kit to Rival Commercial Models.” It was about the Altair, designed by a small company in Albuquerque. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen had the idea to convert the programming language Basic into a product that could be used on the Altair, which would put them in position to be the first to sell such a product for a personal computer. Mr. Gates went to college at Harvard, which just happened to have a PDP-10 computer upon which he could develop and test his ideas. Wow, Bill Gates was really lucky, right? Yes, he was. But luck is not why Bill Gates became a 10Xer. Consider these questions:  Was Bill Gates the only person of his era who grew up in an upper middle-class American family?  Was he the only person born in the mid-1950s who attended a secondary school with access to computing? 1 2 3 Next Page » Jim Collins is the author of the worldwide best seller âGood to Great.â This article was adapted from âGreat by Choice: Uncertainty, Chaos, and Luck â Why Some Thrive Despite Them All,â which was written with Morten T.

A new model of a certain black, rectangular, touch-screen smartphone has just arrived. Its new software contains what the company says are hundreds of new features. The most eye-popping enhancement is speech recognition: you can tell this new phone to call someone, text someone or give you driving directions.I refer, of course, to Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7.5. Gotcha! Yes, Microsoft is belatedly trying to take on the iPhone and Android phones with its own phone software. It’s available on several phones from Samsung and HTC, at prices from $50 to $200 with two-year contracts; each major American carrier offers at least one. (The Windows Phone 7.5 software, code-named Mango, is also available as a free upgrade for older Windows Phone 7 phones.) Windows Phone 7.5 is gorgeous, classy, satisfying, fast and coherent. The design is intelligent, clean and uncluttered. Never in a million years would you guess that it came from the same company that cooked up the bloated spaghetti that is Windows and Office. Most impressively, Windows Phone is not a feeble-minded copycat. Microsoft came up with completely fresh metaphors that generally steer clear of the iPhone/Android design (grid-spaced icons that scroll across home pages). The home screen presents two columns of colorful tiles. Each represents something you’ve put there for easy access: an app, a speed-dial entry, a Web page, a music playlist or an e-mail folder. More than ever, the text on them conveys instant information, saving you the effort of opening them up. A number on a tile tells you how many voice-mail messages, e-mail messages or app updates are waiting. The music tile shows album art, the calendar tile identifies your next appointment. A tile for your sister might display her latest Twitter and Facebook updates. Windows Phone first appeared, incomplete, a year ago. There was no copy and paste. No way to add new ringtones. No multitasking. No visual voice mail. No tethering option (which lets you use the phone as an Internet antenna for your laptop). No unified e-mail in-box for multiple accounts. No message threading. No Twitter integration. You couldn’t see multiple categories at once on the calendar. In Mango, Microsoft has addressed all of these shortcomings. Most of them bear that new Microsoft finesse and excellence, but there are some footnotes. For example, you get tethering and visual voice mail only if your cellphone company offers it; so far, only T-Mobile offers the latter. Another example: You enter the multitasking switcher by holding down the phone’s Back button. But this “multitasking” is the iPhone variety: when you switch out of an app, it doesn’t keep running in the background, draining the battery. (There are the usual exceptions: for example, music keeps playing, and GPS navigation keeps running.) Instead, the app you’re leaving goes into suspended animation. It’s supposed to spring back instantly when you return. Unfortunately, Windows Phone apps must be rewritten for this multitasking feature; until then, they can take several seconds to wake up again. Meanwhile, there’s still no way to create folders to organize your apps. There’s no way to send videos to other phones as MMS messages. There is still no built-in video chat app. And, as on the iPhone, you can’t watch Flash videos on the Web. But the drawbacks column is still much shorter than the goodies column. The Bing searching app now offers audio and visual searching. That is, you can hold the phone up to any pop song playing wherever you go; in about three seconds, it identifies the song and offers the chance to buy it online. It’s just like Shazam on iPhone or Android, but built in. Visual search is a lot like the Google Goggles app for iPhone or Android: you can aim the phone’s camera at a bar code, a book cover or a DVD cover, and the phone identifies it by product name and company. You can even aim the camera at any printed text, and marvel as the Bing app translates it into typed text, ready for pasting into an e-mail message or Word document. There’s even a Translate button if you want the scanned text flipped roughly into another language. This is amazing, amazing stuff — why aren’t people cheering in the streets? Then there’s the speech feature. When you hold down the Windows-logo button, you get a talking virtual assistant, like Siri on the iPhone 4S. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comDid you hear the news?

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/technology/with-new-smartphones-high-hopes-for-nokia-and-microsoft.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">With New Smartphones, High Hopes for Nokia and Microsoft Union<date>Published: October 26, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, introduced two smartphones on Wednesday, the first fruits of its alliance with Microsoft, in a bid to curb its declining market share.Nokia’s chief executive, Stephen A. Elop, presented the Lumia 800, a 420 euro ($584) touch-screen device, and the Lumia 710, a 270 euro handset at a company product introduction. Both devices are being sold in six European countries and will be sold later this year in parts of Asia. Other smartphones are planned for the United States, but not until early next year. Analysts said the Nokia smartphones, the result of an eight-month collaboration with Microsoft, could also help Microsoft extend its dominant computer software business into the cellphone and mobile device market. The software has received positive reviews, but few handset makers are using it. The new lineup aims to revive Nokia’s tarnished reputation as an innovative force in mobile phones, an industry it pioneered and dominated until Apple and Google, helped by more user-friendly software, wrested control of the smartphone business four years ago. “Nokia really needed this to happen today, and this is a new start for the company,” said Pete Cunningham, an analyst based in London with the research firm Canalys. “This helps stop the bleeding and will help Nokia get back in the game.” Mr. Elop, a former senior Microsoft executive who made the decision to enter the software alliance with his former employer in February, said the new Lumia devices showed that Nokia, which is based in Espoo, Finland, was delivering on his promise of a turnaround. “This signals our intent to be today’s leader in smartphone design and craftsmanship,” Mr. Elop told 3,000 people attending the company’s Nokia World conference in London. During an interview, Mr. Elop said Nokia was planning to push its smartphones into the United States, where it has struggled, early next year. He said Nokia was in advanced talks with the four major American operators, which together sell more than 90 percent of all cellphones in the country. Nokia’s new smartphones for the United States, Mr. Elop said, will run on high-speed 4G networks that use a technology called LTE, or Long Term Evolution, as well as on older 3G networks. They will also be made to run on networks that use the C.D.M.A. standard, which is used by the market leader, Verizon Wireless. Mr. Elop said that Nokia was listening closely to phone operators and would be flexible in meeting their demands. “If you do the math, you may come to the conclusion that clearly we are in good conversations with those operators,” he said Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., is using its business connections — its server software powers a lot of cloud computing centers used by network operators — to help Nokia re-establish relationships with American operators, he said. “When we enter a market, it is not just dipping your toe in the market, but coming in with the appropriate levels of investment by us,” Mr. Elop said. “It takes work. It takes money. We are being very deliberate.” With Lumia, Nokia aims to beat Apple and Google by designing handsets that are easier to use than the two best-selling smartphones, the Apple iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S II, which runs Google’s Android software. The Lumia 800’s start screen is a wheel of interactive tiles. By clicking a tile, users are taken directly to a preferred task, like text messaging a friend, tracking a sports team or listening to a favorite song, without having to enter and close applications. The software interface, developed by Microsoft but refined by Nokia, is designed to remove as much laborious touch-screen tapping as possible. Marko Ahtisaari, Nokia’s head designer, said the smartphones used fluid, rather than linear, design logic, which eliminated many of the intermediary steps required with the array of static app icons that Apple and Google’s Android favor. Shares of Nokia closed at 4.80 euros, down 0.6 percent, in European trading. One investor said that Nokia and Microsoft must still overcome skepticism about the venture. “I have seen no evidence that Nokia and Microsoft are making a game of it — yet,” said Jeffrey P. Davis, the chief investment officer at Lee Munder Capital, an investment fund manager based in Boston with $5.4 billion under management. “Android is winning the mind space on the consumer front. The business world will probably follow.” Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Nokia was paying $15 to Microsoft for each Windows smartphone it produced, less than the estimated $20 other handset makers must pay. The new Windows phone lineup, he said, has the potential to help restore Nokia’s fortunes in the smartphone market. “One thing I have learned in this business is to never say never,” Mr. Mawston said.LONDON — Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, introduced two smartphones on Wednesday, the first fruits of its alliance with Microsoft, in a bid to curb its declining market share.</text></article>

Microsoft and Google are both weighing whether to participate in the bidding. Each has its own business reasons for wanting to see the continued existence of Yahoo, which despite its financial struggles still has a monthly audience of almost 700 million unique visitors. But there's one thing the technology giants have in common: Not one of them wants to actually buy or run Yahoo. Instead, Microsoft and Google are considering lending financial support to private equity firms or others weighing a bid, according to people briefed on the matter. Microsoft is the furthest along, having held discussions with a number of leveraged buyout firms, these people said. Under one possible combination, Microsoft would chip in billions of dollars in financing as part of a consortium led by the private equity firm Silver Lake and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, three of these people said. That group would be backstopped by billions of dollars in bank financing as well. Google, for its part, has had conversations with two private equity firms about backing a takeover, according to another person briefed on the matter. Such discussions are in the early stages and may not lead to a bid, this person said. Representatives for Microsoft, Google, Silver Lake and Yahoo declined to comment on any potential bidding. While nearly every major private equity firm has been conducting some preliminary due diligence on Yahoo, potential suitors have been trying to sort out what bids would look like before they sign nondisclosure agreements with Yahoo to officially pore over its books, according to people briefed on the matter. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about confidential deal negotiations. But what has become apparent is that the private equity firms would be focused on turning around the company, while a deep-pocketed backer like Microsoft or Google would supply capital. A crucial Yahoo adviser, Allen &amp; Company, has told potential bidders that they should focus on how to improve the company's core North American operations and not worry about the divestiture of the company's huge holdings in the Alibaba Group of China and Yahoo Japan. Players like Microsoft and Google are primarily interested in what they could reap from teaming up with Yahoo. Yahoo's news arm reported 81.2 million unique visitors in August, making it the biggest online news site. Microsoft already has in place a wide-ranging agreement with Yahoo: Its Bing search engine fetches answers to user queries, while Yahoo's sales force sells ads against those results. Microsoft may also push to integrate its newest acquisition, the Internet communications company Skype, into Yahoo. With a deal, Google could eventually wrest Yahoo away from Microsoft when their partnership expires. By doing so, the company could provide its own search technology and use its DoubleClick display advertising subsidiary to service Yahoo's advertising inventory, this person said. Google could also use Yahoo to promote its other offerings, like the Google Plus social network. However, it is unclear whether a Google-Yahoo partnership would pass antitrust scrutiny. The two companies previously discussed forming an advertising alliance in 2008, only to see the talks founder amid likely opposition by the Justice Department. Still, even if Google considered the regulatory challenges insurmountable, it could participate in the bidding process to help drive up the price, to frustrate its rival. News of Google's discussions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online. Such discussions are expected to play out over a matter of weeks or even months. Yahoo's board is still weighing whether to sell the company outright, accept a minority investment, or do nothing. Yahoo's board has named the chief financial officer, Timothy Morse, as interim chief executive while it searches for a permanent leader after having ousted Carol A. Bartz last month. Meanwhile, potential buyers are speaking to former Yahoo executives about taking an operational role should they succeed in taking over the company. One possible point of contention is price. Private equity firms have indicated they are unwilling to pay much more than Yahoo's current market value of $20 billion, arguing that the stock price already includes the expectation of a sale, according to people briefed on the matter. Many of the potential suitors for Yahoo have contacted Alibaba's chairman and chief executive, Jack Ma, looking to gauge his interest in working with them, these people said. The agreement that governs Yahoo's 40 percent stake in his company gives Mr. Ma what some analysts have said is a kingmaker role. Alibaba is also in discussions with Yahoo about buying back its stake on its own, separately from any takeover of Yahoo as a whole. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Jack Ma, the chief executive of Alibaba, of which Yahoo owns a 40 percent stake.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/24iht-nokia24.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Crucial Test for Nokia as Latest Smartphones Arrive<date>Published: October 23, 2011</date><text>BERLIN — When Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, introduces the company’s first phones bearing Microsoft Windows Phone software Wednesday, he will probably be met with equal parts good will and skepticism. On the one hand, many mobile operators are pulling for Nokia and Microsoft to succeed, creating a credible third smartphone lineup that they can use to leverage better terms from Google and Apple, which in four years have taken over the high-end mobile business. On the other, the partnership with Microsoft was struck while Nokia, the erstwhile market leader, was under duress, undertaking an 18 percent cut to its work force. The company absorbed combined losses of €436 million, or $597 million, in the second and third quarters. Worst of all, since the deal was made in February, Nokia has had to tread water as engineers combined the companies’ smartphone technologies, allowing Google, Apple and Samsung to secure their positions in the pecking order. As a result, Nokia’s share of the global smartphone market has fallen by nearly half, to 15.5 percent in September from 27.5 percent in December, according to International Data Corp., an information technology research firm. “The road back for Nokia is going to be a long one,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst in London for International Data. “There is a risk that they are too late to the party.” At a conference in London on Wednesday, Nokia intends to present at least two new phones, one aimed at high-end users and one for the midrange mass market, people with knowledge of the presentation said. Time is not an ally for Nokia in the fast-moving smartphone segment of the mobile market, which now accounts for more than half of all cellphone sales in North America and Western Europe. For Nokia, the decision to abandon its own Symbian operating system in favor of Windows Phone came at a price. Operators quickly reduced their stocks of all Symbian devices, both smartphones and basic phones, hurting Nokia’s bread-and-butter business. Nokia’s share of the overall global cellphone market fell to 24.5 percent in September from 30.7 percent in December, according to International Data. On Thursday, when the company reported a €68 million loss for the third quarter, which was smaller than some investors had expected, Mr. Elop spoke of the “many important steps ahead in our journey of transformation.” “With each step,” he continued, “you will see us methodically implement our strategy, pursuing steady improvement through a period that has known transition risks, while also dealing with the various unexpected ups and downs that typify the dynamic nature of the industry.” For Mr. Elop, a former Microsoft executive who made the decision to enter the alliance, and for Nokia, the success or failure of the collaboration will be a defining event. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst in London with the technology research firm Gartner, said Mr. Elop so far appeared to be delivering on his promise to turn Nokia around. The company’s upgrades this year of Symbian, Symbian Belle and Symbian Anna were tangible improvements that showed Nokia could innovate on the fly. Nokia released the N9, considered its best smartphone to date and a product of the now-defunct alliance with Intel, to positive reviews. Sales of two new dual-SIM devices, the C2-03 and C2-06, helped Nokia lift sales of basic phones 8 percent in the third quarter. Gartner is predicting that Nokia and Microsoft will succeed, gaining 20 percent share in the smartphone market by 2015. While that would still be below Nokia’s peak, it is a lot better than where it is now. “I am not sure if success is a given,” Ms. Milanesi said. “Their major issue will remain brand and making both Nokia and Microsoft sexy enough for consumers.” Nokia must succeed at the top and middle ends of the smartphone business to reclaim a leadership position, said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics in Milton Keynes, England. Profit margins for top-end devices, like Apple’s iPhone, are about 36 percent, Mr. Mawston said. For midrange devices, the gains are much smaller, from 1 percent to 15 percent. “The top end is where the biggest revenue and profit pools lie,” Mr. Mawston said. “The volume is at the low- and midtier.” Mobile network operators are hoping that Nokia-Microsoft smartphones will sell well, because that will help them command lower prices from Apple and the makers of Google’s Android phones for their models, Mr. Mawston said. “Apple’s iPhone is widely perceived among operators as being overpriced, but Apple is so popular that operators can’t reduce the price they pay for it by even a small amount,” he said. Nokia is expected to introduce the first new Microsoft devices in places where it already has a relatively strong market share, like Western Europe. It hopes to build momentum and positive reviews and take the devices to the United States, the world’s largest smartphone market. There, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is helping Nokia of Finland open doors to the four largest U.S. operators, which control more than 90 percent of all cellphone sales. Nokia’s North American market share in smartphones in the third quarter was only 1.2 percent, according to International Data. Microsoft’s share of the global smartphone software market was not much bigger: 2 percent, globally. While Internet access is rapidly shifting from traditional desktop and laptop PCs to mobile devices, Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, can still fall back for the time being on its dominant Windows licensing business. That is why Nokia, which makes most of its money selling cellphones, has much more at stake in the collaboration than Microsoft, analysts said. But the venture is also crucial to Microsoft, which despite several attempts on its own has largely failed to gain a foothold in the software business for mobile devices. “I think given Microsoft’s dominant position in fixed and portable keyboard computing, Nokia is not their final chance, but it is probably one of their final chances to enter this market,” Mr. Mawston said. “They probably won’t get too many goes after Nokia.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 25, 2011 An article on Monday about Nokiaâs pending introduction of smartphones bearing Windows Phone software misidentified the smartphone that resulted from Nokiaâs now-defunct alliance with Intel. It was the N9, not the N8.BERLIN — When Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, introduces the company’s first phones bearing Microsoft Windows Phone software Wednesday, he will probably be met with equal parts good will and skepticism. On the one hand, many mobile operators are pulling for Nokia and Microsoft to succeed, creating a credible third smartphone lineup that they can use to leverage better terms from Google and Apple, which in four years have taken over the high-end mobile business.

It was Bangalore’s day out. In India’s silicon capital, college students, retired government employees, housewives and tech-industry workers thronged the stations to ride the just-launched metro train service on Thursday. It was a raucous opening, with musicians beating on drums, security guards whistling and, in keeping with tradition on Indian roads, the drivers of the new trains honking incessantly. “This is a dream come true,” said Pranjal Dixit, 21, an engineering student who had traveled from the other end of the city with five classmates to ride the sleek green-and-purple colored coach of the train on the train’s elevated first stretch. A local transport company helper, S. Murugesh, brought his son Abhishek Kannan, 2, to ‘witness history’, he said. “How fast can it go?” wondered a retired government official, Sudheer Rao, as passengers’ cries of “Metro ki jai!” (“Victory to the Metro!”) rent the air. At each stop, pink shirt-clad station controllers stood by to keep rule-breaking passengers from running across the tracks. Customer relations managers patiently answered questions on how to buy a ticket (costing 10 to15 rupees or 20 to 30 cents) and where to board. Bangalore is India’s fastest-growing city, and the main India outpost for dozens of international companies including Microsoft, Goldman Sachs and Thomson Reuters. They, and India’s homegrown IT giants, employ tens of thousands of software engineers, research scientists and customer service workers in the city and its suburbs. So far, the service runs along a mere 4-mile stretch from downtown MG Road to Byappanahalli in the east and has only six stops. But that did not quell the excitement of Bangalore’s harried commuters, who look at the much-delayed project as their savior. Bangalore is in some ways India’s most modern city with a young population, bars and restaurants and an international feel. But the population has increased 46 percent in the past decade to nine million people, and potholed roads and traffic jams have taken the shine off the city’s brand in recent years. Befitting Bangalore, the Namma Metro (Our Metro) coaches are Wi-Fi enabled. A soon-to-launch mobile payment application will give them entry with the wave of a cellphone. “This is the beginning of the end of 15 years of traffic hell,” said marketing manager Lokeshwara N.S. Two tech industry managers, Indu Arun and Bhanu Balachandran, said the train slashes their commute time from one hour each way to a 10-minute ride. “This is a big leap towards reinforcing Bangalore’s status as India’s best city to live in,” said Ms. Arun. When completed in 2014, the $3 billion project will cover three-quarters of Bangalore. Citizens are already taking to the service. Atmaram Gangaram, a retailer, abandoned his swank BMW at home on the very day Metro launched. He wants to use the new service to travel between his bookstore on MG Road and his home in Indiranagar, four stops apart.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/technology/microsoft-fiscal-1q-earnings-match-analyst-views.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Microsoft Income Gains 6%, but Weak PC Sales Continue<date>Published: October 20, 2011</date><text>SEATTLE — Microsoft said its net income rose 6 percent in its first fiscal quarter, but the company’s results continued to reflect weak growth in PC sales.The PC market, especially the part representing the companies using Microsoft’s Windows operating system, has suffered lately as economic uncertainty has crimped spending on information technology. Newer types of devices like tablets and mobile phones have sapped some of the business as well. Microsoft said net income rose to $5.74 billion, or 68 cents a share, from $5.41 billion, or 62 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 7 percent, to $17.37 billion, from $16.2 billion a year ago. Analysts estimated that, on average, Microsoft would earn 68 cents a share on revenue of $17.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Microsoft’s shares fell 1 percent after it released the financial results at the close of normal trading. Microsoft said its revenue from selling Windows rose less than 2 percent during its first quarter, which ended Sept. 30. That reflects the fact that shipments of new PCs grew only 3.6 percent globally in the quarter, which ended Sept. 30, according to the research firm IDC. Apple defied the trend, reporting a 26 percent increase in the number of Macs sold during the same period, the company said on Tuesday. Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said the company’s revenue from Windows sales was weaker than he had expected. “We’ve now had a year where Windows hasn’t come in in-line with analyst expectations,” he said. “It’s less of a miss than in the past.” The Microsoft division that includes its Office suit of applications fared better than Windows, with a revenue increase of almost 8 percent. That division — Microsoft’s largest, representing a third of total revenue — got a boost from a new version of Office released last year that continues to sell well for the company, despite competition from free and low-cost online applications from Google and others. One problem for Microsoft is that some of the stronger sources of growth in the PC business are now in developing markets like China. While that is good news for other players in the PC business, like Intel, that make hardware components, Microsoft has a harder time in those regions because of rampant software piracy and lower average selling prices for its products. Microsoft’s Windows business is also facing a growing challenger in the iPad. Tech industry executives are divided over the degree to which Apple’s tablet computer is eroding sales of traditional PCs. This week, Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said he thought that the iPad was cannibalizing some sales of Macs, but that a “materially larger” number of iPad buyers were choosing the tablet device over a Windows PC. Apple sold 11.1 million iPads in its last quarter. “With cannibalization like this, I hope it continues,” Mr. Cook said. Microsoft intends to tackle the threat from the iPad with a new version of Windows, known currently as Windows 8, that has been redesigned for the touch screens of tablet devices, but that product is not expected to appear for about a year. Peter Klein, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company had greater demand from businesses for Windows than it had from the consumer market, where the iPad has had a big impact on the low-end laptop computers known as netbooks.SEATTLE — Microsoft said its net income rose 6 percent in its first fiscal quarter, but the company’s results continued to reflect weak growth in PC sales.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/travel/fine-tuning-your-flight-search.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Fine-Tuning Your Flight Search<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>LAST month, Google introduced the first version of its new flight search feature (Google.com/flights) and the response has mostly focused on what it does not offer. Right now, it can search only for round-trip tickets for select domestic destinations. And while it is much faster than other travel search engines, it does not display fares from all the airlines that serve a particular route.Sean Carlson, a Google spokesman, said the current flight search is only an “early look” at what is in the pipeline and that more options will be added as engineers integrate technology from ITA Software, which Google bought earlier this year. Though Google’s debut may have been premature, its foray into flight search has shaken up the competitive landscape, which is good news for travelers. One notable change is that travel search engines are finally moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach to booking a flight, and are building tools that answer specific questions about different types of trips. Here are some of the most pertinent queries that search engines are currently taking on. WHAT IS THE TICKET PRICE, INCLUDING BAG FEES? Most search engines give you only the price of a ticket. But escalating fees for baggage, preferred seats and other extras have made some passengers wish they could see the total cost of a flight. Kayak.com has a fix — at least for the cost of checked luggage. On the left side of the fare results page, a link allows users to “Add baggage” to the fares Kayak has found. “You can enter the number of bags you’re going to check, and we will instantly reprice all of those flights for you,” said Robert Birge, Kayak’s chief marketing officer. Although Kayak does not display fares from Southwest — which allows two free checked bags but does not share its fare data with other Web sites — this feature makes Kayak a good choice if you are going to check a bag when you fly. IS THE TRAIN LESS EXPENSIVE? Hipmunk.com, a travel search engine that made its debut last year, automatically includes Amtrak prices and departure times when you search for flights on a route that is also served by the train. Adam Goldstein, one of Hipmunk’s founders, said that is an especially popular feature for trips between Boston, New York and Washington, but that it also appeals to people traveling on other short routes, like Chicago to Milwaukee or Seattle to Portland. Hipmunk even highlights which trains have Wi-Fi, and its bar graph interface makes it easy to compare travel times and prices: the time bar stretches from the departure time to the arrival time for each flight and train. Hipmunk is known for taking a more visual approach to presenting information (rather than showing a long list of flights), but other travel sites, including Google, are experimenting with maps and graphs as well. WHEN IS THE CHEAPEST TIME TO TRAVEL? Most travel Web sites now allow users to search for fares on dates close to the ones you initially input, so you can potentially save money by shifting your itinerary by a day or two. But for some trips — like a weekend visit with a friend — you may want to be even more flexible, looking for the cheapest time to travel in the next month or more. My favorite site for this type of search is ITA Software’s Matrix search tool, which lets you select an option called “See calendar of lowest fares.” Once you enter the earliest date you can travel and the number of nights you want to stay, a calendar shows the lowest price for each departure date in the next month. One drawback of using ITA Software is that it does not sell tickets; you have to recreate your itinerary and buy it through the airline or another site. But Google offers a similar feature if you click the not-so-obvious calendar icon after you enter your itinerary (it’s a gray square below the route map). Say you entered a three-night itinerary — a bar graph appears showing the price of a three-night trip for each departure date in the next six months. As you scroll down through each date, your trip is also highlighted on a calendar, so you can easily scan the cheapest Friday departures. Although Kayak and other sites also offer versions of the flexible search option, Google’s calendar stretches out farther, its results are quicker, and its interface is better. Once Google’s flight selection is more comprehensive, its flexible search will be tough to beat. WHERE CAN I GO WITHIN MY BUDGET? One area travel sites have been slow to address is what Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group, calls the dream phase of vacation planning. “Not everybody knows where they want to go when they start thinking about a trip,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “I think this is where the future of flight search is going to be.” He pointed to Kayak’s explore feature (kayak.com/explore) as a model; it lets you enter your departure city, travel season, budget and maximum flight time and then displays a map showing where you can go within those parameters. Although the airfares displayed above each city are subject to change after you choose a travel date, this feature is a good way to discover destinations you might not have considered, like comparing various islands in the Caribbean. Google also has a version of this feature; a route map is displayed when you search for flights, showing prices for major cities and adding other destinations as you zoom in. But Google’s current flight data limitations make that feature less useful for now. WHEN’S THE BEST TIME TO BOOK? Microsoft’s Bing flight tool (travel.bing.com) does the best job of helping travelers decide when to book by presenting a “buy now” or “wait” recommendation above the results when you search for a flight. Although those predictions can be hit or miss, Bing’s “fare history” link shows the average low and the recent price history for the route you entered, so you can gauge whether you are getting a reasonable fare. That is especially useful if you are flying somewhere new and have no idea what a ticket should cost. Kayak offers a similar option (“Show fare charts”) in the left margin of its search results, but its link is easy to overlook — a design challenge as sites add new tools. “There’s a really tough balance here in terms of how much information to present,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “But you have to make it easy for customers to discover what they want.”LAST month, Google introduced the first version of its new flight search feature (Google.com/flights) and the response has mostly focused on what it does not offer. Right now, it can search only for round-trip tickets for select domestic destinations.

Expanding Efforts to Connect More Americans to Broadband<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>As part of a broad effort to encourage more Americans to use high-speed Internet and be able to compete in the global economy, the Federal Communications Commission has brought together a group of private companies that will offer free computer training to people in disadvantaged communities.Starting next year, the familiar blue-shirted Geek Squad from Best Buy, one of the nation’s largest electronics retailers, will work through service organizations like Boys and Girls Clubs, Goodwill and 4-H in 20 cities to offer training in basic computer literacy. Microsoft will also offer such training, as well as job-search training, in schools and libraries in 15 states and in their stores nationwide. “It’s one important stop of the train,” Julius Genachowski, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview Tuesday, referring to the many things that need to be done to connect more Americans to the Internet. He plans to announce Wednesday that these companies and others have made a commitment through a new group called Connect to Compete to help more people learn to use computers. Only 68 percent of Americans with access to high-speed broadband Internet are using it, while in places like South Korea the rate is 90 percent. More than 80 percent of Fortune 500 companies — including Wal-Mart and Target — require job applicants to apply online. Various studies have shown that the major reasons people do not have broadband are: the cost of Internet services and the cost of computers; not knowing how to use a computer; and not understanding why the Internet is relevant. As part of its attempt to break down these barriers, Mr. Genachowski said the F.C.C. wanted to start a pilot project that would lead to expanding the number of libraries that teach people how to use computers and apply for jobs online. Last week, Mr. Genachowski outlined a plan to transform the $8 billion Universal Service Fund, most of which comes from consumers’ telephone bills nationwide, from subsidizing telephone service in underserved areas to expanding broadband access in those areas. He said Tuesday that some of the money from this fund could be used to help expand computer classes in libraries. Moving the nation to full computer literacy, he said, will require multiple approaches. "There’s no single action that will solve all these problems," he said, "but there are a series of initiatives that will move the needle."As part of a broad effort to encourage more Americans to use high-speed Internet and be able to compete in the global economy, the Federal Communications Commission has brought together a group of private companies that will offer free computer training to people in disadvantaged communities.</text></article>

Now, Bing and the show have figured out another way to link arms. A new television commercial opens with a male and female zombie gnawing on a torn-off leg — the verisimilar gore by the same team that won an Emmy for prosthetic makeup effects on “The Walking Dead” — and then a director shouting, “Cut.” As they sit down for a break, the actress, smiling flirtatiously, says to the other zombie, “You were really great in that scene. Very authentic!” The male, though, does not break character or speak. The woman pulls up Bing on her smartphone and searches the phrase “dating an actor.” The man also pulls up Bing, but types in “EATING an actor.”  The spot then shows video from the show’s first season, while a voiceover highlights Bing sweepstakes for a “stagger-on role,” with the winner to be made up like a zombie to appear in a future episode. When the commercial returns to the actors, who are resuming the scene, the male sinks his teeth into the arm of the actress, who looks genuinely shocked and horrified. The ad, by Bark Bark, an Atlanta agency that specializes in brand integration, first appeared on AMC on Monday, and will run primarily during “The Walking Dead” episodes. Bing accounted for 14.7 percent of Internet searches in the United States in August, compared to Google’s 64.8 percent, according to comScore. Total advertising spending by Bing was $152.7 million in 2010, according to Kantar Media, which is part of WPP. With its first-season finale last December drawing six million viewers, including four million in the coveted 18- to 49-year-old group, “The Walking Dead” is, appropriately enough, making a killing with advertisers. But brands that want to actually promote to consumers within the show face a paradox: consumer culture has ceased to exist in the fictional world of the show, whose characters’ preoccupation is survival. “You don’t want to interfere with the main storytelling for a show and you don’t need to force-fit something into a world that may not be appropriate for it,” said Chet Fenster, managing partner of MEC Entertainment, a product placement and branded content division of MEC, a WPP agency. Mr. Fenster lauded the Bing spot as an example of “borrowing the equity of a show even though they’re not using its characters or setting.” It is reminiscent, he said, of a 2010 co-branded commercial with the Honda Odyssey minivan and ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars,” in which a woman driving in the car hears a promo for the show on the radio, then imagines herself dancing a tango on the show’s stage. The commercial establishes the sort of intimate connection between the car and the show that comes from paid placement, even though “you can’t drive a minivan onto the ‘Dancing with the Stars’ stage and make it relevant,” Mr. Fenster said. Not all product-placement proposals for the zombie show are dead in the water. Because it is set in the present with the apocalyptic events having unfolded recently, the cars are of a recent vintage, which turns out to be convenient for Hyundai, which will be featuring a Tucson model in episodes of the coming season. Hyundai will give the actual car featured in the show away through a sweepstakes contest. Pizza Hut, which advertises on the AMC show, also had internal discussions about integrating the brand in its plot. “Maybe we could have had a scene where they ducked into a Pizza Hut restaurant to plan an attack or an escape,” said Chris Fuller, director of public relations for Pizza Hut, which is owned by Yum Brands. “But we didn’t feel like an on-screen integration was right for us.”  While featuring Pizza Hut in a show with depictions of zombies consuming human flesh might not whet appetites, the chain is associating with the characters on the show through what it’s calling “The Walking Dead Trailer Mash-Up Contest.” In the contest, which is hosted on Facebook, consumers choose from a collection of clips from the show, as well as graphic elements and music, to make their own trailer. In the contest, which is accepting submissions through Halloween, popular voting will determine 10 finalists, with Pizza Hut deciding the winning entry, which will be shown during a commercial break for the show on Nov. 27. The contest was inspired by viral videos on YouTube where users selectively use film and music from movies to make genre-bending trailers, like an authentic-seeming trailer for “The Shining” as a heartwarming family drama and another for “Mary Poppins” as a horror movie, Mr. Fuller said. The Pizza Hut contest is featured prominently on the Web site for the show, and the brand also is mentioned both at the beginning of the trailers themselves and in a click-to-share message on Facebook. “We want to be where the eyeballs are,” Mr. Fuller said. “Which sounds like a grotesque way to talk about a zombie show.”BING, the two-year-old Microsoft search engine, has paid for product placements in movies including “Source Code” and television shows including “The Vampire Diaries” and “Hawaii Five-0.”</text></article>

Although my default e-mail client is Thunderbird, whenever I click on such a link, Outlook automatically opens and I never use Outlook for any purpose. A. To change the mail program that opens with a new message when you click a “mailto” or “Contact Us” link on a Web page, you just need to tell the Web browser which mail program to use. If you browse the Web with Internet Explorer, open the program, go to the Tools menu and choose Internet Options. In the Internet Options box, click the Programs tab. Next to “E-Mail,” use the drop-down menu to change the setting from Microsoft Office Outlook to Mozilla Thunderbird. You can change other default programs the browser uses here as well, like your preferred programs for your contacts and calendars. Click the O.K. button when finished. If you use Mozilla Firefox instead and never use Internet Explorer, go to the Tools menu and select Options. In the Options box, click on the Applications tab. Under the Content Type list on the left side of the box, scroll down to “mailto” and use the drop-down menu next to it and choose Mozilla Thunderbird. Click O.K. when finished.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/technology/europe-approves-microsoft-purchase-of-skype.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Europe Approves Microsoft Purchase of Skype<date>Published: October 7, 2011</date><text>BERLIN — The European Commission on Friday approved Microsoft’s $8.5 billion purchase of Skype, saying it had no objections to a deal that would link the world’s largest software maker with the leading Internet communications service. While the assent from the European competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, is not the final antitrust hurdle for the transaction — regulators in Russia, Ukraine, Serbia and Taiwan are still deliberating — the positive review from Brussels was considered the last significant threat to what would be Microsoft’s largest takeover to date. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission approved the transaction in June. In voicing no objections to the deal, Mr. Almunia, a Spanish economist, chose not to act on a complaint from an Italian competitor to Skype, Messagenet of Milan, which had asked that the deal be blocked unless Microsoft opened Skype’s 124-million user network to competitors. Mr. Almunia in February approved Microsoft’s purchase of the search advertising business of Yahoo. This time, the competition commissioner said he was approving the purchase of Skype “because the deal would not significantly impede effective competition,” according to a statement by his office. In the consumer communications business, the commission said Microsoft and Skype overlapped only in video communications, which Microsoft offers separately through its Windows Live Messenger program. “However, the commission considers that there are no competition concerns in this growing market where numerous players, including Google, are present,” the commission said in its statement. In the sale of Internet communications to businesses, Skype had only “a limited presence,” the commission concluded, which did not overlap with Microsoft’s Lync Internet communications software, used by large companies. Microsoft, in a statement, called the European approval “an important milestone. We look forward to completing the final steps needed to close the acquisition.” The approval from Brussels will expedite the fusion of Microsoft, maker of the ubiquitous Windows computer operating system and Office business application suite, with Skype, an Internet seller of free and low-cost audio and video telephony founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom, a Swede, and Janus Friis of Denmark. During the past eight years, Skype has become the largest provider of Internet-based communications. But profitability has remained elusive. A previous owner, eBay, which bought Skype for an estimated $2.6 billion in October 2005, was not able to integrate Skype profitably into its online auction business. In October 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion impairment charge reflecting what it estimated that it had overpaid for Skype. Last November, eBay sold a 70 percent stake in Skype to an investor group led by Silver Lake Partners for an estimated $2 billion. Microsoft, which announced its agreement to buy Skype on May 10, is paying nearly three times Skype’s market value, as measured by the sale of eBay’s stake almost a year ago to private investors. Leif-Olof Wallin, an analyst in Stockholm for Gartner, said Microsoft would use Skype to bolster its push into Internet-based telephony around its Lync software for businesses. With Skype’s huge user base, Microsoft will be able to greatly expand the availability of low-cost Internet telephony, Mr. Wallin said. He added that Microsoft’s distribution of Skype through its Windows operating system would improve the image of Internet calling, especially among businesses, which are increasingly encouraging workers to use their own computers and software for company business. That will make Microsoft more of a direct competitive threat to Cisco Systems and Avaya, the two biggest companies that sell Internet-based telephone service software for businesses. But it will also accelerate downward pressure on long-distance and international calling prices, Mr. Wallin said. “Once it is preloaded on a device, whether it is a computer or a phone, it becomes more convenient to use,” Mr. Wallin said. “That will make consumers more likely to discover and try it.” Whether Microsoft can generate a profit from Skype, or create profitable synergies with its other software services and products remains unclear, said David W. Cearley, an analyst for Gartner in Stamford, Connecticut. “I do not believe that direct revenue was the main reason for the purchase,” Mr. Cearley said. “The main thing that Microsoft is buying with Skype is brand presence on the Web and a customer base.”BERLIN — The European Commission on Friday approved Microsoft’s $8.5 billion purchase of Skype, saying it had no objections to a deal that would link the world’s largest software maker with the leading Internet communications service.

I have a long document and I’d like to create an index for it. How hard is this to do in Microsoft Word for Windows? A. Microsoft Word includes tools that make index creation fairly straightforward, although it may take some time. The process requires  going through the document and manually marking the words or phrases you want to include in the index–which can be time-consuming, depending on the length of the file and the number of terms. In a nutshell, you do this by selecting each term within the document and clicking the Mark Entry button in the Index area of the Ribbon’s References tab. Once you have gone through the file and marked all the index entries you want to include, you need to pick a format for your index and insert it into the document. Microsoft has step-by-step instructions for making and editing an index in Word 2007 and 2010 on its site, as well as instructions for Word 2003. Want to see index creation in action? The creators of the book “Microsoft Word 2007 for Dummies” have a four-minute video tutorial online that offers a good overview.</text></article>

Three of the biggest movers among technology stocks on Wednesday were Yahoo, Akamai Technologies and Research in Motion. What do they have in common? All were the subject of deal speculation. Again. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Buyers Weigh Yahoo Bids (Oct. 3, 2011) RIM Shares Jump (Sept. 27, 2011) Yahoo jumped more than 9 percent on Wednesday after Reuters reported that Microsoft was considering a potential bid for the ailing company, likely in concert with others. Akamai, a Web content technology company, was the subject of a Bloomberg News analysis musing that it would make a good takeover target for the likes of I.B.M. Akamai shares rose up close to 9 percent. And RIM? An article in The Independent reported on “vague rumors” that the company, which makes the BlackBerry smartphone. could be acquired by Vodafone. (There were also whispers that RIM was considering hiring an investment bank to advise on potential strategic options.) That was good enough to lift its shares more than 12 percent. It is a sign of how weak the share prices of the companies have been that investors could grasp at such thin reeds. Microsoft’s interest in Yahoo is well-known this time around, for instance. People briefed on the company’s deliberations previously told DealBook that Microsoft might not lead a deal, but instead lend its considerable financial firepower to a consortium of buyers. As for Akamai, Bloomberg’s piece quotes analysts saying that a deal for the company was a “no-brainer.” The article also quotes an Akamai co-founder, Tom Leighton, as saying that while the company might be attractive to bigger technology players, “we don’t see any need to be bought.” And The Independent’s article notes prominently that Vodafone’s strategy “was unlikely to involve a move into mobile handset manufacturing.”</text></article>

The actual announcement doesn’t amount to nearly that much, but it is worth noting for what it says about our TV habits. Starting this holiday season (launch date not specified), owners of an Xbox 360 can start viewing major television programming through the device, Microsoft said. The programming includes channels from TV providers like Comcast’s Xfinity TV and Verizon FiOS. This announcement would, in fact, come nearer to ushering in a “new era” of TV if it meant that people could, through an Xbox, get programming of their choice on an á la carte basis. This is what many consumers crave: a departure from having to purchase big programming packages when they watch only a fraction of the shows. But the new service announced by Microsoft allows people to watch programming they are paying for separately through Comcast or Verizon or another TV service provider. In other words: same programming and cost, but different interface; you watch through the Xbox and not through a conventional cable box. So what’s the big deal? Microsoft says a key selling point of the new service is that people will not have to deal with multiple set-top boxes or remote controls. “Gone are the days of managing a handful of remote controls, trying to remember what movies are available from what service, and hunting back and forth across television inputs,” the company said in a press release. And for added convenience, it notes, people may be able to give up the remote control altogether and use voice commands. “Having trouble finding last night’s episode of ‘The Office’? It’s now only a voice command away. Just say ‘Xbox, Bing, “The Office,”’ and Xbox finds it.” O.K., that might be the dawning of a reasonable alternative in our household to searching under couches and through buckets of toys for the remote control. Still shy of a New Era. (Xbox, Bing, Dictionary, Less Cartoonish Alternative to ‘New Era.’)</text></article>

Samsung, the largest maker of Android products, will pay Microsoft an undisclosed fee for every smartphone and tablet it makes that uses Google’s free operating system. Previously, Taiwan’s HTC, the second-largest maker of phones using Android, struck a patent-licensing deal with Microsoft. Free, it seems, has its costs. Google sees Microsoft as the ringleader in a shady cabal of competitors – “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents,” David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post. Not surprisingly, Microsoft views things differently. In an interview last Friday, Brad Smith, the company’s general counsel, said what is happening with patents in the smartphone market is merely a rerun of similar episodes in the past. When Microsoft moved beyond personal computers into corporate, data-center computing, it licensed technology from its predecessors in the business market. In the last decade, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft has paid $4.5 billion in licensing fees to companies including I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle), Cisco and Silicon Graphics. “That’s the way the industry works and has always worked,” Mr. Smith said. The rise of the smartphone has added a new layer of patent licenses for the cellphone business. The first layer – or “stack” of technology – was the basic radio technology for cellular communication. The largest patent beneficiary in the radio layer is the leader in that technology, Qualcomm. The company collects about $20 on every smartphone produced, Mr. Smith estimates. The second layer was media technology, allowing music and video to play on modern smartphones. Those patent-licensing fees are about $3 to $5 a phone, and go to a variety of companies, Mr. Smith said. The next layer, he said, is the software layer – the computing operating systems that animate smartphones. The companies that have been working on that technology for years, like Apple and Microsoft, went first and developed software ideas that Android builds upon, according to Microsoft and Apple. And Android uses Java software technology, developed by its Sun unit, Oracle contends. The inventors, Mr. Smith said, deserve to be compensated through reasonable patent royalties. Their claims have stirred controversy, he concedes, but he points out that was true as well of Qualcomm’s initial efforts to charge licensing fees for its radio technology. “We’re seeing a licensing regime emerging for the software stack,” Mr. Smith said. Google says the Microsoft campaign is not just bad for Android, but bad for the industry and consumers as well by substituting litigation and patent deal-making for innovation. Mr. Smith disagreed. “Patent-licensing regimes allow companies to build on the shoulders of others,” he said. “It allows companies to use technology and ideas, after paying reasonable fees. They can spend their resources on new ideas instead of trying to figure out ways to invent around the work done by others. In that way, patent-licensing is very much pro-innovation.”</text></article>

In the past, the European Commission has been sympathetic to complaints about Microsoft’s strategy of “bundling” popular applications with Windows, eventually requiring the software maker to make concessions on its media player and Internet browser. But legal experts were split over whether the latest complaint, filed Sept. 20 by Messagenet, a company based in Milan that is a rival to Skype Internet’s phone service, would complicate or prevent European approval of the takeover, which would be the largest in Microsoft’s history and the largest takeover in the technology sector this year. “These types of complaints from competitors are to be expected,” said Denis Waelbroeck, an antitrust lawyer at Ashurts in Brussels. “I would expect that the commission will look at this seriously, but I think that in the end, the officials will reach their own independent decision. This doesn’t mean the complaint will be upheld.” Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, plans to make his decision on the acquisition public on Oct. 7. A spokeswoman for Mr. Almunia, Amelia Torres, on Wednesday declined to comment on Messagenet’s complaint. In general, she said the commission considered all submissions from competitors in antitrust cases. Mr. Almunia, a Spanish economist, had been competition commissioner for less than two months when his office approved Microsoft’s takeover of Yahoo’s search business in February 2010. A Brussels antitrust lawyer, who did not want to be identified for fear of alienating a potential client in Microsoft, said the Italian complaint could scupper the deal. “I would certainly say this kind of complaint, if it raises new issues that the commission has not previously considered, may derail the deal or, at least delay approval,” the lawyer said. Mr. Almunia could be persuaded to extend his present review into a more exhaustive second phase, which could take months or even years. Or, the lawyer said, Microsoft could seek to delay an immediate decision and buy time by requesting an extension to prepare an answer to the complaint. Jesse Verstraete, a spokesman for Microsoft in Brussels, said the company declined to comment on the allegations in the complaint from Messagenet. “The proposed acquisition is still undergoing regulatory review and we are working closely with the agencies,” Mr. Verstraete said. “Until all regulatory approvals are obtained, it is business as usual at Microsoft and at Skype.” Besides asking Microsoft to “unbundle” Skype from Windows, Messagenet is urging European competition authorities to require Microsoft to effectively open Skype’s Internet phone network, which had 124 million regular users in June, to the services of rivals. Messagenet is asking the commission to do this by requiring Microsoft to disclose the confidential computer coding that would enable rival services to connect calls to Skype users. Skype’s communication software does not operate with rival services. In May, after Microsoft announced its plans to buy Skype, the managing director of Messagenet, Andrea M. Galli, said he had written to Skype requesting the secret coding that would let the services interconnect, according to a copy of the complaint that Messagenet filed with the commission, and which was seen by the International Herald Tribune. Mr. Galli said Skype never responded to the request. Less than three weeks later, Skype ended its partnership with Digium, a company based in Huntsville, Alabama, whose software had enabled users of an open-source Internet phone service, Asterisk, to call and be called by Skype users. At that time, a Digium product manager, Rod Montgomery, lamented in a company blog that Skype for Asterisk, the Digium software, had been a “strong and steady seller.” 1 2 Next Page »BERLIN — Reviving arguments that have dogged Microsoft in Europe for nearly two decades, an Italian software maker is asking European officials to block Microsoft’s $8.5 billion purchase of Skype, the Internet phone service, unless it is removed from Microsoft’s ubiquitous Windows Office platform.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/us/companies-get-gay-rights-heat-over-christian-donations.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Companies Get Gay-Rights Heat Over Christian Donations<date>Published: September 25, 2011</date><text>The culture war over gay rights has entered the impersonal world of e-commerce.A handful of advocates, armed with nothing more than their keyboards, have put many of the country’s largest retailers, including Apple, Microsoft, Netflix and Wal-Mart, on the spot over their indirect and, until recently, unnoticed roles in funneling money to Christian groups that are vocal in opposing homosexuality. The advocates are demanding that the retailers end their association with an Internet marketer that gets a commission from the retailers for each online customer it gives them. It is a routine arrangement on hundreds of e-commerce sites, but with a twist here: a share of the commission that retailers pay is donated to a Christian charity of the buyer’s choice, from a list that includes prominent conservative evangelical groups like the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family. The marketer and the Christian groups are fighting back, saying that the hundred or so companies that have dropped the marketer were misled and that the charities are being slandered for their religious beliefs. The national battle was ignited in July by Stuart Wilber, a 73-year-old gay man in Seattle. He was astonished, he said, when he learned that people who bought Microsoft products through a Christian-oriented Internet marketer known as Charity Giveback Group, or CGBG, could channel a donation to evangelical organizations that call homosexual behavior a threat to the moral and social fabric. “I said, ‘You’ve got to be kidding, Microsoft,’ ” he recalled, noting that the software giant — like many other corporations accessible through the commerce site, including Apple and Netflix — was known as friendly to gay causes. In July, Mr. Wilber went to a Web site that helps groups and individuals circulate petitions, called Change.org, and started one, asking Microsoft to end its association with what he called “hate groups.” By that night, 520 people had signed, with their ire copied to Microsoft officials — and Microsoft had quietly dropped out of the donation plan. Much to Mr. Wilber’s surprise, this would be the start of an electronic conflict that has put hundreds of well-known companies in an unwelcome glare. On one side are angry gay-rights advocates and bloggers, wielding the club of the gay community’s purchasing power. On the other side are conservative Christian groups that say they are being attacked for their legitimate biblical views of sex and marriage, as well as a Web marketing firm that feels trampled for providing consumers with free choice. Caught in the middle are companies, including such giants as Macy’s, Expedia and Delta Air Lines, which have the dual aims of avoiding politics but not offending any consumers. In this case, they have been pressured to make a choice that may involve little money either way but that could offend large blocs of consumers. “This is economic terrorism,” said Mike Huckabee, the former pastor, governor and presidential contender, who is a paid CGBG consultant. “To try to destroy a business because you don’t like some of the customers is, to me, unbelievably un-American,” he said in an interview. CGBG, a for-profit company formerly called the Christian Values Network, resembles hundreds of so-called affiliate marketers, which retailers use to bring customers to their own Web sites. The affiliate receives a commission on any sales, and CGBG allows buyers to send half that commission to any of the Christian charities on its list. In July, as word of Mr. Wilber’s victory spread virally, Ben Crowther, a college student in Bellingham, Wash., started a similar Internet appeal to Apple, which would soon succeed after drawing 22,700 signers. Roy Steele, who runs a gay-rights Web site in San Francisco, picked up the crusade, directly contacting about 150 companies listed on the e-commerce site. AllOut.org, a gay-rights group in New York with hundreds of thousands of e-mail-ready members, focused on the travel industry, helping to push Avis, Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts, Expedia and many other hotels and travel agencies to disassociate themselves from CGBG. Close to 100 companies have left the charity arrangement, though most refuse to discuss the matter. These have become the objects, in turn, of a countercampaign from the Christian groups — “Please Don’t Discriminate Against My Faith” is the heading of a sample letter — and of high-level entreaties from Mr. Huckabee and other Christian leaders. A few companies that briefly left the network have been persuaded to rejoin, including Delta, PetSmart, Sam’s Club, Target and Wal-Mart. “People have been misled. The retailers are not donating to anyone; they are simply paying a commission to get traffic,” John Higgins, the president of CGBG, said in an interview. He said CGBG focused on Christian consumers and marketing through large organizations like Focus on the Family because it saw an untapped commercial opportunity. “Retailers should keep their doors open to everybody,” Mr. Higgins said. He also complained that some competing e-commerce sites included the same conservative groups on charity lists but had not been subjected to similar attacks. 1 2 Next Page »The culture war over gay rights has entered the impersonal world of e-commerce.</text></article>

The plan was discussed at a private meeting in Manhattan on Tuesday night among officials from the three companies and executives from the advertising industry, according to an agency executive who attended but who would speak only anonymously because the meeting was private. AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft declined to comment on the plan. The companies also hope to entice other online publishers to join their partnership. And by joining together and selling for one another, they hope to reduce the need for third-party ad networks that often sell some of the less desirable ad space on their sites. The plan was first reported Wednesday morning on AllThingsD, the technology Web site. The report said the deal was focused on selling remnant inventory, or the lower-priced ads that typically run at the bottom of Web pages or on secondary pages. Remnant ads are generally sold by third-party networks, usually for lower prices, and feature products or services like weight-loss or teeth-whitening treatments. The move would signal another step by online publishers to rely more heavily on so-called private exchange technology, which allows them to deal directly with ad agencies without having to use third-party networks. Selling the space could allow the publishers to earn more revenue and gain more control over the data they collect on their users. It would also give media buyers and agencies a one-stop shop for buying advertising space on each of the three companies’ sites. “What they are trying to replicate is the growth of private exchanges,” said David Hallerman, a principal analyst for eMarketer, a digital market research firm. The exchanges, he said, “offer a buyer accurate targeting, brand safety and good pricing for good reach.” The companies’ plan would most likely require them to overcome several obstacles. The technologies they use to sell and place ads on their sites are not immediately compatible. Yahoo has an ad exchange called Right Media, and AOL has Advertising.com, which makes much of its revenue from selling remnant ads. Last winter, Microsoft began selling remnant ads through AppNexus’s exchange. Other issues could include figuring out how to coordinate sales efforts and determining which sales team sells which ad space. Google dominates the search advertising marketplace, with nearly 76 percent market share, according to data from eMarketer, and the company is aggressively pushing into online display advertising as well. It accounts for about 9 percent market share in display, with projected revenue of about $1.1 billion, according to eMarketer. The projected display advertising revenues for Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft combined would total $2.7 billion, eMarketer reported.Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft, three major technology companies that have traditionally competed for digital advertising revenue, have created an unusual partnership in which they will sell ads for one another.</text></article>

Is it possible to check the spelling of Spanish excerpts in the same document with English text in the American version of Microsoft Word 2010? A. Most recent versions of Microsoft Word include proofreading tools like grammar guides and spellcheckers for additional languages besides American English. The company’s list of proofing tools available for different international editions of Word shows that the English version includes dictionaries and other utilities for both French and Spanish as well as for English. (For those who need proofing tools in other world tongues, Microsoft sells add-on Office Language Packs for about $25 per language.) To check the spelling of Spanish sections in a Word 2010 document, highlight the text you want to check. Next, click the Review tab in the Office Ribbon at the top of the window, click the Language icon and choose “Set proofing language” from the menu. In the language box, select the regional variation of Spanish you would like to use. Once you have indicated which parts of the file need the Spanish dictionary, go back to the Review tab and click the Spelling &amp; Grammar button to check the document. As Word goes through the file and flags suspicious words, the Spelling &amp; Grammar dialog box on the screen will have a dictionary language drop-down menu that lets you switch the language used to check the selected word. Microsoft has its own page of illustrated instructions for checking spelling and grammar in different languages in Word 2010. A similar guide for users of Office 2011 for the Mac is also available.</text></article>

History suggests that the company is rarely first with a technology, but it is persistent — and it often prevails.The track record is lengthy: personal computer operating systems, point-and-click graphical computing, productivity software, data center software, the Internet browser and even video game consoles and software. This week, the company is trying to begin another come-from-behind campaign — this time, in touch-screen tablet computing, with its Windows 8 operating system. Products using the new software are not expected until next year. But the crucial effort to woo software developers to write apps for Windows 8 starts Tuesday at a four-day conference in Anaheim, Calif. Microsoft will give away an early “preview” version of Windows 8 and thousands of tablets, made by Samsung, to developers at the conference, according to two industry consultants who have been told about the plans but would talk about them only if they were not named. For Microsoft, the stakes are high. Its Windows business remains huge and immensely profitable, but the franchise is showing its age, with revenue and profits slipping in the year that ended in July. “Microsoft has got to make this work,” said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering, a technology research firm. Tablets, as well as smartphones, look to be the computing devices of the future. Sales forecasts of personal computers have been scaled back in recent months, as consumers and business people have increasingly chosen tablets. Apple rules the tablet market with its iPad, while others have stumbled. Last month, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, which used H.P.’s WebOS software. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, has struggled to find buyers for its tablet, the PlayBook. Tablets running Google’s Android software have had little success so far, and ones using Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system have had even less. “Windows 8 is Microsoft’s effort to get back in the game,” said Michael Silver, an analyst at Gartner, a research firm. Microsoft has offered glimpses of Windows 8 at a few industry conferences in recent months. The new design, Microsoft executives say, represents an ambitious rethinking of the operating system, including the chips used and the user experience. Windows 8 on a PC can be ready for use in less than 10 seconds. The look of Windows 8 borrows from Windows Phone software, the company’s new smartphone operating system, which was introduced last fall. It has large, tilelike icons that represent applications like e-mail or Facebook. Windows 8 is intended to run on both ARM chips, which now power most tablets and smartphones, and Intel microprocessors. Microsoft executives say Windows 8 has been designed so that tablet, notebook and desktop computers run equally well and share most features. For example, they speak of a “touch first” philosophy, meaning the touch features of Windows 8 work smoothly on tablets and on notebook and desktop PCs. Taps and finger swipes on a screen, Microsoft executives say, will become a routine way to open, close and browse applications, even on machines that have keyboards. Touch screens, they suggest, could help revive excitement in the PC category. Windows 8 also reflects Microsoft’s increasing commitment to open Web standards, like HTML 5, a new technology that makes it possible for developers to write applications with rich interactive features without using proprietary software controlled by individual companies. In the past, Microsoft had followed a more closed, proprietary path. Microsoft signaled its new approach in March with the release of Internet Explorer 9, a Web browser that was tailored for HTML 5. But the browser also includes software features that can take advantage of the underlying Windows operating system for faster performance. The goal, Microsoft executives say, is to reduce the skills that developers will need to write applications for Windows 8, which will run smoothly on both tablets and PCs. “Windows 8 will provide a unique industry opportunity across hardware architectures for developers,” said Steven Sinofsky, president of Microsoft’s Windows division. Web developers have been impressed with Microsoft’s new approach. “Microsoft is opening things up for Web developers,” said Emily P. Lewis, a 37-year-old Web applications designer in Albuquerque. “They had no choice. What I do isn’t a Windows thing or an Apple thing.” Microsoft, analysts note, has also made tools that so its millions of loyal developers of business software will not find their skills made obsolete by Windows 8. Microsoft, they say, is betting that its traditional developer community will be a ballast in the future and not an anchor. That approach is in contrast to Apple, which often forces developers to rewrite their applications for its new products, like the iPad, favoring innovation over stability.Microsoft has a knack for comebacks. History suggests that the company is rarely first with a technology, but it is persistent — and it often prevails.</text></article>

It took less than seven weeks, but it became more expensive quickly. From the first discussions in early July to a formal announcement on Aug. 15, Google moved swiftly this summer to secure a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility, according to a filing submitted on Tuesday. The search giant, which was eager to own Motorola’s extensive patent portfolio, was also willing to pay up. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. filing Google to Buy Motorola Mobility After floating an initial bid of $30 a share on Aug. 1, Google raised its offer price to $37, before settling at $40 a share. In just weeks, the offer increased by more than $3 billion. For that, Motorola can thank Frank P. Quattrone, whose investment bank was hired on Aug. 1. The filing, which maps out the background of the merger, discloses how the deal came together in the wake of Google’s failed bid for Nortel‘s patent portfolio. In early July — mere days after Google lost out to a consortium led by Apple and Microsoft — Andrew Rubin, the company’s senior vice president of mobile, reached out to Sanjay Jha, the chief executive of Motorola Mobility, to discuss “the possible impact of and potential responses” to the Nortel purchase. Over the next several days, discussions intensified, roping in more executives, including Google’s chief, Larry Page, and Nikesh Aurora, the company’s chief business officer. And by mid-July, the parties had agreed to a confidentiality agreement, as Google began due diligence on Motorola Mobility’s patent portfolio. Although talks initially centered on Motorola’s patents, the focus quickly shifted to takeover talks. On July 28, Google said it would entertain a bid in the range of high $20s to low $30s. On Aug. 1, it came back with a formal letter and a $30 offer. Enter Mr. Quattrone. On that day, Motorola Mobility hired Mr. Quattrone’s Qatalyst Partners and Centerview Partners to serve as financial advisers. According to the filing it was Qatalyst, which has recently advised some of the largest takeover transactions in the technology sector, that prodded Google to go higher. On Aug. 5, after a telephone meeting with Motorola’s directors, an unidentified Qatalyst representative contacted Google’s chief legal officer “to reject the $30 per share offer and suggested that Google increase its proposed price to $43.50 per share.” On Aug. 9, Google came back with $40 a share. At the tail end of the process, Motorola Mobility’s board considered seeking other buyers, but ultimately concluded that it was “preferable” to negotiate on a confidential basis with a single potential acquirer, rather than to conduct a private or public auction. Six days later, the deal was done.</text></article>

Scientists at Microsoft Research and the University of Washington have come up with a new system that uses the human body as an antenna. The technology could one day be used to turn on lights, buy a ticket at a train station kiosk, or interact with a world of other computer applications. And no elaborate instruments would be required. “You could walk up to a ticket-purchasing machine, stand in front and make a gesture to be able to buy your ticket — or set the kind of gas you want at the gas station,” said Desney Tan, a senior researcher at Microsoft Research and one of the creators of the technology. The system, demonstrated so far only in experiments, is “a fascinating step forward,” said Joseph A. Paradiso, an associate professor of media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-director of the Things That Think Consortium. There is no reason to fear that the new technology will affect people’s health, he said; it merely exploits electromagnetic fields that are already in the air. “Suddenly someone takes advantage of it and opens up an example that is potentially useful,” he said of the new gesture technology. The innovation is potentially inexpensive, as it requires no handheld wireless wand, as the Nintendo Wii does, or the instrumentation of Microsoft’s Kinect, which uses infrared light and cameras to track motion. Instead, the technology uses something that is always with us, unless we live in the wilderness: ambient electromagnetic radiation emitted as a matter of course by the wiring in households, by the power lines above homes, and by those gas pumps at the service station. The human body produces a small signal as it interacts with this ambient electrical field. The new system employs algorithms to interpret and harness that interaction. In initial tests, the technology determined people’s locations and gestures from the way their bodies interacted with the electrical field, said one of its inventors, Shwetak N. Patel, an assistant professor at the University of Washington. Matt Reynolds, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at Duke, who collaborates with Dr. Patel, says it has long been known that people function as antennas as they move near power lines — for example, those within the walls of a home. “What’s new,” he said, “is leveraging those signals as useful data that can be the basis for an interface for a computer system.” Dr. Patel has had a longstanding interest in delving into signals in the home and finding new uses for them. He helped to found a company called Zensi, which created an energy monitoring device that can be plugged into any outlet in a home to figure out which appliances are drawing power. (The company was sold last year.)   He is also working on a system to monitor home water use. By detecting minute changes in pressure at a spigot, it infers how much water the toilet or dishwasher is consuming. Practical applications of gesture technology will take time to develop, Dr. Tan of Microsoft cautioned. One of those applications may be in homes, where a wave of the hand might control lighting, security systems, air-conditioners or televisions. Of course, designers must take care that gestures don’t accidentally set off a device, he said. For example, it could be commanded to start only with an unusual gesture — perhaps drawing a circle in the air, or touching a certain number of fingers on the wall. Once users have done this, the system knows the gesture is intended as a command. Such home-automation devices would have to be calibrated individually for each household, and recalibrated if people moved to another home, as the homes would have different wiring. But Robert Jacob, a professor of computer science at Tufts University, said that such calibration would be a relatively minor chore for machine learning. “A computer can be quickly trained to do that,” he said.

    <article index="8" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/qa-taking-the-upgrade-leap-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7/?ref=microsoftcorporation">Q&amp;A: Taking the Upgrade Leap From Windows XP to Windows 7<date>September 8, 2011, 6:04 pm</date><text>Q. What’s the least painful way for a Windows XP user to upgrade to Windows 7 since Microsoft doesn’t allow you to just install the new system directly on top of the old one? A. Microsoft requires people upgrading to Windows 7 from Windows XP to perform a “clean” installation of the new system. And by “clean,” they mean it — as in “none of your settings, files are programs are automatically copied to Windows 7.” In one form or another, you need to back up all the stuff you want to move to the new system, install Windows 7 on the computer, and then reinstall all your files, settings and programs for use with the new system. Before delving into this project — which can take several hours depending on what method you use to perform the upgrade — check your existing computer hardware, software and peripherals to make sure they can even handle Windows 7 and its system requirements. Microsoft has a Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor program you can download and run on your current computer as well as Windows 7 Compatibility Center on its site to double-check your critical programs and devices before you upgrade from Windows XP and find out that they no longer work with Windows 7. (If your computer doesn’t meet the needs of Windows 7, upgrading your hardware or buying a whole new machine with Windows 7 already installed are the typical solutions.) But if everything on your current computer looks like it will work with Windows 7, you can decide how you want to upgrade. You need to buy Windows 7 installation discs for whichever edition of the system you decide to use after checking compatibility. One upgrade approach is to use the method Microsoft outlines on its site, which offers a short video and a 17-page guide you can download and print for reference as you go along. This process involves copying your files and settings to an external hard drive using the built-in Windows Easy Transfer software. If you already have an external hard drive you can use for the upgrade, this method does not really cost anything more except some time, and perhaps patience. You will also need to have the original installation discs for any programs you want to put back on the computer after the upgrade, as the Windows Easy Transfer program only saves things like user account info, documents, photos, music, videos, e-mail and browser bookmarks. If such a manual approach sounds like too much of a hassle, investing $40 or so in software that migrates your files, settings and installed programs from Windows XP to Windows 7 is another way to upgrade the computer. Laplink Software’s PCmover is one such program and others are reviewed here.</text></article>

In recent years, technology companies have been cutting their losses with increasing speed. Google proudly released Wave, its platform of collaborative work tools, to the general public in May 2010. It canceled Wave 77 days later. Palm announced its first tablet, the Foleo, on May 30, 2007. By Sept. 4, the company halted development and the product was never sold. Pure Digital, maker of the Flip camcorder, had planned to release the Flip-Live on April 13, but Cisco, which had acquired Pure Digital in 2009, shut the entire division on April 12. These days, big technology companies — particularly those in the hypercompetitive smartphone and tablet industries — are starting to resemble Hollywood film studios. Every release needs to be a blockbuster, and the only measure of success is the opening-weekend gross. There is little to no room for the sleeper indie hit that builds good word of mouth to become a solid performer over time. When Microsoft released the Xbox 360 in 2005, there were widespread reliability issues and the console faced serious competition from the Nintendo Wii, yet the company stayed the course, and now the Xbox is one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time. That kind of tenacity seems to be in diminishing supply. Some analysts trace the origin of this blockbuster-or-bust mentality to Apple. Each release of the company’s popular iPads and iPhones crosses over into being a mainstream media event. Al Hilwa, an analyst at the research firm IDC, described the accelerated lifecycle of high-end hardware as “Darwinian.” “There’s a level of desperation from anyone whose name is not Apple,” said Mr. Hilwa. The crush of tech bloggers and Twitter-using early adopters who chronicle every bit of news — good and bad — about new phones and tablets also raises the stakes around how well new products perform in the marketplace. “You know pretty quickly, and in a very public way, whether a product is successful or not,” said Mr. Hilwa. Similar to opening week at the movies, early reviews on the Web panning a new tablet or phone can be disastrous for its makers. “Once you lose momentum, it's hard to regain it,” said Chris Jones, an analyst at Canalys. The rapid life cycles of products can play with the affections of consumers, who may rush out to be the first on their block with a new product, only to find that the manufacturer has canceled any future support or development weeks after it went on sale. Neal LoCurto, the owner of TeamLogic IT, an information technology consulting company in Syosset, N.Y., said he bought his TouchPad the morning it went on sale. “On release day I went to Best Buy that morning and waited at the door,” Mr. LoCurto said. “I was the first one in and the first one out.” Mr. LoCurto, who ultimately grew unhappy with the TouchPad because of the lack of apps, received a refund for his TouchPad, but he says he no longer trusts H.P. “I feel like they lied to us,” Mr. LoCurto said. “They didn’t give it a chance.” Companies kill new products more quickly now because of the higher cost of staying competitive, said Jim McGregor, research director for In-Stat, a market research firm. Quickly pulling the plug on an obvious failure makes sense, although it can be embarrassing. “The life cycles are very short because there is obviously huge competition,” Mr. McGregor said. “Even if you do have a blockbuster, you know you’re going to get leapfrogged in six months. You have to come out with something that really knocks off the pants and then follow it up. You can’t just sit there and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got a success.’ ” In the case of the TouchPad, analysts agree it failed because its operating system, webOS, had few of the apps that made Apple’s iPad a runaway hit, he said. Microsoft’s Kin had a similar problem. Mr. McGregor said that Google TV, Google’s Internet-connected television accessory, faded into obscurity because of content providers declined to make their content available. Google had lined up various manufacturers as partners, including LG, Toshiba and Sharp, only to tell many of them last December to delay the release of their Google TV products. While Google’s strategy for Google TV remains unclear, none of those partners have come out with a Google TV product. “The content is worth more than the device,” said Mr. McGregor. “If you don’t have everything — the content, the applications and the experience — you might as well drop your anchor and jump off the ship.” Even mighty Apple was not always so skilled. Like other companies today, Apple suffered a streak of bad luck with new products more than a decade ago and, like them, it cut its losses. The company killed the Power Mac G4 Cube, a desktop computer, in 2001 after only 11 months because consumers believed the price was too high and balked at having to buy a monitor separately. Two days after announcing it would kill the TouchPad, H.P. started unloading its inventory through a fire sale. The steep discount — 80 percent off the original price — succeeded in setting off a buying frenzy that H.P.’s executives had hoped for when they introduced the device. H.P.’s online store, along with Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart, quickly ran out of TouchPads after putting them on sale for $100 for the 16G version and $150 for the 32G version. When originally available in July, they were listed at $500 and $600. People strategized on online message boards about how to find a TouchPad. H.P.’s call center was overwhelmed. “All this clamoring for the TouchPad, kind of bittersweet,” H.P.’s customer service arm said in a post on Twitter.Seven weeks after it was put on sale, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, the company’s competitor to Apple’s iPad.</text></article>

Competition benefits consumers. This is not a ideological screed, just a simple observation about what happens to goods and services when there is more than one provider of that product. I’m ultimately talking about the state of the tablet industry, but let’s start by talking about cars. Let’s say you were going to buy a family sedan today. You would have several options to choose from: the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord, the Ford Fusion and the Hyundai Sonata are just a few that leap to mind. If you were researching these cars, you would discover a couple of things: Each model has won some magazine’s multicar comparison or another, and the overall opinion would be that these cars, as a group, are all quite good. Personal preferences and the availabilities of certain pricing deals may sway your opinion one way or another, but nobody could reasonably say that the car you picked was materially worse than another. And that’s because competition breeds excellence. Ask anyone who pays attention to the car industry and they will tell you that the family-sedan segment is just brutal, with manufacturers fighting tooth and nail over every sale. In fact, that market has become more competitive in recent years. It used to just be the Camry and the Accord fighting for supremacy, but now you have new (Hyundai) and old (Ford) competitors, among others, joining the fight with interesting, well-made, compelling products. It’s a great time to be shopping for a new family sedan. Compare that with the state of the tablet market today. Hewlett-Packard is in retreat. Research in Motion is in a holding pattern. Motorola has been sold and its tablet is now an afterthought. Samsung fights the good fight, but it trails Apple’s market share by 50 percentage points. Apple is not just ahead of the pack, it almost is the pack. Now, some would say that this is also a simple result of economic laws at work: Apple makes a superior product, therefore it gets most of the sales. Great. But you know what would be really great? Apple and Google/Microsoft/H.P./Anyone locked in an epic battle for tablet supremacy, each side releasing new and better products at a furious pace, each dropping prices substantially at a steady clip. Now, some would argue that this is already happening — that Apple is driving innovation and creativity with each upgrade of the iPad it releases. But think what it would be like if you had two companies doing that — or three. This isn’t about whether you prefer Apple or Android for your tablet. This isn’t about picking sides. As a consumer, I want there to be robust competition across the board. I want Coke and Pepsi. Target and Wal-Mart. Engadget and Gizmodo. If you’re a fan of Apple, you want there to be a worthy rival to push it, to keep its feet to the fire. If you don’t like Apple, you want someone else in the game so that Apple doesn’t suck all the air out of the room. And you want Apple to do the same pushing and foot-scorching to its competitor that another company would do to it. In any market, as far as the consumer is concerned, there should be blood.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/business/global/rethinking-libya-and-oil-prices.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Rethinking Libya and Oil Prices<date>Published: August 22, 2011</date><text>The endgame in Libya could herald a slump in oil prices. As with the rebel advance into Tripoli, Libyan supplies to the global market could come sooner than expected. Brent crude prices slipped by as much as $3 to almost $106 a barrel at one point on Monday, before rebounding later in the day. A resolution in Libya, coupled with concerns over global growth, means tight markets could soon look oversupplied. A return of Libyan oil production to levels before the unrest, 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of global supply, would take until 2015, according to a June estimate from the International Energy Agency. The forecast may now look too pessimistic, with the rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Repsol of Spain, and Eni of Italy all suggesting that normal supply could resume much faster once the crisis is resolved. Analysts estimate that daily production could reach up to a million barrels within a year. Oil prices have eased almost $20 a barrel in four months. A supply increase, just as the American and European economies look vulnerable to a new recession, will further weigh on prices. And Saudi Arabia’s recent effort to offset the disruption from Libya, taking production to a record high of almost 10 million barrels a day, will act to compound any supply glut, as will the International Energy Agency’s release of reserves. Yet any price slump is likely to be less severe than in 2008, when oil prices crashed by more than $100 a barrel in six months. This time around, credit lines remain open to businesses. And oil demand remains strong from certain rapidly growing countries like China, which account for almost 50 percent of total global consumption, compared with 44 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital. Politics will further support prices. Investors remain alert for signs that the protest movement could spread to larger oil producers like Iran. And even if prices do continue to fall, high-spending gulf countries have an incentive to cut production quickly. Saudi Arabia’s budget needs roughly $84 a barrel to break even, compared with around $50 a barrel three years ago. But with Brent prices some way off the pain threshold for producers, there’s still room for adjustment. A Murky Patent War Today’s costly technology patent wars in many ways can be pinned on the courts. Google, Apple, Microsoft and others are spending billions of dollars for the rights to the ideas powering devices like smartphones. But what they’re actually buying is legal protection. The next wave of rulings ought to sync up the law with the real world. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the exclusive forum for patent appeals, created in 1982 to keep the law consistent. But that consistency produced decisions upholding patents so broadly it was hard to tell exactly what they covered. In the 1990s, for example, software patent approvals began. Unlike with other inventions, they required only general descriptions — not code or other information specifying how concepts worked. The court used similarly loose standards to approve patents for business methods and certain technology. Judges may have been trying to promote innovation. But the practical result has been overlapping claims to some of tech’s most valuable ideas. It means firms like Google cannot identify all the patents that may cover, say, the Android mobile operating system. The company’s chief legal officer says as many as 250,000 patents might apply to a smartphone. That has led companies to introduce their products first and face consequences later. In the case of Android, Microsoft has asked Samsung to pay as much as $15 for each device using the software because of accusations of infringement. Microsoft is also suing in federal court to ban Motorola’s Android phones. The latest tack, though, is to deter lawsuits and royalty demands by acquiring patent portfolios. By doing so, companies can counter infringement threats with claims of their own. It is also a way to establish détente. A more reasonable approach would be stricter approval standards. The Supreme Court seemed to agree last year when it affirmed the rejection of a proposed business-method patent. The decision comes too late for companies that have spent freely for infringement fights. But it bodes well for those that would rather use patents to promote innovation than squelch it.

A return of Libyan oil production to levels before the unrest, 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of global supply, would take until 2015, according to a June estimate from the International Energy Agency. The forecast may now look too pessimistic, with the rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Repsol of Spain, and Eni of Italy all suggesting that normal supply could resume much faster once the crisis is resolved. Analysts estimate that daily production could reach up to a million barrels within a year. Oil prices have eased almost $20 a barrel in four months. A supply increase, just as the American and European economies look vulnerable to a new recession, will further weigh on prices. And Saudi Arabia’s recent effort to offset the disruption from Libya, taking production to a record high of almost 10 million barrels a day, will act to compound any supply glut, as will the International Energy Agency’s release of reserves. Yet any price slump is likely to be less severe than in 2008, when oil prices crashed by more than $100 a barrel in six months. This time around, credit lines remain open to businesses. And oil demand remains strong from certain rapidly growing countries like China, which account for almost 50 percent of total global consumption, compared with 44 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital. Politics will further support prices. Investors remain alert for signs that the protest movement could spread to larger oil producers like Iran. And even if prices do continue to fall, high-spending gulf countries have an incentive to cut production quickly. Saudi Arabia’s budget needs roughly $84 a barrel to break even, compared with around $50 a barrel three years ago. But with Brent prices some way off the pain threshold for producers, there’s still room for adjustment. A Murky Patent War Today’s costly technology patent wars in many ways can be pinned on the courts. Google, Apple, Microsoft and others are spending billions of dollars for the rights to the ideas powering devices like smartphones. But what they’re actually buying is legal protection. The next wave of rulings ought to sync up the law with the real world. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the exclusive forum for patent appeals, created in 1982 to keep the law consistent. But that consistency produced decisions upholding patents so broadly it was hard to tell exactly what they covered. In the 1990s, for example, software patent approvals began. Unlike with other inventions, they required only general descriptions — not code or other information specifying how concepts worked. The court used similarly loose standards to approve patents for business methods and certain technology. Judges may have been trying to promote innovation. But the practical result has been overlapping claims to some of tech’s most valuable ideas. It means firms like Google cannot identify all the patents that may cover, say, the Android mobile operating system. The company’s chief legal officer says as many as 250,000 patents might apply to a smartphone. That has led companies to introduce their products first and face consequences later. In the case of Android, Microsoft has asked Samsung to pay as much as $15 for each device using the software because of accusations of infringement. Microsoft is also suing in federal court to ban Motorola’s Android phones. The latest tack, though, is to deter lawsuits and royalty demands by acquiring patent portfolios. By doing so, companies can counter infringement threats with claims of their own. It is also a way to establish détente. A more reasonable approach would be stricter approval standards. The Supreme Court seemed to agree last year when it affirmed the rejection of a proposed business-method patent. The decision comes too late for companies that have spent freely for infringement fights. But it bodes well for those that would rather use patents to promote innovation than squelch it.

    <article index="3" href="http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/ford-toyota-partnership-hybrid-market-leaders-double-up/?ref=microsoftcorporation">Ford-Toyota Partnership: Hybrid Market Leaders Double Up<date>August 23, 2011, 6:00 am</date><text>Ford and Toyota, companies that both have had success developing and marketing vehicles with full hybrid powertrains, jointly announced on Monday that they would work together to create new hybrid systems for light trucks and sport utility vehicles. The brands expect to have products in the marketplace before the end of the decade, they said. In addition to hybrid technology, the automakers plan to collaborate on the development of standards for in-car telematics and Internet-based services. Current Ford and Toyota hybrid systems for front-drive vehicles are somewhat similar, so a joint effort would appear to be a good fit. Both automakers currently produce parallel systems that can utilize the electric motor either independent of or in combination with the gasoline engine, while charging the battery pack with a generator fed by the gasoline engine and through regenerative braking. Some news sources reported that Ford licensed Toyota hybrid technology roughly a decade ago. Said Deep, a Ford spokesman, said in a telephone interview that the confusion resulted from the fact that Ford licensed a number of Toyota patents when it introduced its first hybrid vehicles. Toyota also licensed some Ford patents, he said. The cross-licensing of patents is common in high-technology industries, when product similarities are evident, but Mr. Deep said that no Toyota technology was used in developing the early Ford hybrids. In the joint statement, the automakers said that they had been independently developing rear-wheel-drive hybrid powertrains, but decided to collaborate to bring new technology to the marketplace sooner, as well as to save development costs, which would lead to lower costs in the showroom. “We expect to create exciting technologies that benefit society with Ford, and we can do so through the experience the two companies have in hybrid technology,” said Takeshi Uchiyamade, a Toyota executive vice president. While the automakers will collaborate on the development of the new rear-wheel-drive hybrid system, they will work independently when integrating the finalized design into their vehicles and in developing a specific calibration. So while the hardware will be common, the on-road performance and efficiency won’t necessarily be. If Toyota may seem a step ahead of Ford in hybrid technology — its Prius is the top-selling hybrid in the United States — Ford may have an advantage in telematics. The automaker collaborated with Microsoft to develop its Sync in-car entertainment and communication system, which has been in the marketplace longer than Toyota’s Entune system. However, MyFord Touch, an extension of the Sync system, has been widely criticized, so both automakers may stand to profit from a collaborative effort on this front as well.</text></article>

Tyler Golden/Oxygen MediaCameron Mitchell, right, and Damian McGinty, participants in “The Glee Project,” perform in a video that is being streamed on oxygen.com. The show, “The Glee Project,” made its debut on June 12 and presented its final episode on Sunday night. The show was a reality competition series with a twist, offering the winner a chance to appear in seven episodes of the coming third season of the Fox Broadcasting series “Glee.” Twelve young men and women sang, danced and acted for the chance to win the prize. Bing was a major sponsor of “The Glee Project,” on Oxygen and online, at oxygen.com. As part of the deal, Bing also sponsored a competition called the Bing Fan Favorite, giving viewers a chance to vote at oxygen.com/fanfavorite for the contestant they liked the most. It was not required that the winner of the fan favorite competition had to be the same person who won the part on “Glee” on “The Glee Project.” The prize for the fan favorite was $10,000 and a chance to perform in a music video that would begin appearing on oxygen.com at the end of the last episode of the series. There were more than 3.7 million votes in the Bing Fan Favorite competition, the Oxygen and Bing executives reported, and the winner, too, provided a twist. The winner was Cameron Mitchell, 21, a contestant from Colleyville, Tex., near Fort Worth, who voluntarily withdrew from the competition during the July 31 episode. He told the judges that their request for him to kiss a girl as part of a performance would conflict with his Christian beliefs. The fact that Mr. Mitchell had pulled out of the competition meant that by definition the Bing Fan Favorite would be different from the winner of “The Glee Project.” And there was yet another twist in the final episode: There was more than one winner from among the four finalists. The finalists were shocked to find out that the judges had decided to give two of them – Samuel Larsen, 19, of Los Angeles, and Daman McGinty, 18, of Derry City, Northern Ireland — the chance to appear in seven episodes of the new season of “Glee.” (Mr. McGinty, who got to remain in the competition because Mr. Mitchell withdrew, performs with Mr. Mitchell in the Bing Fan Favorite video. The pair, who became friends during the series – leading to the inevitable descriptions of their “bromance”– sings the Michael Buble song “Haven’t Met You Yet.”) The judges also gave the other two finalists — Alex Newell, 18, of Lynn, Mass., and Lindsay Pearce, 20, of Modesto, Calif. — a consolation prize: Each of them will appear in two episodes of the 2011-12 season of “Glee.” “Did we all just win a little bit?” Ms. Pearce, seemingly agog, asked on camera after the judges made their announcement. There had been high hopes at Oxygen and Microsoft for “The Glee Project,” given the popularity of “Glee” and an aggressive marketing campaign by Oxygen to let viewers know about the reality series. But ratings for the premiere episode were unexpectedly weak. Only 455,000 viewers tuned in on June 12, compared with hopes of perhaps twice that. Even adding the viewership for the rerun, which followed immediately after, brought the total up to just 792,000. “We were surprised,” Jason Klarman, president of Oxygen Media, part of the NBCUniversal unit of Comcast, said in a phone interview. “Our expectations were certainly higher.” Still, “even as low as that number was, it wasn’t so low that we were thinking, ‘Oh my God,’ ” Mr. Klarman said. “It always looked like it was going somewhere.” So Oxygen ramped up its promotional efforts and waited. That patience paid off as the ratings for subsequent episodes rose significantly; the first run of the Aug. 8 episode, for instance, drew 912,000 viewers. For the finale, “we expect it to hit over a million,” Mr. Klarman said. And according to preliminary data on Monday afternoon, it did. There were 1.237 million viewers, Oxygen said, making the last episode the most-watched of any during the run of the series. Total viewership climbed 172 percent compared with the first episode, according to the data. The upturn was pronounced enough that Oxygen and the creators and producers of “Glee,” who were also involved in “The Glee Project,” are considering a second season. Eric Hadley, general manager for Bing marketing at Microsoft, said in a phone interview that he would “definitely” be interested in a sponsorship for a second season. “We’d want to evolve it so we would not do the same thing” as is the first season, he added. Bing is pleased with how “The Glee Project” has turned out and is “really happy” with the engagement of viewers and computer users with the search engine, Mr. Hadley said. As for the reaction after the initial ratings shortfall, “we knew they were going to do a ton to promote it,” he added, referring to the Oxygen executives. In sponsorships of nonscripted shows, “you’ve got to take a little bigger gamble” than with their scripted counterparts, Mr. Hadley said.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/the-ripple-effects-of-googles-motorola-deal/?ref=microsoftcorporation">The Ripple Effects of Google's Motorola Deal<date>August 15, 2011, 12:14 pm</date><text>Shares in Motorola Mobility jumped more than 56 percent on Monday after the company’s $12.5 billion sale to Google was announced. But it was not the only technology company to see its shares rise. Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, and Nokia enjoyed climbing stock prices after the deal came to light. That is presumably because of a greater appreciation for patents, which could be music to the two beleaguered companies’ ears. RIM shares were up 3.3 percent, at $25.36, in midday trading on Monday. And American depositary receipts of Nokia leaped 10.3 percent, to $5.91. Google made it clear that one of the chief benefits of the deal — why the search giant was willing to pay a 63.5 percent premium for Motorola — was the company’s arsenal of more than 17,000 patents, with an additional 7,500 pending. Both R.I.M. and Nokia have their own intellectual property portfolios. And after at least two prominent patent sales, Motorola and Nortel Networks, investors appear to be hoping that there are deals in the future for the two handset makers. For months, RIM had been under pressure, as its long-popular smartphones appeared to be losing steam to Apple‘s iPhone and handsets powered by Google’s Android. The company’s answer to the iPad, the Playbook, has yet to gain widespread acceptance. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Google to Buy Motorola Mobility Icahn Gets His Wish (Again) Video: Google Looks for Vertical Integration Meanwhile, in an effort to rid itself of its “burning platform,” Nokia cast its lot with Microsoft, choosing the tech giant’s Windows Mobile 7 as its cellphone operating system going forward. But there are some glimmers of hope for improving the valuations of both companies. From a research note by National Bank Financial: “RIM’s IP value may be worth $10 billion now; it’s hard to say but speculation could lift the stock in the near term.” Some investors and analysts appear to be betting that Microsoft will eventually do more than work out an operating system deal with Nokia, with Forrester Research‘s John McCarthy writing that the Google deal may embolden the pride of Redmond, Wash., to dream bigger. (One loser from the deal: InterDigital Inc., which owns a portfolio of about 8,800 patents. Google had reportedly been in talks to buy the wireless chip company, a deal whose prospects appeared to have withered considerably. Shares in InterDigital sank nearly 22 percent by midday on Monday, to $59.39.)</text></article>

I just got a new Windows 7 computer and it already seems kind of slow. Is adding RAM the only way to speed things up? A. The machine may seem pokey if it didn’t come with enough memory to run all the programs you want to have open at one time. You should also check to make sure the computer’s processor meets the system requirements for the programs you’re using. If the computer is constantly maxed out with memory-hungry applications, adding more RAM chips should help. If you don’t want to crack open the case (or pay someone) to add more memory, you can also give the computer a lift with the ReadyBoost feature, which essentially uses portable flash memory as RAM. To use ReadyBoost with Windows 7, Microsoft recommends using a USB flash drive with at least a gigabyte of available memory. Once you plug in the drive, select the “speed up my system” option in the Windows 7 AutoPlay box and follow the steps. ReadyBoost, (introduced with Windows Vista), also works with flash memory cards like those used in digital cameras. You also don’t lose the card or drive to Windows forever because ReadyBoost can be turned on or off at will. Windows 7 also includes troubleshooting utilities and a Performance Information and Tools feature that you can use to help diagnose certain causes of slowness. And Microsoft has other suggestions for giving your PC more pep, no matter what 21st-century version of Windows you’re running.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/qa-online-photos-for-the-family/?ref=microsoftcorporation">Q&amp;A: Online Photos for the Family<date>August 8, 2011, 5:39 pm</date><text>Q. I have scanned family photos for a reunion that I’d like to put online, but what’s the best way to move them all to the Web (and not on Facebook), and how can I keep them private for only relatives to see? A. Scout around for a photo-sharing site that meets your needs in terms of the amount of data you can upload, as well as privacy options. Depending on what Web services you already use, you may have photo-sharing space and not realize it — for example, Hotmail users can take advantage of Microsoft’s Windows Live SkyDrive to upload and share photos and Gmail users can easily get started with Google’s Picasa Web albums. Standalone photo-sharing sites (like Flickr, Photobucket and SmugMug) are another option. Both Flickr and Photobucket offer free basic accounts, but may limit the amount of photos you can upload each month or pepper your photo pages with advertising. SmugMug accounts start at $40 annually, but the site includes things like online backup, more privacy options and ad-free customizable pages to display photos. Many photo-sharing sites include privacy controls you can set so that only specified people can view your photo albums, even though the Web site itself is public. You are usually given a password or an obscure URL to share with family members so they can get in to see the pictures. Flickr, one of the largest photo-sharing sites on the Web, allows you to designate fellow members as friends or family, and then limit the visibility of the photos you upload to just those people on your friends and family lists. (If your relatives are not Flickr members, you can also send them a Guest Pass.) When looking around for a photo site, check to see if it offers tools for uploading photos in bulk instead of one at a time — which can save you hours if you have a large picture archive to share. If you think your family members are going to want to download copies of the photos for themselves, also make sure the photo site you choose allows authorized viewers to download the images for themselves.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/business/aaa-rating-is-a-rarity-in-business.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">AAA Rating Is a Rarity in Business<date>Published: August 2, 2011</date><text>Hanging over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington has been the threat that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating, a coveted measure of the federal government’s financial strength. But in corporate America, the top rating long ago became an anachronism.Scores of big corporations have lost their AAA status in recent years — only four non-financial companies continue to hold the rating — as it became seen in board rooms as more of a straitjacket than a path to riches. Just as many consumers relied on their credit cards to finance a higher standard of living, companies took on more debt to reap bigger returns. The choice did not appear to hurt them. The borrowing costs of companies with AAA ratings and those one level below are not that far apart. Investors, in other words, do not see much difference in quality. “It’s like you are going from a Rolls-Royce to a Mercedes — not from a Rolls-Royce to a Yugo,” said Chris Orndorff, a senior portfolio manager for the bond giant Western Asset Management. “That’s nothing to be ashamed of.” More and more, in fact, companies have found that a AAA credit rating is not something worth aspiring to if a more conservative approach means lower profits. Today, markets often render credit judgments before the rating agencies can take out their pens, so a downgrade has a less noticeable effect. By that time, many of the traditional benefits of being deemed AAA, like lower borrowing costs and reputational glow, have evaporated. In the early 1980s, around 60 companies had AAA credit. By 2000, the number of AAA companies was about 15. Today just four corporations— Automatic Data Processing, Exxon Mobil, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Microsoft — can claim those once-coveted three initials. (Five big insurers and several government affiliated organizations can too.) Analysts say corporate buyouts and acquisitions accelerated the trend. Many AAA companies lost their ratings when they were taken over and their new owners loaded them with cheap debt to help pay for the deal. Other strategic decisions also triggered downgrades. UPS, for example, struck a long-term agreement with its union workers in fall 2007 that raised pay and benefits but froze certain pension obligations. Soon after, the ratings agencies started knocking down the company’s credit rating to AA because of the new pension arrangement. “Maintaining a AAA rating is not a financial goal of this company,” a UPS spokesman said at the time. Investors barely reacted. In the three months after the downgrade, yields on UPS bonds responded by increasing about 0.4 percentage point from 5.32 percent. Today, with borrowers enjoying ultra-low interest rates, the bond yields are back to their levels in late 2007. Meanwhile, the financial crisis and deep recession laid into several of the sturdiest pillars of American capitalism. Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric and Pfizer all lost their AAA ratings. Still, a funny thing happened when these companies were sent down to AA. Investors shrugged off the change; the markets had already rendered their verdict. Borrowing costs for General Electric and Berkshire actually fell in the weeks after they were downgraded in spring 2009, amid a broader market rally. “The rating agencies were late to the party,” said Mr. Orndorff, the bond investor. Ratings for companies and countries are viewed differently, even if they are evaluated in much the same way. For most Americans, the prospect that the government could lose its AAA credit rating is almost unthinkable — a blow to national pride and consumer confidence that could turn out to be more damaging than any increase in borrowing costs. That is why even after President Obama signed a law on Tuesday that lifted the debt ceiling, some in Washington were worried that the plan’s spending cuts were not deep enough to appease all the major rating agencies. For now, all three major rating firms continue to give the United States a AAA rating. But on Tuesday, Moody’s said its outlook was negative after putting the government on notice last month that it could be downgraded. Fitch said on Tuesday that it planned to complete another review of the government’s finances by the end of this month, and Standard &amp; Poor’s has warned that the United States might lose its rating if it did not sharply rein in the deficit. It helps, of course, that the dollar remains the world’s leading currency, ensuring that demand for United States debt is strong in spite of the nation’s myriad financial challenges. But the truth is, even as the government maintained its AAA grade, the markets suggested long ago that the United States was no longer deserving of such a high rating. 1 2 Next Page »Hanging over the debt ceiling negotiations in Washington has been the threat that the United States could lose its AAA credit rating, a coveted measure of the federal government’s financial strength.

After all, an app that uses the entire screen is, in a way, distraction-free; you’re focused on the task at hand. I’ve been playing with a few distraction-free text editors over the last few weeks and I’ve found a few that really helped me concentrate while writing and reading. The first of these is OmmWriter Dana II ($4.99, Mac/PC/iPad), a seemingly patchouli-scented editor that turns off all of your notifications and presents you with a blank, bare screen with a rudimentary editor. Calming chimes play in the background as you contemplate the majesty of the Diamond Sutra, or, barring that, work on your logistics reports. Another simple editor is called ByWord ($9.99, Mac) that supports a language called Markdown that allows you to add italics, bold, and various other design elements by typing in text. It is sort of an anti-Microsoft Word where almost nothing is available in terms of font control and layout. Finally, there is Scrivener ($45, Mac), a unqiuely powerful editor that allows you to break up longer works into chapters, chunks or scenes. A single button expands the window to cover all other apps and allows you to work on your magnum opus in relative peace. Still not living the distraction-free life? Try Freedom, an app that turns off your network connection for a set amount of time. After all, think of how unproductive Dickens would have been if he had to fight against Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.</text></article>

It shows the young Muhammad Ali glaring down at a fallen Sonny Liston, the bruising heavyweight who had seemed invincible — until Ali beat him, in 1964, in one of the biggest upsets in sports history, and then beat him again a year later. “The triumphant underdog,” Mr. Nichols says, nodding toward the wall. The inspirational fight poster is fitting, because Mr. Nichols, a general manager at Microsoft, is a lieutenant in an underdog corporate army here. Its daunting mission is to take on the Google juggernaut. Microsoft’s assault on Google in Internet search and search advertising may be the steepest competitive challenge in business today. It is certainly among the most costly. Trying to go head-to-head with Google costs Microsoft upward of $5 billion a year, industry executives and analysts estimate. As the overwhelming search leader, Google has advantages that tend to reinforce one another. It has the most people typing in searches — billions a day — and that generates more data for Google’s algorithms to mine to improve its search results. All those users attract advertisers. And there is the huge behavioral advantage: “Google” is synonymous with search, the habitual choice. Once it starts, this cycle of prosperity snowballs — more users, more data, and more ad dollars. Economists call the phenomenon “network effects”; business executives just call it momentum. In search, Google has it in spades, and Microsoft, against the odds, wants to reverse it. Microsoft has gained some ground. Its Bing search site has steadily picked up traffic since its introduction two years ago, accounting for more than 14 percent of searches in the American market, according to comScore. Add the searches that Microsoft handles for Yahoo, in a partnership begun last year, and Microsoft’s search technology fields 30 percent of the total. Yet those gains have not come at the expense of Google. Its two-thirds share of the market in the United States — Google claims an even higher share in many foreign markets — has remained unchanged in the last two years. The share losers have been Yahoo and smaller search players. The costs for Microsoft, meanwhile, keep mounting. In the latest fiscal year, ended in June, the online services division — mainly the search business — lost $2.56 billion. The unit’s revenue rose 15 percent, to $2.53 billion, but the losses still exceeded the revenue. Microsoft is a big, rich company. But investors are growing restless at the cost of its search campaign. In May, when David Einhorn, the hedge fund manager, called for Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s C.E.O., to be replaced, he pointed to the online unit as a particular sore spot. Qi Lu, president of Microsoft’s online services division, sees the situation this way: “To break through, we have to change the game. But this is a long-term journey.” MR. LU, 49, knows about long journeys — and persistence. His grandparents raised him in rural China, in a home without running water or electricity. A bright student, he won a scholarship to the doctoral program at Carnegie Mellon. After stints at the Almaden Research Center of I.B.M. and at Yahoo, where he was in charge of its search and search ad technology, he joined Microsoft at the end of 2008. He was recruited by Mr. Ballmer, who assured him that Microsoft was committed to search and competing with Google for the long haul. Paul Yiu came from Yahoo two years ago, impressed by Microsoft’s approach to competing in search. A business and product manager, Mr. Yiu had spent most of his career in Silicon Valley, often working for Microsoft adversaries like Netscape and Oracle. He explains that in the valley, with its job-hopping and start-up culture, there is a “renters’ mentality”: if things aren’t working out, just move on. At Microsoft, he says, there is a “homeowners’ mentality”: a dedication to making things work. “If you’re in the expensive search game, you need to have a homeowners’ mentality,” Mr. Yiu says. Microsoft’s leadership knew years ago that becoming a real competitor to Google would take patience as well as dollars. In 2007, Mr. Ballmer met with Harry Shum, a computer scientist who led Microsoft’s research lab in Beijing at the time. Mr. Ballmer, as Mr. Shum recalls, told him that the company wanted to make a concerted push in search and bring in leading technical experts and business managers. “You spent 10 years in research, and now you’ll spend the next 10 years in search,” he remembers Mr. Ballmer saying to him. 1 2 3 4 Next Page »BELLEVUE, Wash.</text></article>

Mr. Clarkson, best known for his caustic wit and irreverent critiques on “Top Gear,” the long-running BBC program, is scheduled to become a “digital asset” in October, when Microsoft releases the fourth generation of its popular racing-simulator game, Forza Motorsport. Ian Gavan/Getty ImagesJeremy Clarkson. As part of the game’s refresh, which brings the requisite new cars, new tracks and new graphic mapping effects, Turn 10 Studios, its developer, is creating what it calls its strategic partnership with “Top Gear” in Britain, said Dan Greenawalt, a Turn 10 spokesman. As part of the arrangement, Mr. Clarkson writes his own take on a number of cars, including the Mercedes SLS AMG and the McLaren F1. Earlier this week, during a demonstration of the game’s new features, Mr. Greenawalt played a sound bite from Mr. Clarkson’s voiceover review of the SLS. Then, at the touch of a button, he cut him off midsentence — something that rarely happens to the nonvirtual Mr. Clarkson. The commentary is integrated into a new feature in Forza called AutoVista, a virtual car showroom in the program that allows users who have the Microsoft Xbox 360 Kinect controller to open car doors, examine the wheels and look under the hoods. “We thought about how people want to interact with cars, to move around one, open the doors, kick the tires,” said Mr. Greenawalt. “Our goal with this is to turn gamers into car lovers, and car lovers into gamers.” The collaborative deal between the show and the developer was signed last year; footage from “Top Gear” was featured in some editions of Forza 3. Forza Motorsport 4 is scheduled for release in the United States on Oct. 11.</text></article>

Bing is the industry’s distant No. 2 after Google. It has become a distraction for the software giant — one that costs shareholders dearly. The division that houses Bing lost $2.6 billion in the latest fiscal year. Facebook, or even Apple, might make a better home for Bing. A sale would be a boon for Microsoft’s investors.Microsoft has been pouring money into Bing. The company thinks search makes its offerings in everything from mobile phones to business software more compelling. Perhaps, but there is little evidence to date. And Bing and sites it powers like Yahoo still control only about 27 percent of the United States market; Google has more than twice as much. Advertisers do not want a monopoly in search, which should assure Bing of future revenue. And Google may be partly hamstrung as a competitor by antitrust inquiries worldwide. But the business has more value to a buyer that could bring it traffic. How much? Microsoft’s online services unit, of which Bing is the main component, had $2.5 billion of sales in the year that ended June 30. Google is valued at about six times sales. At a 25 percent discount to Google, the unit would be worth about $11 billion. Moreover, there are potential buyers. Facebook already works with Bing. It might be interested in buying the site, keeping more traffic onsite, and perhaps using its data to better tweak search results. That would be a potent weapon in its fight with Google, which recently introduced a rival social network, Google+. Apple might even be interested, given its growing online ambitions, evidenced by its consideration of a bid for Hulu. In a deal, Microsoft could either get paper in a highly coveted company or cash, which Microsoft, to its credit, has been good about returning to shareholders. Equally, it could buy back stock, as the company trades at nine times estimated earnings, almost a 20 percent discount to the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock average. On top of any proceeds a sale would bring, it would stanch losses like last year’s $2.6 billion. Without that, Microsoft would have made 10 percent more profit. That is something that should excite even jaded Microsoft investors. Rethinking Debt Standard &amp; Poor’s could choose to cut America’s AAA rating even if Congress does a debt ceiling deal. That would force a rethink. The 18 other top-rated sovereigns are either caught up in the European mess or are tiny. Without the “risk-free” benchmark of Treasuries, even ultracautious bond investors would have to get used to credit risk. America’s $7.8 trillion of Treasury bonds, notes and inflation-protected securities, together with more than $5 trillion of federal housing agency paper and the debt of several insurers, would all be affected if America’s rating slipped to AA, according to S.&amp;P. For bond investors fixated on AAA credits, there is not much capacity elsewhere to pick up the slack. Other top-rated sovereign entities include the Isle of Man, Guernsey and Liechtenstein, which are tiny. Even the largest of them, Germany, has only 2 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) of public debt outstanding. Moreover, six of the entities are euro zone members, and several others are closely connected to the European Union’s debt troubles. Only Australia, Canada, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland hold top ratings without such blemishes, but all five have relatively small amounts of debt. Top-rated companies do exist, but in the United States there are only four of them. That is nowhere near enough to absorb investor demand — even assuming that buyers could get used to relying on corporate, rather than government, credit. Money market funds, obliged to hold almost all their assets in AAA credits, might be spared a huge sell-off in a downgrade because their rules refer to short-term ratings, and S.&amp; P.’s threat might only apply longer term. For other investors, adjusting portfolio holdings, and even their guiding rules, to include the United States and other AA-rated names should require only modest changes, though banks and some insurers might have to raise capital. And the United States government bond market would still be there, even if interest-rate comparisons with Treasury yields would have to contemplate negative numbers as well as positive. The biggest impact could be psychological: there would no longer be a globally accepted liquid benchmark viewed as “risk-free.” Fifty years of thinking, and computer models, would need tweaking.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/technology/microsoft-posts-mixed-results-in-4th-quarter.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Microsoft Posts Mixed Results in 4th Quarter<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Sales of Microsoft’s core Windows computer operating system continued to erode for the second consecutive quarter as consumers shifted away from PCs to tablets.The software giant’s mixed financial results, reported Thursday, showed a company struggling with the muted demand for computers while winning strong sales for Xbox 360 and products for business customers. “We felt like it was a very solid close to a very solid fiscal year,” Peter Klein, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. Microsoft reported that its net income in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June, rose 30 percent to $5.87 billion, or 69 cents a share, from $4.52 billion, or 51 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue climbed 8.5 percent, to $17.37 billion from $16 billion. The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 58 cents a share and revenue of $17.25 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. The focus, however, is inevitably on Windows, Microsoft’s flagship product. Revenue from the unit that sells the Windows operating system software fell 1 percent, to $4.74 billion. It is the second consecutive quarter that Microsoft’s Windows revenue has fallen, a trend that Microsoft executives expect to continue because of the weakness in PC sales. The division’s fortunes are closely tied to PC sales, which worldwide grew 2.6 percent in the quarter, according to IDC, the market research firm. The shifting demand toward tablets is worrisome to Microsoft because most tablets run on Apple’s operating system or on Google’s Android software. Tablet manufacturers have shown little interest in adopting Windows, leaving Microsoft out of what some of its executives had thought was a niche product. Sales of tablets are expected to triple to 43.6 million units in 2011 from a year earlier, according to eMarketer, a market research firm. Microsoft attributed some of the decline in Windows revenue to a greater mix of PCs shipped to emerging markets, where prices were lower. A tough economy and a 41 percent drop in the sales of netbooks also contributed. Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said that Microsoft was trying to make inroads in tablets with an updated version of Windows, to be available in 2012. If it turns out to be “interesting, but not game-changing, then this deterioration will continue,” he said.  Mr. Klein said Microsoft would have more to say about its plans for tablets at its developer conference in September. Microsoft is also struggling with getting its Windows Phone 7 operating system on smartphones. Earlier this year, Nokia agreed to make phones that used Windows, but the partners have yet to introduce any devices. In an ominous sign, Nokia said on Thursday that its smartphone sales fell 32 percent in the quarter. The decline shows eroding demand for Nokia’s products and the difficulty Microsoft faces in competing against Apple and Google. The company still has strengths. Revenue from its Office software, which includes Word, grew 7 percent, to $5.78 billion. The company has said that the latest version, Office 2010, is being deployed at a rate five times faster than its predecessor. An 8 percent decline in revenue from Office to consumers was offset by a 12 percent gain with business customers. Microsoft attributed the weak consumer results, as it did with its operating system, to sales in emerging markets. Revenue from servers and tools, a division that caters to corporate customers, grew 12 percent to $4.64 billion.  A particular bright spot in Microsoft’s portfolio was its entertainment products and devices like the Xbox 360 video game console and the Kinect game controller, which lets users move their bodies to control characters in video games. Sales by the division grew 30 percent, to $1.49 billion. Microsoft’s shipments of Xbox 360 game consoles increased 13 percent to 1.7 million, underscoring its popularity among gamers. “They are continuing their amazing momentum this year,” Mr. Klein said. Revenue from Microsoft’s online properties, like the MSN portal and Bing search engine, rose 17 percent, to $622 million. The unit posted $728 million in operating loss, continuing a streak of red ink. Microsoft took over Yahoo’s search engine in an effort to better compete with Google. But so far, the partnership has failed to raise online advertising revenue as much as executives originally told investors. Both companies are working on the problem, Mr. Klein said, but it will not be resolved until the end of the year. Shares of Microsoft fell less than half a percent to $26.99 in after-hours trading. In regular trading, they closed nearly flat at $27.10.SAN FRANCISCO — Sales of Microsoft’s core Windows computer operating system continued to erode for the second consecutive quarter as consumers shifted away from PCs to tablets.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/technology/personaltech/kinect-hacking-finds-a-wider-crowd.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Kinect Improvisation, With a Wave of the Hand<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>Russ Maschmeyer doesn’t have anything against old-fashioned musical instruments. He just thinks they’re a bit hard to play.In his work as a graduate student at the School of Visual Arts in New York, he created one from thin air. He hacked a Microsoft Kinect game machine so the device’s cameras follow his body and turn its movements into notes. He can pluck notes from the air as if he were playing a harp. “Traditional instruments are really, really complex.” he said. “Not only do you need to know how to produce a note, but know how to produce them rapidly in sequence. To be a master musician, you’ve got to be able to pull off all of the micromovements necessary for it to be an expressive performance.” From the day it was released last fall, the Kinect captured the imagination of experimenters, starting with programmers, roboticists and tinkerers. Research scientists have long used pairs of cameras and specialized algorithms, but Microsoft’s machine handled all the hard work. The Kinect was the first relatively low-cost way to capture three-dimensional information about the world. Because the Kinect is inexpensive and easy to work with, the experimentation grew more mainstream, and people began sharing their software and reporting on their exploits using sites like kinecthacks.net. Microsoft developed the device as an attachment for the Xbox game console and built in enough power to track the movement of people and objects in front of it in three dimensions. The Kinect, which costs $150, uses a camera with an infrared light that is not visible to the human eye. The various objects and people in a room reflect this light and the camera analyzes the pattern from this invisible light. From this it reconstructs a three-dimensional view of the room and tracks any people in front of it. Thousands of people have used Kinect to create musical instruments, artworks or other projects. Many of their efforts can be found on sites like kinecthacks.net, kinecthacks.com or hackaday.com. Such sites often outline how to do it yourself. People have created voice-controlled music playback software for televisions, colored on-screen “water trails” that flow from your feet wherever you walk on the floor, animated art inside picture frames as in the Harry Potter movies and a way to turn any surface into a multitouch reading device. Artists seem to be the largest group drawn to the device, perhaps because there’s not much excitement in waving your arms to manipulate the quarterly budget report. In one of Alexandra Wolfe’s classes at Carnegie Mellon, she programmed her Kinect to track her movement and add a swirl of colored lights that followed her on screen. “I was tracking the silhouette because the Kinect has this great user tracking data,” she said. “You can do that with plain computer vision, but it would have taken ages and require so much intense code, but it only took five minutes.” Anyone who has a new task for the Kinect can experiment with the tools, which are proliferating. Some of the packages require sophisticated programming ability, but others are meant to be simpler. One of the easier approaches is to download the Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit from the University of Southern California. It converts physical gestures into instructions for PC software. The toolkit simulates the clicking of a keyboard. This makes it much easier for anyone to use because the keyboard is a common interface. The toolkit team took a popular game, World of Warcraft, and created a list of gestures that corresponded to keystrokes. Leaning forward, for instance, is converted into a push of the W key that would normally be pressed to walk forward in the game. Users are already swapping lists of gestures that work well for various software packages. Using a tool like this makes it fairly easy to reprogram any software that responds to the keyboard. Many photo packages, for instance, have slide shows that advance when the space bar is hit. It’s easy to arrange for any gesture, like a wave of the hand, to be used to skip to the next picture. The Southern California project site has a forum where people swap lists for common software packages and games. The blog kinecteducation.com also offers a number of suggestions for using the package in classrooms. All of this excitement has not gone unnoticed at Microsoft, and the company recently released its own software development kit for noncommercial users. These tools are supporting a wide range of experiments in home automation, art and manufacturing. Gerard Rubio worked with two friends, Raul Nieves and Jordi Bari, in Barcelona to build a three-dimensional copying machine that would scan an item from three sides with three Kinects and then send the model to a three-dimensional printer. A person could stand in the center of the circle and be turned into a sculpture in a few minutes. Artists are integrating the tool with projectors and sound cards to turn the way we move our bodies into a performance. Peter Morton, an Australian programmer, worked with a friend to build a simulation of the scene from the movie “Big” in which Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia played “Heart and Soul” and “Chopsticks” on a piano keyboard floor mat with sensors. The Kinect version doesn’t require any floor sensors because it watches the feet. The team used software from OpenKinect.org and wrote its own software in the Python language to extract the position of the feet and turn it into music. Mr. Morton said that the OpenKinect software was evolving quickly to be more flexible and supportive, freeing up the programmers to experiment and be creative. “The sheer scope and variety of demos produced so far could not have been predicted by Microsoft,” he said, and then added with a bit of surprise: “Or anyone else.”Russ Maschmeyer doesn’t have anything against old-fashioned musical instruments.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/technology/personaltech/the-best-apps-for-windows-phone-7.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">The Best Apps for Windows Phone 7<date>Published: July 20, 2011</date><text>Some people make it a big deal that Apple has 425,000 apps and Android has, by some counts, 250,000.But would you want a television with 400,000 channels or just 100 great ones? The Windows Phone 7 platform has “only” 25,000 apps, and that number will quickly grow once Nokia, one of the most popular handset makers, starts producing devices for the platform later this year. Already, though, the phones are good, if you mix in the right apps. Before I get to my own list, a note or two is in order. The devices come loaded with a mobile version of Microsoft Office, which lets you open and, in some cases, edit Office files. That saves you one big app-related shopping task. Also, while you can easily browse for apps on a PC, there is no dedicated shopping software for the Mac, so those users must instead browse online and buy on the phone, which can be buggy and frustrating. On the Web, it can be hard to find information about specific Windows 7 apps, and on the phone the search engine mixes results from other genres. So if you search, say, for a word like “Slacker,” you get albums, artists and songs associated with that word, as well as apps. The list of games is great, if you love Xbox games and the biggest hits from other mobile platforms, like Angry Birds, Plants vs. Zombies and the like. Otherwise, it’s hit or miss, with games like N.O.V.A. and Grand Theft Auto conspicuously absent. Meanwhile, developers of many popular iPhone or Android apps haven’t built versions for Windows Phone 7. There’s no Urbanspoon, Hipstamatic, SoundHound, MyWeather, Instapaper or Google Maps. And some that work great on other platforms, like Shazam, are painfully slow on Windows. With those caveats, then, here’s a list of the 10 best apps for Windows Phone 7 along with some contenders. ¶ Facebook for Windows Phone 7 (free): Built by Microsoft, the software is nicely designed, making good use of the big screens that are common on many Windows phones. The result is far less clutter than you’d find on a mobile Web page. ¶ Movies by Flixster, with Rotten Tomatoes (free): A recurring theme among the better Windows apps is the seamless navigation. Flixster, the excellent movie-information service, is a good example. Pages yield easily, and logically, to others, while large-font type at the top of the screen lets you know where you are and where you’ve been. ¶ Yelp (free): Information on nearly any local business you might need, rendered in a user-friendly manner. Pages load quickly, and reviews and photos for restaurants, in particular, are good. ¶ Epicurious (free): The mobile standard for recipe information. Its recipes have been created by chefs, cookbook authors and the editorial staffs of Bon Appétit and Gourmet, among others. Recipes are rated by users, and the app helps you build and share shopping lists. ¶ The Weather Channel (free): When judging the company’s other mobile offerings, the word “lovely” doesn’t come to mind. It does here. Most of the vital weather information breezes by with a flick of the finger. The app would be almost flawless if it didn’t force you to click a link and wait for the hourly forecast details. ¶ Google Search (free): In many ways, it’s the opposite of the Weather Channel. While Google’s search app excels on other platforms, it’s merely passable on Windows, mainly because it lacks a voice-search function. Still, it’s the best available shortcut to good, and quick, mobile search results. ¶ ESPN ScoreCenter (free): Sports fans can customize the app to show results and news for their favorite teams, across many professional and college leagues. The team selection process is simple, the interface is free of clutter, and the app includes a news ticker at the bottom of each screen. ¶ Evernote (free): In my experience, Evernote offers the best mobile note-tracking software because it’s easy to use and fast. Enter a note, audio or text, and it is immediately synchronized with your Evernote account, so you could log onto the online version and it would be waiting for you there. The free version is enough for most purposes, with added storage available for an annual fee. ¶ Thumba Photo Editor ($1): Fast and fun. It lets you test different photo effects with minimal processing delays, and you can also crop and rotate images. You can share to Facebook, Twitter and Flickr, but there is no e-mail sharing. ¶ Ilomilo ($5) helps demonstrate the Windows Phone gaming excellence. This puzzle game is challenging but not arduous, and the graphics are first rate. Like many other games on the Windows Phone platform, Ilomilo includes a trial version. That trial feature is important, because for whatever reason, developers generally charge more than on other mobile platforms for their games when they sell them on the Windows mobile platform. Maybe developers believe users will pay for the added benefit of synchronizing their mobile gameplay across the spectrum of Xbox Live. Either way, brace for sticker shock. Also, brace for some confusion. You won’t find games in the apps section, only in the games section of the Windows Phone Marketplace. Honorable Mention CNN Newsreader (free): Fast-loading, with a layout that lends itself nicely to at-a-glance browsing and reporting that will satisfy most people; Endomondo Sports Tracker (free): Great way to track your running, hiking or other outdoor activities; MLB.com At Bat 11 ($10): Pricey, but for baseball fans, worth every penny; Last.fm (free): Offers personalized radio along the lines of Slacker or Pandora, but you can fast-forward unlimited times; Glympse (free): Allows users to signal their precise whereabouts to other people for a limited amount of time; Kindle (free): Nimble e-reader software with useful features familiar to users of the Kindle device; moTweets (free): Great Twitter reader, with an option to stream updates directly to the phone’s home screen. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 22, 2011 The App Smart column on the Personal Tech pages on Thursday, about top apps for handsets running the Windows Phone 7 operating system, misstated the platform availability of the puzzle game Ilomilo. The game runs on Windows Phone 7; it is not available from Apple.Some people make it a big deal that Apple has 425,000 apps and Android has, by some counts, 250,000.</text></article>

Baidu, previously primarily a Chinese-language search engine, made the announcement Monday afternoon, saying Microsoft’s search engine, Bing, was expected to appear on Baidu’s Web pages by the end of this year. Baidu, which dominates Chinese-language search services here with about 83 percent of the market, has been trying for years to improve its English-language search services because English searches on its site are as many as 10 million a day, the company said. Now it has a powerful partner. “More and more people here are searching for English terms,” Kaiser Kuo, the company’s spokesman, said Monday. “But Baidu hasn’t done a good job. So here’s a way for us to do it.” Baidu and Microsoft did not disclose terms of the agreement. But the new English-language search results will undoubtedly be censored, since Beijing maintains strict controls over Internet companies and requires those operating on the mainland to censor results the government deems dangerous or troublesome, including references to human rights issues and dissidents. A Microsoft spokeswoman said, "Microsoft respects and follows laws and regulations in every country where we run business. We operate in China in a manner that both respects local authority and culture and makes clear that we have differences of opinion with official content management policies." Microsoft seems to be betting it can get access to what is already the world’s largest Internet population of about 470 million users. Google continues to be available on the mainland, though its search engine, which operates in English and Chinese, was moved last year to Hong Kong, where Beijing’s censorship rules do not apply. But lately, Google’s search engine and its e-mail service, Gmail, have become more difficult to connect to on the mainland. The company, which is based in Mountain View, California, has blamed the Chinese government for interfering with its operations. For Microsoft, it could be an opportunity. In a statement released Monday, Shen Xiangyang, Microsoft’s senior global vice president, said: “Bing’s cooperation with Baidu will allow the vast Baidu users to receive better English search experiences and results” and allow more Chinese users to experience Bing. Google declined to comment on the partnership between Baidu and Microsoft. But Google says that search is not its biggest business opportunity in China. Instead, it is betting on selling ads to Chinese companies to show users outside China and selling display ads to run on non-Google Web sites, neither of which is dependent on search. Chinese advertisers spent $1.7 billion on display ads last year, one of the highest such spends in the world, according to Google. The company continues to employ 500 people in China and says revenue there is growing year over year.

The group of companies, which also includes Research in Motion, Sony, Ericsson and EMC, beat out Google and Intel for the patents and patent applications that Nortel had accumulated when it was still one of the largest telecommunications equipment makers in North America. Nortel, which filed for bankruptcy in 2009, said in a statement late Thursday that it had sold its last remaining patents, covering businesses including wireless and networking technology and semiconductors, in an auction that it called “very robust.” “The size and dollar value for this transaction is unprecedented, as was the significant interest in the portfolio among major companies around the world,” said George A. Riedel, chief strategy officer of Nortel. Nortel delayed the auction once last month because of what it called “significant interest,” and started the sale on Monday. Nortel said it hoped to close the transaction in the third quarter. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Nortel press release RIM press release In April, Google made a stalking-horse bid of $900 million for the patents, some of which are related to the wireless technology known as long-term evolution. Networks based on that technology, considered crucial to the future of telecommunications, are created to carry large amounts of data like streamed video to mobile devices. The Google offer was interpreted as a defensive move. The search giant was seeking intellectual property rights to shield itself from lawsuits as it moves deeper into the mobile business with its Android software. Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, wrote at the time of the bid that it was supposed to “create a disincentive for others to sue Google.” “The tech world has recently seen an explosion in patent litigation, often involving low-quality software patents,” Mr. Walker wrote. Now, thousands of crucial patents will be in the hands of rivals like Apple and Microsoft, both of which have shown themselves to be much more aggressive in patent litigation than Google. On Friday, Mr. Walker said in an e-mail that the auction’s outcome was “disappointing for anyone who believes that open innovation benefits users and promotes creativity and competition.” The sale announced Thursday will require approval from courts in Canada and the United States, Nortel said. About 2,600 of the patent assets are American. A joint hearing has been scheduled for July 11. Nortel, based in Mississauga, Ontario, was once a flagship Canadian company but filed for bankruptcy in 2009 after losing nearly $6 billion in 2008. Since then, it has sold its wireless equipment business for $1.13 billion to the Swedish company Ericsson, which walked away with $340 million worth of patents from the auction on Thursday. More recently, Ericsson bought Telcordia, an American telecom network equipment maker, for $1.15 billion. In 2009, Nortel sold another unit dealing with enterprise solutions for $475 million to Avaya, a former AT&amp;T unit that is now owned by private equity and which filed for an initial public offering of stock last month. RIM, Canada’s most prominent technology company since Nortel collapsed, said in a separate statement that it had paid about $770 million for patents at the auction. The sale of patents raised more than the rest of Nortel’s disposals combined. The company said it did not anticipate that holders of its common shares or preferred stock would benefit from the bankruptcy process. Creditor protection proceedings “will result in the cancellation of these equity interests,” Nortel said. Nortel was advised by Lazard. Nortel’s creditors’ committee, which includes the Bank of New York Mellon and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, hired Jefferies as its financial adviser for the auction, which saw the patent assets reap five times the stalking-horse bid.</text></article>

But however easy the links are to make, many are also facile. The most significant resemblance between the two situations may be their outcomes.Critics argue Google is using its dominance in one area to muscle unfairly into others, as Microsoft did. There’s even some similar nerdish arrogance. Microsoft’s founder, Bill Gates, was famously testy about being deposed by the powers that be. Google’s chief executive, Larry Page, recently declined a request by a Senate subcommittee to testify. Yet the prosecution’s case against Microsoft was relatively simple. Windows held about 95 percent of the market for PC operating systems in the late 1990s. Microsoft forced computer makers to use its Internet browser if they wanted to sell machines running Windows. Customers were constrained. Downloading a rival browser wasn’t easy, and switching to a machine not running Windows was painful. In essence, Microsoft had a true monopoly, abused its position and government intervention was the only immediate cure. Google’s situation is more complex. The firm claims only about two-thirds of the search market in the United States. Rivals also accuse Google of putting its services first. For example, its own maps might turn up in search results. But customers can easily use other search engines or type in a Web site address directly, and search doesn’t appear to be a utility in need of regulation. Smartphones could make a more compelling study. More than a third are now powered by Google’s Android, according to comScore, and the number is growing quickly. Applications are a potential way to lock in consumers. Withholding the system’s latest version from handset makers that favor a rival’s services could be a potent stick for Google to wield. Though the Microsoft case was simpler, it still took more than a decade to resolve. And the most important result was the company pledging restraint. The Google inquiry could uncover most anything, but for now the tortuous path and the end result are starting to seem like the real kinship with Microsoft. Space for Investors Rupert Murdoch’s experience with MySpace should inspire him to focus on his space. Mercifully for shareholders, the media mogul’s failed six-year experiment in social networking ended on Wednesday, with the News Corporation’s sale of the Web site for $35 million, a fraction of its original price. The deal serves as a pointed reminder of the News Corporation’s poor uses of capital of late. Big TV is where the company’s resources are best allocated. Mr. Murdoch’s tabloid sensibilities mean he knows a hot story when he sees one. Investing $580 million in MySpace in 2005, when Facebook was still in its infancy, looks outrageous only in hindsight. But not long after the News Corporation took control, the site began its rapid descent. Multiple high-profile bosses couldn’t set a sensible strategic direction for MySpace as Facebook crushed its rival. Mr. Murdoch’s expensive attempt to jump on the iPad bandwagon, the much-ballyhooed electronic magazine The Daily, so far looks like a dud, too. Mr. Murdoch’s zeal for newspapers hasn’t helped either. He paid $5 billion in 2007 for Dow Jones, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal, only to write it down to roughly $3 billion about a year later. Worse, Mr. Murdoch surrendered his stake in the satellite TV operator DirecTV in 2006 in exchange for the stake in the News Corporation owned by the cable mogul John Malone, who might have obstructed his pursuit of Dow Jones. Though the News Corporation booked nearly a $5 billion gain on DirecTV, the company’s shares have more than tripled in the last five years, while the News Corporation’s shed 13 percent. DirecTV was an especially big loss because its business is central to what the News Corporation does best. Its British and Italian satellite TV businesses have performed well. And with rare exceptions like the Fox Business Network, Mr. Murdoch has proved a master at producing television programming in the United States. “American Idol” has been a hit for nearly a decade, and the Fox News Channel remains a huge money-spinner. But even at 80, Mr. Murdoch is chasing something new. He has hired the former head of the New York City public school system to start up an education division, so it’s not obvious that he has learned the lessons of misplaced endeavors like MySpace.

Mr. Conophy, the chief information officer of the InterContinental Hotels Group, decided earlier this year to begin moving nearly all the company’s 25,000 office workers off Microsoft’s e-mail and Office productivity applications and onto Google’s Web-based alternatives. About 6,000 employees in the hotel management company have converted so far, Mr. Conophy says, and things are going well. The savings, he estimates, will add up to millions of dollars a year. And Google’s online offerings, he said, have improved steadily since it entered the business market four years ago. “We could do this now because the Google cloud apps are ready for prime time,” Mr. Conophy said. Halting such defections is a top priority at Microsoft. Its response arrives Tuesday, when the company begins selling Office 365, a cloud-based version of Microsoft’s e-mail, whiteboard collaboration software and word processing, spreadsheet and presentation programs. The marketing campaign will begin with a presentation in New York by Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer. Like Google Apps, the new service is run in the cloud — remotely in data centers — and users tap in from an Internet-connected browser on a personal computer, tablet or smartphone. Microsoft’s long-awaited move, analysts say, is a studiously crafted bet, including various offerings at different prices. They are not sure whether it represents wishful thinking or a workable strategy. Microsoft’s plan is to embrace the demand for cloud-based tools for office workers, which promise to be less costly for companies than conventional software, and yet avoid cannibalizing a business that is its biggest single money-maker. “If Microsoft stumbles, it really opens the door to Google,” said Matt Cain, an analyst for Gartner. “It’s a tremendous long-term threat to Microsoft and its Office franchise.” The Microsoft unit that includes the Office family of products is a $20 billion-a-year business with pretax profit margins of 60 percent. The business is even larger than the company’s other big profit engine, the Windows PC operating system. Google portrays the arrival of Office 365 as an endorsement, if not a capitulation. “This is a recognition that our business is for real,” said David Girouard, president of Google’s enterprise division. “We’ve really helped move the needle in the marketplace.” The company now claims more than 30 million active users of Google Apps, its collection of online office productivity and communications programs. But about 12 million of those users are university staff and students, who typically get free access to the apps. The standard charge for business and government customers is $50 per user a year. Google will not disclose how many customers pay that fee. It does say it is gaining momentum. Just this month, Google announced a series of large converts. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency that conducts climate and ocean studies, with 25,000 employees, is adopting Google Apps. Others include the State of Wyoming, with 10,000 workers, and the McClatchy Group, a publishing chain, with 8,500 workers. The subscription renewal rates to Google Apps, Mr. Girouard said, are higher than 90 percent and for larger companies the rate is nearly 100 percent. There are other cloud-based business e-mail, productivity and collaboration tools including entries from Zoho, Zimbra from VMware, Lotus Live from I.B.M. and Chatter from Salesforce.com. Yet Google, analysts say, is the main rival that Microsoft has in mind with Office 365. “There’s no doubt that the increasing popularity of Google Apps has forced Microsoft’s hand,” said Melissa Webster, an analyst at IDC. “But Microsoft is really embracing the cloud now. This is the other shoe dropping.” At $50 a year, Google’s pricing seems far more appealing than the standard price for the Office PC software, from $200 to about $400, depending on features. Office 365 prices are from $2 per user a month to $27 per user a month. The $2-a-month service is just e-mail and is intended for companies that want to extend communications to employees currently not served, like factory workers. The $27-a-month offering is for all the online features, including Web conferencing and digital whiteboards for team projects, and a license to the most powerful version of the Office personal computer software. A $6-a-month offering is aimed at extending Microsoft’s e-mail server services and collaboration tools, like SharePoint, to small businesses. These small businesses typically have the Office PC software, but not the related software, analysts say. With cloud-based versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint, plus several new communications and collaboration tools, that offering could be quite appealing, analysts say. The price, at $72 a year, is somewhat above Google’s, but it carries the Microsoft name and familiarity. “It could be a lot of net new business, and stable recurring revenue, if Microsoft can pull it off,” Ms. Webster said.People like Tom Conophy are stirring anxiety — and action — in Microsoft’s executive offices these days.

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/business/media/21xbox.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Xbox Will Introduce Interactive Ads to Games<date>Published: June 20, 2011</date><text>Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video.On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to announce a new suite of advertising tools, called NUads, short for natural user-interface ads, that will let users interact with advertising on the console dashboard or embedded in games and other video content. The ads use the same voice and motion control developed for the company’s Kinect game console, which it introduced in time for the 2010 holiday season. The new ads are intended to help advertisers keep the attention of Xbox users in a way that traditional television advertising does not. “When you have highly interactive people and a passive medium, they are interacting with their phone or their laptop while watching TV,” said Mark Kroese, the general manager of the advertising business group at Microsoft. The new ads, Mr. Kroese said, “create a natural way for the user to engage with the TV.” At least one advertising agency seems to agree. “The new ad units really epitomized the level of engagement that everyone is working towards,” said John M. Lisko, the executive communications director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Los Angeles, part of the Publicis Groupe. Mr. Lisko said the agency had successfully advertised on the Xbox console in the past and was “absolutely considering” the new capabilities. “You can text, you can tweet, you can vote,” he said. “That’s phenomenal.” Using voice commands, gamers will be able to send messages about an ad to a social networking site like Twitter by saying “Xbox Tweet.” Advertisers who want to send more information about a product or promotion associated with a campaign can prompt Xbox users to say “Xbox More,” which will send users an e-mail with the information they wanted. For advertising tied to events like television shows, advertisers can prompt a user to say “Xbox Schedule” and the system will send a text message reminder to the user’s mobile phone. Similarly, advertisers can prompt users to say “Xbox Near Me” and a map to the nearest retailer will be sent to their mobile phone. Finally, advertisers can prompt users to vote on a topic by asking the user to wave their hand in front of the console and select their favorite pizza topping, superhero or clothing brand. The new advertising options will be presented on Tuesday to advertisers at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, an annual conference for advertisers and marketers. Consumers will begin to see the new features in the spring of 2012. The new ads will be simple for marketers to deploy since they can use the same commercials they would use on television. “What we’re seeing now is a technology environment where marketers can deliver more sophisticated ads and they don’t have some of the hurdles that in-game marketers and in-game publishers had,” said Paul Verna, a senior analyst at eMarketer. “It’s a level of interactivity that suggests more possibilities than we’ve seen up until now.”Users of Microsoft’s popular Xbox Kinect gaming console will soon be able to use voice and motion commands to interact with advertisements while they are playing their favorite game or watching a video.</text></article>

Consumer technologies get all the attention these days, but the company has quietly thrived by selling to corporations and governments. Profits are strong, its portfolio of products and services looks robust, and its shares are near a record high. I.B.M.’s stock-market value passed Google’s earlier this year. Not bad for a corporate centenarian.Yet, not so long ago, I.B.M.’s corporate survival was at stake. In the early 1990s, it nearly ran out of money. Its mainframe business was reeling under pressure from the lower-cost technology of personal computing. New leadership was brought in, and thousands of workers were laid off. It was part of the company’s painful journey to what might be called “post-monopoly prosperity” — that is, a new path to corporate success once a dominant product is no longer the turbocharged engine of growth and profit it once was. “I.B.M. faced the challenge that all great companies do sooner or later — they dominate, they lose it, and then they re-create themselves or not,” observes George F. Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research. I.B.M. met the challenge, moved beyond the mainframe and built a business increasingly based on software and services. So as it celebrates a milestone, the company holds lessons for others. Evolving beyond past success is a daunting task for companies in all industries. But that problem is magnified in the technology arena, where companies can quickly rise to rule a market, seemingly invincible, until a shift in the technological landscape opens the door to a new generation of corporate dynamos. That is certainly the test that Microsoft is struggling with today, as it seeks growth beyond its lucrative stronghold in personal computer software. If they are to prosper for the long haul, Google and Apple, too, must reach beyond their dominant businesses. Each of these companies, in its way, is trying. So, then, what broader insights are to be drawn from the I.B.M. experience? One central message, according to industry experts, is this: Don’t walk away from your past. Build on it. The crucial building blocks, they say, are skills, technology and marketing assets that can be transferred or modified to pursue new opportunities. Those are a company’s core assets, they say, far more so than any particular product or service. In I.B.M.’s case, the prime assets included strong, long-term customer relationships, deep scientific and research capabilities and an unmatched breadth of technical skills in hardware, software and services. Though once a mainframe company, I.B.M. has recast itself as the supplier that can best manage and stitch together diverse technologies in modern data centers. Mainframes still have a role, and I.B.M. has invested heavily in them — $5 billion in mainframe research in the last decade — so that different kinds of software can run on them and new kinds of processors can plug into them. But it is the technology surrounding the mainframe that really pays off for I.B.M. today. Mainframe hardware alone accounts for less than 4 percent of its revenue. But when the software, storage and services contracts linked to mainframe computers are included, the figure rises to 25 percent — and as much as 45 percent of operating profit, estimates A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. I.B.M. has redirected its research labs and sales force to focus on services and software, retraining thousands of people, and supplementing in-house programs with acquisitions. In big, complex services contracts, from running smart-grid projects for utilities to traffic-management systems for cities, I.B.M. acts as a high-tech general contractor whose expertise spans research, software, hardware and services. These so-called Smarter Planet projects build on its legacy of broad technical skills and deep knowledge in fields like energy, transportation and health care. AT the moment, Microsoft is the tech company that most squarely confronts the post-monopoly predicament, as I.B.M. once did. Some of the similarities are striking, right down to the long-running federal antitrust suits that both companies endured. But unlike I.B.M. in the early 1990s, Microsoft is not a company in crisis. It is growing steadily and remains immensely profitable. It has nurtured new businesses beyond its lucrative stronghold in personal computer software: the Windows operating system and its Office programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations. Microsoft has invested for nearly two decades to build up business database software and server operating systems that run larger data-serving computers in data centers. An I.B.M. executive once declared that Microsoft’s attempt to move into data center computing would be its “Vietnam,” a humbling setback. And many analysts predicted that Microsoft would be thwarted in data centers by competition from Linux, the free operating system. 1 2 Next Page »AS it turned 100 last week, I.B.M. was looking remarkably spry.

They’re abused in more than 90 percent of attacks meant to hit random Internet users (versus more targeted strikes), according to Kaspersky Labs. And more than half of those attacks exploit flaws in browser software and seek to install dangerous malware on computers. Why all the attention? Because browsers are an easy target. Computer users perennially ignore update reminders and run old versions with well-known security holes. They also use ancient browser plug-ins, which aren’t as easy to update and are often rich with known vulnerabilities. As a result, a whopping 80 percent of computers run outdated, unsecure browsers or plug-ins, according to Qualys, a firm that helps companies manage software vulnerabilities. Security &amp; Privacy Keeping tabs on online threats. To say we make ourselves low-hanging and abundant fruit for hackers is an understatement. But with the help of a new free tool for consumers from Qualys called BrowserCheck, you can make yourself significantly less available for the picking with relative ease. BrowserCheck works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux machines and will identify weak spots in the Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera browsers, and it will help you fix them. It can be especially useful for staying on top of oft-abused plug-ins. I first used the service in April on my Mac to check my Safari and Firefox browsers. It showed that Safari was one version out of date — not a surprise, since Apple had just released an update that included a fix related to the Comodo imbroglio. To my shame, I had been hitting “Not Now” on an Apple update alert for a couple of days. It also found that my Adobe Flash software was also a bit old. I had the same issues with Firefox, along with one item with a non-security-related update available. I tackled Flash first, since Adobe products have become favorite targets of attackers in the last couple of years (Sun’s Java has been popular recently). From the Safari report, I hit the “Fix It” button, which took me to the relevant Adobe page for updating Flash Player, where I downloaded the latest version. Restarting my browsers and running scans again showed that Flash was now up-to-date for both my Safari and Firefox browsers. I ran BrowserCheck more recently and it again alerted me to unsecure Adobe software, suggesting that using the periodically is a good idea even for people who are generally good about downloading most updates. I also updated Firefox, though thanks to Firefox’s automatic updating, I didn’t have significant problems there. Firefox will automatically check for updates and download minor ones in the background whenever you restart your browser. If it has waited more than 24 hours, it will show a pop-up message asking you to restart Firefox and install the update. Mozilla says Firefox 4 will also help you keep add-ons up-to-date, but not plug-ins like Adobe Flash. Users can go here to check and update plug-ins. I also used BrowserCheck to update Safari, though that was unnecessary. I still had to download the Apple update I had postponed to get some non-Safari fixes. This kind of maintenance work is vital for everyone’s safe surfing today, but especially so for Windows users, who are attacked the most by far. Qualys’ tool can help them, too — particularly with those pesky plug-ins. Easy and painless updates for Windows and other Microsoft software, including Internet Explorer, are available through Microsoft’s automatic Windows Update service. Go to the Microsoft Update Web site to turn on the free service or see if it’s already activated. Then Microsoft updates can literally happen in your sleep.</text></article>

Can I make my Windows 7 laptop just shut down all the way instead of going to sleep when I close the lid? A. Windows 7 allows you to select one of several outcomes when you close up your laptop, including having the system shut down entirely. Other actions include sleep, hibernate or just doing nothing. (The sleep and hibernate functions may not be available on all computers based on video card capabilities and other hardware settings; Microsoft has a fuller explanation, as well as a description of the difference between sleep and hibernate on its site.) To get to the settings, go to the Start menu, type in “power options” in the search box and click on “Change what closing the lid does.” You can also get there the long way by going to the Start menu to Control Panel, clicking on Hardware and Sound, clicking on Power Options and then clicking on “Change what closing the lid does” on the left side if the window. Once the settings box appears on screen, use the drop-down menus next to “When I close the lid:” to select “Shut down.” You can choose different actions based on whether the laptop is running off its battery power or plugged into an electrical outlet.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/opinion/11sat4.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Remember Microsoft?<date>Published: June 10, 2011</date><text>Steven Ballmer is going through a rough patch. Not only did the influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn call for him to step down from the top job at Microsoft, “to give someone else a chance,” Microsoft stock jumped right after he said it. Investors’ frustration is not hard to understand. Over the last 10 years, Microsoft’s stock price has flat-lined as those of rivals Apple and Google soared. The biggest American company by market capitalization in the late 1990s, it was surpassed by Apple last year. Last month, I.B.M. briefly overtook it for the first time in 15 years. This is probably little consolation, but Mr. Ballmer’s plight is an example of one of the core strengths of American capitalism: the ease with which new technologies emerge to challenge the most entrenched colossus. Sure, Microsoft missed a few boats. It misunderstood the importance of Internet search. It’s missing the smartphone and tablet revolution. But figuring out the next big thing is not easy. Over the last 25 years the number of industrial companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 has fallen by half. Technology upends companies in different ways. It allows new firms to deliver better products and services in a more efficient way; it also creates new goods and services for consumers to want. Eastman Kodak, the fifth-biggest company in the S.&amp; P. 500 in 1975, was almost destroyed by digital cameras and is no longer in the index. General Motors, fifth biggest in 1985, was hobbled by rivals that could make more fuel efficient cars. Microsoft still rules the PC desktop. But that will matter less and less as users migrate to tablets and more computing takes place in “the cloud.” There is another lesson in Microsoft’s long slide. It is about how far corporate behemoths will go to stop technology that threatens their dominance. Ten years ago, Microsoft tried to use its virtual monopoly of the operating system to strangle potential rivals and their new technologies. Fortunately, it failed. But the new rising behemoths will likely try similar tactics on whatever new gizmo challenges them.Steven Ballmer is going through a rough patch. Not only did the influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn call for him to step down from the top job at Microsoft, “to give someone else a chance,” Microsoft stock jumped right after he said it. Investors’ frustration is not hard to understand. Over the last 10 years, Microsoft’s stock price has flat-lined as those of rivals Apple and Google soared. The biggest American company by market capitalization in the late 1990s, it was surpassed by Apple last year. Last month, I.B.M. briefly overtook it for the first time in 15 years. This is probably little consolation, but Mr. Ballmer’s plight is an example of one of the core strengths of American capitalism: the ease with which new technologies emerge to challenge the most entrenched colossus. Sure, Microsoft missed a few boats. It misunderstood the importance of Internet search. It’s missing the smartphone and tablet revolution. But figuring out the next big thing is not easy. Over the last 25 years the number of industrial companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 has fallen by half. Technology upends companies in different ways. It allows new firms to deliver better products and services in a more efficient way; it also creates new goods and services for consumers to want.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/technology/10nokia.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Nokia’s Top Technology Officer Departs, Maybe for Good<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>The Finnish cellphone maker Nokia said on Thursday that its chief technology officer had taken a leave of absence and would be temporarily replaced by the head of the company’s research center.News of the departure of Richard L. Green, an American who joined Nokia last year from Sun Microsystems, came as Standard &amp; Poor’s cut Nokia’s long-term credit rating for the second time this year. Nokia said Mr. Green had taken a leave “to attend to a personal matter.” Paivyt Tallqvist, head of media relations at the company, based in Espoo, Finland, said there was “no specific timeline” for his return. In his absence, Mr. Green will be replaced by Henry Tirri, head of the Nokia Research Center, Ms. Tallqvist said, adding that the change would have “no impact on our product strategy or our product launches.” Earlier, however, a Finnish newspaper reported that Mr. Green was unlikely to return because of disagreements over strategy. Without citing its sources, the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper reported that Mr. Green was unhappy with management decisions, including abandoning plans to introduce devices based on the MeeGo smartphone operating system that had been under development with the chip maker Intel. The appointment of Mr. Tirri is seen by some analysts as a return to basics, and a focus on chips, motherboards and transmission technology. He has been at the company since 2004 and is also a professor of computer engineering at the Helsinki University of Technology. His résumé highlights a host of publications on subjects including information modeling, neural networks and data mining. Nokia remains the biggest producer of cellphones globally, but its market share has been sliding. At the premium end, it has been losing ground to the Apple iPhone, the BlackBerry smartphones from Research in Motion and devices using Google’s Android software. At the low end, phones from companies like ZTE of China and Micromax of India have been gaining ground, as have no-brand manufacturers — generally small Chinese companies — that have been gaining sales in India, China, Africa, Latin America and Russia. At the end of last month, Nokia said that mobile phone sales in the second quarter would be “substantially” below a previous forecast of 6.1 billion euros to 6.6 billion euros ($8.9 billion to $9.6 billion). The company attributed the lower sales to difficult conditions in China and Europe and lower average selling prices and volumes than expected. Stephen A. Elop, the former Microsoft executive who became Nokia’s chief executive in September, is hoping to recover lost ground by switching Nokia phones to Microsoft’s Windows Phone software, abandoning Nokia’s own Symbian platform. That switch is expected to take place at the end of this year or early next year. The alliance with Microsoft was announced in February and has been seen by some analysts as a possible precursor to a more extensive relationship between the two companies. The company’s shares were little changed Thursday afternoon at 4.30 euros ($6.29) in Helsinki, Finland. Since the beginning of this year, the stock has plunged 44.6 percent. On Thursday, Standard &amp; Poor’s cut Nokia’s rating by one notch, to BBB+; three further downgrades would classify the company’s debt as below investment grade, or junk. Another agency, Fitch Ratings, downgraded the group this week to BBB-, just one level above noninvestment grade. As it tries to lift sales, Nokia also has been trying to trim costs. It said in April that it would eliminate 12 percent of its global work force, or 7,000 jobs, to help save 1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) by the end of 2012. In a leaked memorandum this year, Mr. Elop compared the company’s predicament — trying to catch up with Apple and Google — to that of a man standing on a burning oil rig at sea. Nokia’s struggles have made the company vulnerable to a takeover. Potential buyers mentioned recently include Samsung Electronics of Korea, Chinese groups and private equity firms. “I think Nokia will play defensively until the Windows phone ramps up, and then it will push to find a slot in the business end of the market, stressing compatibility with personal computers,” said Ilkka Rauvola, an analyst at Danske Markets in Helsinki. Mr. Green reported directly to the chief executive. Previously he was executive vice president for the software division of Sun Microsystems, where he had broad responsibility for Sun’s software business, including services, sales, product and business strategy, and product development. Mr. Green could not be reached for comment.The Finnish cellphone maker Nokia said on Thursday that its chief technology officer had taken a leave of absence and would be temporarily replaced by the head of the company’s research center.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/business/10bizcourt.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Microsoft Loses Appeal in i4i Patent Case<date>Published: June 9, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously upheld a $290 million award against Microsoft in a patent dispute. The case was brought by a Canadian software company, i4i Limited Partnership, which said a version of Microsoft Word had infringed its patented method for editing documents.At the trial, the jury rejected Microsoft’s argument that the patent was invalid. Before the Supreme Court, Microsoft said the trial court had subjected its invalidity defense to an overly demanding standard. Microsoft had been required to prove its defense by clear and convincing evidence, and the company said it should have only needed to meet the more relaxed standard of a preponderance of the evidence. Under that standard, Microsoft would have had to prove only that it was more likely than not that the patent was invalid. The question in the case (Microsoft Corporation v. i4i Limited Partnership, No. 10-290) was what Congress meant on that point in the Patent Act of 1952, which said only that patents are “presumed valid” and that “the burden of establishing invalidity” rests “on the party asserting such invalidity.” Though the law did not expressly specify a standard of proof, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court, said Congress must have codified the general understanding about the appropriate standard, one reflected in a 1934 Supreme Court decision. The presumption that patents were valid, Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo wrote, was “not to be overthrown except by clear and cogent evidence.” The Canadian firm’s patent was for a method of editing computer documents that stored the contents of documents separately from codes for their structure. In 2007, it sued Microsoft, arguing that Microsoft Word had infringed the patent. Microsoft said the patent was invalid under a provision of the patent laws that bars protection for inventions that had been on sale in the United States for more than a year before the patent application was filed. The Canadian firm had sold another software program more than a year before it submitted its application, and the patent examiner had not considered whether the older program contained the main innovation in the later one before issuing the patent. Though the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the more lenient preponderance standard should apply across the board in invalidity challenges, it was more sympathetic to Microsoft’s fallback position. The company argued that the lower standard should at least apply where the factual question in dispute had not been considered before the patent was issued. Here the court sketched out a roadmap for future defendants seeking to assert an invalidity defense in similar circumstances. Though courts should continue to require “clear and convincing” evidence of invalidity in name, Justice Sotomayor wrote, the decision to issue a patent “may lose significant force” where the patent office “did not have all material facts before it.” That means, she continued, that “the challenger’s burden to persuade the jury of its invalidity defense by clear and convincing evidence may be easier to sustain.” Jury instructions, Justice Sotomayor said, may take account of these points. In a concurrence, Justice Stephen G. Breyer suggested additional limitations. The requirement of clear and convincing proof, he wrote, applies only to factual questions typically decided by juries, such as when a product was first sold. Legal questions decided by judges, on the other hand, are not subject to the standard. Among such legal questions, he wrote, are whether inventions are novel or obvious. Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined Justice Breyer’s concurrence. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. did not participate in the case. In a financial disclosure form issued last month, the chief justice reported that his family owned $100,000 to $250,000 in Microsoft shares last year.WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously upheld a $290 million award against Microsoft in a patent dispute.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/media/09adco.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Searching for a ‘Glee’ Star, With Help From Bing<date>Published: June 8, 2011</date><text>A NEW reality competition series that will search for someone to join the cast of the hit show “Glee” is teaming up with a brand that, appropriately enough, helps with searches.Not real-world searches for humans, but the metaphor is certainly there. Bing, the search engine from Microsoft, is becoming a major sponsor of the series, “The Glee Project,” that is to make its debut on Sunday on the Oxygen cable channel. The series, scheduled to run through Aug. 21, will follow 12 contestants competing to win a priceless prize: a guest role on seven episodes of the third season of “Glee,” starting in the fall on Fox Broadcasting. (Given that one network is presenting a show about a show on another, perhaps Oxygen ought to have titled its series “The ‘Glee’ Project.”) Bing’s involvement with “The Glee Project” goes beyond running commercials during the 10 episodes of the show. For instance, Bing will be the title sponsor of an online effort to select from among the contestants a “fan favorite,” who will win prizes like a performance to be streamed on the Oxygen Web site, at oxygen.com/fanfavorite. The sponsorship is another example of a growing trend as advertisers seek to become intrinsic elements of entertainment programming, just as in the “Brought to you by” days of early television and the golden age of radio. The goal is for consumers to perceive brands as making it easier to enjoy their favorite shows rather than as the blankety-blanks that keep interrupting their favorite shows. “We’re in a space where we want to be innovative, try new things,” said Eric Hadley, general manager for Bing marketing at Microsoft. As with anything new, there is no guarantee that viewers of “The Glee Project” will start to use Bing for their online searches rather than, say, Brand G — Google. “You have to make a little bit of a bet,” Mr. Hadley said, that “Bing can bring value” to the consumer experience with the series, both on television and on Web sites like oxygen.com and thegleeproject.com. “Bing has been doing a lot of stuff like this” to reach its target audience, Mr. Hadley said, of consumers ages 16 to 34 who are devotees of popular culture. The brand has also advertised during “Glee” on Fox, he added, including the premiere last month of a commercial that is part of a new campaign promoting a Bing partnership with Facebook. And a principal cast member of “Glee,” Matthew Morrison, is appearing in a two-minute video clip on bing.com, talking about how “friends matter” in areas like career choices. Bing is also advertising during reruns of “Glee” that are being shown by Oxygen in addition to its involvement in “The Glee Project.” It was the channel’s decision to buy rights to those reruns that led to the discussions with “Glee” executives to develop a reality series based on a fictional series. • “This isn’t a singing competition or a dancing competition or an acting competition,” said Michael Davies, an executive producer of “The Glee Project” who was the executive producer of shows like “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.” Rather, Mr. Davies said, the idea of the series is to find “someone to inspire Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk to write for them.” The reference was to two of the creators of “Glee”; Mr. Murphy is also an executive producer of “The Glee Project.” Mr. Davies acknowledged how “creatively challenging” it was to “make a nonfiction show as good as ‘Glee’ without trying to be ‘Glee.’ ” He said he believed that “the ridiculously amazing prize” of a role on a successful show and the caliber of the contestants would appeal to viewers “who don’t watch ‘Glee’ or who haven’t watched ‘Glee’ ” along with the ardent fans of the Fox series, known as Gleeks. The contestants will be the subject of a casting special, “The Glee Project: The Final 12,” that Oxygen is to run on Sunday before the first episode of “The Glee Project.” A video clip of them singing “Firework,” a Katy Perry song that was sung on “Glee,” has already been watched more than 496,000 times on YouTube. “The thing I love about the Bing sponsorship is that it’s giving the fans a voice,” said Jason Klarman, president at Oxygen Media, part of the NBC Universal unit of Comcast. “The idea of a ‘fan favorite’ makes sense because your favorite might not get the job on ‘Glee,’ ” Mr. Klarman said. “It’s another level of engagement, important for viewers’ experience with the show.” Mr. Klarman and Mr. Hadley said there were no plans for Bing to be integrated into episodes of “The Glee Project” the way that brands like Coca-Cola are integrated into episodes of reality competition series like “American Idol.” • “I think it would be distracting,” Mr. Klarman said, adding, “I’m not saying it wouldn’t happen for Season 2.” Asked if that meant Oxygen was already considering a renewal, he replied, laughing, “Can you call me on Monday?” (Some initial reviews have been positive, including an A minus from Entertainment Weekly.) Mr. Hadley said the idea for Bing’s sponsorship came from the brand’s media agency, Universal McCann, part of the Mediabrands unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. He declined to discuss the budget. Microsoft spent $108.1 million on ads in major media to introduce Bing in 2009, the Kantar Media unit of WPP reported, and $118.4 million last year. Other sponsors of “The Glee Project” and the “Glee” reruns on Oxygen include another Microsoft brand, Kinect, and Verizon. Oxygen is promoting “The Glee Project” with television and print ads as well as on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

It’s been a tough couple of months for Sony. The company’s PlayStation Network was breached by hackers in late April and now several other units of the company have suffered broad security breaches. In the last week alone, half a dozen Sony Web sites and servers, including some in the United States and Brazil, have been breached. On Monday a group of hackers calling themselves LulzSec posted proprietary Sony source code on file-sharing Web sites. Although the members of LulzSec have gone after other organizations in the past, including Fox.com and PBS.org, the attacks against Sony have been unrelenting. “These attacks are a combination of Sony’s lax security and a number of groups being very vigilant about breaking in to show how powerful they can be,” explained Frank Kenney, vice president of global security at Ipswitch, a company used to securely transfer files online. “What Sony has to do is re-examine their entire security system including the type of code they are using and the type of servers; they have to acknowledge that their brand is at stake.” Mr. Kenney said that no server was impervious to hackers, but a company like Sony, with millions of credit cards and users’ personal information on file, had a responsibility to ensure protection “equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security‘s servers is in place.” He said that the fact that dozens of Sony Web sites and servers had been breached indicated it was clearly a companywide problem. “Any type of environment can be breached, but Sony has to come up with a plan that not only protects their infrastructure, but also convinces their customers that their credit cards and personal information is safe,” Mr. Kenney said. In an interview in New York last month, Howard Stringer, Sony’s chief executive, said the company was working with a number of outside security companies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent further attacks. But Sony is definitely up against some untenable foes in this fight. LulzSec doesn’t show any signs of easing its attacks on Sony, and the group is not deterred by the F.B.I., even taking up a fight with some of the organization’s affiliate groups. LulzSec also said in a Twitter message on Monday that it was receiving thousands of dollars in donations to continue its attacks on Sony. Ron Gula, chief executive of Tenable Network Security, an enterprise security company, said the problems at Sony likely went back years when the company first built its infrastructure. “A lot of times these problems are more holistic, and that’s usually evidence by the fact that Sony has been attacked multiple times,” he said. Mr. Gula said Sony would be unable to stop the attacks overnight and that it could take years for the company to get sufficient security in place to protect all its servers, databases and Web sites. “Microsoft used to be the laughing stock of security and now they are now the shining example of good security,” said Mr. Gula. “It’s going to take a while for Sony to fix this, I think this will take years.”</text></article>

June 7, 1:07 p.m. | Updated with the letters In its quest to win approval of its $39 billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, AT&amp;T just got a lot of help from its friends. Eight technology giants, including Facebook and Microsoft, and 10 venture capital firms, filed letters supporting the acquisition late on Monday. The letters, filed with the Federal Communications Commission, lent their support to AT&amp;T’s argument that the T-Mobile deal will help the company extend its next-generation data network across the country, helping to meet the growing need for wireless broadband services. “Many policy-related efforts will not be able to quickly address near-term capacity needs,” the Microsoft-led group wrote in its letter. “The F.C.C. must seriously weigh the benefits of this merger and approve it.” The letters are the latest salvo in the fight over AT&amp;T’s effort to become the nation’s biggest cellphone service provider. It is a fight that has pitted AT&amp;T against consumer groups and smaller rivals like Sprint Nextel. Sprint and other service providers have argued strenuously that the deal would revive the “Ma Bell” situation of old, leaving AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless in a duopoly that controls most cellphone customers. Such a combination could lead to higher prices and reduced service, they say. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The letters AT&amp;T's Deal for T-Mobile Sprint, the nation’s third-biggest carrier behind Verizon Wireless and AT&amp;T, has been the most outspoken opponent of the deal. “I am here because Sprint believes in competition, which goes hand in hand with innovation,” the company’s chief executive, Daniel Hesse, testified at a Senate hearing last month. Both sides have been racing to enlist as many prominent supporters as possible. Sprint has found common cause with consumer groups, while AT&amp;T has lined up support from unions, particularly the Communications Workers of America. And both sides have sought political leaders to speak out. The outpouring of support is taking place within the confines of reviews by the F.C.C. and the Justice Department, which are aimed at determining if the deal is in the public’s interest and whether it harms competition. The process may take about a year. The deadline to file supporting comments for the deal is Friday, while the deadline to file opposing comments was last week. The letters filed Monday provide solid support for the deal from Silicon Valley. Other companies that have signed on are Yahoo, Oracle and the BlackBerry’s maker Research in Motion. The venture capital firms include Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Sequoia Partners. As smartphones and tablets proliferate, so too have apps like one by Facebook that draw in ever-rising amounts of data. Monday’s letters cite AT&amp;T’s contention that the T-Mobile deal will allow the carrier to expand its nascent 4G network to cover 97 percent of the country and an additional 55 million Americans. “The access aspect of this is so, so important,” Fred Humphries, Microsoft’s vice president for United States government affairs, said by telephone. “We quickly came to the conclusion that this is a good merger.” Promod Haque, a managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, said in a telephone interview that constraints on network capacity were harming new mobile applications and offerings. “The lack of adequate spectrum is killing the quality of users’ experience,” he said. “Customers say, ‘I can’t even get a phone call and can’t get adequate reception. So you want me to use this new service?’ ” Allowing AT&amp;T to consolidate its network spectrum with T-Mobile’s is easier and more cost-effective than alternatives, Mr. Haque added. Microsoft approached “a select few” technology companies to support the deal, mostly those whose products would obviously also benefit from wider data pipelines, and received quick and positive replies, Mr. Humphries said. The software giant also contacted several trade associations to which it belongs, letting them know of the company’s position. While Microsoft and Research in Motion have signed the letter, other notable smartphone players whose offerings consume large amounts of data, like Apple, have not. Some of the signers said that while they had considered Sprint’s arguments that the deal would harm both competition and innovation, they disagreed. Jon Auerbach, a general partner at Charles River Ventures, pointed to smaller competitors like Leap Wireless and “virtual network operators” like Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile USA as alternatives for consumers. Mr. Auerbach and Mr. Haque also said that AT&amp;T had repeatedly shown a willingness to work with its portfolio companies. They argued that those business relationships showed a willingness by AT&amp;T to eschew existing technology in favor of new developments from unproven players. “When a large provider is willing to take a bet on something that may not have the best balance sheet in the world or a long track record, that goes a long way,” Mr. Auerbach said. “AT&amp;T really wants to know what’s next.” Update: Here are the four letters submitted to the F.C.C. One is from Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle, Yahoo, Research in Motion, Qualcomm, Avaya and Brocade. The second is from Kleiner Perkins. The third is from Sequoia. And the fourth is from a group of eight venture capitalists, including Mr. Haque and Mr. Auerbach.

In Europe, Skype has been the chief litmus test for measuring the openness of mobile networks. The results so far have been resoundingly negative. Most European mobile operators block Skype from their networks or impose arbitrary charges on consumers wanting to use the free service from their cellphones. This runs counter to the concept of net neutrality, which calls for the equal treatment by networks of all Internet traffic, regardless of content. Skype executives have complained loudly to European regulators in Brussels for more than a year, describing the carriers’ policies as a form of economic discrimination. And the regulators have been sympathetic. In April, a month before Microsoft announced the deal with Skype, the European commissioner for telecommunications, Neelie Kroes, warned operators to stop blocking or imposing fees on Skype before the end of the year or risk unspecified sanctions. But assuming that Microsoft acquires Skype — the transaction requires approval by the competition authorities in the United States and Europe — Skype’s interests may take a back seat to Microsoft’s larger goals. Unlike Skype, Microsoft views mobile carriers as customers for mobile phones using the Microsoft operating system, which will soon gain wider carriage as part of new models by Nokia, as well as for Internet protocol television and Lync, a unified communications server. Since the sale was announced May 10, Microsoft and Skype executives have released few details about what role Skype will play under Microsoft. Executives from both companies in Europe declined to speak about Skype’s future role for this article. Experts in the Internet telephone industry were split over what Microsoft would do. Some said they thought Microsoft would redouble Skype’s lobbying efforts in Brussels, providing a strong ally in a fight that could require European operators to open their networks to economic competitors. Michael Dorn, the chief executive of PrimaCom, an Internet operator in Leipzig, Germany, said he expected Microsoft to press the issue of mobile access in Brussels because telephone systems have become increasingly Internet-based, and with Skype, Microsoft would have the opportunity to enter that growing business from a position of strength. “The mobile operators’ biggest problem are their business models,” Mr. Dorn said. “The industry is moving toward data-based calling systems, not the old systems used by mobile operators, who still charge by the minute or the text message.” Thomas Vinje, one the Brussels lawyers who sued Microsoft on behalf of its rivals in a 10-year antitrust case, agreed, saying that he expected Microsoft to press Skype’s demands on operators because it was to Microsoft’s economic advantage. But others said they expected Microsoft to backpedal, either dropping Skype’s critical line of argument in Brussels or striking a deal to share revenue with operators. “Microsoft is an operator-friendly company,” said Rajeev Chand, an analyst at Rutberg, a private bank in San Francisco. “It’s hard to imagine that Skype’s approach to Brussels would not change given the context of Microsoft’s overall business.” Mark Page, an analyst in London at A.T. Kearney, a research firm, said Microsoft had no choice but to try to recoup its purchase price for Skype by trying to get the most from its Internet telephone and video revenue. Mr. Page said Microsoft would not alienate carriers by defending Skype in Brussels. “Operator device procurement tends to be a formalized process several times a year and is all about hardcore economics — attractiveness, availability, cost — rather than being generous to firms on the basis of their lobbying strategy,” Mr. Page said. Jens Weller, the chief executive of Toplink, a seller of high-speed Internet and voice-over-Internet services to businesses in Germany, said Microsoft was already taking a conciliatory approach because it was reliant on the cooperation of operators to make its Windows Phone software function seamlessly and effectively. In mid-May, three weeks after the takeover was announced, Mr. Weller said that he and executives from Deutsche Telekom; Arcor, a German fixed-line operator owned by Vodafone; the German unit of the British provider BT; and Colt Telecom had been invited by Microsoft to a presentation on its software products and its strategy for carriers. 1 2 Next Page »BERLIN — If Microsoft’s $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype, the Internet communications company, goes through, supporters of network neutrality may be losing a standard-bearer.

Michael Dorn, the chief executive of PrimaCom, an Internet operator in Leipzig, Germany, said he expected Microsoft to press the issue of mobile access in Brussels because telephone systems have become increasingly Internet-based, and with Skype, Microsoft would have the opportunity to enter that growing business from a position of strength. “The mobile operators’ biggest problem are their business models,” Mr. Dorn said. “The industry is moving toward data-based calling systems, not the old systems used by mobile operators, who still charge by the minute or the text message.” Thomas Vinje, one the Brussels lawyers who sued Microsoft on behalf of its rivals in a 10-year antitrust case, agreed, saying that he expected Microsoft to press Skype’s demands on operators because it was to Microsoft’s economic advantage. But others said they expected Microsoft to backpedal, either dropping Skype’s critical line of argument in Brussels or striking a deal to share revenue with operators. “Microsoft is an operator-friendly company,” said Rajeev Chand, an analyst at Rutberg, a private bank in San Francisco. “It’s hard to imagine that Skype’s approach to Brussels would not change given the context of Microsoft’s overall business.” Mark Page, an analyst in London at A.T. Kearney, a research firm, said Microsoft had no choice but to try to recoup its purchase price for Skype by trying to get the most from its Internet telephone and video revenue. Mr. Page said Microsoft would not alienate carriers by defending Skype in Brussels. “Operator device procurement tends to be a formalized process several times a year and is all about hardcore economics — attractiveness, availability, cost — rather than being generous to firms on the basis of their lobbying strategy,” Mr. Page said. Jens Weller, the chief executive of Toplink, a seller of high-speed Internet and voice-over-Internet services to businesses in Germany, said Microsoft was already taking a conciliatory approach because it was reliant on the cooperation of operators to make its Windows Phone software function seamlessly and effectively. In mid-May, three weeks after the takeover was announced, Mr. Weller said that he and executives from Deutsche Telekom; Arcor, a German fixed-line operator owned by Vodafone; the German unit of the British provider BT; and Colt Telecom had been invited by Microsoft to a presentation on its software products and its strategy for carriers. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Both Windows 7 and Mac OS X include features that help you focus quickly on the one window you need to find. In Windows 7, just click on part of the title bar at the top of the one window you want to see and give it a “shake” by holding down the mouse button and dragging the cursor back and forth quickly. This action minimizes all other open windows on the screen and sends them to the Taskbar so you can concentrate on the selected window. You can restore the full windows to the desktop by repeating the shake process. (You can also minimize all windows except for the active window by pressing the Windows logo key and the Home key to minimize and restore the windows.) Microsoft has more on using the Shake feature and other desktop-window tricks here. Mac OS X has its own way of handling overlapping piles of windows on the desktop. The built-in Exposé feature, included in the past several versions of the system, shrinks all open windows to thumbnail size with the tap of a key — so you can quickly find and select the one you want to concentrate on. Some newer Mac keyboards use the F3 key to activate Exposé, while others may use the F9 key to toggle the feature on and off. Apple has instructions for using Exposé as well as a video with more Exposé tips and tricks.</text></article>

It’s a fair criticism reignited last week by the hedge fund boss, David Einhorn, who called for the software giant’s chief executive to step down. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Mr. Ballmer will go. Based on total return to shareholders, other long-time company bosses, including Jeff Immelt at General Electric, have fared worse.Mr. Ballmer started as chief executive in January 2000. Over the last decade, Microsoft’s shares have tumbled 30 percent, and they’re up only a hair from their low in 2006. The potted narrative is that Mr. Ballmer has shepherded the “old” operating system and productivity software powerhouse reasonably well but misjudged new developments, wasting billions of dollars chasing Silicon Valley innovators like Apple and Google. It would be a lot to expect a single company to dominate more than one truly world-changing technology. But with that caveat, the critique of Mr. Ballmer is on target even if he’s far from the only chief executive who has struggled to make the most of a franchise. And he at least saw the need to pay dividends a few years earlier than, say, John Chambers at Cisco Systems. On a total return basis including those payouts, Microsoft shareholders are down just over 10 percent over 10 years, and better off by some 14 percent over five, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. That’s far from gratifying, but easily beats Cisco. Looking further across corporate America, Mr. Ballmer stomps Mr. Immelt’s decade-long reign at G.E. and outdoes Rupert Murdoch’s latest five-year stretch at the News Corporation. Richard Fairbank at Capital One Financial and Steven Burd at the grocery chain Safeway, two other corner-office fixtures, also have fallen short of Mr. Ballmer’s performance. This report card, of course, damns Mr. Ballmer with faint praise. His problem isn’t so much shrinking profits as a loss of investor faith in Microsoft, whose price-to-earnings ratio is one of the lowest among big companies in the United States. But Mr. Einhorn probably won’t quickly get his wish for a replacement. Mr. Ballmer and Microsoft’s chairman, Bill Gates, go way back and together own more than 10 percent of the company. That means the current chief executive probably will get more time to try to reinvent Microsoft. Virtual Inflation In the currency wars, the nerds are winning. The value of a Bitcoin, a digital currency trading over peer-to-peer networks, has rocketed more than ninefold in two months to more than $8.60 as of Friday afternoon. The preordained supply and decentralization of Bitcoins have intrigued geeks and paranoid inflationistas alike. But this abstract gold may not survive what looks like a bubble. Bitcoins are actually strings of unique digits, tracked and traded via an online network. People earn new coins by solving network security problems. These coins can then be traded for real currencies on exchanges, or for goods from certain businesses that accept them. The Bitcoins in a user’s virtual wallet are tracked by the secure system and can be transferred only by that user. Moreover — and here’s the hook for the inflation worriers — the currency can’t be printed willy-nilly. The supply of Bitcoins is on a predefined path and will be capped at 21 million. And because there’s no central point in the system, there’s no equivalent of the Federal Reserve to rewrite that policy. The concept of the Bitcoin is no less real than regular paper money or coins. All such currencies have only the value their users accept. Bitcoins do, though, have a couple of disadvantages: they don’t generate income, and since they exist in the digital cloud they’d be less use than paper money in any scenario involving power cuts or lost connectivity. Still, it’s easy, quick and essentially free to transfer Bitcoins. Moreover, transactions are anonymous and the system knows no national borders. That’s helpful for some legitimate users, but also makes the currency a potential worry for law enforcers. The finite supply means the value of Bitcoins should rise as demand increases. But the latest run-up looks decidedly frothy. A flush user can buy Web design help or alpaca socks. But there aren’t many businesses that accept Bitcoins. So it seems likely that enthusiasts and speculators are hoarding them without regard to the value they really represent. A bubble that bursts when the abstract intellectual appeal fades would probably doom the otherwise creative idea.

David Einhorn, the head of the hedge fund Greenlight Capital, called on Wednesday for the removal of Steven A. Ballmer as Microsoft‘s chief executive, telling an investor conference in New York that his leadership was the biggest overhang on the company’s stock price. Mr. Einhorn, a long-time Microsoft shareholder, said at the Ira Sohn Conference that the company had floundered under Mr. Ballmer’s stewardship, missing major opportunities in establishing tablet products to compete with Apple and wasting money on ill-conceived mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Einhorn reviewed comments from Mr. Ballmer in the media that suggested he did not see Apple’s iPhone or iPod devices as a threat. He also told an interviewer that his children were not allowed to use Google or iPods, which Mr. Einhorn suggested meant he was out of touch and “stuck in the past.” Mr. Einhorn also attacked the Microsoft’s efforts to create a search engine as a “sinkhole.” Known for his often controversial statements and ideas, Mr. Einhorn has used previous Ira Sohn Conferences to criticize companies, most famously Lehman Brothers months before the firm filed for bankruptcy. On Wednesday, he began his presentation with some humor and investment ideas, including buying shares of a Dutch insurer.

But it quickly became clear he should stop, he said, and he appreciated the way the older students broke it to him. They told him he’d had a chance, they had seen what he could do, and it was time to give someone else a try, he said. He suggested the board of Microsoft offer the same directive to Mr. Ballmer.

    <article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/what-microsofts-mango-says-about-its-phone-strategy/?ref=microsoftcorporation">What Microsoft's 'Mango' Says About Its Phone Strategy<date>May 24, 2011, 3:34 pm</date><text>Microsoft showed off the next version of its smartphone operating system, code-named Mango, at an event in downtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning. The presentation comes seven months after the release of Windows Phone 7, when it became clear that Microsoft was finally going to stop trying to cram Windows PC software onto a cellphone. Microsoft’s new smartphone operating system has Groups, which assemble contacts into personalized Live Tiles that display the contacts’ status updates. The Mango upgrade takes the simplified user interface of Windows Phone 7, with its big tilelike icons, and pushes things further with some neat features (500, Microsoft claims). But more important, the show-and-tell pointed to the strategy and tactics Microsoft will count on to catch the leaders in smartphone operating systems, Apple and Google. Microsoft is moving fast for a change, and betting on its computer science, deep pockets and partnerships. The computer science part amounts to a deep integration of Microsoft search expertise — not just Bing, but all the skills of that team — to alter the user experience of smartphones. “We’re blurring the line between search and applications,” said Andrew Lees, president of the mobile communications business. The current smartphone experience, he explained, is organized around apps. “The user has to go app by app by app,” Mr. Lees said. “It’s as if every time you wanted to go from the living room to the dining room, you had to go through the front door.” Mango links location data, information about a subject and shopping options. The results are presented to the user as related views on the screen, instead of links to Web sites as in conventional search. In a demo, a person typed in the name of a recent movie, “Water for Elephants.” The first screen displayed the location of nearby theaters and show times for the movie. Another tap, and the next screen showed the description and summary of the film, pulled from the movie information service IMDb. Next came options to purchase a ticket through a few online services. Derek Snyder, a product marketing manager, put Mango through its paces in a speed test against Google Android, Apple iOS and BlackBerry phones. The Mango-equipped phone won. No surprise there. The home team always wins demos. But Microsoft is claiming Mango will be fast and responsive. Deciding how Microsoft’s Mango compares with the offerings of its fast-moving competitors will be up to the likes of David Pogue, when the new software appears in smartphones in the fall. But the new Microsoft operating system will be offered by more mobile operators and more handset makers. Mr. Lees did not mention the new operators, but said the “addressable market” would be four times as large as it was for the original Windows Phone 7. The handset makers in the fall will include the initial three for Windows Phone 7 — Samsung, LG and HTC. The new converts, Mr. Lees said, include Acer, Fujitsu and ZTE. And the big new partner, of course, is Nokia, which in February struck an alliance with Microsoft and declared it would abandon its smartphone software and adopt Windows Phone. “Nokia brings scale and innovation to our ecosystem,” said Mr. Lees, who noted that Mango was already running Nokia phones in development. “The stars are aligning,” he said. Mango, Mr. Lees added, represents “a tipping point of opportunity.”</text></article>

Last fall, he was recruited from Cisco Systems, where he was a senior vice president, by the investor group, led by Silver Lake Partners, that owns Skype. Then, two weeks ago, Microsoft agreed to buy Skype, the pioneer in Internet phone calls, for $8.5 billion. Tony Bates of Skype. So Mr. Bates is set to become president of Microsoft’s Skype division, as the software giant tries to become a leader in the next generation of telecommunications by combining video calls, voice and text-over-digital networks. In an interview Friday afternoon, Mr. Bates said he could not discuss the plans of the two companies in detail, because the deal is still pending. But the 44-year-old executive, who holds nine patents in telecommunications technology, did answer some questions. Here are some excerpts. Q. Do you talk to Steve Ballmer (Microsoft’s chief executive) using Skype? A. Yes. Actually the first time we talked I was in a hotel room in Estonia at about 1 a.m. Once I found decent light in the room, so he could see me clearly through the camera on my notebook computer, it worked. Q. The engineering origins of the company are in Estonia. But what’s your engineering work force today, and where are they? A. We have about 400 engineers, and nearly 60 percent of them are in Tallinn [Estonia]. The remainder are in Stockholm and Palo Alto. Q. What were your biggest concerns in being bought by Microsoft? A. I don’t think of them concerns, but as priorities. And there are three main priorities. The first is staying multiplatform, working with the popular technologies of other companies, not just Microsoft, on the desktop, mobile devices and increasingly in the living room. That’s really important. The second is maintaining the integrity of the brand. Our mantra is that Skype should be universal, useful and wonderful. The third is that we maintain the recent momentum of our fast-paced, agile product development. Q. Could you elaborate a bit on that development approach? A. Sure, it started under Silver Lake (which bought a controlling interest of Skype from eBay in September 2009). And I’ve really just tried to push it even more. It mainly amounts to having reaffirmed the product engineering lead to the company, getting back to fast-cycle innovation mentality of the early days. We release new versions every 90 days, which is twice as fast or faster than the development cycles of a year or two ago. If you’re a disruptive Internet play, you’re only as good as your last feature, your last release. Q. Skype is headquartered in Luxembourg and its major engineering arm is in Estonia. Where do you live? A. I live in Silicon Valley. Q. Are you going to move to Redmond [the Seattle suburb, where Microsoft is headquartered]? A. I don’t plan to. Think that’s a mistake? .</text></article>

Casey/Bloomberg NewsJaron Lanier at a conference in March. Jaron Lanier, a partner architect at Microsoft Research, has had a long and varied career in technology. Mr. Lanier popularized the term “virtual reality” in the 1980s and has worked for decades on computer science, physics and music. The Times’ Michiko Kakutani chose Mr. Lanier’s book, “You Are Not a Gadget,” as one of her 10 best books of 2010. He is currently working on a follow-up. The following is an edited transcript of an interview with Mr. Lanier. Joshua Brustein: What is your focus at Microsoft nowadays? Jaron Lanier: I have a mixed role there. Part is straight research, where I’m part of Microsoft Labs. This is a weird transition for me, because I’ve always defined myself as being a hard to pin down, independent character. But I realized that there’s a very strong chance that Microsoft is going to be the organization that realizes some of the goals and technologies that I’ve been really enthused about. Like, for instance, with the introduction of the Kinect camera. I also speak my mind, and haven’t had to compromise what I say at all. I’d leave in a minute if that came up. It all seems to be working, much to my amazement. With Kinect, people have been experimenting with it since the moment it came out. What are the most interesting things you’re seeing? The things I’m most enthused about are the applications of Kinect to medicine. For years, I’ve worked with full-body tracking for things like physical therapy, helping people adapt to prosthetic limbs more quickly and certain types of diagnoses. In the past, we typically had to have people get into a motion capture suit, and then calibrate it. With Kinect, all of a sudden that becomes convenient and cheap. I think we’re going to see a real expansion of certain kinds of techniques and therapies that have been proven but haven’t been inexpensive and practical before. You’ve criticized the current shape technology is taking. How did we go wrong, so to speak? The way I see we’ve been engaged in this long-term drama since the middle of the 19th century. Technologists provide tools that can improve people’s lives. But I want to be clear that I don’t think technology by itself improves people’s lives, since often I’m criticized for being too pro-technology. Unless there’s commensurate ethical and moral improvements to go along with it, it’s for naught. And so there’s been, in my view, a social contract. As technologists create disruption, the new stuff we bring in is generally better than the old. If a job is made obsolete, there will be a new job that is more dignified, more cerebral, better paying. So are we still adhering to that contract? In my view, we forgot about that contract at the turn of the century. Now we have a different social contract. Services like Google and Facebook only exist because of the social acceptance of a mass amount of distributed volunteer labor from tons and tons of people. Google said we’ll just give you stuff for free. There’s a trade-off: you get some short-term benefits because things are cheaper, but in the long term your career prospects are diminished. Was it inevitable that many jobs would become less valuable as it became possible to replace them with automated processes or crowdsourcing? No. The first concept of Internet implementation, to my knowledge, was by Ted Nelson in the 1960s. He envisioned a world in which instead of copying documents, each thing would exist only once. There’s someone who attends to it, and experiences online are built by references to these original copies. Everyone in the chain can make money off of it by a universal micropayment system. Well, now that we’ve gotten to this part in history, what’s a long-term vision that reconnects the social contract, and what’s the first step toward getting there? Well, certainly Ted’s ideas would have to be updated, but I think we have to get back to them. I think it could take a century. This is a frustrating time frame to talk about, because in Silicon Valley we’re used to some start-up taking over the world in a year or two all the time. But we can’t have a strong middle class in a world where the only official information business is what is called the ”advertising model,” a term I dislike. Why do you dislike it? It’s not really advertising. It’s more like running a spying and influence company. Having this stealthy manipulative substrata fundamentally undermines the openness and the pleasant qualities of the Internet. There are two versions of you on Facebook. One is the one you tend to and can access. That one is worth nothing from a commercial point of view. The way Facebook can make money is by having a differential value between that version of you and some other version of you. Privacy crusaders say Facebook should release its secret dossier of what’s known about you, but there’s not a specific block of information about you that can be revealed in isolation. Instead, the second version is correlations between you and a million other things, like are you similar to people who tend to want chocolate ice cream on May 14? How much self-reflection of this type do you see in Silicon Valley? It seems like there’s an almost religious excitement among people who work in technology. I find that excitement precious, and there’s a portion of that I buy into and defend. But every medicine can be a poison. I do run into this problem of people feeling like I’m raining on their parade. But this isn’t just a parade. We’re actually changing the world, and I think we should be tough on ourselves. So what are your reasons for being optimistic? We have a lot of capable smart people who have a lot of good will and aren’t totally lost to dogma. A remarkable thing about the Silicon Valley culture is that its status structure is so based on technical accomplishment and prowess. I really love the way that the most successful people who run companies — some of the wealthiest people in the history of the world — are still a bit insecure about the best technical people. The value system is very based on merit.</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/technology/16phone.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Data Networks Force Wireless to Find New Income<date>Published: May 15, 2011</date><text>Today, long-winded talkers need to worry about running out of minutes on their cellphone plans. But someday there will be no minutes to run out of — just megabytes.Wireless carriers now funnel voice and data traffic over two separate networks and charge customers accordingly. In the not-so-distant future, analysts and industry executives say, all mobile services, including text messages and voice and video calls, will travel over data networks. Microsoft’s recent $8.5 billion deal to buy Skype, the Internet calling service, could accelerate this change — one that is forcing wireless carriers to adapt. Services like Skype can cut into the carriers’ revenues because they offer easy ways to make phone calls, videoconference and send messages free over the Internet, encroaching on the ways that phone companies have traditionally made money. The telecommunications industry is already in a state of flux as more people disconnect their home telephone lines in favor of cellphones. Now the wireless carriers are looking for new ways to make money based on mobile broadband and applications, rather than voice minutes. “Eventually, everything migrates to a data channel,” said Brian Higgins, an executive at Verizon Wireless who is developing products and services for the company’s high-speed 4G network. “We’re moving away from silos of communication to one where everything is combined together.” Analysts tend to agree that Microsoft is not looking to steal business from the wireless carriers. Instead it hopes to revitalize itself by creating innovative software for smartphones and tablets, with Skype’s services built in. Microsoft will need companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless to put their confidence and marketing budgets behind those devices to appeal to consumers. But the Skype deal also signifies a larger interest in next-generation communications services. It is not just Skype that the wireless companies need to worry about. A bevy of mobile messaging applications, including WhatsApp, Kik, GroupMe and textPlus, allow people to send messages over data networks, sidestepping the cost of sending and receiving standard text messages. Carriers already must deal with many new competitors in the communications game. Name companies like Apple, Facebook and Google are making services available that traditionally only carriers could offer. Google, like Skype, offers ways to make free phone and video calls over the Internet. Apple lets iPhone owners make video calls. The ultimate risk for the carriers, analysts say, is becoming “dumb pipes,” providing only the data connection and not selling any more sophisticated communications services themselves. “Much of the value in communication now sits above basic connectivity,” said Charles S. Golvin, a telecom analyst with Forrester Research. “Things like IM, video calling like FaceTime, and Web conferencing. These are delivered to consumers by companies like Google, Apple and Cisco — not the carriers.” Chetan Sharma, an independent telecommunications analyst, points to one instance in which the growing popularity of using mobile applications to communicate has hurt a wireless company. Last month, KPN, a wireless carrier in the Netherlands, cut its profit forecast and reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue from text messaging, which the company attributed to applications that give people free access to voice and text services if they have a data plan. “It’s an early indicator that it could happen elsewhere,” Mr. Sharma said. In the United States, no signs indicate that the volume of text messages sent or voice minutes used is in decline, he said. But revenue from voice services has dropped steadily as carriers have move toward unlimited calling plans to stay competitive with one another, lowering the average revenue that can be generated per minute of talk time. In the United States, Mr. Sharma said, voice revenue has declined 7 percent over the last four years, while data revenue has soared 132 percent. Over all, data revenue now makes up 35 percent of the total revenue for the wireless industry. Carriers have responded to the shift toward digital communication differently. Some seek to leverage the new wave of services to differentiate themselves and gain an edge over competitors. Sprint, for example, recently united with Google to let its customers link their Sprint phone numbers to Google Voice, a service that rings all of a person’s phones and even Gmail when someone calls that person’s number. Others, like Verizon Wireless, say there is plenty of money to be made from their mobile data networks. They say demand for data services will drive sales and adoption of smartphones, which are more lucrative to wireless carriers because they require expensive data plans. “There will be an increased appetite for devices that can access higher bandwidth, which I find very encouraging,” Mr. Higgins of Verizon said.Today, long-winded talkers need to worry about running out of minutes on their cellphone plans. But someday there will be no minutes to run out of — just megabytes.</text></article>

While Google has also tried to offer “social” inputs into its search results, Microsoft said that its partnership with Facebook would allow it to go further than its rival. “It’s a first step in the evolution of how search can become more human,” said Stefan Weitz, a director of Bing at Microsoft. In addition to highlighting links that were liked by a person’s Facebook’s friends, Mr. Weitz said that when a user searched for a Web site like NYTimes.com or Cooks.com, Bing will would news articles or recipes deep inside those sites that their friends have recommended. Bing will also try to make search more “conversational” by showing people who search for a destination like Paris or Chicago who among their friends live there and making it easy to click through to those friends’ Facebook pages to ask them questions. In a blog post, Yusuf Medhi, a corporate vice president at Microsoft, said these and other new social features would help Bing users “make faster, more informed decisions.” For these features to work, a person has to be logged into Facebook and Bing. Microsoft’s deeper foray into social search comes as Google’s own efforts in the area appear to have worried Facebook. A campaign by Facebook to secretly raise privacy questions about Google’s approach backfired after a blogger discovered that the social networking giant was behind it. Bing has slowly gained market share over the last year. Google accounted for 65.4 percent of searches in the United States in April, followed by Yahoo with 15.9 percent and Bing with 14.1 percent, according to comScore. A year earlier, Google accounted for 64.4 of the market, followed by Yahoo with 17.7 percent, and Bing with 11.8 percent.</text></article>

In the 1990s, its Windows operating system became so dominant that government trust-busters took it to court. They spent four years and millions of dollars making the case that Microsoft was unduly using its power to wipe out rivals in the Web browser business and other domains. The settlement to that case, which put limits on Microsoft’s behavior and imposed a decade of government oversight on the company, expired last Thursday. Almost nobody noticed. Given the furious pace of innovation by companies like Apple, Google and Facebook, an inevitable question springs to mind: Did the biggest high-tech legal action of the 20th century make any difference, or was it a waste of money and time? Critics of the settlement, and there are many, argue that the Microsoft case did little to change technological development; it was Google, the Internet and bad business decisions that put an end to the dominance of Microsoft. The conditions imposed by the court, to stop forcing consumers to use Internet Explorer and preventing rival software from operating properly on Windows, had little relevance to the future path of innovation. This seems too narrow a reading of history. It is, of course, impossible to say what would have happened had the Justice Department and 19 state attorneys general not taken Microsoft to court in 1998. But beyond specific conditions imposed on the company, the case did seem to alter Microsoft’s behavior, taming its ruthless drive. Government oversight not only swayed Microsoft to pull its punches, it sent a signal to other innovators that it was O.K. to work on technologies that Microsoft was interested in — something they might never have done before. Had Internet Explorer become as dominant as Windows, Microsoft could have held more sway over the development of new services on the Web. Today, Microsoft is way behind the curve. New innovators, like Google and Facebook, have emerged with big power over their respective markets. Yet the precedent of Microsoft’s antitrust case poses an important question about the future: Should we worry about dominant information technology companies, or can we simply wait for the next big thing to bump them aside? Microsoft thinks we should worry. Last June, it filed a letter about Google with the Federal Communications Commission. It said: “When a single entity achieves dominance and thereby becomes a gatekeeper, there is an inherent risk that it may have both the incentive and ability to place its own interests above consumers’ interests in access to a broad and diverse range of content, services and viewpoints.” Regulators agree. The European Commission is deciding whether Google abused its search dominance, and American authorities are considering an investigation. We support these efforts. Innovation needs competition.Remember when Microsoft ruled the PC industry? In the 1990s, its Windows operating system became so dominant that government trust-busters took it to court.

For more than a decade, both have run dominant, rapidly maturing tech juggernauts — Mr. Chambers at Cisco Systems and Mr. Ballmer at Microsoft. And both have let down their shareholders. The difference is that one seems to have recognized the error of his ways and is repenting.After years of frittering away Cisco’s cash on acquisitions and overpriced stock buybacks, Mr. Chambers has gotten religion. He is paring back the company to focus on its core networking businesses and streamlining management ranks. As he said on Wednesday, “We have acknowledged our challenges. We know what we have to do.” Cisco has instituted a dividend. And if he can resist more of the shopping excursions that led him to spend $34 billion in the last decade, he may even manage to kick-start his stock after 10 years of directionless returns. Compare that with Mr. Ballmer. A day before Cisco released its third-quarter results, Microsoft agreed to spend $8.5 billion on Skype. Without a serious financial rationale for the purchase of the Internet telephone company at 10 times sales, Microsoft took another leap into what Cisco’s Mr. Chambers used to call “market adjacencies.” There may be some Skype synergy with Microsoft’s many products. But they are fuzzy, in the same way that Cisco’s lurch into the consumer business with the acquisition of cable set-top boxes and handheld video cameras was. So what has made Mr. Chambers see the light, while Mr. Ballmer continues building an empire of adjacencies? After all, Microsoft’s stock has underperformed Cisco’s over the last 10 years. It is down more than 25 percent, three times the drop in Cisco’s stock — though admittedly Mr. Ballmer instituted dividends years ago, which has made the total return less disappointing for investors. One simple explanation lies in the shareholder base. Mr. Chambers’s decision to revamp the company came with activist investors circling. With no single major shareholder to protect him, Mr. Chambers grasped the risks of inaction. Microsoft’s ownership, by contrast, is still dominated by its chairman and co-founder, Bill Gates. He and Mr. Ballmer own about $20 billion of Microsoft stock, giving them a combined stake bigger than 10 percent — something no outside investor could amass. With insulation like that, it’s no surprise Mr. Ballmer is still able to run amok. Booming Exports Has the global economy hit a soft patch? A week after a sell-off skimmed froth from bubbly commodities markets, China reported a tiny decline in inflation. But any impression that the global economy is cooling, and the conclusion that monetary policy tightening can be deferred, is wrong. Inflationary pressures still need to be checked. China’s annual rate of inflation moderated to 5.3 percent in April, from 5.4 percent the month before. But that is still very high, and inflationary forces are plain to see. Wages in China are widely reported to be rising at double-digit rates. The country’s currency is appreciating at only a slow pace against the dollar. The latest huge trade surplus suggests foreign exchange reserves will keep booming, and with them the money supply. Record export figures provide further confirmation that the global recovery is firmly on track. China’s exports were up a staggering 29.9 percent in April from a year earlier. Meanwhile, exports out of Germany were up by 19.9 percent in March compared with a year earlier. They are also well above the record set in April 2008. Rapid export growth is adding to inflationary pressure in Germany, too. German consumers are spending and inflation has jumped to 2.7 percent. Price increases in the euro zone over all are also heading toward 3 percent. The European Central Bank will need to raise interest rates. It cannot afford to let inflation soar in the core economies of the region despite the troubles of some peripheral member states. Investors and some policy makers keep seeing soft patches in the worldwide recovery. The reality is that limited monetary policy tightening by a few central banks hasn’t checked global growth much. The German and Chinese export booms ought to be echoing loudly worldwide. Interest rates in most economies remain negative in real terms. The mix of strong demand and easy money suggests higher rates will be needed to prevent commodities flying again and inflation soaring. The hard data doesn’t look so soft at all.John Chambers and Steve Ballmer have much in common. For more than a decade, both have run dominant, rapidly maturing tech juggernauts — Mr. Chambers at Cisco Systems and Mr. Ballmer at Microsoft. And both have let down their shareholders.

Google hopes that the devices, which it says will eliminate the need for software updates and hard drive backups and will boot up within eight seconds, will replace PCs running Microsoft's Windows software in offices and homes around the world. ''Whether it be Microsoft or other OS vendors, I think the complexity of managing your computers is really torturing users out there,'' said Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder and director of special projects, speaking at Google I/O, its developer conference here. ''That's a flawed model fundamentally. And I think Chromebooks are a new model that doesn't put the burden of managing your computer on yourself.'' Google will not have an easy time challenging Microsoft, which dominates the workplace. While Google has bested Microsoft in operating system software for mobile phones, it has taken on Microsoft in the workplace before and failed to budge it, most notably in word processing and spreadsheet software and collaboration tools. Google says Chromebooks will attract corporate technology buyers because Google automatically updates the Chrome operating system over the Internet and there is no need to back up computers because if they are lost or ruined, all the data exists online. ''We're venturing into a really new model of computing that I don't think was possible previously, even a few years ago,'' said Mr. Brin. ''I think it's just a much easier way to compute.'' Google's biggest challenge will be persuading people to do computing in a completely different way. The Chromebooks, named after Google's Chrome operating system, will store all of a user's data and the computer's software online. Google's idea is that anyone could walk up to an Internet-connected computer anywhere and have access to his or her information. But since most computer users are accustomed to using desktop software and storing data on a computer's hard drive, getting people - and corporate managers of information technology - to change will be difficult, said David Daoud, research director for personal computing at IDC. ''Large companies are still very much Windows-centric,'' Mr. Daoud said. ''Yes, Google might find a niche market for this, but it's going to be very difficult to compete with Microsoft in the large enterprise space, given the complexity of those installed products.'' The Chrome operating system, which Google introduced in 2009, does away with desktop software and storing data on a computer. Instead, it is not much more than a browser, and all of a computer user's information, like documents, photos and e-mail messages, is stored on the Internet, or in ''the cloud.'' Instead of desktop software like Microsoft Word or iPhoto, people use Web-based software like Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365 or Picasa. Corporate I.T. departments are not known for quickly adopting flashy new products. Half of businesses are still running the 2001 version of Windows XP, said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president for Chrome. However, tablet computers with touch screens, like the iPad, are replacing laptops in some workplaces, so the Chromebook may be late to the game. Microsoft has also seen some softness in its sales for its operating system software. Google's strategy is to go after businesses and schools first. If students get used to a Web-based operating system, they might request it in their offices later on, and if people use it at work, they might decide to buy one for their homes. ''There's a limit to how many people will get a Chromebook on their own, so they're probing for another entry point into this lightweight computing market,'' said Ray Valdes, research director for Internet platforms at Gartner, a research firm. The first Chromebooks, made by Samsung and Acer, will start at $349 and be available June 15 from Amazon.com and Best Buy. The computers, along with the software and technical support, will also be available to rent for schools and businesses, for $20 a month per student or $28 a month per employee.</text></article>

The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample Well, you heard the news: Microsoft is going to buy Skype for $8.5 billion. It’s the most money Microsoft has ever spent for anything. Analysts — the ones who think the deal is a good idea — say that Microsoft can use Skype’s voice and video technology to build into its products, like Windows and Kinect. But that’s such a weird analysis, since Windows and Kinect already have voice and video built in. Hello? NetMeeting? Windows Live Messenger? The difference, of course, is that nobody used those programs. At least not compared with the 170 million people who use Skype every month, including close to 9 million of them who actually pay for the service. (You pay, for example, if you want to make voice calls to telephone numbers, rather than other computers or phones.) “It’s an amazing customer footprint,” Ballmer said in a Times interview. “And Skype is a verb, as they say.” And so is “Google.” I’d be willing to guess that this purchase was as much about “look what we’ve got, Google!” as it is about Microsoft’s technology strategy. Every time some big clumsy corporate behemoth buys a popular consumer-tech product, I cringe. It almost never works out. The purchased company’s executives take a huge payday; promises are made all around that they’ll be allowed to continue operating independently; and then, within a couple of years, the product disappears altogether. A little star of the tech sky is snuffed out, for absolutely no good reason. Yahoo bought GeoCities, Broadcast.com, HotJobs.com, MusicMatch, Konfabulator and Upcoming. AOL bought CompuServe, Netscape and Xdrive—all gone or irrelevant now. Cisco bought the Flip camcorder, and then killed it last month. But what about Microsoft? Its acquisitions list includes the Sidekick (Danger) service, Groove, Placeware, Massive, LinkExchange and WebTV. It has shut down all of them. (As my Twitter follower @jfhaft notes, “Microsoft = King Midas in reverse.”) I guess what I’m saying is that I’m skeptical. This feels more like an 800-pound-gorilla move than anything that will wind up benefiting you. No wonder my Twitter followers, on the night the Microsoft-Skype deal was announced, promptly began into a hilarious round of Mock-the-Microsoft. Their tidbits included: @okc_dave: They must have found some extra change in the couch. @BeckJeffrey: I guess we can look forward to Skype 2011 in a few years. @loyalmoses: We’ll have to start saying “Microsoft me” instead of “Skype me”… but saying that makes me feel dirty. @macsmarts: Microsoft buying Skype is like the Captain of the Titanic using his last moments to send out an SOS for a replacement radio. @Sandydca: At least all the tech-support calls to Bangalore will be at a reduced rate. @Vikster: At first, MSFT weren’t sure. But Skype had them at unpatched security vulnerability.” @LunaticSX: The 1st details MS will announce about their plans for Skype will be integration with Kin phones, Connectix webcams, &amp; WebTV. @cjkm: Skype Condescending Starter Edition; Skype Unpaid Blogger Edition; Skype Cubicle Jail Edition; Skype Telco Replacement Edition… @Checkw: Now Windows can call customer support on its own! @xriva: Microsoft Skype: The Blue Screen of Voice. @bryanroutledge: To dial, press Ctrl-Alt-Del… @2jase: MSFT buys Skype? It’s ChatRoulette with all chambers loaded. @ericfgould: Now I’ll have to login using Windows LiveHotmailWhatever acct that I haven’t used since Internet Explorer 6. @tiffbrownolsen: Does that mean it’s going to stop working properly When I pleaded with my followers to find something positive to say about the deal, @psdlund racked his brains and came up with: “At least it wasn’t Cisco.” (The best tweet of all may have come the next morning from Frank Shaw, Microsoft’s top PR guy. “@fxshaw: I can tell david pogue is not up yet because he’s not retweeting snark about ms and skype.”) Sometimes, these purchases pay off. A few of Microsoft’s acquisitions live on, even if they’re minor or unprofitable: HotMail, Visio and TellMe, for example. And the $200 million Microsoft paid for PlaceWare led to something useful: NetMeeting, the voice-and-video-chat program that competes with Skype. (Oh, wait.) So add Skype to the list of acquisitions that took a beloved, popular consumer product and folded it into a big behemoth corporation. Will Microsoft wind up shutting it down, as it has so many other acquisitions? Let’s meet back here in two years and compare notes.</text></article>

Corporations have built up a record amount of cash over the last several years, and they have started using it to purchase rivals, pay dividends and also expand their businesses. That, in turn, has led to increased confidence among money managers and other investors that stocks are going to continue to rise. Large companies also want to put their cash stockpiles to work because they’re getting minimal returns on them, said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services. Interest rates for short-term savings pay less than 1 percent. “The crisis is behind us,” he said. Companies “don’t need this much cash anymore.” The Skype purchase would be Microsoft’s largest in its 36-year history. It follows AT&amp;T’s announcement in March that it would buy T-Mobile USA for $39 billion and Johnson &amp; Johnson’s $21.3 billion deal announced last month to acquire Synthes, a maker of medical instruments and implants. CKx Inc., which owns the rights to the names and images of Muhammad Ali and Elvis Presley, jumped 22 percent after it agreed to be bought by private equity investors. The buyout group will pay about $511 million for the company, which also owns the “American Idol” television show. Also on Tuesday, the dairy producer Dean Foods and Medifast reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. Dean had a stronger start to the year than it expected and raised its forecast for full-year earnings. The company also said it would raise prices to help combat falling milk sales. Shares of Dean jumped 11 percent. Shares of Medifast, which operates a weight-loss program, rose 18 percent. Boston Scientific sank 9 percent after the medical device company said its president and chief executive, J. Raymond Elliott, would retire at the end of the year. The company is looking for his successor. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.68 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 12,760.36. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rose 10.87 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,357.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 28.64 points, or 1 percent, to 2,871.89. Stocks have risen sharply in 2011, driven by strong earnings reports from major companies like Caterpillar and Apple. The S.&amp; P. 500 is up 8 percent, more than it gained in five of the last 10 full calendar years. Companies in the S.&amp; P. 500 are on track to report first-quarter earnings growth of 19 percent, according to FactSet. That’s far ahead of the 11 percent that analysts were forecasting at the end of 2010. Nearly nine out of 10 companies in the index have reported results already. Crude oil wavered but gained $1.33 to settle at $103.88 per barrel. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday that higher fuel costs drove prices for imports into the United States up 2.2 percent last month. It is the first time import prices have topped 2 percent in consecutive months since June 2008. Metals futures recovered more of their losses from last week’s sell-off. Silver rose to $38.48 per ounce. Silver has more than doubled over the last year, but is still about $10 below where it was at the end of April. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to 103 13/32. The yield rose to 3.21 percent.Corporate deals and strong earnings have been credited with driving stocks higher this year, and news on Tuesday continued that trend.</text></article>

After agreeing to sell the company for $8.5 billion to Microsoft, the owners - including a private equity firm, a venture capital firm and a pension fund - are now poised to reap a windfall. Even eBay, which took a $1.4 billion hit on its original investment, looks to collect more than $2 billion on Skype. With the Microsoft deal, which was announced on Tuesday, Skype avoids becoming a technology cliche. Many Internet stars attract lofty bids from deep-pocketed suitors, only to fade a few years later. But few make a splash for a second time. ''It was an orphaned division of eBay,'' said Egon Durban, a managing director at Silver Lake Partners, one of the investors in Skype. ''But we thought we could take Skype, a great Internet brand, and turn it into an ubiquitous communications platform.'' Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, Skype quickly became an online sensation. Within the first two months of its start, more than a billion people had downloaded the communications service. Less than two years later, eBay, the huge online marketplace, rushed to capitalize on Skype's popularity, offering $2.6 billion for the company, with an additional $1.5 billion in performance-based incentives. The young founders eagerly accepted. But the marriage soon soured. While the auction site thought Skype's video-and-voice platform would enhance the user experience, it was an awkward fit. A series of management shuffles only added to the tension between eBay management and Skype's founders. Although the number of Skype subscribers continued to grow under eBay's watch, losses swelled. In 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on the business, watching it continue to languish. From 2006 to 2009, Skype posted only one year of profitability. ''EBay had reasons to buy the business but they never were able to execute,'' said Benedict Evans, an analyst with the London-based research firm Enders Analysis. ''They bought the business and, it seems, they just forgot they bought it.'' Amid the recession in 2009, Mr. Durban of Silver Lake Partners called the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the venture capital firm Index Ventures, to discuss a possible co-investment in Skype. By the end of the year, the group had hashed out an agreement with eBay to buy a majority of Skype for $1.9 billion. It was a risky bet. Besides a string of losses and a weak economy, Skype was also wrestling with intellectual property lawsuits filed by its founders. After the acrimonious split, the founders had retained crucial patents that formed the foundation of Skype's platform. Even so, the investors remained confident. Price was a big factor. The deal valued Skype at $2.75 billion, slightly less than eBay paid four years earlier. Silver Lake alone paid nearly a billion dollars for its stake -its biggest single investment ever. ''Skype was embroiled in a lawsuit the day we signed and the investors were sued the following day after signing,'' Mr. Durban said. But ''we saw an unbelievable potential to transform this company.'' ''There was a lot of risk,'' said Mark Wiseman, the executive vice president of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. ''But we did our own due diligence, and we saw a lot of the same things that Microsoft saw - a dominant global brand, with a very solid, growing base of users, and a robust technology platform.'' The investors and eBay settled the outstanding suits in late 2009. As part of the agreement, Skype acquired the intellectual property and a holding company owned by the founders received a 14 percent stake. Index Ventures also bowed out of the deal. With their legal issues behind them, Silver Lake and the other investors swiftly moved to spruce up Skype. Over the last two years, they have pushed the Internet company to increase its focus on development, shortened product cycles and forged new partnerships. Skype also moved to build out its services in the mobile and the enterprise space, both considered high-growth markets. Last year, for instance, the company started an application for Google's Android mobile phones and signed a deal with Facebook. Since 2009, Skype's staff has increased by more than 40 percent, to about 1,000 employees. Last October, the investors hired a new chief executive, Tony Bates, a veteran of Cisco Systems. ''They invested a lot in making money and the quality of the service,'' said Ted Schadler, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''The move to hire Tony, a world-class I.T. executive, was a turning point - that move alone said they were growing up very rapidly.'' The changes started to materialize in the numbers last year. Skype recorded $859.8 million in revenue and a net loss of $7 million in 2010, according to a recent filing. The previous year, the loss exceeded $300 million. Skype's monthly users topped 170 million, nearly double the amount at the end of 2009. Skype's improving fortunes started to attract the attention of potential suitors. Technology giants like Google and Facebook were actively looking at the company earlier this year, according to people who were close to the matter but not authorized to speak publicly. The casual talks put a deal in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. Speculation of a sale spurred Microsoft into action. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, who said that he had considered buying Skype in recent years, sent his chief financial officer, Peter W. Klein, to Silver Lake's Silicon Valley offices to make an unsolicited offer. For several weeks, the various parties discussed the potential terms, talking about valuation, Skype's long-term outlook and the role of the current management team. In mid-April, Microsoft settled on the price, agreeing to pay $8.5 billion, including the assumption of $725 million in debt. The deal was signed Monday night at 9:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/technology/11skype.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">For Microsoft, Skype Opens Vast New Market in Telecom<date>Published: May 10, 2011</date><text>Microsoft has peered into the future, and placed a bet that people the world over want to stay in touch with someone anytime and anywhere — preferably at no cost.In agreeing Tuesday to pay $8.5 billion to buy Skype, the pioneer in Internet phone calls, Microsoft is embracing a technology that is transforming the way people communicate at home and at work. And by stitching Skype technology into Microsoft products, used by hundreds of millions of people, the software giant could hasten the mainstream adoption of video communications, especially in businesses. Microsoft, although rich and powerful, lags in new fields like smartphone software. Skype could help it better compete with the new giants of technology, like Google and Apple. “Skype has been a forerunner, and this deal is Microsoft trying to become relevant in this new age of Internet communications,” said Berge Ayvazian, a telecommunications consultant. “It could really change things for Microsoft and accelerate the spread of this new technology.” The future of communications, industry analysts and executives say, will be animated by Internet technology and rests increasingly on video calls, as well as voice and text messages. Skype started on personal computers less than a decade ago, but is now beginning to make its way onto smartphones. As it heads for living rooms with applications like at-home videoconferencing on digital televisions, it could change the way people make even the most routine calls. This next generation of communications is both a threat and an opportunity to telecommunications and technology companies — a focus of energy, investment and anxiety for corporations including AT&amp;T, Verizon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Microsoft is betting that Skype can help change its fortunes. Skype is a leader in Internet voice and video communications, with 170 million users each month connected for more than 100 minutes on average. In the last year or two, video use has surged, now accounting for 40 percent of Skype’s traffic. That large and active community of users represents a major asset, said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive. “It’s an amazing customer footprint,” Mr. Ballmer said in an interview. “And Skype is a verb, as they say.” Mr. Ballmer never mentioned Google, Microsoft’s archrival whose name is used as a verb for Internet search. In that market, Microsoft is spending heavily to try to catch Google, and making some progress with its Bing engine, but at great financial cost. Google, like Skype, has a free Internet phone call and video messaging service. So Microsoft, analysts say, is taking a bold step to grab a leadership position instead of risking falling behind Google in a crucial market and then facing the difficult task of trying to catch up. “Skype gives Microsoft instant size and scale in this emerging market,” said Howard Anderson, a senior lecturer at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The merger with Skype, if successful, could give Microsoft a leading consumer Internet service — something it has lacked — and help lift its other businesses, like smartphone software, Office productivity programs and Xbox video game consoles, analysts say. In doing so, Microsoft aims to keep people seamlessly connected at work or at home. “We want to enable communications across people’s lives,” Mr. Ballmer said in a press conference in San Francisco. Skype, founded in 2003, is a creation of the new technology that is transforming telecommunications. “For some time, it has been clear that telecommunications is going to move to all-digital Internet technology,” said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and a former official at the Federal Communications Commission. “Skype shows what can be done.” Skype was founded by two entrepreneurs, one Swedish and one Danish, with software developed by a small team of programmers in Estonia. They deployed a version of peer-to-peer software, initially associated with illegal file-sharing of pirated music and movies. The voice and video travel over the Internet rather than dedicated phone landlines or cell tower networks. Skype has had a bumpy ride as a business. EBay bought it for $2.6 billion in 2005, and then sold most of it to a private investors’ group in 2009, after eBay could not figure out how to make money on Skype. 1 2 Next Page »Microsoft has peered into the future, and placed a bet that people the world over want to stay in touch with someone anytime and anywhere — preferably at no cost.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/us/11corps.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Peace Corps Volunteers Speak Out on Rape<date>Published: May 10, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Jess Smochek arrived in Bangladesh in 2004 as a 23-year-old Peace Corps volunteer with dreams of teaching English and “helping the world.” She left six weeks later a rape victim after being brutalized in an alley by a knife-wielding gang.When she returned to the United States, the reception she received from Peace Corps officials was as devastating, she said, as the rape itself. In Bangladesh, she had been given scant medical care; in Washington, a counselor implied that she was to blame for the attack. For years she kept quiet, feeling “ashamed and embarrassed and guilty.” Today, Ms. Smochek is among a growing group of former Peace Corps volunteers who are speaking out about their sexual assaults, prompting scrutiny from Congress and a pledge from the agency for reform. In going public, they are exposing an ugly sliver of life in the Peace Corps: the dangers that volunteers face in far-flung corners of the world and the inconsistent — and, some say, callous — treatment they receive when they become crime victims. “These women are alone in many cases, and they’re in rough parts of the world,” said Representative Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, who says the Peace Corps’ promises do not go far enough and is sponsoring legislation to force changes in the way it treats victims of sexual assault. “We want the United States to rush in and treat them as a victim of crime like they would be treated here at home.” Founded in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, the Peace Corps has 8,655 volunteers and trainees, as young as 21 and as old as 86, serving in 77 countries. For most, service is, as the agency’s Web site boasts, “a life-defining leadership experience.” But from 2000 to 2009, on average, 22 Peace Corps women each year reported being the victims of rape or attempted rape, the agency says. During that time, more than 1,000 Peace Corps volunteers reported sexual assaults, including 221 rapes or attempted rapes. Because sexual crimes often go unreported, experts say the incidence is likely to be higher, though they and the Peace Corps add that it is difficult to assess whether the volunteers face any greater risk overseas than women in the United States do. On Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will convene a hearing to examine what its chairwoman, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Republican of Florida, called “serious crimes” committed against Peace Corps volunteers, including murder; in announcing the hearing, her office cited reports of “gross mismanagement of sexual assault complaints.” Lois Puzey, whose daughter Kate was murdered in 2009 while posted in Benin, will testify. So will Ms. Smochek, now a board member of First Response Action, a fledgling advocacy group founded by another former volunteer, Casey Frazee. Ms. Frazee was sexually assaulted in South Africa in 2009 and came home, she said, determined to not “let the Peace Corps toss me off like I was an isolated incident.” In an interview Monday, the director of the Peace Corps, Aaron S. Williams, said he was committed to revamping the agency’s practices to create a more “victim-centered approach.” He insisted that it was safe for women to serve in the Peace Corps. “We do not place Peace Corps volunteers in unsafe environments,” he said. But he said the agency must modernize its procedures to “make sure that we provide compassionate care” to crime victims. Already, Mr. Williams has made some changes, including hiring a “victim’s advocate” who began work on Monday and signing an agreement with a nationally known rape crisis group to re-examine his organization’s training and policies. The changes reflect the work of Ms. Frazee, who has spent the last 18 months tracking down Peace Corps sexual assault survivors by reaching out through social networking sites and her blog. Last year, her work attracted the attention of the ABC News program “20/20,” which ran a segment on the women in January. In recent months, Ms. Frazee, 28, has collected more than two dozen affidavits from other women, who have shared stories that Mr. Williams called “tragic.” In interviews and documents, they paint a picture of what many call a “blame the victim” culture at the Peace Corps. 1 2 Next Page »WASHINGTON — Jess Smochek arrived in Bangladesh in 2004 as a 23-year-old Peace Corps volunteer with dreams of teaching English and “helping the world.” She left six weeks later a rape victim after being brutalized in an alley by a knife-wielding gang.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/business/11views.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Skype Deal Unlikely to Pay Off for Microsoft<date>Published: May 10, 2011</date><text>Microsoft has only recently embraced the Internet cloud. But from the perspective of its shareholders, that’s certainly where its $8.5 billion deal to buy Skype belongs.In theory, it has potential advantages. In practice, Microsoft’s poor track record on mergers and acquisitions and the high price it is paying for Skype mean the transaction is unlikely to pay off. The idea is that Microsoft can integrate Skype’s voice, video and messaging tools with Office e-mail and its mobile operating system. A recent deal with Nokia could support efforts to promote Microsoft’s smartphone platform, which is an also-ran. Adding Skype, one of the few Internet names other than Google to become a verb, could help, for instance to compete with Apple’s FaceTime video calling. And gaining a Microsoft-like acceptance behind corporate firewalls might extend Skype’s reach. That all sounds good. But in 2007, the $6 billion acquisition of the online advertising group aQuantive — the biggest by Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, until the Skype deal — hasn’t borne any noticeable fruit in the battle with Google. Neither has the software giant’s search deal with Yahoo. Yet the price Mr. Ballmer has put on Skype, even without an auction, would require it to add huge value. When Skype filed for an initial public offering late last year, a $5 billion price tag looked optimistic. Microsoft is paying almost 10 times revenue. Even Google trades at only a bit over five times. Put another way, Mr. Ballmer is paying more than 400 times last year’s operating income. Sure, Skype is growing quickly. Monthly users increased 38 percent last year to 145 million, with the number of paying customers up 19 percent. And the total climbed to 170 million last month. To turn that operating income into a 10 percent annual return on investment, however, even on a pretax basis, it must grow fortyfold. Microsoft can easily afford Skype. It had $50 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of March. But it’s hard to see how the outlay, even from cash held overseas, is going to break even for the company’s shareholders. Microsoft was the biggest American loser of market capitalization on Tuesday, shedding more than $1.3 billion in value. That suggests investors in the software giant have a different verb in mind than Skype. Munis Under Threat Call it headline risk. Bad press, with stressed state finances, hammered the debt of local governments last year. But the $3 trillion market was never in as bad shape as the doomsayers made out. Still, an improving market — gains in 18 of the last 19 trading sessions through Monday, according to Janney Capital Markets — isn’t immune to stumbles as dysfunctional states tackle budget problems. Meredith Whitney, a financial analyst, last year made a controversial call that “hundreds of billions of dollars” of municipal bonds would go bad. That helped drive down the market in munis. Yet nothing looks remotely on track for disaster on the scale that Ms. Whitney predicted. There are less than $10 billion of defaulted bonds outstanding, with just $28 million of those coming from the safest instruments like bonds backed by a state, according to Municipal Market Advisors. Another $22 billion are admittedly showing signs of stress and bear watching, especially if the domestic economy sputters again. In the meantime, prices have recovered some of their losses and yields on the average AAA-rated 10-year municipal bond have dropped about 13 percent to 2.7 percent this year. Low Treasury rates stemming from the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy have helped, but so has a dearth of supply. A surge of issuance could soften the market. Then there’s demand. Outflows from muni bond mutual funds have slowed. They are running around $1 billion a week, according to Lipper, a firm that tracks fund flows. That’s less than half the pace earlier this year. But a few more of those bad headlines could have investors reaching for their wheelbarrows again. Though the market seems stable for now, the finances of states like California and Illinois have an outsize influence on investors. The next fiscal year begins on July 1 for 46 of the 50 states, and budget negotiations will gather intensity in the coming weeks. Throw in concern over the federal debt ceiling, and a few jitters, deserved or not, could easily rattle munis. RICHARD BEALES and AGNES T.

It underscores a growing surge in technology deals. Worldwide, tech mergers and acquisitions have nearly doubled this year compared with the same period a year ago, with $85.5 billion worth of deals announced, according to Thomson Reuters data. It is the sector’s fastest start since 2000. The Skype transaction would rank among the 12 biggest high-tech deals since 2000 and would be the biggest deal since Hewlett-Packard‘s $13 billion acquisition of Electronic Data Systems in 2008, according to data from Thomson Reuters.

Previously, that honor went to Microsoft’s nearly $6 billion deal for aQuantive, an online advertising company, in 2007. One has to go back to the tech boom year of 1999 for its next biggest deal, nearly $3 billion in stock for a 29.7 percent stake in the British cable operator Telewest Communications. Like a lot of deals that year, that investment didn’t turn out very well. Microsoft sold its stake in 2003 for $5 million. And if the Skype deal doesn’t pan out, Microsoft won’t be able to blame its bankers; it didn’t use any. Skype used JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, who will split an estimated $30 million to $35 million in fees, according to Freeman Consulting, Reuters reported.

Silver LakeEgon Durban, a managing director at Silver Lake Partners, which paid nearly $1 billion for its Skype stake. When a group of investors offered to pay eBay $1.9 billion for a controlling stake in Skype two years ago, the technology veterans were derided for buying a fallen Internet darling hobbled by losses and lawsuits. After agreeing to sell the company for $8.5 billion to Microsoft, the owners — including a private equity firm, a venture capital firm and a pension fund — are now poised to reap a windfall. Even eBay, which took a $1.4 billion hit on its original investment, looks to collect more than $2 billion on Skype. With the Microsoft deal, which was announced on Tuesday, Skype avoids becoming a technology cliché. Many Internet stars attract lofty bids from deep-pocketed suitors, only to fade a few years later. But few make a splash for a second time. “It was an orphaned division of eBay,” said Egon Durban, a managing director at Silver Lake Partners, one of the investors in Skype. “But we thought we could take Skype, a great Internet brand, and turn it into an ubiquitous communications platform.” Founded in 2003 by Nordic entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, Skype quickly became an online sensation. Within the first two months of its start, more than a billion people had downloaded the communications service. Less than two years later, eBay, the huge online marketplace, rushed to capitalize on Skype’s popularity, offering $2.6 billion for the company, with an additional $1.5 billion in performance-based incentives. The young founders eagerly accepted. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Full Coverage of Microsoft's Deal for Skype But the marriage soon soured. While the auction site thought Skype’s video-and-voice platform would enhance the user experience, it was an awkward fit. A series of management shuffles only added to the tension between eBay management and Skype’s founders. Although the number of Skype subscribers continued to grow under eBay’s watch, losses swelled. In 2007, eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on the business, watching it continue to languish. From 2006 to 2009, Skype posted only one year of profitability. “EBay had reasons to buy the business but they never were able to execute,” said Benedict Evans, an analyst with the London-based research firm Enders Analysis. “They bought the business and, it seems, they just forgot they bought it.” Amid the recession in 2009, Mr. Durban of Silver Lake Partners called the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the venture capital firm Index Ventures, to discuss a possible co-investment in Skype. By the end of the year, the group had hashed out an agreement with eBay to buy a majority of Skype for $1.9 billion. It was a risky bet. Besides a string of losses and a weak economy, Skype was also wrestling with intellectual property lawsuits filed by its founders. After the acrimonious split, the founders had retained crucial patents that formed the foundation of Skype’s platform. Even so, the investors remained confident. Price was a big factor. The deal valued Skype at $2.75 billion, slightly less than eBay paid four years earlier. Silver Lake alone paid nearly a billion dollars for its stake —its biggest single investment ever. “Skype was embroiled in a lawsuit the day we signed and the investors were sued the following day after signing,” Mr. Durban said. But “we saw an unbelievable potential to transform this company.” “There was a lot of risk,” said Mark Wiseman, the executive vice president of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. “But we did our own due diligence, and we saw a lot of the same things that Microsoft saw — a dominant global brand, with a very solid, growing base of users, and a robust technology platform.” The investors and eBay settled the outstanding suits in late 2009. As part of the agreement, Skype acquired the intellectual property and a holding company owned by the founders received a 14 percent stake. Index Ventures also bowed out of the deal. With their legal issues behind them, Silver Lake and the other investors swiftly moved to spruce up Skype. Over the last two years, they have pushed the Internet company to increase its focus on development, shortened product cycles and forged new partnerships. Skype also moved to build out its services in the mobile and the enterprise space, both considered high-growth markets. Last year, for instance, the company started an application for Google’s Android mobile phones and signed a deal with Facebook. Since 2009, Skype’s staff has increased by more than 40 percent, to about 1,000 employees. Last October, the investors hired a new chief executive, Tony Bates, a veteran of Cisco Systems. “They invested a lot in making money and the quality of the service,” said Ted Schadler, an analyst with Forrester Research. “The move to hire Tony, a world-class I.T. executive, was a turning point — that move alone said they were growing up very rapidly.” The changes started to materialize in the numbers last year. Skype recorded $859.8 million in revenue and a net loss of $7 million in 2010, according to a recent filing. The previous year, the loss exceeded $300 million. Skype’s monthly users topped 170 million, nearly double the amount at the end of 2009. Skype’s improving fortunes started to attract the attention of potential suitors. Technology giants like Google and Facebook were actively looking at the company earlier this year, according to people who were close to the matter but not authorized to speak publicly. The casual talks put a deal in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. Speculation of a sale spurred Microsoft into action. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, who said that he had considered buying Skype in recent years, sent his chief financial officer, Peter W. Klein, to Silver Lake’s Silicon Valley offices to make an unsolicited offer. For several weeks, the various parties discussed the potential terms, talking about valuation, Skype’s long-term outlook and the role of the current management team. In mid-April, Microsoft settled on the price, agreeing to pay $8.5 billion, including the assumption of $725 million in debt. The deal was signed Monday night at 9:30 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time. While some worried that Microsoft paid too much, Skype’s investors stand to profit immensely. Silver Lake Partners netted nearly $3 billion in the deal, according to people close to the firm who were not authorized to talk publicly. Andreessen Horowitz, which initially invested $50 million, now has a stake valued at an estimated $200 million. The investment owned by the founders’ holding company is worth around $1.1 billion. Mr. Durban, who says he felt a pang of seller’s remorse, was ultimately happy with both the price and the buyer. It was, as he said, “an opportunity to get liquidity in full.” “It was very difficult for us to walk away.” Steve Lohr and Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed reporting.</text></article>

Long before Skype became the object of Microsoft’s desire, the big phone mobile companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T had slowly been increasing the price of Internet data usage on mobile phones, while lowering the cost of talk time. With good reason. It has also become increasingly obvious that people want the ability to video chat, whether for work or pleasure, and do it everywhere on any device. People won’t need cell networks or landlines to do it. There may have been some head scratching and debate Tuesday after Microsoft announced it would acquire Skype for $8.5 billion. Some questioned if it was a smart move for Microsoft to pay billions of dollars for an online communications company that could easily be usurped by a new and better product. But this actually could be one of the smartest consumer-forecasting moves Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, has made to date. First, Microsoft will now gain access to Skype’s 107 million users, who log about 100 minutes of conversation a month on the service. But more important, the acquisition of Skype will make Microsoft a serious contender in the multibillion-dollar telecommunications world — and the future of how people communicate globally. It is no secret that the majority of consumers will eventually move from landline telephones, or paying for mobile phone calls by the minute, and instead communicate over the Internet using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services like Skype. The Skype deal will catapult Microsoft to the forefront of this nascent form of communication, and will also add tremendous pressure to other technology companies that have been trying to prepare for the same future. Take Google and Apple for example. These two giants have been building their own Internet-enabled communications platforms for several years. Apple has been pushing its iChat and FaceTime products, both of which allow videoconferencing over the Web and mobile devices. Google has long been trying to gain customer adoption for its voice and video services too, including Google Voice and Google Chat. But there are problems with the Apple and Google approach. In many instances, these products don’t work across competing platforms. Apple users can’t video chat with Google or Windows customers. Although Google goes further with its attempt at universal availability, the company has come up against a number of roadblocks in its quest. If this conundrum existed with telephone companies today, people who use Verizon would not be able to talk to people who use T-Mobile. For consumers who have a number of computing and mobile platforms to chose from, the communications barriers set up by Google, Apple and others don’t help drive consumer adoption of these walled gardens. Skype doesn’t have this problem. Its free products work on Apple, Linux and Windows computers; Google Android and Apple iPhone platforms; and even some televisions. Now Microsoft will add Skype to its Windows Phone 7 devices, the Xbox gaming system, Web-based platforms and anything else with a Windows logo attached to it.</text></article>

In Skype, Microsoft is buying the leader in Internet voice and video communications, with 107 million users per month connected for more than 100 minutes a month on average. That large and active user base represents a major asset, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, said in an interview. “It’s an amazing customer imprint,” Mr. Ballmer said. “And Skype is a verb, as they say.” In an interview Mr. Ballmer never mentioned Google, Microsoft’s archrival whose name is used as a verb in Internet search — a market where Microsoft is spending heavily to try to catch Google, making some recent progress, but at great financial cost. Buying Skype, analysts say, gives Microsoft the upper hand in the fast-growing market for Internet communications, both for consumers and businesses. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The press release “Google is way behind Skype, and getting ahead of Google in this market was certainly an incentive for Microsoft,” said Leif-Olf Wallin, an analyst for Gartner in Sweden. Mr. Ballmer emphasized that Microsoft plans to expand Skype’s business and inject its voice-and-video technology across the spectrum of Microsoft products, from consumer offerings like Xbox to its Office productivity software. “There are a lot of great opportunities to optimize Skype services in Microsoft products,” Mr. Ballmer said. Despite its popularity, the service has struggled to maintain profitability. Since most of its services are free, Skype makes much of its income from a small group of users who pay for long distance calls to telephone numbers. In 2010, Skype recorded $859.8 million in revenue but reported a net loss of $7 million, according to a filing. Marc Andreessen — the co-founder of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in Skype — is optimistic about the company’s prospects under Microsoft, given the behemoth’s extensive lineup of products and various market opportunities. “Microsoft has extremely broad reach, they have a whole product portfolio that Skype can be attached to,” said Mr. Andreesen, whose firm bought a $50 million stake in Skype in 2009. “There’s all kinds of ways Skype can make money.” But Microsoft’s deal-making history is mixed. The company has often been a smart acquirer of start-ups and smaller companies, analysts say, picking off technical teams that are then folded into products likes Windows, Office and Internet Explorer. But during Mr. Ballmer’s tenure as chief executive, beginning in 2000, the company has also made far larger, riskier bids, most of which have been viewed as unsuccessful. In 2004, Microsoft entered into talks to buy the big business software company SAP, for about $50 billion, according to testimony that came out in a court case. In 2007, Microsoft acquired aQuantive, an online advertising company, for about $6 billion, a sizable premium, and some suggested it overpaid. Nearly three years ago, the company made a surprise $48 billion offer for Yahoo. Talks then broke off, and Microsoft withdrew its bid, but later reached a partnership to take over Yahoo’s search business. The Microsoft acquisition is the second time a technology giant has acquired Skype. In 2005, eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion with hopes of tightly integrating the service as a sales tool. But the deal never lived up to its promise and eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on its investment. Skype was sold several years later to a consortium of investors led by Silver Lake Partners, Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Mr. Andreessen, who co-founded Netscape Communications, was seen as a pivotal matchmaker for Skype, at one point trying to put it together with Facebook, another company for which he is on the board, according to people involved in the discussions. The Microsoft deal ends the speculation about the future of Skype. The company had been planning an initial public offering but delayed its debut last year, prompting talk that it would be sold to a company like Facebook, Google or Cisco Systems. Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer said, has looked at the possibility of acquiring Skype in recent years. But with Skype’s private equity investors known to be exploring a public offering for the company, Microsoft moved in early April. Peter Klein, chief financial officer, flew down to Silicon Valley and made an unsolicitied offer to the investor there, Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz. The negotiations accelerated in the last few weeks, Mr. Ballmer said, and the final agreement was signed on Monday night. The boards of both companies have approved the deal. “Microsoft and Skype share the vision of bringing software innovation and products to our customers,” said Tony Bates, the current head of Skype who will become the president of the newly created Microsoft Skype Division. “Together, we will be able to accelerate Skype’s plans to extend our global community and introduce new ways for everyone to communicate and collaborate.” Evelyn M.

The response from analysts and investors appears to depend on whether one thinks the strategic considerations outweigh the financial ones. Investors have answered collectively, sending shares of Microsoft down more than 1 percent in afternoon trading. And a number of analysts and others have questioned paying $8.5 billion for a company that lost $7 million last year and whose ability to be profitable has been questioned in the past. The price is more than double the value that an initial public offering of Skype was expected to offer. At 9.9 times 2010 revenue, Microsoft’s price tag is relatively expensive. UBS analysts say they are “lukewarm” on the deal, noting Microsoft’s “poor job at integrating larger transactions in the past.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: The Big Winners DealBook: Microsoft to Buy Skype DealBook: Ranking the Skype Acquisition Microsoft, in any case, can well afford the purchase, having more than $49 billion in cash on hand. One advantage available to Microsoft is that much of its cash is held overseas. Analysts at Collins Stewart say that 80 percent of Microsoft’s cash last quarter was in international balances. Skype is incorporated in Luxembourg and has its headquarters there, which means that Microsoft will be able to use its overseas cash for the most part without incurring a huge tax liability if it were to bring that cash back home to the United States. On a conference call to discuss the deal, Peter Klein, the chief financial officer of Microsoft, confirmed that the company “will be using overseas cash to make this transaction.” For analysts at CLSA, valuation is besides the point, given the lack of attractive companies to buy and with low yields on cash. “Simply put, an acquisition of Skype would be a better use of Microsoft’s $50 billion cash hoard than other likely alternatives.” Analysts at Gleacher say the true value of Skype is its large base of users. “We believe Skype customers will likely be introduced to various MSFT products and potentially boost many of MSFT’s businesses. We see an immediate opportunity for MSFT to introduce its search engine, Bing, to the Skype platform.” In the video below, Andrew Ross Sorkin, DealBook’s editor, talks with Sam Grobart, The New York Times personal technology editor, about how Microsoft can best capitalize on its acquisition.</text></article>

Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg NewsMicrosoft has shipped an estimated 2.5 million Windows Phone 7 handsets in the first quarter of this year. The deal could be a tremendous boost for Microsoft, which has struggled to stay relevant to consumers as both Apple and Google have steadily gained momentum and attracted devoted fans of their smartphones and mobile software. Buying Skype gives Microsoft direct access to popular mobile applications, videoconferencing and video chatting, which both Google and Apple have already enabled for their devices. It may also provide a pipeline to hundreds of millions of new customers around the world — a far cry from the 2.5 million Windows Phone 7 handsets the company is estimated to have shipped in the first quarter of this year, as Kevin Tofel of GigaOm pointed out earlier. But some analysts say wireless carriers may not be so quick to congratulate either company. Since Skype lets cellphone users make free or cheap calls over the carriers’ data networks, people could become less reliant on expensive unlimited voice plans, which in turn could cut into the amount of revenue that wireless carriers are able to bring in from their customers. Of course, Skype has been available for some time on a number of smartphones, including the iPhone and smartphones powered by the Android operating system. But Craig Moffett, an analyst who follows the telecommunications industry at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said that the stakes were raised when a giant hardware and software company decided to invest billions of dollars in such a service. “Microsoft putting its weight behind the service and company is a different story,” said Mr. Moffett. He said that the news could cool relations between Microsoft and wireless carriers — which would not bode well as the company is taking strides such as working with Nokia in an attempt to gain a lasting foothold in the smartphone industry. “Ultimately, the carriers have the final say in terms of what they choose to sell and market in their stores,” Mr. Moffett said. “”It’s not clear to me how they will convince the carriers that Skype is their friend.” AT&amp;T declined to comment on the Skype news. Verizon had not yet responded to requests for comment. On a press call Tuesday morning, Steven A. Ballmer, chief executive of Microsoft, showed no signs of concern about how wireless carriers might respond to the news. He said that he recognized that partnerships with carriers would be a crucial ingredient in helping to establish Windows Phones in the consumer marketplace. Even so, “everyone in the network and communications business knows the key to business acceleration is innovation in new scenarios,” Mr. Ballmer said. “Our opportunity to do that together has been enhanced.”</text></article>

Emerging in the aftermath of the dot-com bust, the company was highly coveted in its early years for its promising technology, which routed phone calls over the Internet for a nominal cost. Despite lackluster financials, Skype was acquired in 2005 by eBay for $3.1 billion, including additional performance payments. But Skype was not a good fit, and eBay eventually sold a controlling stake in the company several years later to a group of investors led by the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, and it took a $1.4 billion hit on the sale. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links DealBook: Microsoft to Buy Skype Now, several investors stand to benefit from Microsoft’s planned $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype, which was announced on Tuesday. Skype’s hodgepodge of owners, including a private equity firm, a pension fund and a venture capitalist, reflects its changing fortunes over the years. Here is a look at how investors could profit from their current stakes in Skype under the Microsoft deal. (Calculations are based on a valuation of $7.76 billion, which equals the purchase price minus outstanding debt.) Andreessen Horowitz In one of its first major deals, the venture capital firm — co-founded by Marc Andreessen, who helped start Netscape — bought a 3 percent stake in 2009 for $50 million, at a $2.75 billion valuation. The sale of Skype will be the first exit for Andreessen Horowitz. Estimated Value of Skype Investment: $200 million eBay International While it sold off the majority of Skype to investors in 2009, eBay still owns a 30 percent stake. According to a recent filing, eBay estimated its stake to be worth “approximately $620.0 million.” As a result of the Microsoft deal, that stake is now valued at $2.3 billion. Combined with the proceeds from its earlier transaction, EBay stands to capture more than $4 billion from the sale of Skype. Not a bad pay day, considering that eBay bought the company in a heavily criticized deal for $3.1 billion in 2005. Estimated Value: $2.3 billion Joltid In 2009, the founders of Skype, Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, sued Skype over patent issues. After a favorable settlement, the two founders held 14 percent of Skype and placed the investment in a holding company, Joltid. Estimated Value: $1.1 billion Silver Lake Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board In 2009, Silver Lake and a team of investors bought a controlling stake in Skype. After the legal settlement with Joltid, the investment group — which also included the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz — owned a 56 percent stake in Skype. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a $145 billion pension fund, often buys direct stakes in privately held companies, and holds investments in the communications company Avaya, the media company Clear Channel and the chip maker Freescale Semiconductor.

    <article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E7D71738F933A25756C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=microsoftcorporation">Microsoft Is Said to Be Near $8.5 Billion Deal to Buy Skype<date>Published: May 10, 2011</date><text>12:20 a.m. | Updated Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire Skype, which revolutionized telephone calls over the Internet, for $8.5 billion, including the assumption of debt, according to people involved in the negotiations. A deal is expected to be announced Tuesday morning, these people said, although they cautioned that the talks could still fall apart. A spokesman for Skype declined to comment, and calls to Microsoft were not returned. The acquisition would be Microsoft's largest ever and it is the software giant's effort to gain a foothold in the world of voice and video communications. Microsoft would be able leverage Skype's more than 600 million registered users into using its other products. For example, it could be connected to Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Kinect systems, and integrated into the company's flagship product, Office, as a way for business users to better collaborate. It could also help Bing, its search engine, which competes with Google. It may also help bolster Microsoft's fledging mobile telephone offering, which lags far behind Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems. The deal would end months of speculation in Silicon Valley about Skype's future. The company had been planning an initial public offering but delayed those plans last year, leading to persistent rumors that it would be sold to another technology giant like Facebook, Google or Cisco Systems. News of the deal and Microsoft's interest in Skype was first reported by The Wall Street Journal online and the technology site GigaOM. Skype has some 663 million registered users, the company said in a recent filing. Although most of its services are free, Skype makes the bulk of its profits from a small fraction of its users who pay for long distance calls to telephone numbers. Despite its popularity, the service has struggled to maintain profitability; in 2010, Skype made $859.8 million in revenue but recorded a net loss of $7 million, according to its filing. Skype burst onto the scene in 2003 and has long been seen as a challenger to the telephone companies because it can route phone calls - and video calls - over the Internet free or for a nominal fee. Most telephone carriers have come to accept Skype, but still see it as a potential threat. It is unclear how the wireless carriers that support handsets with Microsoft's operating system would view the deal and how tightly Microsoft would seek to integrate Skype into mobile. Microsoft, analysts say, is making a move to block Google from gaining greater ground in Internet communications. ''This is part of the strategic fight between Microsoft and Google,'' said Rob Enderle, an independent technology analyst. Facebook, Mr. Enderle said, has a large market value, but not the cash to do deals as Microsoft does. ''Microsoft is backing Facebook's play, and to some degree entering this fight on Facebook's side of this strategic confrontation with Google,'' he said. Microsoft, analysts say, has often been an astute acquirer of start-ups and smaller companies, picking off technical teams that are then folded into products likes Windows, Office and Internet Explorer. But during Steve Ballmer's tenure as chief executive, beginning in 2000, the company has also made far larger, riskier bids, mostly unsuccessful. In 2004, Microsoft entered into talks to buy the big business software company SAP, for about $50 billion, according to testimony that came out in a court case. In 2007, Microsoft acquired aQuantive, an online advertising company, for roughly $6 billion, a sizable premium, and some suggested it overpaid. Nearly three years ago, the company made a surprise $48 billion offer for Yahoo. Talks then broke off, and Microsoft withdrew its bid, but later reached a partnership to take over Yahoo's search business. If a deal for Skype is reached, it would be the second time a technology giant has acquired the company. EBay bought Skype in 2005 for $2.6 billion with hopes of tightly integrating the service as a sales tool. But the deal never lived up to its promise and eBay took a $1.4 billion write-down on its investment. Skype was sold in 2007 to a consortium of investors led by Silver Lake Partners, Index Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Marc Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, who co-founded Netscape Communications, was seen as a pivotal matchmaker for Skype, at one point trying to put it together with Facebook, another company for which he is on the board, according to people involved in the discussions. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are advising Skype. Evelyn M. Rusli and Verne Kopytoff contributed reporting. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

All those billions, but Microsoft’s “other” founder doesn’t receive the credit or respect he feels he deserves. Sure, those vast storehouses of cash Allen earned while he was still in his 20s have allowed him to buy a pair of big-name professional sports teams, the Seattle Seahawks and the Portland Trail Blazers. (He is also co-owner of a soccer team.) He can soothe his resentments riding the seas on a 414-foot yacht, tended to by a full-time crew of more than 50. The yacht holds a basketball court, a movie theater and a fully equipped recording studio, complete with killer ocean views, that has allowed him to rub shoulders with the fabulous — Mick Jagger, Bono, Paul McCartney and a long list of Page Six names that populate this memoir. “One of the greatest creative minds in the world of technology,” writes Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seahawks and therefore an Allen employee, in a blurb gracing the book’s back cover. Tellingly, no one remotely connected to the technology world echoes that sentiment.Allen works hard in the pages of “Idea Man” to prove Coach Carroll’s point that he is a tech visionary. He was in the 10th grade and Bill Gates in the 8th when they met in the computer room of the Seattle private school both attended. A few years later, in the mid-1970s, the two were eating pizza when Allen speculated about the possibility that one day people would read a newspaper via computer. Gates, Allen tells us, dismissed the idea as lame-brained. Ouch. There are a lot of moments like this in a memoir that isn’t so much Allen’s life story as an extended brief arguing that Paul Gardner Allen deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of pioneers who gave us our wired world — to prove, as Wired magazine once said of him, that he is not just the “accidental zillionaire.” Allen spends chapter after chapter arguing (sometimes convincingly) that he was as critical to the founding of Microsoft as his legendary former colleague — but the more he stays with the topic, the more plain it becomes that Microsoft would have been nothing without Gates. Recovering from Hodgkin’s disease but mainly just sick of fighting with his more forceful partner, Allen abruptly quit in 1983 to venture out on his own. Somehow Microsoft managed just fine without him. The book reads well. (Allen writes in the acknowledgments that Jeff Coplon, a seasoned ghost writer, “helped me to realize the book I had envisioned.”) And there’s a refreshing candor to the prose, too. Allen spends the better part of one chapter demonstrating how a meddlesome owner can foul up a basketball franchise; in another, he shows that being too smart by half can mess up a professional football team. He confesses to losing $8 billion investing in cable companies in the 2000s. And then there was his decision to sell the large stake he had amassed in AOL in the early 1990s. He kicks himself for letting Gates convince him that a pipsqueak like AOL stood no chance against Microsoft, but he also shares the colossal size of his blunder: selling, it turned out, was a $40 billion mistake. Yet bum advice and lapses of vision are hardly the worst Allen has to say about Gates. The Silicon Valley way had always been to divide ownership in a new startup 50-50, but Gates, the son of a prominent lawyer, had his own ideas about what was fair. Allen had the original idea for Microsoft. The two worked the same breakneck schedule in those feverish weeks when the company was born. Yet Gates wrote the program that served as Microsoft’s first product, whereas Allen did the less glamorous work of creating the tools Gates needed to do his job. Gates insisted on a 60-40 split; Allen passively agreed and then limply went along when Gates later proposed a 64-36 split because he had “done most of the work” and “gave up a lot to leave Harvard.” These and other similar anecdotes have been picked up by the business press, but Allen’s book is not nearly as bitter-sounding as those accounts suggested. He doesn’t seem mad so much as resigned to having been outfoxed by a junior titan who makes even Mark Zuckerberg look like a slacker. Reading Allen’s book one almost feels sorry for him, though not because of an unfair partnership agreement that ended up costing him billions. Is it possible to be beside the point in your own memoir? Allen, nondescript and conventional, pales next to Gates, who comes across here as more peculiar than repellent. Allen’s Gates, awkward and gangly, walks around with chronically orange hands because he licks Tang from his palm whenever he needs a late-night sugar high. His Gates guzzles a dozen cans of Coke a day, eats chicken with a spoon and seems to enjoy nothing so much as singing Sinatra’s “My Way” in full throat. Even Allen tacitly admits he himself is not nearly as interesting as those populating his world: he devotes all of two sentences to the startup he created after he had ventured off on his own, yet gives us page after page of how much better Microsoft might have fared had people there listened to his advice. And the author practically disappears in the last two-thirds of the book. He’s like Forrest Gump in his own autobiography. There’s Jagger chatting about gardens and Bono cajoling Mick to join in on a jam. But who’s that bland-looking bespectacled fellow in the picture? Oh, it’s his boat, his guitars. Allen is never so interesting as when he’s quoting others. He has only just met Paul McCartney but reports Sir Paul as saying, “Everyone wants to talk about John, John, John. You know, I wrote some songs, too.” That might have been a moment for the author to delve into his own psyche (“Bill, Bill, Bill, but I wrote some code, too, you know”). The book is supposedly a “memoir” — the word is right there on the cover — yet the author reveals almost nothing about himself. Peter Gabriel, he tells us, is the kind of person who will offer you a spot of afternoon tea. But after 350 pages, it’s not clear what kind Allen might be. “Idea Man” describes Allen as a “billionaire technologist and philanthropist.” There’s precious little philanthropy in this book, though, beyond the Allen Institute for Brain Science, a research facility he bankrolled shortly after his mother began struggling with dementia. On the philanthropy front his “partner in crime,” as he calls Gates, has bested him again. Allen mourns the old science fiction collection his mother sold for $75 so he creates the Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. He has adored Jimi Hendrix since childhood — so he spends $250 million building a Hendrix museum he names the Experience Music Project. Gates might have played his old high school chum at the birth of Microsoft, but at least he is trying to do good with all those extra billions that ended up in his pocket. Allen, in contrast, is the accidental billionaire who reveals himself to be little more than an overgrown kid playing with his money. Gary Rivlin, a former New York Times reporter, is the author of âThe Plot to Get Bill Gates.â His most recent book is âBroke, USA,â an investigation of businesses that cater to the working poor.Pity Paul Allen.

Many Windows XP users out there (not me) cling to their PCs, which came from a small storefront that had a “funny” software license for the operating system. Now they would like to upgrade to Windows 7, but experience strange messages from Microsoft. Is there any way to upgrade? A. To crack down on software piracy, Microsoft created its Genuine program so that only legitimate, licensed copies of its software were eligible for upgrades and support. When one tries to use a Windows 7 upgrade disc to update a computer running a counterfeit copy of Windows XP, the most likely result will be a screen full of software activation errors that derails the process. Buying the full version of Windows 7 (instead of the cheaper upgrade edition) and installing a fresh, legitimate copy of the system is one way to upgrade. This process does involve copying all the personal data from the computer to an external drive before installing Windows 7 — and then copying all the content back after the installation — but it should take care of those Microsoft messages. Just make sure the computer meets the Windows 7 requirements listed here.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/03/technology/03consoles.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Makers of Game Consoles Slow Pace of New Systems<date>Published: May 2, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — So much technology seems to get upgraded at Internet speeds. Not video game consoles, at least not anymore.Traditionally, console makers have upgraded their machines every five or six years. Nintendo intends to keep to that schedule. It said that it planned to sell a sequel to its five-year-old Wii in 2012. But Microsoft, the maker of the Xbox 360, and Sony, maker of the PlayStation 3, are taking their time with an update. Video game industry analysts said they expected that it would be 2014 before Microsoft sold a new Xbox and Sony upgraded its PlayStation. If that bears out — the two companies are not publicly discussing their plans — that will mean nine years between upgrades for Microsoft and eight for Sony. There are several reasons for extending the life of the consoles. But analysts said one reason predominates: cost. Microsoft and Sony invested hundreds of millions of dollars, the analysts said, to create machines so that they could handle intensive graphics and complex gameplay and survive the furious pace of game development. “Eight or nine years is longer than usual between cycles, but I think the world is rapidly changing,” said Anita Frazier, an analyst with NPD, a market research firm. Evan Wilson, a video game financial industry analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said both Microsoft and Sony were still trying to recoup their investments. “It’s less of a surprise that Nintendo is sticking to the traditional upgrade cycle than the fact that Microsoft and Sony are not,” Mr. Wilson said. He added: “It speaks to the fact that Microsoft and Sony both lost so much money.” As those companies were making such big investments, the companies began facing steeply intensifying competition for attention and consumer dollars from casual games. Today, big competition comes from the likes of Zynga’s Farmville on Facebook or Angry Birds on smartphones and tablets. Nintendo’s Wii, with its motion-control sensor and more basic graphics, is aimed at a more casual gamer — younger children, women and seniors who had not played console games. It exploded in popularity after it was released in 2006. Nintendo has sold 86 million systems worldwide, 41 million in the United States. Microsoft has sold 50 million Xbox 360s since the console’s release in 2005 and it has sold 10 million Kinect sensors, its own motion-control device. For its part, Sony has sold 50 million of the PlayStation 3, and eight million of its Move motion controllers. Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, said the company felt its heavy investment in the PlayStation 3, or PS3, technology, which included the Blu-ray movie format, was paying off. He said “the PS3 is now just hitting its stride.” Industry analysts said game software sales were increasing for Sony and Microsoft, while Nintendo’s sales of Wii games were on a sharp decline. The analysts also say they believe that Nintendo has a chance in redoing the Wii to make a play for the hard-core game crowd, which tends to favor graphics-intensive in-depth games. The greater resolution will also help the display of Netflix movies, which can be streamed from the device to a television. Those movies now look better fed through an Xbox or PlayStation box. Sony and Microsoft also have built and marketed their systems to be broader entertainment hubs for streaming high-definition movies, television shows and other digital content. Nintendo declined to comment on what consumers should expect from the new system. It said it would preview the machine at the annual E3 Expo, a gaming trade conference held in June in Los Angeles. Colin Sebastian, a video game industry analyst with Lazard Capital Markets, said Nintendo, despite having mined a new market of casual gamers, needed to do something innovative with the new system if the console was going to continue to grow. “If they just add high definition and some better online services and call it Wii 2, that would have a limited audience,” he said. “They need to do something more to innovate.”SAN FRANCISCO — So much technology seems to get upgraded at Internet speeds. Not video game consoles, at least not anymore.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/technology/29microsoft.html?ref=microsoftcorporation">Sales of Xbox and Kinect Help Lift Microsoft Earnings<date>Published: April 28, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft, once the dominant technology company, saw revenue from its core operating system software slip in the first three months of the year as consumers begin to shift to buying tablet computers that do not run on Microsoft software.While Microsoft reported Thursday that its fiscal third-quarter profits were up 31 percent, revenue from the division that includes the Windows operating system fell 4 percent, to $4.45 billion. The fall was due in part to an overall decline in PC sales worldwide of about 3.2 percent. Analysts have blamed the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, a big market for computers, for part of that decline. But the sales of tablet computers, like the iPad, were another major factor and that could become a persistent problem for Microsoft. The category of the tablet computer created by Apple and its iPad is expanding quickly. Apple has sold 19.5 million iPads, and all the big PC makers and cellphone makers are making tablets. Most of the tablets on the market run either Apple’s operating system software or Google’s Android software. Manufacturers have shown little interest in using Microsoft Windows software to run a tablet. Canalys, a technology market research firm, noted that when tablet computers are grouped with PCs, Apple becomes the fourth largest PC manufacturer in the world with almost 10 percent of the market. The three biggest PC makers, Hewlett-Packard, Acer and Dell, are all making tablets that don’t use Microsoft software. One other indication of Microsoft’s changing stature: for the first time, Apple’s quarterly profits exceeded Microsoft’s — $5.99 billion compared with $5.23 billion. Last year, Apple surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization and in revenue. “It’s a huge testament to Apple,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Financial. “There is clearly some disruption in the PCs.” However, Mr. Gillis noted that Microsoft Windows 7 is the fastest-selling operating system in history. He thinks Microsoft will probably make a move into tablets later this year with its expected release of Windows 8. In any case, Mr. Gillis said, “PCs aren’t going to disappear.” Microsoft also has found itself left behind in software for cellphones. It recently acted to ramp up its presence on mobile phones through an agreement with Nokia, the Finnish handset maker that is troubled, but still the largest makers of cellphones in the world. The two companies are working together on new mobile phones that would use Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system. Microsoft has seen declines in its operating software before, as recently as last year’s first fiscal quarter when it fell 4 percent. To be sure, other parts of the company’s business remain strong and helped Microsoft report Thursday that net income in its third quarter rose 31 percent to $5.23 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $4 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Revenue climbed 13 percent, to $16.43 billion, from $14.5 billion. The company’s Office software, where it has no significant competition, grew 21 percent, to $5.25 billion. Office 2010 is the fastest-selling version of Office ever, Microsoft said, with businesses deploying the software at five times the rate of its predecessor. However, revenue from Microsoft’s entertainment and devices, which includes the Xbox 360 video game console and the innovative Kinect game controller that interprets gestures and voice commands, gained 60 percent, to $1.94 billion. Kinect, a sensor that lets players interact with video games without having to hold a controller, did particularly well, selling 2.4 million units in the quarter. Customers bought 2.7 million Xbox 360s. Microsoft blamed the economy for the lower revenue from Windows. Consumers are saving their money rather than buying new computers, said Peter Klein, Microsoft’s chief financial officer. Asked in an interview about the impact of tablets on computer sales, he acknowledged that “it’s part of the story.” “There are a whole host of consumer purchases vying for the consumer wallet,” Mr. Klein said. Sales of Windows for consumers PCs fell 8 percent in the quarter, Microsoft said. Windows for netbooks, the small laptops that had been big sellers until tablets came along, declined 40 percent, highlighting the rapid shift in computer buying habits. Revenue from Microsoft’s online properties like the MSN portal and Bing search engine rose 14 percent, to $648 million. The unit lost $726 million in operating income, continuing a pattern of losses. Two years ago, Microsoft signed an agreement to take over Yahoo’s search business to create a more formidable rival to Google. However, Yahoo’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz, said last week that the partnership had not yielded the expected financial results for Yahoo and that technical glitches by Microsoft were to blame. Downbeat reports about personal computer shipments in early 2011 had raised questions about Microsoft’s future dominance. Microsoft has developed an operating system for smartphones, but it is on relatively few phones. It does not have software that makers of tablet computers want. In after-hours trading, Microsoft’s shares lost 1.4 percent. They had ended regular trading at $26.71, up 33 cents, or 1.25 percent.SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft, once the dominant technology company, saw revenue from its core operating system software slip in the first three months of the year as consumers begin to shift to buying tablet computers that do not run on Microsoft software.</text></article>
