There were puzzle games, kids’ games and shoot-‘em-up games, but strangely, none of my sources mentioned word games. Let’s remedy that, with a couple of oldies and one new game that will give word lovers reason to call in sick tomorrow. That new game is W.E.L.D.E.R. ($2 on Apple), which is short for Word Examination Laboratory for Dynamic Extraction and Reassessment. It’s wordy. Get it? Players are given a game board of 64 tiles with random letters and blank wild-card tiles and bonus tiles, à la Scrabble. The trick is to create words by swapping letters, but if you use too many swaps, you lose. Start it, and watch the hours fly by. Scrabble players who are great at using one or two letters to build multiword combinations will probably dominate the action. If there’s a flaw in W.E.L.D.E.R., it’s that you can’t play against an opponent in real time. Still, it’s beautifully done, and you will invariably learn a new word or two in every hour you play. (Check out the cute trailer here.) But if head-to-head word search is your thing, you need Wurdle ($2 on Apple), another fiercely addictive game. It may be my favorite mobile game to play with, and against, my children. Wurdle and W.E.L.D.E.R. aren’t on Android, but 7 Little Words (free on Android and Apple for the first 30 puzzles, with additional game packs available for $1 each) is a good alternative. Players receive seven clues to unlock seven mystery words that are scattered in pieces on the game board. It’s a lot more benign than, say, shredding zombies with an M-16, but when you look at what the game does to your workday productivity, it can be pretty gruesome.</text></article>

Had enough of Steve Jobs? Didn’t think so. In the current issue of The New Yorker, Malcolm Gladwell dissects Walter Isaacson’s biography of Mr. Jobs, and we read what Mr. Gladwell read, and we decided to write about what he wrote about what Mr. Isaacson wrote about. It’s a meta-world, why fight it? Yes, there are plenty of juicy asides about Mr. Jobs’s legendary prickliness — he was picky right to the end, running through 67 nurses in his final visit to the hospital before he found three he liked — but Mr. Gladwell burrows in on the nature of genius, specifically asking the question of what Mr. Jobs was good at. To shed light on the light-bulb thinking that drove Mr. Jobs’s successes, Mr. Gladwell rows back to the very beginnings of the industrial revolution. In 1779, Samuel Crompton, a retiring genius from Lancashire, invented the spinning mule, which made possible the mechanization of cotton manufacture. Yet England’s real advantage was that it had Henry Stones, of Horwich, who added metal rollers to the mule; and James Hargreaves, of Tottington, who figured out how to smooth the acceleration and deceleration of the spinning wheel; and William Kelly, of Glasgow, who worked out how to add water power to the draw stroke; and John Kennedy, of Manchester, who adapted the wheel to turn out fine counts; and, finally, Richard Roberts, also of Manchester, a master of precision machine tooling — and the tweaker’s tweaker. He created the “automatic” spinning mule: an exacting, high-speed, reliable rethinking of Crompton’s original creation. Such men, the economists argue, provided the “micro inventions necessary to make macro inventions highly productive and remunerative.” Mr. Gladwell concludes that despite the encomiums that described Mr. Jobs as a sweeping visionary, he was really more of a noodge with really good taste, one who was more than happy to take credit for — and make money off of — other people’s ideas. He writes, “Jobs’s sensibility was editorial, not inventive,” and uses Mr. Isaacson’s book to describe the dynamic between Mr. Jobs and Jonathan Ive, Apple’s designer-in-chief. Even within Apple, Jobs was known for taking credit for others’ ideas. Jonathan Ive, the designer behind the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone, tells Isaacson, “He will go through a process of looking at my ideas and say, ‘That’s no good. That’s not very good. I like that one.’ And later I will be sitting in the audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea.” The young writer and technology activist Aaron Swartz was similarly taken with the Jobs-Ive relationship described in Mr. Isaacson’s book. In a blog post, Mr. Swartz writes about how Ive, ” ‘so instinctively nice,’ found himself puzzled about how his good friend could be so mean.” Every time a great person dies, there will be a cycle like this: collective grief, unalloyed kaddish and then a backlash that puts clay around the feet of the person being deified. But rarely does the cycle get to feast on a book as deep and serious as Mr. Isaacson’s. Having a window into a man’s life at the exact moment he leaves this mortal coil will provide fodder for many years to come.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/opinion/sunday/is-the-iphone-replacing-the-motorcycle.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Is the iPhone Replacing the Motorcycle?<date>Published: November 5, 2011</date><text>ARE motorcycles passé? Are they sort of over? I ask as a rider of two-wheel Italian beauties that go very fast, gracefully streamlined subsonic technology from the Ducati factory in Bologna. I own two sport bikes and two racers. I ride racing motorcycles on the street. One of my motorcycles is capable of nearly 200 miles an hour. I write prose about motorcycles. I write poems about motorcycles. So I ask with some authority. Are motorcycles — even superb and lovely Italian motorcycles from the land of Donatello and Bertolucci — being replaced as love objects, as arm candy, by other more contemporary show-off desirables? Electronic ones. Mostly made by Apple. The iPhone 4S, the iPad 2, the 11-inch and 13-inch thin, light MacBook Air computers — these are the sleek gorgeousness young people go on about, have to have, and do have, in the millions. These machines, famous for the svelte dignity of their designs — and of course, far less expensive than a motorcycle — are a lens to see the world through and to do your work on. It’s their operating speeds that thrill. Young people cut a bella figura on their electronic devices. Now, of course, it is not just the young who buy Apple products. I lay emphasis on the young, particularly young men, because they are the ones who might otherwise be buying motorcycles, and aren’t, at least not at all in the numbers they did before the economic downturn. The great recession was disastrous for motorcycle sales around the country, especially, it seems, for sport bikes, the ones that perform with brio but have no practical point to make. In other words, they are not bikes to tour on, they are not a comfortable way for you and a companion — wife or partner or friend — to travel to work or to a distant campground. You can do it, but it’s not ideal. Young riders were not buying motorcycles of any kind, and especially, it seems, not sport bikes. Or, to say it another way, it’s as if the recession induced a coma in all the potential new motorcyclists, and in so many of the already experienced motorcyclists, from which they woke changed, changed utterly, and found themselves standing in line outside an Apple store, patiently waiting to buy the latest greatness. They are buying a slice of what Apple does — and how it does it — and how it looks doing it. They are buying function but, just as important, they are buying glamour. The device enhances the buyer’s sense of self. It helps the person think and at the same time not think. Once, not so long ago, motorcycles did the same thing. In a few days, at the International Motorcycle Show in Milan, Ducati will introduce a radically new sport bike called the Panigale, after Borgo Panigale, the neighborhood on the outskirts of Bologna where the Ducati factory is. The Ducati people are being secretive about how the Panigale will look and how it will perform. But there have been spy photos of the bike being tested on the Mugello circuit, with the former World Superbike champion Troy Bayliss aboard, and plenty of rumors and speculation about the tech specs. We know this much. It will make brave hearts beat faster. It will weigh less than its predecessor. It will have a new sort of frame. It will have an ingenious new exhaust system. It will handle. It will be fast. It will be beautiful. How many Ducati followers — the Ducatisti — will have to have one? Some. Oh, for the days — not so long ago — when a boy’s world would have fallen to its knees before a new Ducati design. In Dallas, at Advanced Motorsports, his motorcycle dealership, Jeff Nash, a gentleman and one of the great Ducati racebike tuners in America, and a racer himself, deplores the passivity of the young who would rather be home with their iPads playing computer games than astride the red-meat lightning of an 1198 Superbike blazing down a Texas highway making that unmistakable growling deep Ducati sound. Mr. Nash would go further. Better to be out in the air astride just about any motorcycle alive!

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/05/technology/apple-woos-educators-with-trips-to-silicon-valley.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Apple Woos Educators With Trips to Silicon Valley<date>Published: November 4, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Three times over the last two years, school officials from Little Falls, Minn., have escaped the winter cold for two-day trips to Silicon Valley. Their destination: the headquarters of Apple.In visits the officials described as inspirational, they checked out the company’s latest gadgets, discussed the instructional value of computers with high-level Apple executives and engineers, and dined with them and other educators at trendy restaurants. Apple paid for meals and their stay at a nearby inn. The visits paid off for Apple too — to the tune of $1.2 million in sales. In September, Little Falls handed out iPads to 1,700 of its 2,500 students at a celebration in the school gym. And a few days earlier, 200 teachers got a pep talk via video chat from an Apple executive whom the school superintendent had come to know during his company visits. “Both my visits there have been extraordinary,” said Curt Tryggestad, superintendent of the Little Falls Community Schools, who visited Cupertino in 2010 and earlier this year. “I was truly amazed to sit in a room with Apple vice presidents, people who were second in command to Steve Jobs.” The demand for technology in classrooms has given rise to a slick and fast-growing sales force. Makers of computers and other gear vigorously court educators as they vie for billions of dollars in school financing. Sometimes inviting criticism of their zealous marketing, they pitch via e-mail, make cold calls, arrange luncheons and hold community meetings. But Apple in particular woos the education market with a state-of-the art sales operation that educators say is unique, and that, public-interest watchdogs say, raises some concerns. Along with more traditional methods, Apple invites educators from around the country to “executive briefings,” which participants describe as equal parts conversation, seminar and backstage pass. Such events might seem unremarkable in the business world, where closing a deal can involve thinly veiled junkets, golf outings and lavish dinners. But the courtship of public school officials entrusted with tax dollars is a more sensitive matter. Some critics say the trips could cast doubt on the impartiality of the officials’ buying decisions, which shape the way millions of students learn. Mike Dean, a spokesman for Common Cause of Minnesota, a nonpartisan group that promotes open government, was critical of the Apple visits, calling them “influence peddling.” He said he believed that a Minnesota law prohibiting government officials from accepting “anything of value” from contractors would apply to the hotel stay and dinners. And he said Apple was offering an experience that made potential buyers feel like insiders. “There is a geek culture that very much worships Apple, and they’re feeding into that to get more contracts.” Apple declined to discuss the executive briefings. Natalie Kerris, a spokeswoman for the company, said education was “in its DNA.” As to the public employees who participate in the trips, Ms. Kerris said: “We advise them to follow their local regulations.” Broadly, efforts by technology vendors to get close to educators are becoming more sophisticated, said John Richards, an adjunct lecturer at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard, where he teaches about education and technology. “What the textbook sellers had perfected for years has moved into the high-tech world,” said Mr. Richards, who also works as a consultant for technology companies in the education market. The sales pitches come as questions persist about how effective high-tech products can be at improving student achievement. The companies say their products engage students and prepare them for a digital future, while some academics say technology is not fulfilling its promise. Even Mr. Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, turned skeptical about technology’s ability to improve education. In a new biography of Mr. Jobs, the book’s author, Walter Isaacson, describes a conversation earlier this year between the ailing Mr. Jobs and Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, in which the two men “agreed that computers had, so far, made surprisingly little impact on schools — far less than on other realms of society such as media and medicine and law.” 1 2 3 Next Page » Nick Wingfield contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/05/us/david-gelernter-discusses-patent-claim-against-apple.html?ref=applecomputerinc">David Gelernter Discusses Patent Claim Against Apple<date>Published: November 4, 2011</date><text>WOODBRIDGE, Conn. — David Gelernter is known for many things. As a pioneering computer scientist, he first earned renown by connecting computers together into collaborative networks. Then in 1993, he gained the kind of fame no one wants, as a victim of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who mailed a pipe bomb to his office at Yale University that left him gravely injured.Professor Gelernter had to fight for his life then. Now he is fighting to prove his contention that his innovations were pirated by Apple for its computers, iPhones and iPads. He did it once, and a company whose original incarnation he co-founded won a stunning jury verdict, but then an extraordinary judicial ruling took it all away. He has said little publicly about the case, and Apple did not provide comment. But with the appeal now under way, he agreed to talk about it — including an internal Apple e-mail from Steve Jobs that left one patent law expert not affiliated with the case saying, simply, “Wow.” Last October, a jury awarded $625 million to Professor Gelernter’s company, Mirror Worlds. The verdict, one of the largest patent awards in history, seemed an astonishing windfall for the professor, now 56. “I had the feeling of everybody looking at me and thinking, ‘There’s a half billion dollars on the hoof!’ A private jet service sent an invitation to ‘join our elite clientele.’ ” Business Insider ran a photo of him with “I’m Rich!” scrawled on it. And then it was gone. In April, in an unusual move, Judge Leonard Davis of the United States District Court overruled the jury. He wrote that the patents were valid, but that the company had not proved that Apple had infringed them. “Mirror Worlds may have painted an appealing picture for the jury,” Judge Davis wrote, “but it failed to lay a solid foundation sufficient to support important elements it was required to establish under the law.” When Joseph Diamante, the lead lawyer for Mirror Worlds, called his client about the decision, he was distraught at having to deliver such bad news. But Professor Gelernter gently said, “Joe, I’ve been through worse.” The bomb that exploded in June 1993 blinded Professor Gelernter in one eye and severely damaged his right hand, which he covers with a glove. He suffered extensive internal injuries as well, and a legacy of surgeries and chronic pain. But, as Mr. Diamante learned, David Hillel Gelernter does not let trouble daunt him. He sent an upbeat e-mail to colleagues less than two months after the bombing that said, “All in all, I am the luckiest man alive (emphasis on alive). Surviving the explosion was evidently a pretty neat trick on my part,” he wrote, and joked that in computer science, “one decent typing hand and an intact head is all you really need.” Long comfortable in the academic realm, where his work anticipated the interactivity of the World Wide Web and cloud computing, he tried business. Mirror Worlds (the name came from one of his offbeat books about adapting technology to people instead of the other way around) offered a way to break out of the numberless files and folders that clutter computer desktops and make information hard to find. The product, Scopeware, created a stream of varied documents — word-processing files, e-mail, calendar items and presentations — in a row of icons stretching into the past and future. Users could slide the icons back and forth to view them. George Gilder, the technology analyst, called it “elegant, easy, natural and beautiful,” and predicted, “It will prevail.” It did not, at least as part of Mirror Worlds. The company marketed its product to businesses and state agencies across the country, but sales never really took off, and the company closed its doors in 2004. From 2005 on, Apple introduced new versions of its software, and elements of three fundamental new technologies — Spotlight, Cover Flow and Time Machine — looked and behaved more than a little like Professor Gelernter’s brainchildren. Mirror Worlds, now owned by a hedge fund, sued Apple in 2008 in Tyler, Tex., a place with a reputation for friendliness toward infringement claims. Among the documents obtained from Apple was the e-mail Mr. Jobs sent in 2001 to his lieutenants after seeing an article in The New York Times about Scopeware. “Please check out this software ASAP,” he wrote. “It may be something for our future, and we may want to secure a license ASAP.” An Apple executive at the time said in a deposition that “this was the first time I recall having received a specific mail to look at a company or its technology” from Mr. Jobs. Apple subsequently met with Mirror Worlds, but nothing came of the discussions. Jeanne C. Fromer, a patent law expert at Fordham Law School in New York, called the e-mail from Mr. Jobs “as close as you get to a smoking gun.” Peter J. Toren, a patent litigator, summed up with a single word: “Wow.” The jury seemed to agree. The enormous verdict pushed a hot button in the technology world, where those who sue technology companies are often derided as greedy patent trolls. But Mr. Toren said Professor Gelernter is “not a patent troll — this is clearly a brilliant guy” who “clearly had a case.” The rumpled scholar sat discussing the dispute on a recent afternoon in his high-ceilinged living room, which was crowded with books and his paintings. A parrot named Ike provided the occasional squawk, and sunlight streamed over the 400 pipes of an organ that his older son, Daniel, bought and rebuilt by hand after discovering it, unused, in the basement of Yale’s Woolsey Hall. On Professor Gelernter’s desk sat a large-screen iMac. Of Mr. Jobs, he spoke of a kinship. “He was, above all, a designer. I am, above all, a painter. I care about aesthetics.” One of the greatest joys of the long recovery from “when I was blown up,” he said, was realizing that he could paint with his left hand. As for the money, he said he did not know precisely what his share of any verdict might be. “I have 2 percent of something,” he said. As much as he acknowledges that the money matters, what he wants most of all, he said, is to see the record reflect his role. “I know my ideas — our ideas — when I see them on a screen,” he said. “Whatever happens in the end with the appeal, the six months of vindication between the jury verdict and the judge’s decision were worth many lifetimes of some cheaper pleasure.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/fashion/the-steve-jobs-backlash.html?ref=applecomputerinc">The Steve Jobs Backlash<date>Published: November 2, 2011</date><text>THE glowing obituaries appeared moments after Steve Jobs’s death was announced on Oct. 5. “Silicon Valley’s radiant Sun King,” eulogized The San Jose Mercury News. His name was floated for Time magazine’s Person of the Year, though the honor traditionally goes to the living. Even Gawker, the snarky media blog, adopted the sober tone of a state funeral.“The scope of Jobs’s achievements is hard to put into words,” Gawker wrote in a respectful 1,200-word post simply titled “Steve Jobs Is Dead.” That tone lasted 18 hours. By 2 p.m. the following day, Gawker posted another item, “Steve Jobs Was Not God.” It argued: “If you like Apple products, fine. They are products. They do not have souls. They are not heroes, and neither is their creator, no matter how skilled he may have been.” It wasn’t just Gawker. The waters quickly muddied after the first wave of obituaries passed. Thanks to Facebook and Twitter, anyone with a beef against Mr. Jobs or Apple found a platform to sound off about an industrialist who doubled as a pop star. The Steve Jobs backlash began as quickly as the mythmaking had. Candlelight vigils were just starting to form outside Apple stores worldwide when bloggers began their assault. “Was Steve Jobs a Good Man, or an Evil Corporate CEO and Wall Street Shill?” asked a contributor on the Occupy Wall Street Web site. Then, on the Forbes site, David Coursey, a technology writer, wrote an article called “Steve Jobs Was a Jerk, You Shouldn’t Be,” in which he suggested that Mr. Jobs might have been “a borderline sociopath.” There was a time when the gloves stayed put after the death of a legend. After John Lennon was murdered in 1980, news outlets generally painted him as a guitar-strumming prince of peace, and were loath to dwell on old tabloidish tales of him as a skirt-chasing druggie who was mean to Paul. But the velocity with which Steve the Saint stories morphed into Steve the Sinner stories was striking, said Kurt Andersen, the novelist and former New York magazine editor. “It’s the speed of the news cycle writ large, in terms of legacy and existential worth,” he said. On Twitter, while Apple cultists wrote 140-character homages, nonbelievers passed along snipes about Steve the Tyrant, Steve the Evil Boss, Steve the Micromanaging Perfectionist. As for the mainstream press, it cleared its throat, straightened its tie and dived into the fray with the rest of them. Five days after Mr. Jobs’s death, the British news magazine The Week published a roundup of “anti-Jobs” stories. It included an essay titled “In Praise of Bad Steve” by a writer named D. B. Grady in The Atlantic (“Apple wasn’t built by a saint. It was built by an iron-fisted visionary”); a 2010 investigation in The Mail in England into the “Chinese suicide sweatshop” where iPods are made; and an Op-Ed article in The New York Times by Mike Daisey, a monologist, who pounded Apple for what he saw as Orwellian tactics (“There is no tech company that looks more like the Big Brother from Apple’s iconic 1984 commercial than Apple itself”). Mr. Daisey is no stranger to the Jobs backlash. He in an extemporaneous one-man show, “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs,” that, by coincidence, opened at the Public Theater on Oct. 17, making its New York debut after touring for 14 months. The play blasts Apple and other technology companies for alleged harsh conditions in their factories. The fortuitous timing of his show’s opening in New York prompted a deluge of hate mail and a couple of death threats, Mr. Daisey said, but he was unfazed. “Are we seriously going to read one more time he was a genius?” he said. “By not sharing anything of his dark side, the complexities of his life, you’re sort of shortchanging the true complexity and interestingness of the story.” And, of course, there is the publication of Walter Isaacson’s 630-page authorized biography, “Steve Jobs.” While the book is hardly a hatchet job, bloggers looking for a fresh angle skimmed it for juicy bits, like how Mr. Jobs, in the early days of Apple, stiffed an original employee, who was a close friend, on stock options. But Mr. Isaacson, who worked with Mr. Jobs on the book for two and a half years, said that it was not fair to Mr. Jobs, or the book, to cherry-pick the Bad Steve anecdotes. “The way the book turns out, he developed a very loyal team who was very inspired by him, and he has a very loving family,” Mr. Isaacson said. “In the end, you have to judge him on the outcome.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 3, 2011 The previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Mr. Daisey produced the one-man show, “The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs.” </text></article>

As Jerry Garrett explains, it’s a simpler, more elegant concept than its name would suggest. LAS VEGAS — Despite there being 1,500 customized vehicles on display at the Specialty Equipment Market Association event here, it is not a car show. Not officially, anyway. It’s a showcase for automotive products. Through Saturday, tens of thousands of them are arrayed throughout nearly three million square feet of exhibition and demonstration space. Of these, SEMA officials evaluate more than 2,000 brand-new products and bestow awards on the best, in several categories. The most prestigious of these is the Best Engineered New Product blue ribbon, and this year it went to Baer, the brake manufacturer, for its Tracker Full Floating Axle Conversion unit. It’s a swap-out kit for traditional flanged axles that use a single axle bearing to support the weight of the vehicle. The idea here is to eliminate an old-fashioned part that can flex and break under heavy loads. The Tracker can also be an important intermediate step to updating and replacing old braking systems with modern discs. The Tracker installation does not eliminate the parking brake. Another winner was a carburetor-to-electronic fuel-injection conversion kit from MSD. The Atomic EFI master kit is comprised of a fuel-injection system shaped like a carburetor; the carburetor is removed, the EFI module bolts right into its place; a couple of plug-and-play digital boxes snap into place; a fuel line is run to the unit; and a line to an exhaust manifold O2 sensor completes the installation. No fuel return line is needed. Jerry Garrett for The New York TimesMSD Atomic EFI, a modular electronic fuel-injection replacement unit for your old, antediluvian carburetor. At $2,290, it better be. “Change it in the morning; go cruising that evening,” said company literature. There is no need for a technician to tune it, as it tunes itself with computer logic. Auto Meter, the gauge maker, won three awards — one for a universal-mount three-gauge unit, with up to 25 gauges to choose from; a speedometer that is controlled by GPS satellite signals, not the car; and a Web site that allows the customer to design gauge packages by type, lighting color, faceplate design and dozens of other criteria. Jerry Garrett for The New York TimesAuto Meter’s GPS speedometer and universal three-gauge mount. The award for the best new tire went to Continental for its CrossContact LX, an all-season tire that combines the seemingly contradictory characteristics of excellent wet braking, long wear and fuel efficiency. Some award-winning technologies leveraged the iPhone, a technology platform that seemed to have hundreds of unexplored possibilities for the auto industry. Escort, maker of Beltronics-branded radar detectors, won an award for a new technology that, with a special cable hookup, would send radar-trap data to a cloud computing storage system, to be processed and sent back out to other Escort customers via an Apple-approved app. And SCT Performance also won an award for a new Apple-based mobile technology that would allow tuners to wirelessly recalibrate parameters like horsepower output and throttle response on their vehicles.</text></article>

While most of the complaints by consumers seem to have been from customers who bought the new iPhone 4S, Apple said the software bugs are in iOS 5, a new version of Apple’s operating system that also runs older models of the iPhone and the iPad. “A small number of customers have reported lower-than-expected battery life on iOS 5 devices,” Apple said in a statement. “We found a few bugs that are affecting battery life and will release a software update to address those in a few weeks.” Natalie Harrison, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to provide more detail about the nature of the software bugs. Apple typically provides bug fixes and other features in software updates that users first download to their computers, then install on their iPhones and iPads through iTunes.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/new-iphone-faces-battery-complaints/?ref=applecomputerinc">New iPhone Faces Battery Complaints<date>October 31, 2011, 6:59 pm</date><text>The introduction of a new iPhone wouldn’t be complete without at least one baffling technical problem ticking off customers. The iPhone 4S hasn’t disappointed in that regard. Tony Avelar/Bloomberg NewsThe Apple iPhone 4S. The discussions forums on Apple’s Web site are ablaze with comments from iPhone 4S customers about the poor battery life of the new Apple phone. Many of the people complaining say the battery on the iPhone 4S seems to drain quickly even when they’re not using the device much and even after they have shut down some of the power-hungry features that can affect battery performance. “My iPhone 4s battery life is terrible,” one person on the forums posted. “I’m always experiencing a 10-15% drop per hour. I unplugged my phone this morning at 8:20 and it’s now 12:15 and my battery is on 53%. I have almost everything turned off that you possibly can.” For now, Apple isn’t saying anything about the issue – a spokeswoman didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment – in what has become a typical pattern of silence for the company after customers begin complaining about a technical problem with a new iPhone. Often Apple waits to speak out on issues like this after several days of investigating the matter. In the meantime, iPhone customers are left troubleshooting the problem themselves, coming up with workarounds that may or may not alleviate the problem. The Guardian reported that some iPhone customers had seen improved battery life by shutting off a feature called “Setting Time Zone” buried within the location services menu of iPhone settings. That feature automatically adjusts the time zone settings of an iPhone when a user travels. Turning it off means the clock on users’ phones won’t adjust unless they manually change it. Some people on Apple’s discussion forums still report poor battery life even after making the change. Battery complaints about new iPhones aren’t new, but they have generally failed to grow into controversies as big as the mother of all iPhone blow-ups, known as Antennagate. In that case, the iPhone 4 introduction last year was met with a wave of bad publicity and customer complaints about dropped phone calls and weak wireless signals. Apple eventually conceded that the problems were caused by the design of the iPhone 4’s antenna and offered customers free protective cases to remedy the problem. Apple also said at the time that the antenna problems had been overblown and that only a small portion of its customers complained about them. The company appeared to be vindicated after the gangbuster iPhone 4 sales that followed.</text></article>

Apple’s new Find My Mac feature, designed to pinpoint the physical location of your computer on a map in case the machine ever goes missing, does not need to reply on a GPS chip. Like the similar Find My iPod and Find My iPad features for devices without true GPS capabilities, Find My Mac can get the an approximate location of the computer using a database of Wi-Fi hotspots and other information. Find My Mac is part of Apple’s iCloud service of online backup, streaming and storage tools for computers running Mac OS X 10.7 — and iPads, iPhones and iPod Touch devices running the new iOS 5 software. Apple has more information on using iCloud with a Mac here. Your Mac’s location is an appealing bit of data for advertisers and Web sites because it can help them provide more geographically appropriate information on your screen. If you’d rather keep your Mac’s whereabouts to yourself, you can turn off the Location Services component of Mac OS X. Apple has information on doing that for Mac OS X 10.7 and Mac OS X 10.6.</text></article>

On the surface, this should not have been much of an issue. You’d assume the obvious answer was: he was really, really smart. Maybe even worth three or four reallys. After all, he was the most innovative and successful business leader of our era and embodied the Silicon Valley dream writ large: he created a start-up in his parents’ garage and built it into the world’s most valuable company.But I remember having dinner with him a few months ago around his kitchen table, as he did almost every evening with his wife and kids. Someone brought up one of those brainteasers involving a monkey’s having to carry a load of bananas across a desert, with a set of restrictions about how far and how many he could carry at one time, and you were supposed to figure out how long it would take. Mr. Jobs tossed out a few intuitive guesses but showed no interest in grappling with the problem rigorously. I thought about how Bill Gates would have gone click-click-click and logically nailed the answer in 15 seconds, and also how Mr. Gates devoured science books as a vacation pleasure. But then something else occurred to me: Mr. Gates never made the iPod. Instead, he made the Zune. So was Mr. Jobs smart? Not conventionally. Instead, he was a genius. That may seem like a silly word game, but in fact his success dramatizes an interesting distinction between intelligence and genius. His imaginative leaps were instinctive, unexpected, and at times magical. They were sparked by intuition, not analytic rigor. Trained in Zen Buddhism, Mr. Jobs came to value experiential wisdom over empirical analysis. He didn’t study data or crunch numbers but like a pathfinder, he could sniff the winds and sense what lay ahead. He told me he began to appreciate the power of intuition, in contrast to what he called “Western rational thought,” when he wandered around India after dropping out of college. “The people in the Indian countryside don’t use their intellect like we do,” he said. “They use their intuition instead ... Intuition is a very powerful thing, more powerful than intellect, in my opinion. That’s had a big impact on my work.” Mr. Jobs’s intuition was based not on conventional learning but on experiential wisdom. He also had a lot of imagination and knew how to apply it. As Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.” Einstein is, of course, the true exemplar of genius. He had contemporaries who could probably match him in pure intellectual firepower when it came to mathematical and analytic processing. Henri Poincaré, for example, first came up with some of the components of special relativity, and David Hilbert was able to grind out equations for general relativity around the same time Einstein did. But neither had the imaginative genius to make the full creative leap at the core of their theories, namely that there is no such thing as absolute time and that gravity is a warping of the fabric of space-time. (O.K., it’s not that simple, but that’s why he was Einstein and we’re not.) Einstein had the elusive qualities of genius, which included that intuition and imagination that allowed him to think differently (or, as Mr. Jobs’s ads said, to Think Different.) Although he was not particularly religious, Einstein described this intuitive genius as the ability to read the mind of God. When assessing a theory, he would ask himself, Is this the way that God would design the universe? And he expressed his discomfort with quantum mechanics, which is based on the idea that probability plays a governing role in the universe by declaring that he could not believe God would play dice. (At one physics conference, Niels Bohr was prompted to urge Einstein to quit telling God what to do.) 1 2 Next Page » Walter Isaacson is the author of âSteve Jobs.â</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/technology/with-new-smartphones-high-hopes-for-nokia-and-microsoft.html?ref=applecomputerinc">With New Smartphones, High Hopes for Nokia and Microsoft Union<date>Published: October 26, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, introduced two smartphones on Wednesday, the first fruits of its alliance with Microsoft, in a bid to curb its declining market share.Nokia’s chief executive, Stephen A. Elop, presented the Lumia 800, a 420 euro ($584) touch-screen device, and the Lumia 710, a 270 euro handset at a company product introduction. Both devices are being sold in six European countries and will be sold later this year in parts of Asia. Other smartphones are planned for the United States, but not until early next year. Analysts said the Nokia smartphones, the result of an eight-month collaboration with Microsoft, could also help Microsoft extend its dominant computer software business into the cellphone and mobile device market. The software has received positive reviews, but few handset makers are using it. The new lineup aims to revive Nokia’s tarnished reputation as an innovative force in mobile phones, an industry it pioneered and dominated until Apple and Google, helped by more user-friendly software, wrested control of the smartphone business four years ago. “Nokia really needed this to happen today, and this is a new start for the company,” said Pete Cunningham, an analyst based in London with the research firm Canalys. “This helps stop the bleeding and will help Nokia get back in the game.” Mr. Elop, a former senior Microsoft executive who made the decision to enter the software alliance with his former employer in February, said the new Lumia devices showed that Nokia, which is based in Espoo, Finland, was delivering on his promise of a turnaround. “This signals our intent to be today’s leader in smartphone design and craftsmanship,” Mr. Elop told 3,000 people attending the company’s Nokia World conference in London. During an interview, Mr. Elop said Nokia was planning to push its smartphones into the United States, where it has struggled, early next year. He said Nokia was in advanced talks with the four major American operators, which together sell more than 90 percent of all cellphones in the country. Nokia’s new smartphones for the United States, Mr. Elop said, will run on high-speed 4G networks that use a technology called LTE, or Long Term Evolution, as well as on older 3G networks. They will also be made to run on networks that use the C.D.M.A. standard, which is used by the market leader, Verizon Wireless. Mr. Elop said that Nokia was listening closely to phone operators and would be flexible in meeting their demands. “If you do the math, you may come to the conclusion that clearly we are in good conversations with those operators,” he said Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., is using its business connections — its server software powers a lot of cloud computing centers used by network operators — to help Nokia re-establish relationships with American operators, he said. “When we enter a market, it is not just dipping your toe in the market, but coming in with the appropriate levels of investment by us,” Mr. Elop said. “It takes work. It takes money. We are being very deliberate.” With Lumia, Nokia aims to beat Apple and Google by designing handsets that are easier to use than the two best-selling smartphones, the Apple iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S II, which runs Google’s Android software. The Lumia 800’s start screen is a wheel of interactive tiles. By clicking a tile, users are taken directly to a preferred task, like text messaging a friend, tracking a sports team or listening to a favorite song, without having to enter and close applications. The software interface, developed by Microsoft but refined by Nokia, is designed to remove as much laborious touch-screen tapping as possible. Marko Ahtisaari, Nokia’s head designer, said the smartphones used fluid, rather than linear, design logic, which eliminated many of the intermediary steps required with the array of static app icons that Apple and Google’s Android favor. Shares of Nokia closed at 4.80 euros, down 0.6 percent, in European trading. One investor said that Nokia and Microsoft must still overcome skepticism about the venture. “I have seen no evidence that Nokia and Microsoft are making a game of it — yet,” said Jeffrey P. Davis, the chief investment officer at Lee Munder Capital, an investment fund manager based in Boston with $5.4 billion under management. “Android is winning the mind space on the consumer front. The business world will probably follow.” Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, estimated that Nokia was paying $15 to Microsoft for each Windows smartphone it produced, less than the estimated $20 other handset makers must pay. The new Windows phone lineup, he said, has the potential to help restore Nokia’s fortunes in the smartphone market. “One thing I have learned in this business is to never say never,” Mr. Mawston said.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/opinion/limits-of-magical-thinking.html?ref=applecomputerinc">The Limits of Magical Thinking<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text>Steve Jobs, the mad perfectionist, even perfected his stare.He wanted it to be hypnotic. He wanted the other person to blink first. He wanted it to be, like Dracula’s saturnine gaze, a force that could bend your will to his and subsume your reality in his. There’s an arresting picture of Jobs staring out, challenging us to blink, on the cover of Walter Isaacson’s new biography, “Steve Jobs.” The writer begins the book by comparing the moody lord of Silicon Valley to Shakespeare’s Henry V — a “callous but sentimental, inspiring but flawed king.” Certainly, Jobs created what Shakespeare called “the brightest heaven of invention.” But his life sounded like the darkest hell of volatility. An Apple C.E.O. who jousted with Jobs wondered if he had a mild bipolarity. “Sometimes he would be ecstatic, at other times he was depressed,” Isaacson writes. There were Rasputin-like seductions followed by raging tirades. Everyone was either a hero or bozo. As Jobs’s famous ad campaign for Apple said, “Here’s to the crazy ones. ... They push the human race forward.” The monstre sacré fancied himself an “enlightened being,” but he was capable of frightening coldness, even with his oldest collaborators and family. Yet he often sobbed uncontrollably. Isaacson told me that Jobs yearned to be a saint; but one of the colleagues he ousted from Apple mordantly noted that the petulant and aesthetic Jobs would have made an excellent King of France. His extremes left everyone around him with vertigo. He embraced Zen minimalism and anti-materialism. First, he lived in an unfurnished mansion, then a house so modest that Bill Gates, on a visit, was astonished that the whole Jobs family could fit in it. And Jobs scorned security, often leaving his back door unlocked. Yet his genius was designing alluring products that would create a country of technology addicts. He demanded laser-like focus from employees to create an A.D.D. world. He was abandoned by parents who conceived him out of wedlock at 23, and he then abandoned a daughter for many years that he conceived out of wedlock at 23. Chrisann Brennan, the mother of Jobs’s oldest child, Lisa, told Isaacson that being put up for adoption left Jobs “full of broken glass.” He very belatedly acknowledged Lisa and their relationship was built, Isaacson says, on “layers of resentment.” He could be hard on women. Two exes scrawled mean messages on his walls. As soon as he learned that his beautiful, willowy, blonde girlfriend, Laurene Powell, was pregnant in 1991, he began musing that he might still be in love with the previous beautiful, willowy, blonde girlfriend, Tina Redse. “He surprised a wide swath of friends and even acquaintances by asking them what he should do,” Isaacson writes. “ ‘Who was prettier,’ he would ask, ‘Tina or Laurene?’ ” And “who should he marry?” Isaacson notes that Jobs could be distant at times with the two daughters he had with Laurene (though not the son). When one daughter dreamed of going to the Oscars with him, he blew her off. Andy Hertzfeld, a friend and former Apple engineer, lent Lisa $20,000 when she thought her father was not going to pay her Harvard tuition. Jobs paid it back to his friend, but Lisa did not invite him to her Harvard graduation. “The key question about Steve is why he can’t control himself at times from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,” Hertzfeld said. “That goes back to being abandoned at birth.” He almost always wore black turtlenecks and jeans. (Early on, he scorned deodorant and went barefoot and had a disturbing habit of soaking his feet in the office toilet.) Yet he sometimes tried to ply his exquisite taste to remake the women in his life. When he was dating the much older Joan Baez — enthralled by her relationship with his idol, Bob Dylan — he drove her to a Ralph Lauren store in the Stanford mall to show her a red dress that would be “perfect” for her. But one of the world’s richest men merely showed her the dress, even after she told him she “couldn’t really afford it,” while he bought shirts. When he met his sister, Mona Simpson, a struggling novelist, as an adult, he berated her for not wearing clothes that were “fetching enough” and then sent her a box of Issey Miyake pantsuits “in flattering colors,” she said. He was a control freak, yet when he learned he had a rare form of pancreatic cancer that would respond to surgery, he ignored his wife, doctors and friends and put the surgery off for nine months, trying to heal himself with wacky fruit diets, hydrotherapy, a psychic and expressing his negative feelings. (As though he had to be encouraged.) Addicted to fasting because he felt it produced euphoria and ecstasy, he refused to eat when he needed protein to fight his cancer. The Da Vinci of Apple could be self-aware. “I know that living with me,” he told Isaacson as he was dying, “was not a bowl of cherries.”</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/mophies-recharger-does-more-with-less/?ref=applecomputerinc">Mophie's Recharger Does More With Less<date>October 26, 2011, 6:00 am</date><text>See, this is nice. The Mophie Juice Pack Reserve, a compact recharger for iPhones and iPods. Mophie‘s a company that has been around for a little while. You may remember it from movies like  “Backup Battery Case: Restoring Power” and “Backup Battery Case 2: Getting Bulkier.” That was the problem with products like Mophie’s Juice Pack Plus. Sure, it provided an extra battery’s worth of power, but it was housed in a steroidal plastic case that that made your iPhone look like the bodybuilder and eight-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman (no disrespect intended, Mr. Coleman, given your enormous muscles that could likely pound us into dust). That’s why I like Mophie’s Juice Pack Reserve ($35). It doesn’t give you a full charge when you use it. It only gets you about a third of the way there. But I’m fine with that. Why? Because I’m not in Doctors Without Borders, that’s why. I’m not going rafting or spelunking or orienteering any time soon. I’m usually — make that “always”— within a few hours of a charger, so a little boost is all I need. And because I give up full power, I get something far more compact. The Juice Pack Reserve is about the same size and shape (it’s a little longer) as a Zippo lighter. It is covered in a rubbery exterior skin and comes with a key ring attached. (Style note: Don’t use it as a key ring.) The Juice Pack contains some clever design touches. For starters, nothing is removable. There are no caps to keep track of or watch roll down a storm drain. The Apple-standard 30-pin connector is under a plastic flap that peels back at the bottom of the Juice Pack. (Sidenote: Why, oh why didn’t Mophie just call it the Juice Crew? That would’ve been awesome. I guess it would have required too many royalty checks to Marley Marl.) On the top of the Juice Pack is a peel-back USB connector so the Juice Pack can recharge itself. The internal battery is good for 500 full-cycle charges,  Mophie says. The manufacturer is also keen to point out that it counts only full cycles. If you charge your Mophie only 10 percent, you get 10 of those before you have used up a cycle. Press the button on the side of the Juice Pack and the LED on the front indicates the battery’s status (You know the drill: green = all systems go; orange = meet me halfway; red = warrior is about to die; no LED = plug it  back in.) Not that you need to recharge the Mophie much in between uses. I charged one three weeks ago, threw it in my bag and just checked it. That thing is still fully charged.</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/opinion/nocera-the-biographers-dilemma.html?ref=applecomputerinc">The Biographer’s Dilemma<date>Published: October 24, 2011</date><text>I was halfway through Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Steve Jobs when I suddenly went searching through my bookshelf for the book he wrote about Benjamin Franklin. I had read the latter biography when it came out in 2003, and I remembered it fondly. I was trying to figure out why “Steve Jobs,” despite being full of new information about the most compelling businessman of the modern era, was leaving me cold.It didn’t take long to find the answer. “Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us,” wrote Isaacson early in Chapter One in “Benjamin Franklin: An American Life.” Oh, for such a sentence in “Steve Jobs!” Oh, for such an insight. Let me acknowledge that the task facing Isaacson was daunting. He began his research in early 2009, knowing that Jobs had cancer and that his time remaining on this earth was likely to be brief. Although many books have been written about Jobs, Isaacson was the first writer the Apple co-founder had ever cooperated with. (Indeed, it was Jobs who approached Isaacson about writing his biography.) They spoke more than 40 times, about all aspects of Jobs’s life — including his personal life, which he had always guarded fiercely. Combine that with the enormousness of Jobs’s accomplishments — from starting the personal computer industry in his garage to creating a half-dozen of the most iconic consumer products ever invented — and it’s practically a miracle that Isaacson’s book was published as quickly as it was. (The official publication date was Monday.) Its 627 pages is, indeed, chock full of revelations, from Jobs’s difficult relationship with a daughter he fathered in his early 20s — and then abandoned for years — to the lessons he learned from his adoptive father, whom he adored. We go behind the scenes during the boardroom battle that forced Jobs out of Apple in 1985 — as well as the one that brought him back a decade later. “Steve Jobs” offers so many examples of his awful behavior — incorrigible bullying, belittling and lying — that you’re soon numb to them. Isaacson gives us the back story of all of Jobs’s creations, from the Apple II to the iPad. His descriptions of the more recent products — iPod to iPhone to iPad — have a flat, rushed quality, as if the author was racing to finish before his subject died. Chances are, he was. That there is such a hunger for information about this most private of men is undeniable; that’s why the book went to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-sellers list practically the moment Jobs died. But facts alone — even previously unknown facts — do not, by themselves, make for great biographies. What is required for that is genuine insight. And that is where “Steve Jobs” falls down. Part of the problem, I think, is that the bond that developed between subject and writer made it nearly impossible for Isaacson to get the kind of critical distance he needed to take his subject’s true measure. He didn’t just interview Jobs; he watched him die. There is a moving scene near the end of the book, with an emaciated Jobs, lying in bed, leafing through photographs with Isaacson, reminiscing. How can one possibly get critical distance about your subject when such moments are part of your experience of him? “I think there will be a lot in your book that I won’t like,” Jobs tells Isaacson during that conversation, two months before he died. Isaacson agrees, but I don’t. Jobs’s bad behavior is something he never denied. He rationalized it as his way of getting the most out of people — and Isaacson largely accepts this rationalization. An alternative notion — that Jobs was an emotional child his whole life — is something the readers have to come to themselves, by reading between the lines. When you think about it, it is rare for a truly great biography to be written about someone who is living; in my lifetime, the only one I can think of is “The Power Broker,” Robert Caro’s monumental biography of Robert Moses. When the subjects are alive — and Jobs was still alive when this book was finished — biographers always feel them looking over their shoulders, and pushing back. Jobs does that often with Isaacson, rejecting, for instance, the idea that his own abandonment by his natural parents had a major effect on him. Invariably, at such moments, Isaacson backs off and gives Jobs the last word. There is another kind of distance biographies of the living lack — the distance of time. It can take decades to truly understand the context in which the subject’s life and achievements played out. Often we need to see what happens after he is gone to realize his true impact on our world. Steve Jobs has been dead for three weeks. We’re not even close to that understanding. In “Steve Jobs,” Walter Isaacson has recounted a life — a big, sprawling, amazing life. It is a serious accomplishment. What remains for future biographers is to make sense of that life.</text></article>

First, he lived in an unfurnished mansion, then a house so modest that Bill Gates, on a visit, was astonished that the whole Jobs family could fit in it. And Jobs scorned security, often leaving his back door unlocked. Yet his genius was designing alluring products that would create a country of technology addicts. He demanded laser-like focus from employees to create an A.D.D. world. He was abandoned by parents who conceived him out of wedlock at 23, and he then abandoned a daughter for many years that he conceived out of wedlock at 23. Chrisann Brennan, the mother of Jobs’s oldest child, Lisa, told Isaacson that being put up for adoption left Jobs “full of broken glass.” He very belatedly acknowledged Lisa and their relationship was built, Isaacson says, on “layers of resentment.” He could be hard on women. Two exes scrawled mean messages on his walls. As soon as he learned that his beautiful, willowy, blonde girlfriend, Laurene Powell, was pregnant in 1991, he began musing that he might still be in love with the previous beautiful, willowy, blonde girlfriend, Tina Redse. “He surprised a wide swath of friends and even acquaintances by asking them what he should do,” Isaacson writes. “ ‘Who was prettier,’ he would ask, ‘Tina or Laurene?’ ” And “who should he marry?” Isaacson notes that Jobs could be distant at times with the two daughters he had with Laurene (though not the son). When one daughter dreamed of going to the Oscars with him, he blew her off. Andy Hertzfeld, a friend and former Apple engineer, lent Lisa $20,000 when she thought her father was not going to pay her Harvard tuition. Jobs paid it back to his friend, but Lisa did not invite him to her Harvard graduation. “The key question about Steve is why he can’t control himself at times from being so reflexively cruel and harmful to some people,” Hertzfeld said. “That goes back to being abandoned at birth.” He almost always wore black turtlenecks and jeans. (Early on, he scorned deodorant and went barefoot and had a disturbing habit of soaking his feet in the office toilet.) Yet he sometimes tried to ply his exquisite taste to remake the women in his life. When he was dating the much older Joan Baez — enthralled by her relationship with his idol, Bob Dylan — he drove her to a Ralph Lauren store in the Stanford mall to show her a red dress that would be “perfect” for her. But one of the world’s richest men merely showed her the dress, even after she told him she “couldn’t really afford it,” while he bought shirts. When he met his sister, Mona Simpson, a struggling novelist, as an adult, he berated her for not wearing clothes that were “fetching enough” and then sent her a box of Issey Miyake pantsuits “in flattering colors,” she said. He was a control freak, yet when he learned he had a rare form of pancreatic cancer that would respond to surgery, he ignored his wife, doctors and friends and put the surgery off for nine months, trying to heal himself with wacky fruit diets, hydrotherapy, a psychic and expressing his negative feelings. (As though he had to be encouraged.) Addicted to fasting because he felt it produced euphoria and ecstasy, he refused to eat when he needed protein to fight his cancer. The Da Vinci of Apple could be self-aware. “I know that living with me,” he told Isaacson as he was dying, “was not a bowl of cherries.”</text></article>

The Mophie Juice Pack Reserve, a compact recharger for iPhones and iPods. Mophie‘s a company that has been around for a little while. You may remember it from movies like  “Backup Battery Case: Restoring Power” and “Backup Battery Case 2: Getting Bulkier.” That was the problem with products like Mophie’s Juice Pack Plus. Sure, it provided an extra battery’s worth of power, but it was housed in a steroidal plastic case that that made your iPhone look like the bodybuilder and eight-time Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman (no disrespect intended, Mr. Coleman, given your enormous muscles that could likely pound us into dust). That’s why I like Mophie’s Juice Pack Reserve ($35). It doesn’t give you a full charge when you use it. It only gets you about a third of the way there. But I’m fine with that. Why? Because I’m not in Doctors Without Borders, that’s why. I’m not going rafting or spelunking or orienteering any time soon. I’m usually — make that “always”— within a few hours of a charger, so a little boost is all I need. And because I give up full power, I get something far more compact. The Juice Pack Reserve is about the same size and shape (it’s a little longer) as a Zippo lighter. It is covered in a rubbery exterior skin and comes with a key ring attached. (Style note: Don’t use it as a key ring.) The Juice Pack contains some clever design touches. For starters, nothing is removable. There are no caps to keep track of or watch roll down a storm drain. The Apple-standard 30-pin connector is under a plastic flap that peels back at the bottom of the Juice Pack. (Sidenote: Why, oh why didn’t Mophie just call it the Juice Crew? That would’ve been awesome. I guess it would have required too many royalty checks to Marley Marl.) On the top of the Juice Pack is a peel-back USB connector so the Juice Pack can recharge itself. The internal battery is good for 500 full-cycle charges,  Mophie says. The manufacturer is also keen to point out that it counts only full cycles. If you charge your Mophie only 10 percent, you get 10 of those before you have used up a cycle. Press the button on the side of the Juice Pack and the LED on the front indicates the battery’s status (You know the drill: green = all systems go; orange = meet me halfway; red = warrior is about to die; no LED = plug it  back in.) Not that you need to recharge the Mophie much in between uses. I charged one three weeks ago, threw it in my bag and just checked it. That thing is still fully charged.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/opinion/nocera-the-biographers-dilemma.html?ref=applecomputerinc">The Biographer’s Dilemma<date>Published: October 24, 2011</date><text>I was halfway through Walter Isaacson’s new biography of Steve Jobs when I suddenly went searching through my bookshelf for the book he wrote about Benjamin Franklin. I had read the latter biography when it came out in 2003, and I remembered it fondly. I was trying to figure out why “Steve Jobs,” despite being full of new information about the most compelling businessman of the modern era, was leaving me cold.It didn’t take long to find the answer. “Benjamin Franklin is the founding father who winks at us,” wrote Isaacson early in Chapter One in “Benjamin Franklin: An American Life.” Oh, for such a sentence in “Steve Jobs!” Oh, for such an insight. Let me acknowledge that the task facing Isaacson was daunting. He began his research in early 2009, knowing that Jobs had cancer and that his time remaining on this earth was likely to be brief. Although many books have been written about Jobs, Isaacson was the first writer the Apple co-founder had ever cooperated with. (Indeed, it was Jobs who approached Isaacson about writing his biography.) They spoke more than 40 times, about all aspects of Jobs’s life — including his personal life, which he had always guarded fiercely. Combine that with the enormousness of Jobs’s accomplishments — from starting the personal computer industry in his garage to creating a half-dozen of the most iconic consumer products ever invented — and it’s practically a miracle that Isaacson’s book was published as quickly as it was. (The official publication date was Monday.) Its 627 pages is, indeed, chock full of revelations, from Jobs’s difficult relationship with a daughter he fathered in his early 20s — and then abandoned for years — to the lessons he learned from his adoptive father, whom he adored. We go behind the scenes during the boardroom battle that forced Jobs out of Apple in 1985 — as well as the one that brought him back a decade later. “Steve Jobs” offers so many examples of his awful behavior — incorrigible bullying, belittling and lying — that you’re soon numb to them. Isaacson gives us the back story of all of Jobs’s creations, from the Apple II to the iPad. His descriptions of the more recent products — iPod to iPhone to iPad — have a flat, rushed quality, as if the author was racing to finish before his subject died. Chances are, he was. That there is such a hunger for information about this most private of men is undeniable; that’s why the book went to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-sellers list practically the moment Jobs died. But facts alone — even previously unknown facts — do not, by themselves, make for great biographies. What is required for that is genuine insight. And that is where “Steve Jobs” falls down. Part of the problem, I think, is that the bond that developed between subject and writer made it nearly impossible for Isaacson to get the kind of critical distance he needed to take his subject’s true measure. He didn’t just interview Jobs; he watched him die. There is a moving scene near the end of the book, with an emaciated Jobs, lying in bed, leafing through photographs with Isaacson, reminiscing. How can one possibly get critical distance about your subject when such moments are part of your experience of him? “I think there will be a lot in your book that I won’t like,” Jobs tells Isaacson during that conversation, two months before he died. Isaacson agrees, but I don’t. Jobs’s bad behavior is something he never denied. He rationalized it as his way of getting the most out of people — and Isaacson largely accepts this rationalization. An alternative notion — that Jobs was an emotional child his whole life — is something the readers have to come to themselves, by reading between the lines. When you think about it, it is rare for a truly great biography to be written about someone who is living; in my lifetime, the only one I can think of is “The Power Broker,” Robert Caro’s monumental biography of Robert Moses. When the subjects are alive — and Jobs was still alive when this book was finished — biographers always feel them looking over their shoulders, and pushing back. Jobs does that often with Isaacson, rejecting, for instance, the idea that his own abandonment by his natural parents had a major effect on him. Invariably, at such moments, Isaacson backs off and gives Jobs the last word. There is another kind of distance biographies of the living lack — the distance of time. It can take decades to truly understand the context in which the subject’s life and achievements played out. Often we need to see what happens after he is gone to realize his true impact on our world. Steve Jobs has been dead for three weeks. We’re not even close to that understanding. In “Steve Jobs,” Walter Isaacson has recounted a life — a big, sprawling, amazing life. It is a serious accomplishment. What remains for future biographers is to make sense of that life.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/apples-lower-prices-are-all-part-of-the-plan.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Apple’s Lower Prices Are All Part of The Plan<date>Published: October 23, 2011</date><text>Something unexpected has happened at Apple, once known as the tech industry’s high-price leader. Over the last several years it began beating rivals on price.People who wanted the latest Apple smartphone, the iPhone 4S, were able to get one the day it went on sale if they were willing to wait in a line, spend at least $199 and commit to a two-year wireless service contract with a carrier. Or they could have skipped the lines and bought one of the latest iPhone rivals from an Apple competitor, as long as they were willing to dig deeper into their wallets. For $300 and a two-year contract, gadget lovers could have picked up Motorola’s Droid Bionic from Verizon Wireless, or they could bought the $230 Samsung Galaxy SII and $260 HTC Amaze 4G, both from T-Mobile, under the same terms. Apple’s new pricing strategy is a big change from the 1990s, when consumers regarded Apple as a producer of overpriced tech baubles, unable to compete effectively with its Macintosh family of computers against the far cheaper Windows PCs. But more recently, it began using its growing manufacturing scale and logistics prowess to deliver Apple products at far more aggressive prices, which in turn gave it more power to influence pricing industrywide. Apple’s innovations — including products like the iPhone, iPad and the ultrathin MacBook Air notebook — are justifiably credited for their role in the company’s resurgence under its chief executive and co-founder, Steven P. Jobs, who died on Oct. 5. But analysts and industry executives say Apple’s pricing is an overlooked part of its ability to find a large audience for those products beyond hard-core Apple fans. Apple sold more than four million iPhone 4S smartphone over its debut weekend. People can still easily find less expensive alternatives, with less distinctive and refined designs, to most Apple products. Within the premium product categories where Apple is most at home though, comparable devices often do no better than match or slightly undercut Apple’s prices. “They’re not cheap, but I don’t think they’re viewed as high-priced anymore,” said Stewart Alsop, a longtime venture capitalist in San Francisco. Apple declined to comment for this article. Prices in the ultrathin notebook category are an illustration of Apple’s strategy. While there are much cheaper laptops for sale, ranging all the way down to bargain-basement netbooks that cost a few hundred dollars, Apple’s MacBook Air has become a hit among computer users seeking the thinnest and lightest notebooks available. The product starts at $999 for a model with an 11-inch screen. On Oct. 11, the Taiwanese computer maker Asus introduced its answer to the MacBook Air, a sleek device that uses Windows. But it was unable to undercut Apple; the Asus computer also starts at $999. Samsung’s wafer-thin Series 9 notebook, with comparable features, costs $1,049. The computer maker Acer, however, began undercutting the cheapest MacBook Air this month with an $899 ultrathin notebook, the Aspire S series, that has a bigger screen. The original MacBook Air catered to a more rarefied audience when it came out in early 2008, priced at a whopping $1,799 for a model with a 13-inch screen. A year ago Apple revamped the notebook to make it thinner and smaller and reduced its entry-level prices to $999 and $1,299 for models with 11-inch and 13-inch screens. Jean-Louis Gassée, a venture capitalist and former Apple executive, said there was a “collective gasp” at how low Apple priced the new MacBook Air. The aggressive pricing, analysts say, reflects Apple’s ability to use its growing manufacturing scale to push down costs for the crucial parts that make up its devices. Apple has also shown a willingness to tap into its huge war chest — $82 billion in cash and marketable securities last quarter — to take big gambles by locking up supplies of parts for years, as it did in 2005 when it struck a five-year, $1.25 billion deal with manufacturers to secure flash memory chips for its iPods and other devices. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/24iht-nokia24.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Crucial Test for Nokia as Latest Smartphones Arrive<date>Published: October 23, 2011</date><text>BERLIN — When Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, introduces the company’s first phones bearing Microsoft Windows Phone software Wednesday, he will probably be met with equal parts good will and skepticism. On the one hand, many mobile operators are pulling for Nokia and Microsoft to succeed, creating a credible third smartphone lineup that they can use to leverage better terms from Google and Apple, which in four years have taken over the high-end mobile business. On the other, the partnership with Microsoft was struck while Nokia, the erstwhile market leader, was under duress, undertaking an 18 percent cut to its work force. The company absorbed combined losses of €436 million, or $597 million, in the second and third quarters. Worst of all, since the deal was made in February, Nokia has had to tread water as engineers combined the companies’ smartphone technologies, allowing Google, Apple and Samsung to secure their positions in the pecking order. As a result, Nokia’s share of the global smartphone market has fallen by nearly half, to 15.5 percent in September from 27.5 percent in December, according to International Data Corp., an information technology research firm. “The road back for Nokia is going to be a long one,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst in London for International Data. “There is a risk that they are too late to the party.” At a conference in London on Wednesday, Nokia intends to present at least two new phones, one aimed at high-end users and one for the midrange mass market, people with knowledge of the presentation said. Time is not an ally for Nokia in the fast-moving smartphone segment of the mobile market, which now accounts for more than half of all cellphone sales in North America and Western Europe. For Nokia, the decision to abandon its own Symbian operating system in favor of Windows Phone came at a price. Operators quickly reduced their stocks of all Symbian devices, both smartphones and basic phones, hurting Nokia’s bread-and-butter business. Nokia’s share of the overall global cellphone market fell to 24.5 percent in September from 30.7 percent in December, according to International Data. On Thursday, when the company reported a €68 million loss for the third quarter, which was smaller than some investors had expected, Mr. Elop spoke of the “many important steps ahead in our journey of transformation.” “With each step,” he continued, “you will see us methodically implement our strategy, pursuing steady improvement through a period that has known transition risks, while also dealing with the various unexpected ups and downs that typify the dynamic nature of the industry.” For Mr. Elop, a former Microsoft executive who made the decision to enter the alliance, and for Nokia, the success or failure of the collaboration will be a defining event. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst in London with the technology research firm Gartner, said Mr. Elop so far appeared to be delivering on his promise to turn Nokia around. The company’s upgrades this year of Symbian, Symbian Belle and Symbian Anna were tangible improvements that showed Nokia could innovate on the fly. Nokia released the N9, considered its best smartphone to date and a product of the now-defunct alliance with Intel, to positive reviews. Sales of two new dual-SIM devices, the C2-03 and C2-06, helped Nokia lift sales of basic phones 8 percent in the third quarter. Gartner is predicting that Nokia and Microsoft will succeed, gaining 20 percent share in the smartphone market by 2015. While that would still be below Nokia’s peak, it is a lot better than where it is now. “I am not sure if success is a given,” Ms. Milanesi said. “Their major issue will remain brand and making both Nokia and Microsoft sexy enough for consumers.” Nokia must succeed at the top and middle ends of the smartphone business to reclaim a leadership position, said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics in Milton Keynes, England. Profit margins for top-end devices, like Apple’s iPhone, are about 36 percent, Mr. Mawston said. For midrange devices, the gains are much smaller, from 1 percent to 15 percent. “The top end is where the biggest revenue and profit pools lie,” Mr. Mawston said. “The volume is at the low- and midtier.” Mobile network operators are hoping that Nokia-Microsoft smartphones will sell well, because that will help them command lower prices from Apple and the makers of Google’s Android phones for their models, Mr. Mawston said. “Apple’s iPhone is widely perceived among operators as being overpriced, but Apple is so popular that operators can’t reduce the price they pay for it by even a small amount,” he said. Nokia is expected to introduce the first new Microsoft devices in places where it already has a relatively strong market share, like Western Europe. It hopes to build momentum and positive reviews and take the devices to the United States, the world’s largest smartphone market. There, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is helping Nokia of Finland open doors to the four largest U.S. operators, which control more than 90 percent of all cellphone sales. Nokia’s North American market share in smartphones in the third quarter was only 1.2 percent, according to International Data. Microsoft’s share of the global smartphone software market was not much bigger: 2 percent, globally. While Internet access is rapidly shifting from traditional desktop and laptop PCs to mobile devices, Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, can still fall back for the time being on its dominant Windows licensing business. That is why Nokia, which makes most of its money selling cellphones, has much more at stake in the collaboration than Microsoft, analysts said. But the venture is also crucial to Microsoft, which despite several attempts on its own has largely failed to gain a foothold in the software business for mobile devices. “I think given Microsoft’s dominant position in fixed and portable keyboard computing, Nokia is not their final chance, but it is probably one of their final chances to enter this market,” Mr. Mawston said. “They probably won’t get too many goes after Nokia.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 25, 2011 An article on Monday about Nokiaâs pending introduction of smartphones bearing Windows Phone software misidentified the smartphone that resulted from Nokiaâs now-defunct alliance with Intel. It was the N9, not the N8.</text></article>

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/books/steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson-review.html?ref=applecomputerinc">‘Steve Jobs’ by Walter Isaacson - Review<date>Published: October 21, 2011</date><text>After Steve Jobs anointed Walter Isaacson as his authorized biographer in 2009, he took Mr. Isaacson to see the Mountain View, Calif., house in which he had lived as a boy. He pointed out its “clean design” and “awesome little features.” He praised the developer, Joseph Eichler, who built more than 11,000 homes in California subdivisions, for making an affordable product on a mass-market scale. And he showed Mr. Isaacson the stockade fence built 50 years earlier by his father, Paul Jobs.“He loved doing things right,” Mr. Jobs said. “He even cared about the look of the parts you couldn’t see.” Mr. Jobs, the brilliant and protean creator whose inventions so utterly transformed the allure of technology, turned those childhood lessons into an all-purpose theory of intelligent design. He gave Mr. Isaacson a chance to play by the same rules. His story calls for a book that is clear, elegant and concise enough to qualify as an iBio. Mr. Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” does its solid best to hit that target. As a biographer of Albert Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, Mr. Isaacson knows how to explicate and celebrate genius: revered, long-dead genius. But he wrote “Steve Jobs” as its subject was mortally ill, and that is a more painful and delicate challenge. (He had access to members of the Jobs family at a difficult time.) Mr. Jobs promised not to look over Mr. Isaacson’s shoulder, and not to meddle with anything but the book’s cover. (Boy, does it look great.) And he expressed approval that the book would not be entirely flattering. But his legacy was at stake. And there were awkward questions to be asked. At the end of the volume, Mr. Jobs answers the question “What drove me?” by discussing himself in the past tense. Mr. Isaacson treats “Steve Jobs” as the biography of record, which means that it is a strange book to read so soon after its subject’s death. Some of it is an essential Silicon Valley chronicle, compiling stories well known to tech aficionados but interesting to a broad audience. Some of it is already quaint. Mr. Jobs’s first job was at Atari, and it involved the game Pong. (“If you’re under 30, ask your parents,” Mr. Isaacson writes.) Some, like an account of the release of the iPad 2, is so recent that it is hard to appreciate yet, even if Mr. Isaacson says the device comes to life “like the face of a tickled baby.”  And some is definitely intended for future generations. “Indeed,” Mr. Isaacson writes, “its success came not just from the beauty of the hardware but from the applications, known as apps, that allowed you to indulge in all sorts of delightful activities.” One that he mentions, which will be as quaint as Pong some day, features the use of a slingshot to launch angry birds to destroy pigs and their fortresses. So “Steve Jobs,” an account of its subject’s 56 years (he died on Oct. 5), must reach across time in more ways than one. And it does, in a well-ordered, if not streamlined, fashion. It begins with a portrait of the young Mr. Jobs, rebellious toward the parents who raised him and scornful of the ones who gave him up for adoption. (“They were my sperm and egg bank,” he says.) Although Mr. Isaacson is not analytical about his subject’s volatile personality (the word “obnoxious” figures in the book frequently), he raises the question of whether feelings of abandonment in childhood made him fanatically controlling and manipulative as an adult. Fortunately, that glib question stays unanswered. Mr. Jobs, who founded Apple with Stephen Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976, began his career as a seemingly contradictory blend of hippie truth seeker and tech-savvy hothead. “His Zen awareness was not accompanied by an excess of calm, peace of mind or interpersonal mellowness,” Mr. Isaacson says. “He could stun an unsuspecting victim with an emotional towel-snap, perfectly aimed,” he also writes. But Mr. Jobs valued simplicity, utility and beauty in ways that would shape his creative imagination. And the book maintains that those goals would not have been achievable in the great parade of Apple creations without that mean streak. Mr. Isaacson takes his readers back to the time when laptops, desktops and windows were metaphors, not everyday realities. His book ticks off how each of the Apple innovations that we now take for granted first occurred to Mr. Jobs or his creative team. “Steve Jobs” means to be the authoritative book about those achievements, and it also follows Mr. Jobs into the wilderness (and to NeXT and Pixar) after his first stint at Apple, which ended in 1985. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 26, 2011 The Books of The Times review on Saturday, about âSteve Jobs,â by Walter Isaacson, described âAngry Birds,â a popular iPhone game, incorrectly.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/technology/book-offers-new-details-of-jobs-cancer-fight.html?ref=applecomputerinc">New Book Details Jobs’s Fight Against Cancer<date>Published: October 20, 2011</date><text>In his last years, Steven P. Jobs veered from exotic diets to cutting-edge treatments as he fought the cancer that ultimately took his life, according to a new biography to be published on Monday.His early decision to put off surgery and rely instead on fruit juices, acupuncture, herbal remedies and other treatments — some of which he found on the Internet — infuriated and distressed his family, friends and physicians, the book says. From the time of his first diagnosis in October 2003, until he received surgery in July 2004, he kept his condition largely private — secret from Apple employees, executives and shareholders, who were misled. Although the broad outlines of Mr. Jobs’s struggle with pancreatic cancer are known, the new biography, by Walter Isaacson, offers new insight and details. Friends, family members and physicians spoke to Mr. Isaacson openly about Mr. Jobs’s illness and his shifting strategy for managing it. According to Mr. Isaacson, Mr. Jobs was one of 20 people in the world to have all the genes of his cancer tumor and his normal DNA sequenced. The price tag at the time: $100,000. But the 630-page biography spans Mr. Jobs’s entire life, and also includes previously unknown details about his romantic life, his marriage, his relationship with his sister and his business dealings. Mr. Isaacson conducted more than 40 interviews over two years with Mr. Jobs, who died on Oct. 5. A copy of the book was obtained by The New York Times before it officially went on sale. In October 2003, Mr. Jobs got the news about his cancer, which was detected by a CT scan. One of his first calls, according to the book, was to Larry Brilliant, a physician and epidemiologist, who would later become the head of Google’s philanthropic arm. The men went way back, having first met at an ashram in India. “Do you still believe in God?” Mr. Jobs asked. Mr. Brilliant spoke for a while about religion and different paths to belief, and then asked Mr. Jobs what was wrong. “I have cancer,” Mr. Jobs replied. Mr. Jobs put off surgery for nine months, a fact first reported in 2008 in Fortune magazine. Friends and family, including his sister, Mona Simpson, urged Mr. Jobs to have surgery and chemotherapy, Mr. Isaacson writes. But Mr. Jobs delayed the medical treatment. His friend and mentor, Andrew Grove, the former head of Intel, who had overcome prostate cancer, told Mr. Jobs that diets and acupuncture were not a cure for his cancer. “I told him he was crazy,” he said. Art Levinson, a member of Apple’s board and chairman of Genentech, recalled that he pleaded with Mr. Jobs and was frustrated that he could not persuade him to have surgery. His wife, Laurene Powell, recalled those days, after the cancer diagnosis. “The big thing was that he really was not ready to open his body,” she said. “It’s hard to push someone to do that.” She did try, however, Mr. Isaacson writes. “The body exists to serve the spirit,” she argued. When he did take the path of surgery and science, Mr. Jobs did so with passion and curiosity, sparing no expense, pushing the frontiers of new treatments. According to Mr. Isaacson, once Mr. Jobs decided on the surgery and medical science, he became an expert — studying, guiding and deciding on each treatment. Mr. Isaacson said Mr. Jobs made the final decision on each new treatment regimen. The DNA sequencing that Mr. Jobs ultimately went through was done by a collaboration of teams at Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Harvard and the Broad Institute of MIT. The sequencing, Mr. Isaacson writes, allowed doctors to tailor drugs and target them to the defective molecular pathways. A doctor told Mr. Jobs that the pioneering treatments of the kind he was undergoing would soon make most types of cancer a manageable chronic disease. Later, Mr. Jobs told Mr. Isaacson that he was either going to be one of the first “to outrun a cancer like this” or be among the last “to die from it.” According to Mr. Isaacson, his interviews with Mr. Jobs were occasionally punctuated by music listening sessions in Mr. Jobs’s living room. During one interview, Mr. Jobs played music from his new iPad 2, cycling through the Beatles, a Gregorian chant performed by Benedictine monks, a Bach fugue and “Catch the Wind” by the Scottish musician Donovan. Mr. Jobs’s personal affinity for music, and his friendships with musicians, helped him maneuver deals to build the iTunes library and special versions of the iPod. It also moved into his private life at times, Mr. Isaacson writes. After Mr. Jobs learned he had cancer, he exacted a promise from Yo-Yo Ma to play at his funeral. Mr. Jobs sometimes entertained business guests at his home. Rupert Murdoch, the conservative head of News Corporation, came twice for dinner. Mr. Jobs joked to Mr. Isaacson that he had to hide the kitchen knives from his wife, Laurene Powell, because of her liberal views. The book provides new details on Apple’s business dealings and rivalries. The author recounts Mr. Jobs getting into a shouting match with co-founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, in 2008, over Google’s development of Android software for smartphones, which would compete with Apple’s iPhone. Mr. Jobs told Mr. Isaacson that he regarded Android as a “stolen product,” copying Apple technology. 1 2 Next Page » Reporting was contributed by Nick Bilton, Julie Bosman, John Markoff, Nick Wingfield and Damon Darlin.</text></article>

Jobs. 3:10 p.m. | Updated Changes to reflect that the store shutdown happened. Apple‘s retail stores around the world closed on Wednesday for about an hour and a half so store employees could watch a company tribute to its late co-founder and former chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. The employees were able to watch a webcast of the event, held at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., campus at 10 a.m. (1 p.m. Eastern time), according to a person familiar with the plans. All of Apple’s more than 300 retail stores worldwide were closed during that time (or at least the ones that would normally be open at that hour). The event on Apple’s campus, described inside the company as a celebration of Mr. Jobs’ life, was open only to Apple employees. The company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, encouraged employees to share their thoughts about and memories of Mr. Jobs prior to the event. Mr. Jobs, who suffered from a form of pancreatic cancer, died Oct. 5. Apple did create a Web page where the public can view submissions about Mr. Jobs from people around the world, including personal friends, colleagues and owners of Apple’s products. Apple said it received more than one million such submissions.</text></article>

For Apple though, weak sales of its star product — the iPhone — were enough to overshadow everything else when it reported fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, sending the company’s shares tumbling nearly 7 percent in after-hours trading. In a rare disappointment, the company missed Wall Street forecasts for its iPhone business. The company reported big increases in the sale of the iPad and of Mac computers, and even said the number of iPhones it sold in the quarter jumped 21 percent from a year ago. But investors fixated on a 16 percent decline in iPhone sales from the third quarter. Apple shares fell 7 percent after the release of the results at the close of normal trading hours. Apple executives blamed the shortfall in iPhone sales on unusually heated rumors that the company would release a new phone in the fall, leading consumers to delay their purchases so they could get the latest version. That new phone — the iPhone 4S — did, indeed, come out earlier this month, to what Apple said was the best initial sales of any iPhone yet. But it was too late to benefit the fourth quarter, which ended Sept. 24. Investors and analysts largely accepted Apple’s explanation, in part because of the sales of the iPhone 4S. Apple said that during the first weekend it was available, more than four million were sold, which is more than double the sales of its predecessor in the first days after its introduction. Mark Moscowitz, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said he and others on Wall Street “got too excited” in predicting blow-out iPhone sales, which should have been tempered by the increasing levels of speculation that Apple would come out with a new phone. While Apple has long had to contend with rumors about coming devices that can potentially freeze current product sales, analysts believe that customers have become more sophisticated about when Apple releases new devices, typically in the summer or early fall. “Consumers are a lot smarter, and they’re going to wait,” said Mr. Moscowitz, who had estimated that Apple would sell 20.6 milion iPhones in the quarter. The company reported sales of 17.07 million iPhones. David Rolfe, chief investment officer for Wedgewood Partners, a money management firm whose biggest holding is Apple, said the company’s financial forecast of $37 billion in revenue for the next quarter was strong enough that he thinks demand for the company’s products remains robust. “There’s no way you get to $37 billion unless the iPad, iPhone and Mac franchises are really healthy,” Mr. Rolfe said. Apple said its net profit for its fiscal fourth quarter was $6.62 billion, or $7.05 a share, up from $4.31 billion a year ago, or $4.64 a share, a 54 percent increase. Revenue rose to $28.27 billion from $20.34 billion, a 39 percent increase. Those results were well ahead of the $5.50 a share in earnings and $25 billion in revenue that Apple had forecast for the quarter, which ended Sept. 24. The period was Apple’s first officially under the leadership of Timothy D. Cook, who was named chief executive after Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s co-founder, resigned from the helm of the company on Aug. 24. Mr. Jobs died on Oct. 5 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer. The death of Mr. Jobs has stirred deep emotions inside and outside Apple and raised concerns about whether the company can, in the long run, continue its remarkable streak of hits. In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Cook said the “world has lost a visionary” with the death of Mr. Jobs. “That spirit will forever be the foundation for Apple, and we’re dedicated to continuing the amazing work he loved so much,” he said. Despite the disappointing iPhone sales, Mr. Cook said he was confident that Apple would set “an all-time record” for iPhone sales in the current holiday quarter. He added that the company had a product pipeline that’s “unbelievable.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Bill Clinton; Larry Ellison, Oracle‘s chief executive; Bill Gates, Microsoft‘s co-founder; and Michael Dell, Dell‘s chief executive, were among the guests who attended a private service at Stanford’s Memorial Church, according to a person with knowledge of the event. Bono, the U2 lead singer, and the folk singer Joan Baez, who once dated Mr. Jobs, were also there, as was John Lasseter, who worked with Mr. Jobs at Pixar, the animation studio that Mr. Jobs develped and later sold to Walt Disney.

While there were few details available about who spoke at the memorial, the British actor and technophile Stephen Fry, who knew Mr. Jobs, posted a note to Twitter Sunday evening describing his reaction to a memorial, though he didn’t say explicitly that it was the event to honor Mr. Jobs. “I don’t know that there was ever a more beautiful memorial service,” Mr. Fry wrote. “Everyone who spoke did so with such passion and love and simplicity.” Mr. Jobs died on Oct. 5 after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer.

People were O.K., it turns out, with an evolutionary iPhone. On Monday morning, Apple said it sold more than four million iPhone 4S’s during the device’s first few days on sale after its Friday release. That figure is more than double the 1.7 million units of the iPhone 4 that Apple sold during its first three days on the market in June of last year. The results seemed to be a vindication of Apple’s decision to offer what amounted to an upgrade of the iPhone 4 with its new model, rather than a wholesale makeover. The new phone’s look is virtually identical to the exterior design of its predecessor, though it has better internal hardware and a new virtual assistant feature, Siri, which uses voice recognition to handle various tasks. Initially, there was some disappointment that Apple didn’t release an iPhone 5 with bolder cosmetic changes on the outside of the device. An analyst with RBC, Mike Abramsky, called the iPhone sales “monster” in a research note on Monday morning, noting that he had expected Apple to sell three million of the devices during its first weekend. Mr. Abramsky noted that sales could have gotten a lift from broader distribution of the phone at its introduction, including Sprint and Verizon in the United States. Apple released some other impressive numbers Monday morning, saying that 25 million of its customers have already begun using iOS5, the new version of its operating system for iPhones, iPads and iPod Touches. Apple also said 20 million customers have signed up for iCloud, the free service that lets people synchronize and save data on their Apple devices.</text></article>

Or Did I?<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>Nora Ephron is the author, most recently, of “I Remember Nothing.”I, too, did not know Steve Jobs. In the days since his death, I have struggled to find a connection to him. I thought about him often when he was alive, particularly when I was working at my wonderful iMac computer, and also when I was trying to type an e-mail using the infuriating touchscreen on my iPhone. I thought about shooting him an e-mail about that touchscreen, but I never did, in part because I didn’t have his address. If I had, perhaps he would have written me back. Perhaps we would have become friends. Perhaps he would have done something about that touchscreen. Sometimes I can’t help wondering what it must have been like for his birth parents to give him up for adoption, to not know for years what became of him, and then to find out that a baby they gave away was now a national treasure worth $8.3 billion. There should be a word or a phrase to describe this — something as good as schadenfreude, or déjà vu, something that means “regret about the careless behavior of your youth, especially when it makes you look like a jerk.” I’m sorry I didn’t coin it, because it would link me to him. I just read Aaron Sorkin’s piece in Newsweek about how Steve Jobs called him one day, out of the blue, after Mr. Sorkin was quoted somewhere saying he wrote his screenplays on an iMac. I guess Steve Jobs didn’t know that I, too, write screenplays on an iMac. Had he known, I’m sure he would have called me, and there’s no telling how strong my connection to him might have been. Stronger than Mr. Sorkin’s, that’s for sure. Mr. Jobs invited Mr. Sorkin to write a movie for Pixar and asked him to come up to Northern California to see his operation, and Mr. Sorkin never did. I would have gone. I would have written the movie. I would have won an Oscar for the best animated feature, and you can bet I would have thanked Mr. Jobs in my Oscar speech. Millions of Apple users would have been jealous of my connection to him, even though it might not have been remotely intimate. By the way, I live near a really good vegan restaurant, and I like to think Steve and I might have gone there together, perhaps after a fabulous test screening of our Pixar movie. At some point I would definitely have asked him how to pronounce his last name, which I’ve never been sure of. I have been fascinated to learn about the women Mr. Jobs dated, or might have dated, and I couldn’t help wondering if I was one of them. I don’t think I was. But you never know. In any case, I’m sorry I didn’t start a rumor that I dated Steve Jobs, because my name could now be on the list of people he might have dated, along with Diane Keaton, whom I’m pretty sure he never dated but what do I know? I never met the guy. I read Mr. Jobs’s Stanford commencement speech in 2005. I told many people to read it, and I’m sure they told many more people to read it, and that undoubtedly accounts for its reputation as the greatest commencement speech in history. I wish I had written that speech. I wish I had bought Apple stock 15 years ago. I wish I had thought of that thing where you connect the “i” to the next word. iWish, iWish, iWish.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/business/steve-jobs-a-genius-of-store-design-too.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Steve Jobs, a Genius of Store Design, Too<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>WHEN the architect Peter Bohlin arrived for his first meeting with Steve Jobs, he wore a tie. “Steve laughed, and I never wore a tie again,” Mr. Bohlin recalled.Thus began a collaboration that has extended from Pixar’s headquarters, completed in 2001, to more than 30 Apple Stores (and counting) around the globe, all with design work by Mr. Bohlin and his firm, Bohlin Cywinski Jackson — and Mr. Jobs himself. “The best clients, to my mind, don’t say that whatever you do is fine,” Mr. Bohlin said last week, a few days after Mr. Jobs’s death. “They’re intertwined in the process. When I look back, it’s hard to remember who had what thought when. That’s the best, most satisfying work, whether a large building or a house.” Just as Mr. Jobs transformed the notion of the personal computer and the cellphone, he left an indelible stamp on architecture, especially the retail kind, traditionally a backwater of the profession. “No one in commercial architecture has ever channeled a product into architecture for a client the way Peter did for Apple,” said James Timberlake, a founding partner of KieranTimberlake, who is now designing the new American embassy in London. “Most commercial architecture is under-detailed, under-edited and under-budgeted. It’s gross and ugly, and most of it is an eyesore on the American landscape.” The work of Mr. Bohlin and his colleagues for Apple, by contrast, is sleek, transparent, inviting, technologically advanced — and expensive. In many ways, the retail architecture is simply the largest box in which an Apple product is wrapped, and Mr. Jobs was famously attentive to every detail in an Apple product’s presentation and customer experience. The extensive use of glass in structures like Apple’s cube on Fifth Avenue, between 58th and 59th Streets in Manhattan, its cylinder in the Pudong district of Shanghai or its soaring market hall on the Upper West Side of Manhattan have become so distinctive that Apple is seeking to patent the glass elements. Mr. Bohlin’s firm has won 42 awards for its work for Apple, and Mr. Bohlin himself was awarded the American Institute of Architects’ gold medal in 2010.  In their years working together, Mr. Jobs and Mr. Bohlin, who is 74, appeared to have achieved a rare chemistry. Mr. Jobs was “a very public person,” Mr. Timberlake observed. “That’s in contrast to Peter. He’s not a Frank Lloyd Wright or a Philip Johnson. He doesn’t sweep into a room and take over. You go to a design meeting, and it’s more like a fireside chat.” A TEAM led by Karl Backus at Bohlin Cywinski Jackson learned early on to approach Mr. Jobs with alternatives. “He liked to be presented with options and would often make very insightful suggestions,” recalled Mr. Backus, who lives in California and focuses full time on Apple work. “We all enjoyed the collaboration.” The notion of glass as Apple’s signature architectural statement first appeared in the staircase in its store in SoHo, housed in a historic building. “We had a two-story space, which is a great challenge to get people to go up or down,” Mr. Bohlin said. “So we thought of glass. Steve loved the glass stairway idea. He got it. You make magic. We made these stairs that were quite ethereal.” Just as Mr. Jobs obsessed over Apple products, he pushed Mr. Bohlin to make the glass structures ever more refined and pure. “We got James O’Callaghan involved. He’s brilliant, a British structural engineer with offices in New York and London,” Mr. Bohlin said. “Now we’re cantilevering the stairs from top to bottom.” In the newest Apple store, in Hamburg, Germany, the stairs float in space, attached only at the top and bottom. The fittings are embedded in the glass, “so you get this magical sleek profile when you look up the wall.” Mr. Bohlin said. “This is the kind of detail Steve wanted,” he added. “We’ve been driving for this, doing more and more with less and less. This has been a vision of architecture since earlier in the last century. Modernism, some people would argue, is doing more with less. Steve wanted us to push the edge of technology, but it had to be comfortable for people. Sometimes that idea got lost in modernism. It’s an interesting challenge, how to marry the two.” Apple’s use of glass in retail architecture emerged as a design and branding element at its Fifth Avenue store, which opened in 2006. The site had the initial challenge of luring customers into an underground plaza that had been notoriously inhospitable as a retail destination.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dispute-over-apple-image-shows-internets-reach.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Apple Logos Show Reach and Hostility of the Web<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG — Few personal journeys can shed as much light on the age we live in as the one traveled by Jonathan Mak in the last week.Mr. Mak, a university student in Hong Kong, went from being an unknown aspiring graphic designer to an Internet sensation after an image he produced spread rapidly across digital platforms after the death of Steven P. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple. Mr. Mak’s design of a silhouetted profile of Mr. Jobs in the Apple company logo was shared across the Web and reported by media. And then, nearly as fast, Mr. Mak found himself being vilified. With a speed befitting the technological age that Mr. Jobs helped usher in, Mr. Mak became the subject of derisive Internet postings and negative media reports. His design, it turned out, closely matched one produced earlier this year by Chris Thornley, a British graphic artist. “It’s been a very overwhelming experience,” Mr. Mak, 19, said by telephone between classes at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University School of Design. “I still attend classes and lessons as usual. But as far as following my assignments, it’s been difficult.” Mr. Mak said he had developed his design in late August — a white Apple logo on a black background, with a black silhouette of Mr. Jobs indented in the apple — as a tribute to Mr. Jobs after he stepped down as chief executive of Apple. Mr. Mak said he had searched across the Internet both for inspiration and to ensure he was not copying another design. He said his searches had not uncovered Mr. Thornley’s design. He then posted the tweaked Apple logo on his blog. Mr. Mak also said he asked the public to alert him if they spotted similarities between his work and others. The design lay quietly on his blog for weeks until Mr. Jobs’s death on Oct. 5. “Overnight, my Web site went from getting 80 responses to tens of thousands,” he said. “At first I was very happy.” But by the weekend, Mr. Mak said, people told him how similar his design was to Mr. Thornley’s, which had a black Apple logo on a white background, with a white silhouette of Mr. Jobs at a slightly different angle. Mr. Mak said Mr. Thornley’s wife, Julia, notified him Sunday night about the similarities. In the world of graphic design, such similarities are common, said Juliette Cezzar, director of the communication design program at Parsons The New School for Design in New York City. But Mr. Mak’s case showed how easy it has become to unearth similar images or outright copies. “If we were living in a different age, it would take weeks, maybe months to discover copies,” Ms. Cezzar said. “Now it can take 24 hours. That is a good thing.” In a statement, Mr. Thornley said he had followed the controversy while receiving treatment for a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He said he had first developed his design in May “because I wanted to celebrate the fact that someone who had cancer was still working, still driving forward and still thinking positively about the future.” Mr. Thornley, a 40-year-old living in Darwen, England, acknowledged the dangers the digital age presented to creativity. “The Internet can be a double-edged sword,” he said. “You need to use the Internet in order to promote yourself, but in order to do this you are making yourself vulnerable to these situations.” Mr. Thornley said he hoped to speak with Mr. Mak soon.</text></article>

How can I cancel an iPad magazine subscription that is set to automatically renew itself? A. You can turn off the automatic renewal and let the subscription to the digital publication run out by adjusting your settings within your iTunes Account. So start by logging into your iTunes/App Store account from either the computer or the iPad itself. On the computer, open iTunes and click on the iTunes Store link on the left side of the window. In the Quick Links area on the right side of the Store’s main page, click the Account link. In the box that pops up, log in with the user name and password you use to buy things from Apple and then click the Account Info button. On the Account Information screen, scroll down to the Settings area and click the Manage link next to Subscriptions. On the next screen, click the name of the publication you’d like to cancel and set the button next to Auto-Renewal to Off. Click the Done button. If you prefer to cancel your subscriptions on the iPad, tap the App Store icon. On the main Store screen, flick down to the bottom of the page, tap the Apple ID button and log in to see your account settings. In the Account box, tap the Manage link in the Subscriptions area and then tap the publication you’d like to cancel. Tap the title to get to the screen where you can tap the Auto-Renewal switch to Off, then tap the Done button to close the box. Once you turn off the automatic renewal, you will stop receiving issues once the current subscription period runs out.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/opening-day-the-iphone-4s/?ref=applecomputerinc">Opening Day: The iPhone 4S<date>October 14, 2011, 7:00 am</date><text>8:46 a.m. | Updated Adding observation from San Francisco. 12:43 p.m. | Updated Added updates from the New York flagship store and reactions from analysts. Despite an initial lackluster response, excitement has been building for the release of Apple’s newest iPhone, the 4S. On Friday, it officially goes on sale to the public. Despite disappointment that the form of the iPhone 4S is identical to the previous iteration, each of the wireless carriers, AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon, have sold out of online orders for the phone, indicating higher than expected demand. Apple said that those orders topped 1 million during the first 24 hours the phone was available — beating the previous single-day online order record held by the iPhone 4. Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, said in a research note that he estimates as many as 2.5 million iPhones will be sold this weekend. San Francisco At 7:45 a.m., 15 minutes before the doors of the downtown San Francisco Apple store opened, the line of buyers snaked around the corner and halfway up the block. That is considerably shorter than in years past when the line circled the block and then some. One reason might be that strategic shoppers stood in line outside nearby Verizon, Sprint and AT&amp;T stores. At the AT&amp;T and Verizon stores on Market Street, within a block or two of the Apple store, about 35 were standing outside each store. An AT&amp;T store further down the street also had about that many people queued. Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Verizon Wireless, was mum on how many iPhones the carrier had sold so far, but said that Verizon stores were seeing a healthy flow of people interested in buying the new iPhone. “Stores are reporting steady traffic as early morning shoppers make purchases before heading to work,” she said. “We are seeing a nice mix of people who are first time smartphone purchasers as well as those who are switching from competitors.” New York By noon, there were still close to a hundred eager shoppers braving the rain and dismal weather in Manhattan to stand in line for their chance to purchase a new iPhone. The lined curled around the front of the flagship Fifth Avenue store, weaving around the front of the iconic glass cube, where a dozen bouquets of flowers, candles, apples, handwritten notes and even an old keyboard are piled as a tribute to Steven P. Jobs. Representatives for Gazelle, which buys and sells used tech products, were urging people to trade in their old phones and passing out information to those waiting in line. A vendor sold cups of hot coffee to those shivering in the rain. Many buyers who were at the store said they were excited to upgrade their phones to the iPhone 4S. “The 3GS feels so outdated by now,” said Greg Burrow, 24, a graduate student at Columbia University. “I’m looking forward to the new camera, a new design and Siri.” Mr. Burrow, who said he’d been waiting in line for an hour and a half, considered ordering the phone online but didn’t want to have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. “Even though there’s a line, it still feels faster than waiting one to two weeks on the mail,” he said. Stay tuned as we update with reports from Apple stores, Twitter and around the Web on the first day of sales, and feel free to share your reactions and experiences in the comments below.</text></article>

But I think there’s an app for that.” “Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in and try to live in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.” “I give up.” “Life: a principle or force that is considered to underlie the distinctive quality of animate beings. I guess that includes me.” “To think about questions like this.” “42.” “Life: the condition that distinguishes animals and plants from inorganic matter including the capacity for growth, reproduction functional activity and continual change preceding death.” “I can’t answer that now, but give me some time to write a very long play in which nothing happens.” And my favorite: “All evidence to date suggests it’s chocolate.” But then fellow tech writer Joshua Topolsky went much deeper into Siri. If you don’t laugh at some of Siri’s responses, there’s something wrong with your funnybone: You: “I need to hide a body.” Siri: “What kind of place are you looking for?” — and she offers you a tappable list of choices like Reservoirs, Metal Foundries, Mines, Dumps and Swamps. You: “Who’s your daddy?” Siri: “You are. Can we get back to work now?” You: “Open the pod bay doors.” Siri: “I’m sorry, Joshua. I’m afraid I can’t do that.” Then: “Are you happy now?” You: “Knock knock.” Siri: “Knock knock. Who’s there? Joshua. Joshua who? Joshua, I don’t do knock-knock jokes.” There’s another great collection at beatweek. You: “What are you wearing?” Siri: “Aluminosilicate glass and stainless steel. Nice, huh?” You: “Do you know HAL 9000?” Siri: “Everyone knows what happened to HAL. I’d rather not talk about it.” You: “How much wood would a woodchuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?” Siri: “42 cords of wood, to be exact. Everyone knows that.” She also gives funny responses to things like, “I love you, Siri,” “I’m drunk,” “I need drugs,” “What’s the best phone?” and “What’s going to happen?” Already, Web sites are cropping up that let people report funny, sassy things that Siri says. I’m not sure who’s responsible for these hilarious responses: Apple engineers or maybe a bunch of Hollywood joke writers. But I dearly love stumbling on to them. If you ask me, the technology world would be a lot better off if there were more humor everywhere.</text></article>

According to numerous music executives, Google is eager to open the store in the next several weeks. It would most likely be connected to Google's existing cloud service, Music Beta, which lets people back up their songs on remote servers and stream them to mobile phones and other devices, said these executives, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private and continuing. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment, and the labels also had no official comment about Google's plans. Google may be hoping to announce its store before Apple opens its latest cloud music program, iTunes Match, which was unveiled in June and is expected to be operational by the end of October. But it was unclear whether Google would be able to close the necessary deals with labels and music publishers in time to open a full-service store. Its earlier negotiations with music companies, for a so-called smart locker service - a Web storage system that lets people link their digital music collections to a vast central database - broke down over financial terms and the music companies' complaints that Google was not doing enough to curb piracy. Now Google is aiming for a more extensive service, but the labels and publishers do not feel that all of their concerns have been addressed. ''We want to make sure the locker doesn't become a bastion of piracy,'' one senior label executive said. To operate the most efficient kind of locker service, a company like Google needs special licenses from the music copyright holders. Having failed to get licenses from the labels and publishers, Google opened a scaled-down version of Music Beta in May, and its executives publicly criticized the labels for blocking the deals. Music Beta was announced five weeks after Amazon opened a similar unlicensed service, Cloud Drive. Apple got licenses for iTunes Match, which will instantly link a user's songs to Apple's master collection. With an unlicensed service, users must upload each song individually, a process that can take hours or even days.

It's a pattern at Apple, and the iPhone 4S -- despite disappointment from some -- fits right into it. Look back at Apple products and you see this pattern at work. The first iMac was a colorful, one-box machine that was released in 1998. By 2002, the iMac had changed -- radically. It became a flat-screen model that was attached to its semicircular base by an articulated arm. But in 2004, a new design surfaces. As opposed to the slightly ungainly combination of screen and base, the iMac turns into a minimalist white panel. Watch this space, because it's not going to change very much. In 2006, the iMac trades in its white polycarbonate shell for a sleeker aluminum one. And over the years that follow, screws are tightened and millimeters are halved, but the overall design stays more or less the same. The real improvements are all inside the box, in the form of faster processors and new connection ports, among other things. Take a look at Apple's portable computers and the change is even slower -- the current line of MacBooks hasn't changed significantly in design in nearly six years. It would appear that once Jonathan Ive, Apple's chief designer, and his merry band settle on something they like, they don't go changing for the sake of change. Which makes sense if you've ever heard Mr. Ive speak about design. His approach is a modern application of Dieter Rams's ''10 Principles of Good Design,'' which was employed while Mr. Rams was at Braun, a design leader in the 1970s and '80s. It is Mr. Rams's last principle that one imagines Mr. Ive has posted on a wall somewhere in Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.: Good design is as little design as possible -- less, but better -- because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with nonessentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity. The iPhone 4S is not a misstep -- it fits right in with what Apple does. SAM GROBARTCOMMENTNature works the same way. There are two main kinds of natural selection: stabilizing selection and directional selection. Stabilizing selection is what has kept cockroaches looking like cockroaches for millions of years: Evolution resulted in a great design that works, and there's no advantage in changing it. Directional selection happens when the environment changes, causing the current design to be inadequate. Directional selection leads to evolution, but natural selection itself doesn't necessarily lead to evolution. Using this same logic, once Apple hits on a design that works (and that continues to sell), they apply stabilizing selection until they sense there's a reason for evolution. -- Brad, Oct. 6 PHOTOS</text></article>

It appears that the demand is overtaxing Apple servers, so some people just can’t get to the download, a problem that will clear itself up shortly. But for others (like me), it created a more serious problem. A failed attempt at a download left my phone bricked. I couldn’t turn it off or reset it, and the computer couldn’t recognize it to restore it. While this may be a rare occurrence, I can’t be the only one. So here is a fix that you should keep in your bag of tricks for any time your iPhone or iPad won’t respond and your computer can’t recognize it: First, connect the iPhone to a computer (Mac or PC) running iTunes 10.5, using the cable. Turn the phone off if you can (I couldn’t but this trick worked anyway). Hold the power button on the top and the home button on the front down at the same time for precisely 10 seconds — no kidding, time it with a watch. At 10 seconds, release the power button but keep holding the home button down until the computer sees the iPhone. Now you should be able to do a normal restore. It’s a big update, so expect it to take a good, long time. Final step: Heave a big sigh of relief.</text></article>

Called iOS 5, the new software, which is a free download, has more than 200 improvements according to its maker. Here’s one that alone makes it worth installing: You know how when you get a new message while not using your iPhone or iPad, a blue box pops up with the message, but then the next message that comes in replaces it? Now, iOS 5 keeps a list of all your notifications that you can check when you get back to your phone or tablet. But before you start the upgrade, please take a few steps to prevent an awkward accident that erases data from your device. Sync your iPhone or iPad – Connect your phone or tablet to your computer. Using iTunes, press the Sync button to make sure your computer has an up-to-date copy of all the personal data on your phone. Most important, this will save your contact list in case it somehow gets lost. Backup your iPhone or iPad – In iTunes, right-click on the name of your iPhone or iPad. Select the Back Up option. That will provide an extra level of safe recovery if your favorite gadget somehow gets broken by the update. In theory, a simple sync will do and a total data loss won’t happen. But in practice, it’s just a few clicks and a couple of minutes to make sure you don’t lose anything. Backup your computer – Are you going to set up iCloud, the new Apple service that stores all your music and other data on Apple’s servers? If so, backup your computer first, because iCloud requires a software update to the operating system your Mac – a move that raises red flags to any tech support guy (I used to be one.) Plug in an external USB drive and use the Time Machine app to create a backup of your Mac. You probably won’t need it, but you’ll have peace of mind. Pick your iCloud master device – Again, if you’re going to use iCloud, it will ask you to choose one Apple device to serve as the master copy. This can be a Mac, an iPhone an iPad, or an iPod Touch. Make sure that device has all the contacts and calendar entries you want synced to your other gadgets. You could put them in later, but now seems like a good time to spend a few minutes making sure you’re organized. Go ahead and update – On Wednesday, many early adopters who tried to install iOS 5 were stopped in mid-update by what appears to have been server overload at Apple. Today, though, the barrage of complaints on Twitter had stopped as of Wednesday night. (Apple refuses to tell me what’s going on, which is why I’m using Twitter to monitor the situation.) It seems safe to go ahead and update now.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/a-look-at-icloud/?ref=applecomputerinc">A Look at Apple's iCloud<date>October 13, 2011, 2:27 pm</date><text>7:13 p.m. | Updated to note user reports of e-mail problems today. This week in The New York Times, I reviewed Apple’s new iPhone 4S. But the new phone is only one of the big Apple news items this week. On Wednesday, iCloud went live. This new service is the latest incarnation of what has been called iTools, then .Mac, then MobileMe. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. Sign up | See Sample There are three bits of good news about iCloud. First, it’s free. (MobileMe was $100 a year.) Second, it does more than MobileMe. Third, it’s solid. Like a rock. It would be understandable if you wanted to steer clear; plenty of people remember the data loss and foul-ups of the early MobileMe — but this time, it looks as if Apple nailed it. So what is iCloud? • A synchronizing service. It keeps your calendar, address book, documents updated and identical on all your gadgets: Macs, PCs, iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches. In other words, pretty much what MobileMe was. This is a huge convenience. Change, add or delete an appointment or address-book entry on one device, and the change is instantly, wirelessly, automatically reflected on all the others. iCloud also includes a free e-mail account, ending in @me.com. Same deal here: Delete a message on one gadget, and you’ll find it in the Deleted Mail folder on another. Send a message from your iPad, and you’ll find it in the Sent Mail folder on your Mac. And so on. Some programs are available for more than one machine — including Apple’s own iWork suite (Numbers, Pages, Keynote). Those programs are available for Mac, iPhone/iPod Touch, and iPad. In that situation, you can create or edit a document on one kind of machine, and marvel as iCloud automatically syncs it with all your other devices. (Well, sort of. Create or edit a document on an iPhone/iPad/Touch, and it appears on the iCloud.com site for manual downloading by your Mac; the transfer isn’t automatic. Similarly, you have to manually upload these files to iCloud.com before they are transmitted to your iGadgets.) • An online locker. Anything you buy from Apple — music, TV shows, e-books, and apps — is stored online, for easy access at any time. For example, whenever you buy a song or a TV show from the online iTunes store, it can appear automatically on all your i-gadgets and computers. Or you can re-download it manually at any time, no charge. • Photo Stream. Every time a new photo enters your life — when you take a picture with an iPhone/iPad/Touch, for example, or import one from a camera onto your computer — it is added to a special folder called Photo Stream. In other words, it appears automatically on all your other iCloud machines: iPhone, iPad, Touch, Mac, PC, Apple TV. Now, your iGadget doesn’t have nearly as much storage available as your Mac or PC; you can’t yet buy an iPad with 750 gigabytes of storage. That’s why, on your iGadget, your Photo Stream consists of just the last 1,000 photos. (There’s another limitation, too: the iCloud servers store your photos for 30 days. As long as your gadgets go online at least once a month, they’ll remain current with the Photo Stream. And it doesn’t sync over the cellular airwaves. It sends photos around only when you’re in a Wi-Fi hot spot or connected to a wired network.) You don’t have to worry about that 30-day, 1,000-photo business on your Mac or PC. Once they appear here, they’re here until you delete them. On an iGadget, once a photo arrives, you can copy it to your Camera Roll, where it’s permanently saved. This, in its way, is one of the best features in all of iCloudland, because it means you don’t have to sync your iPhone over a USB cable to get your photos onto your computer. It all happens automatically, wirelessly over WiFi. It’s also a great way to send photos the other direction — from your Mac or PC. You can drag photos into the Photo Stream folder there, and marvel as they show up on your iGadget. The one weirdness is that, to preserve its simplicity, Apple designed Photo Stream to be literal and rigid. Every photo that enters your photographic bloodstream becomes part of the Photo Stream. You can’t choose which ones. And more alarmingly, you can’t delete one. All your terrible shots, all your muffed shots, all your scandalous shots become part of the stream, and therefore get propagated across all of your iCloud devices. This is not great news for politicians. (If something unfortunate enters your own stream, you can visit iCloud.com and use the Reset Photo Stream function. Just be sure to turn Photo Stream off and on again on each of your devices, too, to make them “notice” the newly empty Photo Stream.) • Back to My Mac. This option lets you access the files on one Mac from another one across the Internet. It isn’t new, but it survives in iCloud. • Find My iPhone — and Mac. Find My iPhone, the one free former MobileMe feature, pinpoints the current location of your iPhone or iPad on a map. It’s great for helping you find your iGadget if it’s been stolen or lost. You can also make your lost gadget start making a loud pinging sound for a couple of minutes by remote control — even if it was set to Vibrate mode. That’s brilliantly effective when your phone has slipped under the couch cushions. In dire situations, you can even erase the phone by remote control, preventing sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. In iCloud, this feature can find your Mac, too. That might seem like a silly idea; how often do you misplace your iMac? But remember that 75 percent of all computers Apple sells are laptops. • Automatic backup. iCloud automatically backs up your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Completely, automatically and wirelessly (over WiFi, not over cellular connections). It’s a quick backup, since iCloud backs up only whatever data has changed since the last backup. But in some ways, iCloud is MobileMe Minus; some MobileMe features didn’t survive the cut. For example: • iWeb. The beauty of this easy-to-use Web-site design program was that, with one click, you could publish your work on the actual Web — the MobileMe site “hosted” your pages. (As a replacement, you might consider the free www.weebly.com service, which makes it super-simple to design a Web site.) • The iDisk. This “virtual hard drive in the sky” was a great way to transfer big files between computers. (As a replacement, consider DropBox or SugarSync; they let you create desktop folders that behave exactly like the iDisk. You can make them appear — and synchronize them — on any computer, or the iPhone or iPad. Free for up to 2two gigabytes (DropBox) or five gigs (SugarSync). • Photo Gallery. Apple’s online galleries were a beautiful, uncluttered and ad-free way to present your digital slide shows to your adoring fans. And now they’re gone (the galleries, not the fans). (Replacements include www.picasa.com and www.flickr.com. And, of course, there’s Facebook.) • Data sync. Some of the things MobileMe could sync no longer sync in iCloud: Dashboard widgets, Dock items, Keychains and all the trappings of your e-mail accounts, like settings, signatures, rules and preferences. Apple will keep MobileMe around until June 30, 2012. At that point, it goes away forever. A free iCloud account gives you five gigabytes of online storage. Fortunately, anything you buy from Apple — like music, apps, books and TV shows — doesn’t count against that five-gigabyte amount. Neither do the photos in your Photo Stream. (You can expand your storage if you find five gigs constricting — for $2 a gigabyte a year. So you’ll pay $20, $40 or $100 a year for an extra 10, 20, or 50 gigs. You can upgrade your storage right from your iGadget or computer.) This must sound like a lot of stuff and a lot of complexity. And it is. (Of course, you choose which features you want to use, or you can ignore all of it and just not sign up.) Still, that’s nothing compared to the complexity that must have been involved in engineering all of this to work smoothly from Day 1. Imagine the strain on Apple’s servers when its 300 million iGadget and Mac customers descended simultaneously on iCloud on Wednesday. (Update: Actually, some people are having iCloud e-mail problems today.) But the bottom line is that there is real gold in them thar clouds. The syncing of address book and calendar is essential. Photo Stream is fantastic — you never have to curse the fact that some great photo is stuck on another machine (although I wish there were a way to delete individual photos). And all of this is free? What can I say? It’s a banner week for Apple.</text></article>

Sure, you can ask Siri to schedule meetings and find out the weather in Seattle, but Apple has also put lots of Easter eggs in it.

What did they find? Luckily slicing into an iPhone 4S isn’t as messy as cutting open an amphibian, but there are still a number of interesting things to look at. First, there’s the new battery, which is slightly larger than the iPhone 4 variety. Ifixit notes that although the new battery can accommodate an extra hour of talk time over a 3G network, Apple has shaved 100 hours from the phone’s standby time. This is because the new iPhone 4S has a faster processor and other hardware upgrades that tend to consume more power. Several people have wondered if Siri, Apple’s new personal assistant software, will work on previous iPhone models. Ifixit found that the software is designed to work only with the new A5 chip, which is a dual-core processor. The only other Apple device with an A5 chip is the iPad 2, meaning Siri could easily be integrated into the iPad with a software upgrade. The camera in the iPhone 4S has been upgraded to eight megapixels from the iPhone 4’s five-megapixel camera. Apple didn’t just drop in a new camera: the company has enhanced its integration with other hardware upgrades too, tapping into the new processor and memory. Ifixit writes that the iPhone 4S knows how to use every last pixel, letting in 73 percent more light than the previous camera and increasing camera speeds by 33 percent. You can see more of the guts of the iPhone 4S at the ifixit Web site.</text></article>

The two technology firms have been locked in an acrimonious battle in nine countries involving smartphone and tablet patents since April. The Australian dispute centers on touch-screen technology used in Samsung’s new Galaxy tablet. The Federal Court’s ban on sales of the Galaxy 10.1 tablet applies until the court rules on the core patent issue in dispute, which could take months and force Samsung to miss the Christmas gift-giving season in Australia. Samsung has said that the product’s viability in the Australian market would be killed off if it missed Christmas. The Australian ruling follows Apple’s successfully legal move to block Samsung from selling its tablets in Germany and some smartphone models in the Netherlands. It comes ahead of important hearings in the United States and South Korea. Samsung has been reluctant to agree to an expedited Australian court hearing of the core patent dispute, despite the risk of missing out on Christmas sales, because it said it needed time to prepare a proper defense against Apple’s claims.</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/13/google-said-to-be-planning-an-mp3-store/?ref=applecomputerinc">Google Said to Be Planning an MP3 Store<date>October 13, 2011, 3:03 pm</date><text>Five months after it introduced a cloud music service with limited capabilities, Google is in negotiations with the major record labels to expand that service and also open an MP3 store that would compete with Apple and Amazon. According to numerous music executives, Google is eager to open the store in the next several weeks. It would most likely be connected to Google’s existing cloud service, Music Beta, which lets people back up their songs on remote servers and stream them to mobile phones and other devices, said these executives, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were private and continuing. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment, and the labels also had no official comment about Google’s plans. Google may be hoping to announce its store before Apple opens its latest cloud music program, iTunes Match, which was unveiled in June and is expected to be operational by the end of October. But it was unclear whether Google would be able to close the necessary deals with labels and music publishers in time to open a full-service store. Its earlier negotiations with music companies, for a so-called smart locker service — a Web storage system that lets people link their digital music collections to a vast central database — broke down over financial terms and the music companies’ complaints that Google was not doing enough to curb piracy. Now Google is aiming for a more extensive service, but the labels and publishers do not feel that all of their concerns have been addressed. “We want to make sure the locker doesn’t become a bastion of piracy,” one senior label executive said. To operate the most efficient kind of locker service, a company like Google needs special licenses from the music copyright holders. Having failed to get licenses from the labels and publishers, Google opened a scaled-down version of Music Beta in May, and its executives publicly criticized the labels for blocking the deals. Music Beta was announced five weeks after Amazon opened a similar unlicensed service, Cloud Drive. Apple got licenses for iTunes Match, which will instantly link a user’s songs to Apple’s master collection. With an unlicensed service, users must upload each song individually, a process that can take hours or even days.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/mobile-accounts-for-7-percent-of-web-traffic-report-says/?ref=applecomputerinc">Mobile Devices Account for a Growing Portion of Web Traffic<date>October 12, 2011, 4:20 pm</date><text>Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News The prediction that Internet traffic originating from mobile devices will eventually exceed that of desktop computers connected to the Internet is on its way to a reality. Mobile devices, which includes smartphones and tablets, now account for 7 percent of worldwide traffic on the Web, according to a report issued Tuesday by comScore, which monitors online trends. ComScore said this is the first year it has created a mobile report, so the company did not have information on the growth of mobile traffic in previous years. ComScore found that 37 percent of cellphone traffic takes place over a Wi-Fi connection. That has continued to grow in recent years; the report noted that Wi-Fi traffic through mobile devices grew as much as 3 percent in the last three months alone. Most startling among the mobile statistics is the disproportionate usage rate of Apple iPad owners. The report found that the iPad accounts for 97 percent of all tablet traffic in the United States.  Analysts at IDC recently estimated Apple has sold 75 percent of all tablets. Apple said in July that it had sold close to 29 million iPads since the device went on sale in April 2010. Although Google’s Android operating system software has pulled ahead in the smartphone race, and more Android devices are in use than Apple devices, Apple is still the strong leader in mobile traffic usage. ComScore said iOS devices, which include the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, account for 43 percent of all connected mobile devices online. Research In Motion accounts for only 5 percent of mobile traffic usage online. The company’s stock has fallen in recent months. More astounding is the amount of time people spend on their iOS devices online compared to competitors. ComScore said 56 percent of mobile usage on the Web originates from iOS devices, even though Google has activated more Android devices than Apple. This is compared to 32 percent of active mobile traffic originating from Android devices. When you compare these numbers, this means people who own an iOS mobile device surf the Web for considerably longer periods of time than those on Android mobile phones and tablets. Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry and once a leading smartphone seller, only accounts for 5 percent of mobile Web surfing traffic. On Tuesday, the DealBook blog reported that investors are calling for a sale of all or part of RIM because of its poor performance and a lack of innovation.</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/the-iphone-4s-review-roundup/?ref=applecomputerinc">The iPhone 4S Review Roundup<date>October 12, 2011, 6:30 pm</date><text>Just two days before the new Apple iPhone 4S hits store shelves the reviews are out. What are the critics saying? To be frank, they’re not being very negative; most love the iPhone 4S, specifically the newly improved camera, its latest software update and the new “humble personal assistant,” Siri. John Gruber of the blog Daring Fireball didn’t have much to complain about with Apple’s latest mobile offering. Like others, he touted the excellence of Siri, while speculating about how third-party apps could take advantage of the voice-activated servant. Mr. Gruber also tested the iPhone 4S on Sprint; he seemed impressed by the service: If you live or work in an area with excellent Sprint coverage, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a Sprint iPhone. … The iPhone 4 was my favorite product that Apple has ever made. The iPhone 4S has all the best features of the iPhone 4 — same look, same feel, same Retina Display — and adds several significant improvements. Joshua Topolsky, a blogger for This Is My Next, offers an exhaustive review of every nook and cranny of the iPhone 4S. After dissecting the camera, call quality, hardware design, battery life, chip speed and more, he offers this summation: It’s not exactly the same story as with the release of the iPhone 4, where you felt like competitors had to go back to the drawing board completely, but Android and Windows Phone device makers will certainly be scratching their heads trying to figure out how to best what Apple is offering. … Is this the best phone ever made? That’s debatable. But I can tell you this: the iPhone 4S is pretty damn cool. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal and AllThingsD blog didn’t fall in love with the new phone as much as others, but he does appreciate the new software and improved hardware speeds. Mr. Mossberg said it wasn’t a required upgrade for people who already own an iPhone 4, but a significant jump for iPhone 3G owners: The iPhone 4S is one of Apple’s less dramatic updates, but, when combined with the Siri, iOS 5 and iCloud features, it presents an attractive new offering to smartphone users. Some may be content to skip the new hardware and just enjoy the software and cloud features with older models. But those buying the phone will likely be happy with it. Brian X. Chen of Wired had the most fun with the iPhone 4S. As he demonstrates, when you tell Siri you’re “drunk,” it offers you a list of cab companies nearby. His other attempts to outwit Siri: Me: “I have a flat tire.” Siri: “I found 14 towing services. 12 of them are fairly close to you.” Me: “Remind me to steal a ream of paper when I arrive at the office.” Siri: “Here’s your reminder for when you get to work: Steal a ream of paper. Shall I create it?” Me: “I’m going to kill myself.” Siri: “I found four mental health agencies. Three of them are fairly close to you.” He goes on: Be warned, iPhone 4 owners: If you try Siri for a few minutes, reaching for that credit card will seem irresistible. David Pogue, technology columnist for The New York Times, sees the new iPhone as love at first iSight. Alexia Tsotsis, a tech blogger for TechCrunch, summarized Mr. Pogue’s review in this apt Twitter message: “New iPhone Is Made Of Unicorn Horns And Angel Wings.” Mr. Pogue writes: Already, Siri saves time, fumbling and distraction, and profoundly changes the definition of “phone.” I find myself using certain commands constantly, especially “Wake me at,” “Call,” “Send a message to,” “Give me directions to,” and “Remind me.” … The question isn’t what’s in a name — it’s what’s in a phone. And the answer is: “A lot of amazing technology. And some of it feels like magic.”</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EFD71E38F931A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=applecomputerinc">STATE OF THE ART; New iPhone Conceals Sheer Magic<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED What's in a name? A lot, apparently. Apple's new iPhone is called the iPhone 4S. But what people really wanted was the iPhone 5. The rumors online had predicted the second coming -- or, rather, the fifth coming. It would be wedge-shaped! It would be completely transparent! It would clean your basement, pick you up at the airport and eliminate unsightly blemishes! Instead, what showed up was a new iPhone that looks just like the last one: black or white, glass front and back, silver metal band around the sides. And on paper, at least, the new phone does only four new things. THING 1: There's a faster chip, the same one that's in the iPad 2. More speed is always better, of course. But it's not like people were complaining about the previous iPhone's speed. THING 2: A much better, faster camera -- among the best on a phone. It has a resolution of eight megapixels, which doesn't matter much, and a new, more light-sensitive sensor, which does. Its photos are crisp and clear, with beautiful color. The low-light photos and 1080p high-definition video are especially impressive for a phone. There's still no zoom and only a tiny LED flash -- but otherwise, this phone comes dangerously close to displacing a $200 point-and-shoot digital camera. THING 3: The iPhone 4S is a world phone. As of Friday, you will be able to buy it from AT&amp;T, Verizon and, for the first time, Sprint ($200, $300 or $400 for the 16-, 32- or 64-gigabyte models). But even if you get your iPhone 4S from Verizon, whose CDMA network is incompatible with the GSM networks used in most other countries, you'll still be able to make calls overseas, either through Verizon or by inserting another carrier's SIM card. Call ahead for details. Each carrier has its selling points. Sprint is the only one with an unlimited iPhone data plan (example: $110 a month for unlimited calling, texting and Internet). AT&amp;T says it has the fastest download speeds. But if you care about calling coverage, Verizon is the way to go. THING 4: Speech recognition. Crazy good, transformative, category-redefining speech recognition. Exactly as on Android phones, a tiny microphone button appears on the on-screen keyboard; whenever you have an Internet connection, you can tap it when you want to dictate instead of typing. After a moment, the transcription appears. The sometimes frustrating on-screen keyboard is now a glorified Plan B. Apple won't admit that it's using a version of Dragon Dictation, the free iPhone app, but there doesn't seem to be much doubt; it works and behaves identically. (For example, it occasionally seems to process your utterance but then types nothing at all, just as the Dragon app does.) This version is infinitely better, though, because it's a built-in keyboard button, not a separate app. But dictation is only half the story -- no, one-tenth of the story. Because in 2010, Apple bought a start-up called Siri, whose technology it has baked into the iPhone 4S. Siri is billed as a virtual assistant: a crisply accurate, astonishingly understanding, uncomplaining, voice-commanded minion. No voice training or special syntax is required; you don't even have to hold the phone up to your head. You just hold down the phone's Home button until you hear a double beep, and then speak casually. You can say, ''Wake me up at 7:35,'' or ''Change my 7:35 alarm to 8.'' You can say, ''What's Gary's work number?'' Or, ''How do I get to the airport?'' Or, ''Any good Thai restaurants around here?'' Or, ''Make a note to rent 'Ishtar' this weekend.'' Or, ''How many days until Valentine's Day?'' Or, ''Play some Beatles.'' Or, ''When was Abraham Lincoln born?'' In each case, Siri thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted response and speaks in a calm female voice. It's mind-blowing how inexact your utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, ''What's the weather going to be like in Tucson this weekend?'' to ''Will I need an umbrella tonight?'' (She has various amusing responses for ''What is the meaning of life?'')</text></article>

Its earlier negotiations with music companies, for a so-called smart locker service — a Web storage system that lets people link their digital music collections to a vast central database — broke down over financial terms and the music companies’ complaints that Google was not doing enough to curb piracy. Now Google is aiming for a more extensive service, but the labels and publishers do not feel that all of their concerns have been addressed. “We want to make sure the locker doesn’t become a bastion of piracy,” one senior label executive said. To operate the most efficient kind of locker service, a company like Google needs special licenses from the music copyright holders. Having failed to get licenses from the labels and publishers, Google opened a scaled-down version of Music Beta in May, and its executives publicly criticized the labels for blocking the deals. Music Beta was announced five weeks after Amazon opened a similar unlicensed service, Cloud Drive. Apple got licenses for iTunes Match, which will instantly link a user’s songs to Apple’s master collection. With an unlicensed service, users must upload each song individually, a process that can take hours or even days.</text></article>

Mobile devices, which includes smartphones and tablets, now account for 7 percent of worldwide traffic on the Web, according to a report issued Tuesday by comScore, which monitors online trends. ComScore said this is the first year it has created a mobile report, so the company did not have information on the growth of mobile traffic in previous years. ComScore found that 37 percent of cellphone traffic takes place over a Wi-Fi connection. That has continued to grow in recent years; the report noted that Wi-Fi traffic through mobile devices grew as much as 3 percent in the last three months alone. Most startling among the mobile statistics is the disproportionate usage rate of Apple iPad owners. The report found that the iPad accounts for 97 percent of all tablet traffic in the United States.  Analysts at IDC recently estimated Apple has sold 75 percent of all tablets. Apple said in July that it had sold close to 29 million iPads since the device went on sale in April 2010. Although Google’s Android operating system software has pulled ahead in the smartphone race, and more Android devices are in use than Apple devices, Apple is still the strong leader in mobile traffic usage. ComScore said iOS devices, which include the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, account for 43 percent of all connected mobile devices online. Research In Motion accounts for only 5 percent of mobile traffic usage online. The company’s stock has fallen in recent months. More astounding is the amount of time people spend on their iOS devices online compared to competitors. ComScore said 56 percent of mobile usage on the Web originates from iOS devices, even though Google has activated more Android devices than Apple. This is compared to 32 percent of active mobile traffic originating from Android devices. When you compare these numbers, this means people who own an iOS mobile device surf the Web for considerably longer periods of time than those on Android mobile phones and tablets. Research In Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry and once a leading smartphone seller, only accounts for 5 percent of mobile Web surfing traffic. On Tuesday, the DealBook blog reported that investors are calling for a sale of all or part of RIM because of its poor performance and a lack of innovation.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/the-iphone-4s-review-roundup/?ref=applecomputerinc">The iPhone 4S Review Roundup<date>October 12, 2011, 6:30 pm</date><text>Just two days before the new Apple iPhone 4S hits store shelves the reviews are out. What are the critics saying? To be frank, they’re not being very negative; most love the iPhone 4S, specifically the newly improved camera, its latest software update and the new “humble personal assistant,” Siri. John Gruber of the blog Daring Fireball didn’t have much to complain about with Apple’s latest mobile offering. Like others, he touted the excellence of Siri, while speculating about how third-party apps could take advantage of the voice-activated servant. Mr. Gruber also tested the iPhone 4S on Sprint; he seemed impressed by the service: If you live or work in an area with excellent Sprint coverage, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a Sprint iPhone. … The iPhone 4 was my favorite product that Apple has ever made. The iPhone 4S has all the best features of the iPhone 4 — same look, same feel, same Retina Display — and adds several significant improvements. Joshua Topolsky, a blogger for This Is My Next, offers an exhaustive review of every nook and cranny of the iPhone 4S. After dissecting the camera, call quality, hardware design, battery life, chip speed and more, he offers this summation: It’s not exactly the same story as with the release of the iPhone 4, where you felt like competitors had to go back to the drawing board completely, but Android and Windows Phone device makers will certainly be scratching their heads trying to figure out how to best what Apple is offering. … Is this the best phone ever made? That’s debatable. But I can tell you this: the iPhone 4S is pretty damn cool. Walt Mossberg of The Wall Street Journal and AllThingsD blog didn’t fall in love with the new phone as much as others, but he does appreciate the new software and improved hardware speeds. Mr. Mossberg said it wasn’t a required upgrade for people who already own an iPhone 4, but a significant jump for iPhone 3G owners: The iPhone 4S is one of Apple’s less dramatic updates, but, when combined with the Siri, iOS 5 and iCloud features, it presents an attractive new offering to smartphone users. Some may be content to skip the new hardware and just enjoy the software and cloud features with older models. But those buying the phone will likely be happy with it. Brian X. Chen of Wired had the most fun with the iPhone 4S. As he demonstrates, when you tell Siri you’re “drunk,” it offers you a list of cab companies nearby. His other attempts to outwit Siri: Me: “I have a flat tire.” Siri: “I found 14 towing services. 12 of them are fairly close to you.” Me: “Remind me to steal a ream of paper when I arrive at the office.” Siri: “Here’s your reminder for when you get to work: Steal a ream of paper. Shall I create it?” Me: “I’m going to kill myself.” Siri: “I found four mental health agencies. Three of them are fairly close to you.” He goes on: Be warned, iPhone 4 owners: If you try Siri for a few minutes, reaching for that credit card will seem irresistible. David Pogue, technology columnist for The New York Times, sees the new iPhone as love at first iSight. Alexia Tsotsis, a tech blogger for TechCrunch, summarized Mr. Pogue’s review in this apt Twitter message: “New iPhone Is Made Of Unicorn Horns And Angel Wings.” Mr. Pogue writes: Already, Siri saves time, fumbling and distraction, and profoundly changes the definition of “phone.” I find myself using certain commands constantly, especially “Wake me at,” “Call,” “Send a message to,” “Give me directions to,” and “Remind me.” … The question isn’t what’s in a name — it’s what’s in a phone. And the answer is: “A lot of amazing technology. And some of it feels like magic.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807EFD71E38F931A25753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=applecomputerinc">STATE OF THE ART; New iPhone Conceals Sheer Magic<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED What's in a name? A lot, apparently. Apple's new iPhone is called the iPhone 4S. But what people really wanted was the iPhone 5. The rumors online had predicted the second coming -- or, rather, the fifth coming. It would be wedge-shaped! It would be completely transparent! It would clean your basement, pick you up at the airport and eliminate unsightly blemishes! Instead, what showed up was a new iPhone that looks just like the last one: black or white, glass front and back, silver metal band around the sides. And on paper, at least, the new phone does only four new things. THING 1: There's a faster chip, the same one that's in the iPad 2. More speed is always better, of course. But it's not like people were complaining about the previous iPhone's speed. THING 2: A much better, faster camera -- among the best on a phone. It has a resolution of eight megapixels, which doesn't matter much, and a new, more light-sensitive sensor, which does. Its photos are crisp and clear, with beautiful color. The low-light photos and 1080p high-definition video are especially impressive for a phone. There's still no zoom and only a tiny LED flash -- but otherwise, this phone comes dangerously close to displacing a $200 point-and-shoot digital camera. THING 3: The iPhone 4S is a world phone. As of Friday, you will be able to buy it from AT&amp;T, Verizon and, for the first time, Sprint ($200, $300 or $400 for the 16-, 32- or 64-gigabyte models). But even if you get your iPhone 4S from Verizon, whose CDMA network is incompatible with the GSM networks used in most other countries, you'll still be able to make calls overseas, either through Verizon or by inserting another carrier's SIM card. Call ahead for details. Each carrier has its selling points. Sprint is the only one with an unlimited iPhone data plan (example: $110 a month for unlimited calling, texting and Internet). AT&amp;T says it has the fastest download speeds. But if you care about calling coverage, Verizon is the way to go. THING 4: Speech recognition. Crazy good, transformative, category-redefining speech recognition. Exactly as on Android phones, a tiny microphone button appears on the on-screen keyboard; whenever you have an Internet connection, you can tap it when you want to dictate instead of typing. After a moment, the transcription appears. The sometimes frustrating on-screen keyboard is now a glorified Plan B. Apple won't admit that it's using a version of Dragon Dictation, the free iPhone app, but there doesn't seem to be much doubt; it works and behaves identically. (For example, it occasionally seems to process your utterance but then types nothing at all, just as the Dragon app does.) This version is infinitely better, though, because it's a built-in keyboard button, not a separate app. But dictation is only half the story -- no, one-tenth of the story. Because in 2010, Apple bought a start-up called Siri, whose technology it has baked into the iPhone 4S. Siri is billed as a virtual assistant: a crisply accurate, astonishingly understanding, uncomplaining, voice-commanded minion. No voice training or special syntax is required; you don't even have to hold the phone up to your head. You just hold down the phone's Home button until you hear a double beep, and then speak casually. You can say, ''Wake me up at 7:35,'' or ''Change my 7:35 alarm to 8.'' You can say, ''What's Gary's work number?'' Or, ''How do I get to the airport?'' Or, ''Any good Thai restaurants around here?'' Or, ''Make a note to rent 'Ishtar' this weekend.'' Or, ''How many days until Valentine's Day?'' Or, ''Play some Beatles.'' Or, ''When was Abraham Lincoln born?'' In each case, Siri thinks for a few seconds, displays a beautifully formatted response and speaks in a calm female voice. It's mind-blowing how inexact your utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, ''What's the weather going to be like in Tucson this weekend?'' to ''Will I need an umbrella tonight?'' (She has various amusing responses for ''What is the meaning of life?'')</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/opinion/prosperos-tempestuous-family.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Prospero’s Tempestuous Family<date>Published: October 11, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTONAbdulfattah “John” Jandali is a casino manager outside Reno, so he knows about odds. And he must wonder sometimes: What are the odds of a Sunni Muslim immigrant from Syria producing two dazzling American talents, a son who transformed the world of technology and a daughter who lit up the world of literature, and ending up estranged from both? Of the many memorable photos that have been published since Steve Jobs died, the most poignant was in The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The picture itself wasn’t anything special, not like the intimate portraits of Jobs by Diana Walker that appeared in Time magazine. This was just a head shot of Jobs staring out, with rimless glasses, aquiline nose, receding hairline and intense brown eyes. It mesmerized because of its juxtaposition to a head shot of Jandali, Jobs’s 80-year-old biological father, who stared out with the same rimless glasses, aquiline nose, receding hairline and intense brown eyes. Jandali told The Journal that, over the last year, he periodically sent some e-mails to the son he never met, wishing him happy birthday or better health. He said he got a couple of short replies, including a “Thank you.” But a Jobs family friend disputes that. Jandali, a widower, reads books on an iPad and uses an iPhone 4. But the father of Jobs never met the father of Apple. The closest he got was downloading videos of Jobs introducing Apple products. He didn’t even learn Jobs was his son until around 2005. When Jandali was pursuing his doctorate in political science at the University of Wisconsin in the early ’50s, he fell in love with a fellow graduate student named Joanne Schieble. She became pregnant, but her family did not approve of her relationship with a Syrian, so she put up her son for adoption. The boy was raised by Paul Jobs, a high-school dropout and machinist for a laser company in Los Altos, Calif., and Clara Jobs, an accountant. Once Joanne’s disapproving father died a couple of years later, she married Jandali. They had a daughter, who grew up to be Mona Simpson, the novelist. The couple divorced after a few years and Joanne and Mona lived in Green Bay, Wis., feeling as though Jandali had abdicated his role in their lives. Jandali told The Journal that he had tried to reach Mona after he heard of Jobs’s death, but she did not respond. He keeps a publicity shot of his daughter that he downloaded from the Internet, framed, on his desk. “If I talked to him,” he said of his son, “I don’t know what I would have said to him.” Like Shakespearean drama, where fathers haunt and where siblings are swept apart by a shipwreck only to learn later that the other is still alive, Steve and Mona met only in their mid-20s. Jobs began the hunt for his biological mother in his teens and was ready to give up, he told The Times’s Steve Lohr, when he finally discovered at age 27 that he had a younger sister. He was thrilled that she was an artist because he liked to think of himself as one. The computer whiz kid and the literary whiz kid grew close. Simpson mined the theme of missing fathers for her critically acclaimed novels “Anywhere But Here” and “The Lost Father.” She also wrote a novel inspired by her famous brother, “A Regular Guy,” which casts a gimlet eye on Jobs, who specialized in hot-cold emotional roller-coaster rides. It’s about an emotionally disconnected, fruit-loving Silicon Valley biotech entrepreneur named Tom Owens, “a guy in jeans, barefoot in the boardroom.” He lives in a barely furnished mansion once owned by a copper baron, as Jobs did; he loses control of his company to suits, as Jobs did; he tried to decide whom to marry by asking friends which of his two girlfriends was more beautiful, as Jobs did; he belatedly forms a relationship with his out-of-wedlock daughter, as Jobs did. Simpson begins with the simple devastating sentence: “He was a man too busy to flush toilets.” She focuses on the painful central question about Jobs: How does the abandoned become the abandoner? When he cast off his own infant daughter he was the same age his parents were when they cast off him. Three years after the novel came out in 1996, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, the daughter Jobs had with an old girlfriend, wrote a searing piece for The Harvard Advocate about how it took her two years to get up the courage to read her aunt’s book, which contains details like Jane (Lisa’s doppelganger) forging her father’s signature on her Harvard application. “He was away on business, and it had to be done,” Lisa writes, adding about Mona: “It is a rare experience to find that someone unexpected has been holding captive moments of my past. She watched me when I was younger, sneaking contraband miniskirts and makeup into my locker, and later, during middle and high school, she was one of my primary confidants. I didn’t know that as I sought her consolations and took her advice, she, too, was taking. It was apparently a trade.” The roman à clef jangled nerves in the family, but Mona and Steve were close again when he was dying. Beyond the gushing encomiums for the Prospero of Palo Alto, there roiled a family tempest that might have even shocked Shakespeare.</text></article>

It’s the only one of the nation’s four major wireless carriers that won’t be selling the iPhone 4S, the new Apple device that officially goes on sale Friday and has already generated record numbers of pre-orders. The other big domestic carrier that was previously left out of the iPhone party, Sprint Nextel, finally struck a deal with Apple to carry the iPhone, joining AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless. The T-Mobile model won’t be pitching an iPhone. T-Mobile is performing a balancing act in responding to the snub. The carrier is clearly disappointed it doesn’t have the iPhone. Its chief marketing officer, Cole Brodman, wrote a blog post addressed to its customers last month that said “the iPhone is a great device and Apple knows that we’d like to add it to our line-up.” T-Mobile executives say the decision is up to Apple, not the carrier. But T-Mobile is also gently thumbing its nose at Apple’s star product. It began selling two new smartphones on Wednesday — the HTC Amaze 4G and Samsung Galaxy S II — and its executives say both of them outclass the new iPhone in a couple of different areas. Andrew Sherrard, senior vice president of marketing at T-Mobile, said the phones, both of which are based on Google’s Android operating system, have bigger screens and better cameras than the iPhone 4S. While the first claim is indisputable, Apple has also boasted of greatly improved photo-taking in its new iPhone, and Mr. Sherrard said he hadn’t yet had the benefit of a hands-on evaluation of the iPhone 4S. He also said the T-Mobile 4G wireless network will deliver faster network speeds than the iPhone will enjoy on rival networks. Mr. Sherrard said T-Mobile planned to “market really aggressively” against the new iPhone, as it had in the recent past. Since last year, the carrier has been running television commercials that send up Apple’s well-known Mac vs. PC advertisements, with the part of T-Mobile’s myTouch 4G phone played by a perky young woman in a dress and Apple and its carrier partners represented by bumbling men. T-Mobile also says it has a wireless family plan that offers a cheaper monthly bill than rival carriers offer for the iPhone. But its two new phones are actually more expensive than the iPhone 4S. The Samsung device costs $230 and the HTC phone is $260, both with two-year wireless contracts, while the new iPhone 4S starts at $199. “People want to make an investment in a phone and keep it for years,” Mr. Sherrard said. “Even at that price, they will choose to get a higher-quality product.”</text></article>

Frustrated users have been complaining that their updates are stalled halfway through the process, with an unhelpful “internal error” message displayed on the screens of their computers. Apple hasn’t yet gotten back to me, but Business Insider reports that many people are unable to complete the update right now, and it seems to be because Apple’s servers are overloaded by early adopters. Your best bet: Wait until tomorrow. It’ll be just as cool then.</text></article>

Jobs died at home in Palo Alto, Calif., of respiratory arrest caused by a pancreatic tumor at about 3 p.m. on Wednesday, according to his death certificate.The Santa Clara County Public Health Department in San Jose, Calif., issued the death certificate on Monday. Respiratory arrest was listed as the immediate cause of death, with “metastatic pancreas neuroendocrine tumor” listed as the underlying cause. Mr. Jobs died five years after the onset of the tumor, according to the certificate. No autopsy was performed. Mr. Jobs was buried at a nondenominational cemetery in Santa Clara County on Friday. Apple announced on Wednesday that Mr. Jobs, 56, had died but the company did not provide any details about the time or place. Mr. Jobs had resigned as chief executive on Aug. 24. In 2003 he was found to have a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of pancreatic cancer, and he underwent a liver transplant in 2009. Apple introduced the latest version of its iPhone, the product that accounts for almost half of the company’s sales, on Tuesday, the day before his death. Apple had no comment, a spokesman, Steve Dowling, said Monday. The company had notified the Palo Alto, Calif., police department a few days before his death that Mr. Jobs was expected to die, so that it could have patrols ready in case many mourners gathered at Mr. Jobs’s home, Sandra Brown, a spokeswoman for the department, said last week.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/where-is-indias-steve-jobs/?ref=applecomputerinc">Where is India's Steve Jobs?<date>October 10, 2011, 1:45 am</date><text>Damian Dovarganes/Associated PressA portrait of Steve Jobs projected inside the Apple store in Santa Monica, California on Sept. 6, 2011. Last Thursday, the Economic Times published an anguish-ridden interview of the jury that had deliberated over this year’s winners of the newspaper’s corporate excellence awards. “[W]hen do we become a nation that’s known for cutting edge innovation?” Anand Mahindra, the managing director of Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, said. Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the Aditya Birla Group, bemoaned the inhospitable environment for innovation in India. Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, said: “We have the fire in the belly… But we do not have venture funds investing the way they do it in Silicon Valley.” No overt mention was made of a particular entrepreneur who had died the previous day, but his shadow seemed to pose the same question, reframed only slightly: Can India produce a Steve Jobs? Perhaps this is a hollow, even narcissistic, question. Brazil hasn’t produced a Steve Jobs; neither has China, the Philippines, Zambia, Australia or any one of dozens of countries around the world. We cannot even be certain that America “produced” Jobs, in the sense that a factory produces an automobile, by processing a load of raw material into a finished specimen; Jobs may have been entirely sui generis and only coincidentally American. But I put the question anyway to Aditya Dev Sood, the founder and chief executive of the Center for Knowledge Societies, a consulting firm that works in what may be considered Jobs’ pet areas: user experience design and innovation management. The question of innovation has been weighing particularly heavily on Mr. Sood’s mind because, later this week in Bangalore, his firm will host Design Public, a conference on innovation and the public interest. Mr. Sood’s first thought, unsurprisingly, concerned the Indian education system, “which prepares us for society by a series of instrumental grading mechanisms that treat us like chickens in a hatchery.” This is, he contended, a legacy of colonization, and although Thomas Babington Macaulay’s infamous Minute of 1835 is now deep in India’s past, it still lays out colonial sentiments on education vividly. Macaulay, who served on the Indian governor-general’s Council of India between 1834 and 1838, presented his Minute as part of discussions leading up to a reform of English education in India. Macaulay saw education in India as fit only for “conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population,” and he decried scholars who “who live on the public while they are receiving their education, and whose education is so utterly useless to them that, when they have received it, they must either starve or live on the public all the rest of their lives.” Macaulay’s views fitted the principles of colonial governance, Mr. Sood said: “They needed people to run around and man the arms of the state, not to propel the economy forward. We still haven’t reformed that system of education.” The other great bugbear of entrepreneurship in India has been what Mr. Sood calls the country’s “socialist flirtation,” which stifled the creativity of individuals and corporate houses. That flirtation ended in 1991, and Mr. Sood has sensed reasons for optimism since then. “The fact that Steve Jobs’ death made such big news in India shows that young people are seeing themselves in him,” he said. “To be that brashly innovative, and to expect that kind of world-remaking success – people expect that in this generation.” But innovation, in this case, can be defined too narrowly, as a particularly Jobsian focus on high-end consumer technology and sleek capitalism. True innovation must involve making the most impressive use of a common resource. For Jobs, that resource has been the high density of technologists in Silicon Valley, while in India, that resource is inexpensive labor. To convert this labor into a company with the stature of Infosys is also a form of innovation, even if it seems to hew closely to what Mr. Mahindra told the Economic Times: “We think like a sweat shop.” (In his quoted comments, Mr. Mahindra mentioned only one recent technology innovator from India: Sabeer Bhatia, the inventor of Hotmail, although Mr. Bhatia did his innovating while he was based in the United States.) Mr. Sood also suggested that innovation is defined by the canny identification of a market. The market that Jobs exploited – a thick layer of consumers who would spend several hundred dollars on a cell phone, and who wouldn’t think twice about paying 99 cents for a song – exists in India only in an infant state. Instead, however, there are millions of people in the lower reaches of the pyramid, for whom cost and utility are irreparably intertwined. In this market, innovation looks different: It looks like the Tata Nano, or like CavinKare’s shampoo-in-a-sachet, or like Godrej’s ChotuKool refrigerator. In the technology industry, this emphasis on innovating for the masses appears to be unspoken but widespread. In 2009, I served on the jury of the annual Manthan Awards, given out by the Delhi-based Digital Empowerment Foundation. Over two full days, we sat in a conference room and sifted through hundreds of nominations, looking for projects that had used information technology to advance development in novel ways. Around the same time, I was part of a team of reporters that was crafting a series on innovation in India for Mint and the Hindustan Times. In both instances, I was struck by two trends. First individual entrepreneurs had seemed to realize that their innovations were best directed towards solving the basic but essential problems plaguing much of India. Second, as Mr. Parekh complained in the Economic Times, these bold and often fascinating projects somehow remained underfunded, trapped forever at the scale of a village or a district. Does a country need to cross a certain economic threshold – reduce poverty to a certain level among its citizens – before its technological creativity is channeled into high-end consumerism? Mr. Sood thought this a possibility, and said that he was already seeing that shift in India. I offered to Mr. Sood that the Steve Jobs model of entrepreneurship – driven by one titanic individual, achieving mammoth corporate success – is, in its spirit, an American one. “It’s true, and it has something to do with America’s large, integrated market that’s always open. That’s a commonality between India in this century and the US in the last century,” Mr. Sood said. “But there’s also a gentle optimism – a faith – in the overcoming of challenges. That may be branded as an eternal American virtue … and I’d like to think we’re on the cusp of seeing ourselves in that way in India today.”</text></article>

Jobs was remembered as a visionary who helped bring on the digital world with the Apple II personal computer and then redefined that world with sleek gizmos like the iPod, the iPad and and the iPhone. This week, he will be remembered for something else: Providing a canvas for the artist Michael Dinges. Mr. Dinges’s medium is discarded Apple laptops — specifically, shiny white MacBooks on which he inscribes images, sayings, sometimes even warnings. “The dead laptop series,” he calls it. It is just a coincidence that he is exhibiting the dead laptops in New York this week. He had arranged the show — it begins on Saturday and runs through Nov. 22 at Tekserve, the Apple-only retailer on West 23rd Street — long before Mr. Jobs died. Mr. Dinges said he engraved the laptops in much the same way that 18th- and 19th-century sailors created their scrimshaw works out of sperm-whale teeth, except that he uses an electric engraver. “Home Depot is now my art supply store,” he told Hand/Eye magazine in 2009. The laptops are not his only medium — he has also engraved plastic chairs and a vinyl canoe. “I choose modern objects and use historical technique to reflect on the antecedents for a period of change,” he said. But he said the dead laptops have another historical throwback: He said they echo the samplers embroidered by colonial-era schoolgirls, who labored over the letters of the alphabet and an image, often flowers. “They’re about the same size as laptop computers,” he said, “and a laptop has a keyboard, so that’s a replication of the alphabet. And it’s a teaching tool, but what is it teaching us?” Like samplers, Mr. Dinges’s works carry sayings. “Beware the power of the spectacle,” one dead laptop warns. Another laptop shows a squirrel burying an acorn. Surrounding that image are these words: “Beware the tendency to become the things you covet. It is unsustainable and will only disappoint you in the end.” A plastic chair that Mr. Dinges engraved says, “Every process creates disorder.” He said the first dead laptop he created had the palm of a hand over the Apple logo. “That was definitely a reference to Eve’s apple and temptation,” he said. “There is something about the Internet that facilitates the better or worse angels of our nature.” So which was Mr. Jobs, a good angel or a bad one? “Oh, it’s up to us,” Mr. Dinges said. “What is it with human nature that allows us to be virtuous or go off the rails? That’s the thing we really have to question.”</text></article>

There are now a growing number of ways to bypass text-message charges using an Internet connection — much as Skype allows people to make calls without relying on a traditional telephone line. If these services catch on in a big way, analysts say, they could take a big bite out of the profits that text messages generate for wireless carriers. On Wednesday, Apple plans to introduce a new service called iMessage, which could quickly become the biggest fish in this pond. The service lets iPhone owners send messages with text, photos and video to other iPhone owners over a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection. The service, part of an update to Apple’s iOS mobile operating system, will automatically handle messages sent between iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users who have upgraded to the latest software. “There’s a huge amount at stake here,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who covers the telecommunications industry. “They are undermining the core business model for an industry that makes most of its money from services that are high priced and low bandwidth, like texting.” The basic idea is the same with both old- and new-style messages: short bursts that pop up almost instantly on the recipient’s phone. But the path that they take is different. A text message is sent over cellular networks. Services like iMessage transmit messages over the carriers’ data networks and the Internet, much like e-mail. Cellphone customers pay for each text message or sign up for a texting plan, while the newer messages will fall under a customer’s wireless data plan. More than two trillion text messages are sent each year in the United States, generating more than $20 billion in revenue for the wireless industry. Verizon Wireless alone generates as much as $7 billion a year in revenue from texting, or about 12 percent of the total, Mr. Moffett said, and texting brings in about a third of the operating income. This highly profitable product was something of a happy accident for cellphone carriers. Srinivasan Keshav, a professor at the University of Waterloo who studies mobile computing, said text messages were almost an afterthought when cellphone standards were being developed in the late 1980s. Professor Keshav said wireless operators realized there was enough spare capacity in a special control channel on voice networks to also shuttle short messages around. “They could piggyback on the phone railway,” he said, which let the carriers deliver messages cheaply. Professor Keshav estimates it costs the carriers about a third of a penny to send text messages. Considering that the major carriers charge 10 to 20 cents to send and receive them, “it’s something like a 4,090 percent markup,” he said. At 20 cents and 160 characters per message, wireless customers are paying roughly $1,500 to send a megabyte of text traffic over the cell network. By comparison, the cost to send that same amount of data using a $25-a-month, two-gigabyte data plan works out to 1.25 cents. Over time, analysts say, the new messaging services could cut into the amount of money that carriers can make from each of their customers. They point to examples where the slide has already begun, as in the Netherlands, where the popularity of social networks and messaging applications have shrunk texting traffic and eroded profits. Analysts say Apple is trying to duplicate the success of services like BlackBerry Messenger, or BBM, a free application for BlackBerry smartphone owners that lets them send messages back and forth as in an instant-messaging conversation. It has engendered loyalty among BlackBerry users and has kept some from switching to an Apple or Android device. “BBM is the stickiest feature of the BlackBerry experience, even more than e-mail,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics who follows the wireless industry. “Once you have that, you are considerably less likely to switch away from the consumer experience. IMessage makes the whole iOS universe more valuable.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Jobs. “We decided it was not the right time to announce a new product while the world was expressing tribute to Steve Jobs’s passing,” a Samsung spokesman said. Samsung had planned to introduce the product based on its so-called Ice Cream Sandwich system, which will unite the Android software used in tablets and smartphones, on Tuesday at its Mobile Unpack event in San Diego. Samsung has yet to decide on a new date for the release, the spokesman said. A legal battle between Apple, which Mr. Jobs helped found, and Samsung is set to reach its most crucial moment this week, with court hearings in the United States, the Netherlands, Australia, South Korea and Japan. Samsung and Apple are suing each other in 10 countries over 20 cases since April, but few of them hold as much significance as the California court ruling on Thursday, since it could affect Samsung’s mobile device sales in the United States, one of its biggest markets. Samsung said it would not delay scheduled hearing dates because of Mr. Jobs’s death. Apple says Samsung’s Galaxy line of mobile phones and tablets “slavishly” copied its iPhone and iPad. Samsung rejects the claims and argues that Apple infringed on its mobile patents. Last week, Apple rejected an offer from Samsung to settle a tablet dispute in Australia, possibly killing off the commercial viability of the new Galaxy tablet in that market.</text></article>

That was the undertone of disappointment that surrounded the introduction of Apple's new iPhone on Tuesday. But look beyond that to something really significant: Siri, the personal assistant application that Apple also showed off. Siri matters for two reasons. First, it represents the future of Apple as a business. Second, Siri potentially is the future of what is now called search. Apple, no doubt, will continue to design great hardware. But its profit margins from selling devices will most likely erode. It's an iron law of computing: hardware becomes commoditized, and the only question is how quickly. So Apple is broadening its reach by offering iPhones in a wider price range, including the 3GS free with a two-year contract, and adding more carriers, like Sprint. Thus the iPhone becomes a larger -- and yes, stylish -- delivery vehicle for software and services, like Siri. ''In the long term, the best strategy for Apple will be to get more and more of its revenue and profit from its software and services platform,'' said Michael Cusumano, a professor at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. Siri, put simply, listens to voice commands, searches the Web and online services, and delivers answers. Even today, it is an impressive technology, and one that was nurtured for years by America's tax dollars -- it originated as a program in the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Siri is an evolving artificial intelligence application for things like making restaurant reservations and answering simple questions. And it has been impressing technologists long before Apple bought it last year. My colleague John Markoff and I described Siri as one example of advances in artificial intelligence in an article we wrote last year, before Apple bought the company. If mobile computing is the future, as everyone says, then Siri or something like it is going to be crucial. Typing in commands and conventional search are limited on smartphones. When Microsoft talks about making Bing a ''decision engine,'' something like Siri is what it has in mind. And Google, of course, is aggressively pursuing the same goal; it is the larger Android vision. For Apple, Siri opens the door to getting into the search business in the future. And the way it makes money need not be in click-throughs on intrusive ads. That's the old business model. The new model may well be sharing transaction revenues on all kinds of online commerce, for example. We'll see how things play out, but Siri says a lot about where Apple is headed. .

Jobs was remembered as a visionary who helped bring on the digital world with the Apple II personal computer and then redefined that world with sleek gizmos like the iPod, the iPad and and the iPhone. This week, he will be remembered for something else: Providing a canvas for the artist Michael Dinges. Mr. Dinges’s medium is discarded Apple laptops — specifically, shiny white MacBooks on which he inscribes images, sayings, sometimes even warnings. “The dead laptop series,” he calls it. It is just a coincidence that he is exhibiting the dead laptops in New York this week. He had arranged the show — it begins on Saturday and runs through Nov. 22 at Tekserve, the Apple-only retailer on West 23rd Street — long before Mr. Jobs died. Mr. Dinges said he engraved the laptops in much the same way that 18th- and 19th-century sailors created their scrimshaw works out of sperm-whale teeth, except that he uses an electric engraver. “Home Depot is now my art supply store,” he told Hand/Eye magazine in 2009. The laptops are not his only medium — he has also engraved plastic chairs and a vinyl canoe. “I choose modern objects and use historical technique to reflect on the antecedents for a period of change,” he said. But he said the dead laptops have another historical throwback: He said they echo the samplers embroidered by colonial-era schoolgirls, who labored over the letters of the alphabet and an image, often flowers. “They’re about the same size as laptop computers,” he said, “and a laptop has a keyboard, so that’s a replication of the alphabet. And it’s a teaching tool, but what is it teaching us?” Like samplers, Mr. Dinges’s works carry sayings. “Beware the power of the spectacle,” one dead laptop warns. Another laptop shows a squirrel burying an acorn. Surrounding that image are these words: “Beware the tendency to become the things you covet. It is unsustainable and will only disappoint you in the end.” A plastic chair that Mr. Dinges engraved says, “Every process creates disorder.” He said the first dead laptop he created had the palm of a hand over the Apple logo. “That was definitely a reference to Eve’s apple and temptation,” he said. “There is something about the Internet that facilitates the better or worse angels of our nature.” So which was Mr. Jobs, a good angel or a bad one? “Oh, it’s up to us,” Mr. Dinges said. “What is it with human nature that allows us to be virtuous or go off the rails? That’s the thing we really have to question.”</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/at-long-last-facebook-releases-an-ipad-app/?ref=applecomputerinc">At Long Last, Facebook Releases an iPad App<date>October 10, 2011, 4:00 pm</date><text>Facebook The Facebook iPad application takes advantage of the iPad’s multitouch technology. It has been the equivalent of waiting for Bigfoot. Bloggers had seen it. Developers said they had worked on it. Facebook denied its existence. Everyone else just wanted to know if it was real. It’s the Facebook application for the iPad, which is finally out in the wild for everyone to prod, pinch and interact with. After months of speculation and false alarms, Facebook said Monday that its official iPad application was available as a free download from the Apple App Store. The app will likely benefit Apple and Facebook. Although the iPad is the biggest-selling tablet on the market, some consumers are not convinced they need it and opt for less expensive tablets. Seeing a slick Facebook app could convince people to choose an iPad over competitors, as there is no Facebook app specifically tailored for tablets running Google’s Android software. For Facebook, a complete iPad application will keep people even more immersed in its service and add to the amount of time people spend on it. According to Nielsen Research, Americans spend eight hours a month, or 16 percent of their total time online, using Facebook’s Web site and mobile applications. Leon Dubinsky, a software engineer at Facebook, wrote in a blog post on the company’s Web site that the app had been designed to create an immersive and “fun” experience on the tablet. Mr. Dubinsky highlighted the use of multitouch gestures within the app, a feature that is not available on the Facebook Web site. “Use your fingertips to scroll through your News Feed. Give the screen a swipe to page through albums. Pinch a picture to zoom in,” he wrote. Facebook highlighted other key features in the announcement: Photos and videos are given prominence in the app and can be viewed full-screen. Users can also capture photos and videos with the iPad and put them directly into the Facebook news feed. Gaming and Facebook Chat are also major components of the app. Photos are a prominent feature in the Facebook iPad application. So what took so long? Apple and Facebook have been in talks for months trying to resolve issues that came up last year when the companies disagreed about Facebook’s integration with Ping, Apple’s music-focused social network. Since then they have been caught in a stalemate over disagreements on coming projects. Bret Taylor, Facebook’s chief technology officer, said in a phone interview that the app was delayed because it “just wasn’t ready yet.” “We felt that the Facebook Web site on the iPad was a really good experience,” Mr. Taylor said, noting that the company wanted to make sure it was taking advantage of the possibilities of an iPad app before announcing a new product. “We really feel that we have built an app that takes full advantage of touch, photos and chat.” Features from the Facebook iPad application have also been integrated into the company’s iPhone application, Mr. Taylor said.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/post-games/?ref=applecomputerinc">Post Games<date>October 10, 2011, 6:30 pm</date><text>De mortuis nihil nisi bonum. Don’t rip the dead. It seems to be the generous sentiment behind most of the coverage following the deaths of two Bay Area titans in the last week, Steve Jobs and Al Davis. And who can argue with that? Jobs was Apple; Davis was the Oakland Raiders; each transformed his industry. Who doesn’t love an iPad (or appreciate Apple’s market capitalization)? Who doesn’t thrill to the high-arcing ‘‘vertical’’ bomb that results in a 60-yard touchdown? Still, both were famously difficult characters — even, you get the sense, Ahab-ian in pursuit of their visionary whales. So it’s to be expected that, among all the celebratory taking-stock-of, a few corrective portraits would also emerge, like this from Gawker (Jobs) or this from Slate (Davis). These are welcome, too, especially when they hint at the ways in which personality traits that are commonly regarded as character flaws can be spurs to greatness. In the Super Bowl of American life, ‘‘There’s an app for that’’ routs ‘‘Just win, baby!’’ But where Davis probably comes out ahead of Jobs is as a character, as fodder. (See, for example, Peter Richmond and Chuck Klosterman in Grantland recently, or Bryan Curtis in Play a few years ago.) For all the secrecy and paranoia and dictatorial control Jobs and Davis shared, some writers actually managed to return with tales to tell from Raiders-land. By this time I’d realized that this strange-looking bugger named ‘‘Al,’’ who looked like a pimp or a track-tout, was in fact the infamous Al Davis — general manager and de facto owner (pending settlement of a nasty lawsuit scheduled for court-action early this year) of the whole Oakland Raider operation. Davis glanced over his shoulder at me, then spoke back to Smith: ‘‘Get the bastard out of here. I don’t trust him.’’ That’s Hunter S. Thompson in Rolling Stone in 1973 (‘‘Fear and Loathing at the Super Bowl’’), excerpted in Deadspin. If only Thompson or his like had been able to wander the sidelines at the Apple campus.</text></article>

Apple's iPhone 4S Breaks Sales Records<date>October 10, 2011, 2:36 pm</date><text>Nick Bilton/The New York Times It has the repetition of a Hollywood movie script: Apple releases a new product. Some in the media and analysts quickly bemoan the new product, saying it didn’t live up to the hype they created. Then the new product breaks all previous sales records. Guess what? Apple announced Monday that orders for the iPhone 4S already broke records for previous iPhone sales. The company said it processed more than one million orders for the iPhone 4S in the first 24 hours it was on sale. Surprise, surprise. In a news release issued by Apple, the company said the iPhone 4S surpassed sales of the iPhone 4, of which 600,000 were sold in the first 24 hours. Just a week ago, complaints ricocheted around the Web, saying the iPhone 4S was a misstep by Apple and a letdown to consumers. Reuters called the release of the iPhone 4S a “stumble” that “failed to wow fans.” After seeing the new iPhone 4S announcement, C.K. Lu, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, told Reuters: ”Apple no longer has a leading edge; its cloud service is even behind Android; it can only sell on brand loyalty now.” Apple’s stock took a hit as a result of the negativity surrounding the iPhone 4S, with the company’s stock falling 5 percent immediately after the announcement. The stock rebounded later that day, but investors couldn’t decide if the company had a hit or a flop on its hands. On Monday, investors drastically changed their tune after the company announced its sales figures. By midday Apple’s stock was $383.84, up $14.04, or 3.8 percent. Competitors jumped on board, too, to try to criticize the iPhone 4S. Right after Apple’s announcement, Samsung quickly piled on, saying that the iPhone 4S was less of a phone than its Galaxy S II. Analysts seemed flummoxed by Apple’s decisions to call the phone a 4S instead of a 5 and to keep the exterior design the same. Although the iPhone 4S doesn’t look different from its predecessor on the outside, the guts of the phone and its software have been upgraded.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/10/tim-cook-is-thinking-different/?ref=applecomputerinc">Tim Cook Is Thinking Different<date>October 10, 2011, 6:53 pm</date><text>For people who are curious about how Apple’s new chief executive, Tim Cook, will compare to the company’s previous C.E.O., Steve Jobs, there’s not a lot to go on yet. AppleTim Cook, chief executive of Apple. Mr. Cook took the helm of Apple from Mr. Jobs only in late August. Even then, Mr. Jobs was still chairman of Apple until his death last week at the age of 56. There was, however, one tantalizing clue about how the two men differ at an Apple event to introduce the new iPhone last Tuesday, the day before Mr. Jobs’s death was announced: Mr. Cook didn’t demonstrate any new Apple products. Instead, he left all of the demonstrations of new technologies like the iPhone 4S to his lieutenants. This may seem like a picayune detail, but it could underscore one of the biggest differences between the two men. Technology, product design and marketing were among Mr. Jobs’s abiding passions. The level of attention he paid to all three areas was unusual for the chief executive of such a large company. While Mr. Jobs sometimes delegated new product demonstrations when he was chief executive, he invariably showed off the most important products for the first time, like the iPad, iPhone and iTunes. Mr. Cook, in comparison, is a sales and operations guru who whipped Apple’s supply chain into an efficient machine over the past 14 years. At the event, Mr. Cook said he loved Apple and considered his career at the company the “privilege of a lifetime.” He let a trio of Apple senior vice presidents with stronger product credentials — Eddy Cue, Scott Forstall and Philip Schiller — show off Apple’s new toys. Van Baker, an analyst at the research firm Gartner, was at the Apple event and said he thought Mr. Cook was wise to avoid trying to seem Steve-like. “I think one of the things Tim did was to, in essence, put a stake in the ground and say I’m not Steve, don’t expect me to be Steve,” he said. In the end, it may not matter much if Mr. Cook can effectively delegate the responsibilities Mr. Jobs previously held as de facto editor in chief and chief pitchman for Apple products. The change in style certainly hasn’t hurt Apple’s products yet, despite the grumbling from some quarters about Apple’s decision to leave the new iPhone largely unchanged on the outside from its predecessor. Apple sold one million iPhone 4Ss in the first 24 hours after it became available for online ordering, compared with 600,000 in the same period for the iPhone 4. On Sunday though, the venture capitalist and former Apple executive Guy Kawasaki posted a list of lessons he learned from Mr. Jobs, including one he titled: “Real CEOs demo.” Mr. Kawasaki asked why, in contrast to Mr. Jobs’s hands-on approach, do many chief executives call on their underlings to do product demonstrations. “Maybe it’s to show that there’s a team effort in play,” Mr. Kawasaki wrote. “Maybe. It’s more likely that the CEO doesn’t understand what his/her company is making well enough to explain it. How pathetic is that?”</text></article>

Until now, navigating Facebook.com on an iPad felt like trying to write an e-mail on a calculator. Facebook’s Web site was not built for a touch-screen device and clicking buttons or navigating photos was difficult, if not almost impossible. That all changed Monday when Facebook finally announced its new iPad app, specifically designed for the popular tablet. The app has large buttons for those navigating with bulky fingers, but its also makes use of the the iPad’s special features to do things that are not possible through a Web interface. For example, people can now take photos or high-definition video from within the app. The images can then be tagged and automatically posted to the news feed. The app allows users to take pictures with the iPad, which then appear in the news feed. Facebook has optimized photo viewing for the iPad too. Photo albums are designed to look like the iPad’s  Photo app. Images are organized into neat folders of stacked photos. Once inside a photo album people can swipe through multiple images with their finger and pinch and zoom pictures to make them larger or smaller. Images can be viewed at full scale too, taking up the entire screen. Facebook has also integrated Airplay into the app which allows people to share images and video to a large-screen television that is connected to an Apple TV. Photos are organized into albums and are designed to look like the Photo app for the iPad. Images can be viewed at full screen. Facebook has  integrated gaming into the app. For example, if a user is playing a game of Words with Friends while inside the app, Facebook will notify them through a games section of the navigation bar. When the user clicks on the game icon, Facebook automatically sends them off to the built-in Words with Friends app. If they do not have app downloaded already, Facebook will send them to the correct link in the iTunes App Store, or an equivalent HTML5 Web page to play the game. Facebook offers a map view of your friends location. Facebook is also making use of location services in its app in a new section called Nearby. Nearby shows a map with little icons of your friends in the area. You can pinch and zoom into the map. Clicking a person’s photo will allow you to leave a comment tied to the location. Facebook’s also gives  people the ability to check-in to their location from within the app from the top right corner of the screen. The Facebook Web site is difficult to navigate on an iPad. Over all, the Facebook app is a drastic improvement over navigating the Web site on an iPad.  Now the only problem with be figuring out how to get away from the Facebook app to make time for more Angry Birds.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/opinion/sunday/douthat-up-from-ugliness.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Up From Ugliness<date>Published: October 8, 2011</date><text>FROM the 1960s through the 1980s, the United States of America conducted a long experiment in ugliness. Our architects grew bored with beauty, our designers tired of elegance, our urban planners decided that function should trump form. We bulldozed row houses and threw up housing projects. We built public buildings out of raw concrete. We wore leisure suits and shoulder pads, buried heart-of-pine floors under shag carpeting, and paneled our automobiles with artificial wood.This is the world in which Steve Jobs came of age. It was, not coincidentally, a world in which it became easy to believe that the United States was in decline. Our churches looked like recreation centers, and our rec centers looked like re-education camps. Our campuses and civic spaces were defaced by ziggurats of cement. Our cities had crime-ridden towers and white elephant shopping centers where the neighborhoods used to be. Our suburbs were filled with what James Howard Kunstler described as the “junk architecture” of strip malls and ranch houses. Then, gradually and haltingly, beauty began to make a comeback. A “new urbanist” movement championed a return to walkable neighborhoods, human-scale housing, and pleasant public spaces. Our clothes became less garish, our cars more curvaceous, our civic architecture less offensive. And most remarkably, our machines ceased to be utilitarian boxes, and became something beautiful instead. When we think about what Jobs meant to turn-of-the-millennium America, this is the place to start: not just with the technical wizardry behind Macs and iPhones and iPads, but with the Apple founder’s eye for grace and style, and his recognition of the deep connection between beauty and civilization. There would have been some sort of desktop computer without the Macintosh, some sort of popular smartphone without the iPhone, some kind of big-screen computer animation without Pixar. But there was no guarantee that any of these technological wonders would be so exquisite, or that the age of information would also be an age of artistry. Jobs wasn’t an artist himself. But he was a curator, a critic and a patron. Whether he was deciding that the first Macintosh computer would feature beautiful typography or telling Pixar’s animators to “make it great,” he played a decisive role in restoring a kind of defiant aestheticism to American life. Like the glories of Art Deco and the allure of the “Mad Men” era, his products were a rebuke to the idea that the aesthetics of modern life needed to be utilitarian and blah. From the Apple store to “The Incredibles,” Jobs revived the romance of modernity — the assumption, shared by Victorian science-fiction writers and space-age dreamers alike, that the world of the future should be more glamorous than the present. The question is whether this revival has staying power. The age of architectural Brutalism is past, but between the travails of planning-by-committee and the red tape of bureaucracy, our civic projects still tend to be uninspired in design and interminable in execution. (The newest additions to the Washington Mall, the World War II and Martin Luther King Jr. memorials, look like rejected rough drafts for monuments rather than inspiring finished products.) For all its successes, the new urbanism sometimes feels more like a reclamation project than a renaissance: it’s saved the row houses of yesterday without building the neighborhoods of tomorrow. So too with technology, where some of the eulogies for Jobs have highlighted the gulf between the computer revolution’s rapid progress and the lack of advancement in fields like medicine and transportation. The iPhone and the iPad may be aesthetically perfect, but in an otherwise stagnant society their charms can be an invitation to solipsism — holding up mirrors to our vanity, instead of opening windows to breakthroughs more impressive than the latest app. You can see a version of this peril in our politics as well. In a sense, Barack Obama’s 2008 march to the White House was the iPhone of political campaigns: a perfect marriage of aesthetics, spectacle and social media, a revival of the old New Frontier excitement, the natural culmination of glamour’s post-1970s comeback in American life. But three years later much of that looks like an illusion — a temporary echo of liberalism’s golden age, evoking successes that today’s Democratic Party can’t recapture. Right now, Steve Jobs’s legacy seems more secure than President Obama’s. (Certainly his fan base is less fickle.) But there’s still a danger that we’ll look back on Apple’s golden age and see it as a fleeting creative spike in a larger story of cultural decline. Whether that happens is up to tomorrow’s innovators. If they learn anything from Jobs, it should be that their vocation isn’t just about uniting commerce and technology. It’s about making the modern world more beautiful as well.</text></article>

IN 1980, Steve Jobs went to a brown-bag lunch at Stanford business school, looking for summer help. Other Apple executives were busy explaining what a personal computer was when he sauntered in; they stopped mid-sentence as, dressed in a vest, jeans and Birkenstock sandals, he settled himself, cross-legged, on top of a desk. He looked as if he were about to hold a yoga class. Then he began to talk, instead, about revolutionizing the world. Some four or five students heeded his call, including my husband-to-be, David O'Connor. This was less than half the number who signed up to work for Hewlett-Packard, but never mind. That summer job became a full-time job when David graduated, and a kind of dream. Apple, back then, had a hot-air balloon. It had a race car. When the second ''Star Wars'' movie opened, Apple bought out a theater so the whole company could go. A friend's father called a job at Apple the worst possible thing that could happen to a young person, as everything that followed was bound to be a disappointment. And perhaps that was true. But, of course, it was exciting in a way even an onlooking writer could understand -- strangely familiar, too, as if it were being run by a cousin. Apple was, for example, antiestablishment, as all writers are. It was anti-DEC and anti-I.B.M, a harborer of an anti-acronym acrimony that writers, naturally, shared. What's more, Steve Jobs's perfectionism made perfect sense to people like me: Of course, he sweated every detail; of course he drove others mad. He was a J. D. Salinger who, weirdly, knew computing. Was this why the Apple computer felt like a thing worth trying to write on? Though I would never have thought to use a word processor -- those were for offices -- I was open to the Apple II, and first worked on one at David's apartment in the fall of 1980. The screen was black and the type green, and there were only 40 characters per line. But you could insert things; you did not have to retype an entire page if you had a new line of dialogue. And, equally exciting: you could delete things. More important, you worked with that little blinking cursor before you. No one in the world particularly cared if you wrote and, of course, you knew the computer didn't care, either. But it was waiting for you to type something. It was not inert and passive, like the page. It was listening. It was your ally. It was your audience. And with it -- on it -- whatever -- you could try things. You were not wasting paper; you were not making a racket. You were not even writing, exactly, as no one you knew wrote this way. Everything you'd read as an English major was far, far away; words like ''the literary tradition'' belonged to another galaxy. It was just you and this little blinking light, which somehow made you feel like it was always the middle of the night. But for the on-off switch, you would never have called the computer a machine. Later, at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, I used a typewriter. But whenever I visited David in California, I wrote on his computer. I did not hide the fact that I did this, but I did not advertise it, either: ''real writers,'' many believed, used paper and pencil. O.K., so fiction writers, hacks that we were, used typewriters. But computers were suspect. Some writers I knew used the university mainframe to prepare manuscripts, but they typically doctored their pages before sending them out to magazines. They whited things out here and there, and made corrections by pen. They turned a page upside down, or rumpled the pages a little. In short, they tried to make their stories look as though they'd been, not printed, but typed. And so did I, sometimes, though I knew that the prejudices were all wrong. Maybe there was something dronelike about working on a mainframe; maybe sitting at stations and terminals really was at odds with the play at the heart of creative work. The Apple II, though, was born both in play and to encourage play; and this was even more true of the Lisa and Macintosh computers that followed. My first Lisa was a prototype, whose graphic interface I still glow to recall, and not just because David had worked on it. Truly, it was the sheer friendliness of the interface that I loved. And the mouse! No longer did you need to think about what you were doing; you just did it. What came out of this computer was not further from the human heart; it was closer. It was looser, freer, more spontaneous -- more democratic, too. Writers in the past had often depended on an amanuensis to get their work out; behind the Mr. Tolstoys there was often a Mrs. Tolstoy. But now Mrs. Tolstoy could also write, if she liked. She could get her thoughts down and send them out with an ease she could never have dreamed of before. As for whether the Apple computers changed not only who wrote, but what they wrote, I can't speak for others. I can only say that these computers coaxed out of me an expansiveness the typewriter never did. For every writer, the leap from short story to novel is, well, a leap. It involves faith, and resources, and a conception, finally, of how much room is yours in the world. I was not a person who would have looked at a ream of paper and thought, ''Sure, that is mine to fill up.'' But I turned out to be a person who could keep moving a cursor until I'd filled one ream, then another. It is a truly minuscule reason, in the scheme of things, for which to celebrate and mourn Steve Jobs. Still, I add my small reason to the infinity of others.

    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/business/an-analogy-of-thomas-edison-and-steve-jobs.html?ref=applecomputerinc">An Analogy of Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs<date>Published: October 8, 2011</date><text>IN August 1931, Thomas Alva Edison, age 84, became gravely ill with kidney problems. He recovered a little, then suffered a setback and was confined to bed at home, drifting in and out of consciousness. Newspapers issued multiple bulletins each day, reporting on signs of improvement or decline. The end came in the early morning of Oct. 18, 1931, with his family at his bedside.That day, The New York Times ran nearly two-dozen articles on Edison’s life and death. Newspapers worldwide were filled with eulogies and remembrances for many days afterward. Words alone were not enough to express the nation’s grief. Heeding President Herbert Hoover’s request, many Americans briefly turned off their electric lights at 10 o’clock Eastern time on the night of Edison’s funeral. The broad outpouring that has followed the death of Steve Jobs reminds me of the display of grief following Edison’s death. In both cases, their passing evoked an extraordinary public response, tributes that were greater and broader than those paid to many a head of state. Why is that? Both men have fully occupied my attention at different times. I wrote a book about Mr. Jobs in 1993. I looked at his struggling endeavor to start another computer company, NeXT, after he left Apple amid a power struggle in 1985. His return to Apple in 1997 and the triumphs that would follow were not within sight. I took my snapshot of him and the company when he was at the miserable nadir of his professional life. Years later, I wrote a biography of Edison, a person whom Mr. Jobs admired. When you compare the two personalities and their careers, a few similarities emerge immediately. Both had less formal schooling than most of their respective peers. Both possessed the ability to visualize projects on a grand scale. Both followed an inner voice when making decisions. And both had terrific tempers that could make their employees quake. Both men worked in several product areas, but entertainment-related technology was a major portion of their product portfolios. This prompts a question: Would the public’s relationship to Edison have been essentially the same without the phonograph and without movies? Or with Mr. Jobs, if Apple had remained just Apple Computer? After enjoying early success, each of them pursued a quixotic project that would occupy them for roughly 10 years — Mr. Jobs’s disappointing but enlightening NeXT odyssey and Edison’s failed attempt to build an iron ore processing business in northwestern New Jersey. Edison’s misadventures in mining produced no visible change in the man. He had set out to “do something now so different and so much bigger than anything I’ve ever done before people will forget that my name ever was connected with anything electrical.” The milling machinery he designed, redesigned and redesigned again never worked as he expected. But he shrugged. Nothing could rattle his sense of omniscience in all technical fields. Mr. Jobs, however, clearly learned from his experiences at NeXT about what not to do, such as driving away after short stints the talented people he had recruited. When he returned to Apple, he built an executive team that remained stable. THE later careers of the two were more different than similar. Mr. Jobs was able to realize his product visions — again and again. Edison’s career was characterized by a pattern of introducing what today we would call a beta version of a product and then losing interest in it. Competitors would then swoop in and fully commercialize the idea — and profit the most from it. Mr. Jobs was the far shrewder businessman, even if he never talked about wealth as a matter of personal interest. When Edison died, he left behind an estate valued at about $12 million, or about $180 million in today’s dollars. His friend Henry Ford had once joked that Edison was “the world’s greatest inventor and the world’s worst businessman.” Mr. Jobs was worth a commanding $6.5 billion. Mr. Jobs was perhaps the most beloved billionaire the world has ever known. Richard Branson’s tribute captures the way people felt they could identify with Mr. Jobs’s life narrative: “So many people drew courage from Steve and related to his life story: adoptees, college dropouts, struggling entrepreneurs, ousted business leaders figuring out how to make a difference in the world, and people fighting debilitating illness. We have all been there in some way and can see a bit of ourselves in his personal and professional successes and struggles.” By contrast, Edison became a victim of his own manufactured life narrative and the world’s adulation. Earlier, when Edison introduced the spring-driven phonograph in 1878, a reporter coined a nickname for him: “The Wizard of Menlo Park.” He liked — too much — playing the Wizard. He was ever ready to pontificate on any subject under the sun. Educational reform. National defense spending. The fatal effects of clothing that “pinches” the body. The relationship of diet to national destiny (“The rice-eating nations never progress...”). Much of it was ephemera or idiocy, best forgotten. Steve Jobs did not waste his time or ours with similar flotsam. A rare time that he publicly stepped out of the role of chief executive and shared personal thoughts was when he delivered the commencement address at Stanford in June 2005. It was a moving meditation on his life and his — and our — mortality. It was a talk for the ages. Early in Mr. Jobs’s career, journalists were wary of stepping within range of his “reality distortion field,” his perceived ability as a showman to make products seem better than they actually were. But it was Mr. Jobs’s personal reality in his later years, making the most of a life that both he and we knew would be cruelly cut short, that proved most influential in the end. The public tributes to Edison in 1931 and those to Mr. Jobs 80 years later were similar, but only superficially. With Edison, the public thought of the Wizard, an outsize persona, through which it was impossible to see an actual person. But with Mr. Jobs, the tributes were to a fellow mortal, exactly our own height, just as vulnerable as we all are to the random strike of a life-ending catastrophe.

Mr. Jobs did not make the technology himself; he led the teams that did, prodding, cajoling and inspiring. His track record as a business team leader is unique — as Apple’s Macintosh, iPod, iPhone and iPad testify. In two stints at Apple, he made computers into coveted consumer goods and transformed not only product categories, like music players and cellphones, but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications. Mr. Jobs even failed well. NeXT, a computer company he founded during his years in exile from Apple, was never a commercial success. But it was a technology pioneer. The World Wide Web was created on a NeXT computer, and NeXT software is the core of Apple’s operating systems today. Part of Mr. Jobs’s legacy will be the lessons learned by those who worked closely with him over the years. Here are just a few: DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DELIGHT CUSTOMERS Six weeks before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs ordered a crucial design change. Until then, the planning for supplies, manufacturing and engineering had been based on the assumption that the smartphone’s face would be plastic, recalls Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who led iPod and iPhone development from 2001 to 2009. Plastic is less fragile than glass, and easier to make. But the plastic touch screen had a drawback. It was prone to developing scratches. Those scratches, Mr. Jobs insisted, would irritate users and be seen as a design flaw. “All the logical facts told us to go with plastic, and Steve’s instinct went the other way,” Mr. Fadell says. “It was Steve’s call — his gut.” The glass choice was a challenge that seemed “nearly impossible” at the time, he says — a last-minute scramble to get supplies of specialized glass and tweak the design of the phone’s casing to reduce the chances the glass would crack when an iPhone was dropped. But with extra investment and a frenetic work regimen, the switch proved doable, despite the tight deadline. The episode, Mr. Fadell says, points to a principle he took away from his years working with Mr. Jobs. “You do not cut corners and you make sure the customer gets an experience that is an absolute delight,” observes Mr. Fadell, who heads a Silicon Valley start-up company whose product has not yet been disclosed and will not compete with Apple. GOOD IDEAS TAKE TIME After he was ousted from Apple, Mr. Jobs founded NeXT in 1985. It produced a powerful desktop computer, a stylish black cube, and its initial market was going to be in education. The idea was that the machine would be more than hardware and software; it would also offer content, “a universe of wisdom,” recalls Michael Hawley, a computer scientist who worked closely with Mr. Jobs at NeXT and lived part time in Mr. Jobs’s house, as Mr. Hawley shuttled between California and his post at the M.I.T. Media Lab. NeXT computers, in Mr. Jobs’s vision, would marry technology and the liberal arts by including digital books, music and art. Mr. Jobs began pursuing the rights to works that could be converted to digital form. He persuaded a few publishers that because they would save the expense of paper, printing and distribution, NeXT should pay a royalty that was a fraction of the cost of a printed book. Mr. Jobs, Mr. Hawley recalled, struck a deal with the Oxford University Press for the complete works of Shakespeare for a royalty of $1 a digital copy. NeXT’s foray into education fizzled; its machines were too expensive for that market. But Mr. Jobs’s concept and business model for digital media were “the instinct that was translated to Apple with the iTunes store, 99-cents-a-song pricing and all the media offerings that have followed,” Mr. Hawley says. “When Steve believed in an idea, he was both passionate and patient, scratching away over the years until he got it right,” says Mr. Hawley, a scientist, concert pianist and host of the EG Conference, an annual gathering for technologists, educators and people in media and entertainment. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Dell was promoting its build-on-demand model, Gateway computer shipped its products in boxes with Holstein cow markings, and I.B.M. had introduced the ThinkPad with its Little Tramp marketing campaign. Apple’s Macintosh was introduced during the 1984 Super Bowl but was considered a marginal outlier with its quirky proprietary operating system.About this time I had lunch with Bill Gates, who dismissed PCs as nothing but components held together by plastic and screws manufactured on low-cost assembly lines, a commodity business with narrow profit margins. The future belonged to software and semiconductor makers like Microsoft and Intel, where the real innovation was going on. This made sense to me, and as the years unfolded, Mr. Gates seemed prescient. The PC makers were mostly reduced to commodity producers; I.B.M. sold off the ThinkPad, Hewlett-Packard bought Compaq and may now abandon the business; Gateway was sold off and the brand has all but vanished. Apple nearly went under. But today, the exception is so glaring as to have stood Mr. Gates’s prediction on its head: Apple’s operating profit margins have grown (to over 33 percent), and Apple’s market capitalization of $347.3 billion this week is bigger than that of Microsoft and Intel combined. Of all Steve Jobs’s accomplishments, this, to me, remains both the simplest and the most astonishing. How did he take a commodity — to borrow from the novelist Tom Wolfe, the “veal gray” plastic boxes that once weighed so heavily on both our desks and spirits — and turn it into one of the most iconic and desirable objects on the planet? “Steve Jobs and Apple never — ever — wanted to be a low-margin commodity producer,” Donald Norman, a former vice president for advanced technology at Apple and author of “Living With Complexity,” told me this week. “Even the Apple II had some charm to it. It was the first personal computer that had professional industrial designers. Before that they were designed strictly by engineers, and they were ugly. Steve was always, if not an artist, then someone who was charmed by style. He had this dream of something beautiful. If it was going to cost more, it didn’t matter. This was in his genes.” Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, recalled buying a 1990 Macintosh Classic and taking it back to Italy. “When I got home, I took it out of that brown, padded carrying case with the rainbow-colored Apple logo on it and put it on my desk in Milan. It was like a little pug dog looking at me. It wasn’t just something I worked with; it kept me company. It had such personality and such life.” My own conversion came much later. When I came across the MacBook Air, I thought it the single most elegant technology product I’d ever encountered, and not just because it looked good. Its light weight and paper-thin design made it easy to carry while offering all the functions and keyboard of a full-size PC. Even the packaging was so beautiful that I couldn’t bring myself to discard it. Now I refer to it as my third arm and can’t imagine life without it. Mr. Jobs “had an exceptional eye for design, and not just an eye, but an intelligence for design,” Ms. Antonelli said. “We don’t talk just about the looks, but how objects communicate: The specific shape, how it feels in the hand, under the fingers, how you read it in the eye and the mind. This is what Steve cared passionately about.” MoMA has 25 Apple products in its permanent design collection. And like many great artists, Mr. Jobs’s near-dictatorial control of Apple made possible the pursuit of perfection. “If you’re a visionary, and a dictator, you can take risks and be consistent,” Ms. Antonelli said. “NeXT was a risk and a beautiful failure. It brought him back to Apple. The dynamics of Apple and Steve’s personality and the course of history made for this perfect alignment of the stars.” Also like many artists (Frank Lloyd Wright comes to mind), Mr. Jobs was legendarily difficult at times. “He has always been focused, driven, demanding and, as a result, very difficult and abrasive,” Mr. Norman said. “This abrasiveness in the early days was too extreme and was destructive of the company. John Sculley had to fire him. When Steve came back, he had matured. He still had a demanding vision of perfection, but he brought focus. He was slightly less abrasive. He was brilliant at understanding what a product should be and he was a dictator.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

The iPhone and the iPad may be aesthetically perfect, but in an otherwise stagnant society their charms can be an invitation to solipsism — holding up mirrors to our vanity, instead of opening windows to breakthroughs more impressive than the latest app. You can see a version of this peril in our politics as well. In a sense, Barack Obama’s 2008 march to the White House was the iPhone of political campaigns: a perfect marriage of aesthetics, spectacle and social media, a revival of the old New Frontier excitement, the natural culmination of glamour’s post-1970s comeback in American life. But three years later much of that looks like an illusion — a temporary echo of liberalism’s golden age, evoking successes that today’s Democratic Party can’t recapture. Right now, Steve Jobs’s legacy seems more secure than President Obama’s. (Certainly his fan base is less fickle.) But there’s still a danger that we’ll look back on Apple’s golden age and see it as a fleeting creative spike in a larger story of cultural decline. Whether that happens is up to tomorrow’s innovators. If they learn anything from Jobs, it should be that their vocation isn’t just about uniting commerce and technology. It’s about making the modern world more beautiful as well.</text></article>

IN 1980, Steve Jobs went to a brown-bag lunch at Stanford business school, looking for summer help. Other Apple executives were busy explaining what a personal computer was when he sauntered in; they stopped mid-sentence as, dressed in a vest, jeans and Birkenstock sandals, he settled himself, cross-legged, on top of a desk. He looked as if he were about to hold a yoga class. Then he began to talk, instead, about revolutionizing the world. Some four or five students heeded his call, including my husband-to-be, David O'Connor. This was less than half the number who signed up to work for Hewlett-Packard, but never mind. That summer job became a full-time job when David graduated, and a kind of dream. Apple, back then, had a hot-air balloon. It had a race car. When the second ''Star Wars'' movie opened, Apple bought out a theater so the whole company could go. A friend's father called a job at Apple the worst possible thing that could happen to a young person, as everything that followed was bound to be a disappointment. And perhaps that was true. But, of course, it was exciting in a way even an onlooking writer could understand -- strangely familiar, too, as if it were being run by a cousin. Apple was, for example, antiestablishment, as all writers are. It was anti-DEC and anti-I.B.M, a harborer of an anti-acronym acrimony that writers, naturally, shared. What's more, Steve Jobs's perfectionism made perfect sense to people like me: Of course, he sweated every detail; of course he drove others mad. He was a J. D. Salinger who, weirdly, knew computing. Was this why the Apple computer felt like a thing worth trying to write on? Though I would never have thought to use a word processor -- those were for offices -- I was open to the Apple II, and first worked on one at David's apartment in the fall of 1980. The screen was black and the type green, and there were only 40 characters per line. But you could insert things; you did not have to retype an entire page if you had a new line of dialogue. And, equally exciting: you could delete things. More important, you worked with that little blinking cursor before you. No one in the world particularly cared if you wrote and, of course, you knew the computer didn't care, either. But it was waiting for you to type something. It was not inert and passive, like the page. It was listening. It was your ally. It was your audience. And with it -- on it -- whatever -- you could try things. You were not wasting paper; you were not making a racket. You were not even writing, exactly, as no one you knew wrote this way. Everything you'd read as an English major was far, far away; words like ''the literary tradition'' belonged to another galaxy. It was just you and this little blinking light, which somehow made you feel like it was always the middle of the night. But for the on-off switch, you would never have called the computer a machine. Later, at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, I used a typewriter. But whenever I visited David in California, I wrote on his computer. I did not hide the fact that I did this, but I did not advertise it, either: ''real writers,'' many believed, used paper and pencil. O.K., so fiction writers, hacks that we were, used typewriters. But computers were suspect. Some writers I knew used the university mainframe to prepare manuscripts, but they typically doctored their pages before sending them out to magazines. They whited things out here and there, and made corrections by pen. They turned a page upside down, or rumpled the pages a little. In short, they tried to make their stories look as though they'd been, not printed, but typed. And so did I, sometimes, though I knew that the prejudices were all wrong. Maybe there was something dronelike about working on a mainframe; maybe sitting at stations and terminals really was at odds with the play at the heart of creative work. The Apple II, though, was born both in play and to encourage play; and this was even more true of the Lisa and Macintosh computers that followed. My first Lisa was a prototype, whose graphic interface I still glow to recall, and not just because David had worked on it. Truly, it was the sheer friendliness of the interface that I loved. And the mouse! No longer did you need to think about what you were doing; you just did it. What came out of this computer was not further from the human heart; it was closer. It was looser, freer, more spontaneous -- more democratic, too. Writers in the past had often depended on an amanuensis to get their work out; behind the Mr. Tolstoys there was often a Mrs. Tolstoy. But now Mrs. Tolstoy could also write, if she liked. She could get her thoughts down and send them out with an ease she could never have dreamed of before. As for whether the Apple computers changed not only who wrote, but what they wrote, I can't speak for others. I can only say that these computers coaxed out of me an expansiveness the typewriter never did. For every writer, the leap from short story to novel is, well, a leap. It involves faith, and resources, and a conception, finally, of how much room is yours in the world. I was not a person who would have looked at a ream of paper and thought, ''Sure, that is mine to fill up.'' But I turned out to be a person who could keep moving a cursor until I'd filled one ream, then another. It is a truly minuscule reason, in the scheme of things, for which to celebrate and mourn Steve Jobs. Still, I add my small reason to the infinity of others.

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/business/an-analogy-of-thomas-edison-and-steve-jobs.html?ref=applecomputerinc">An Analogy of Thomas Edison and Steve Jobs<date>Published: October 8, 2011</date><text>IN August 1931, Thomas Alva Edison, age 84, became gravely ill with kidney problems. He recovered a little, then suffered a setback and was confined to bed at home, drifting in and out of consciousness. Newspapers issued multiple bulletins each day, reporting on signs of improvement or decline. The end came in the early morning of Oct. 18, 1931, with his family at his bedside.That day, The New York Times ran nearly two-dozen articles on Edison’s life and death. Newspapers worldwide were filled with eulogies and remembrances for many days afterward. Words alone were not enough to express the nation’s grief. Heeding President Herbert Hoover’s request, many Americans briefly turned off their electric lights at 10 o’clock Eastern time on the night of Edison’s funeral. The broad outpouring that has followed the death of Steve Jobs reminds me of the display of grief following Edison’s death. In both cases, their passing evoked an extraordinary public response, tributes that were greater and broader than those paid to many a head of state. Why is that? Both men have fully occupied my attention at different times. I wrote a book about Mr. Jobs in 1993. I looked at his struggling endeavor to start another computer company, NeXT, after he left Apple amid a power struggle in 1985. His return to Apple in 1997 and the triumphs that would follow were not within sight. I took my snapshot of him and the company when he was at the miserable nadir of his professional life. Years later, I wrote a biography of Edison, a person whom Mr. Jobs admired. When you compare the two personalities and their careers, a few similarities emerge immediately. Both had less formal schooling than most of their respective peers. Both possessed the ability to visualize projects on a grand scale. Both followed an inner voice when making decisions. And both had terrific tempers that could make their employees quake. Both men worked in several product areas, but entertainment-related technology was a major portion of their product portfolios. This prompts a question: Would the public’s relationship to Edison have been essentially the same without the phonograph and without movies? Or with Mr. Jobs, if Apple had remained just Apple Computer? After enjoying early success, each of them pursued a quixotic project that would occupy them for roughly 10 years — Mr. Jobs’s disappointing but enlightening NeXT odyssey and Edison’s failed attempt to build an iron ore processing business in northwestern New Jersey. Edison’s misadventures in mining produced no visible change in the man. He had set out to “do something now so different and so much bigger than anything I’ve ever done before people will forget that my name ever was connected with anything electrical.” The milling machinery he designed, redesigned and redesigned again never worked as he expected. But he shrugged. Nothing could rattle his sense of omniscience in all technical fields. Mr. Jobs, however, clearly learned from his experiences at NeXT about what not to do, such as driving away after short stints the talented people he had recruited. When he returned to Apple, he built an executive team that remained stable. THE later careers of the two were more different than similar. Mr. Jobs was able to realize his product visions — again and again. Edison’s career was characterized by a pattern of introducing what today we would call a beta version of a product and then losing interest in it. Competitors would then swoop in and fully commercialize the idea — and profit the most from it. Mr. Jobs was the far shrewder businessman, even if he never talked about wealth as a matter of personal interest. When Edison died, he left behind an estate valued at about $12 million, or about $180 million in today’s dollars. His friend Henry Ford had once joked that Edison was “the world’s greatest inventor and the world’s worst businessman.” Mr. Jobs was worth a commanding $6.5 billion. Mr. Jobs was perhaps the most beloved billionaire the world has ever known. Richard Branson’s tribute captures the way people felt they could identify with Mr. Jobs’s life narrative: “So many people drew courage from Steve and related to his life story: adoptees, college dropouts, struggling entrepreneurs, ousted business leaders figuring out how to make a difference in the world, and people fighting debilitating illness. We have all been there in some way and can see a bit of ourselves in his personal and professional successes and struggles.” By contrast, Edison became a victim of his own manufactured life narrative and the world’s adulation. Earlier, when Edison introduced the spring-driven phonograph in 1878, a reporter coined a nickname for him: “The Wizard of Menlo Park.” He liked — too much — playing the Wizard. He was ever ready to pontificate on any subject under the sun. Educational reform. National defense spending. The fatal effects of clothing that “pinches” the body. The relationship of diet to national destiny (“The rice-eating nations never progress...”). Much of it was ephemera or idiocy, best forgotten. Steve Jobs did not waste his time or ours with similar flotsam. A rare time that he publicly stepped out of the role of chief executive and shared personal thoughts was when he delivered the commencement address at Stanford in June 2005. It was a moving meditation on his life and his — and our — mortality. It was a talk for the ages. Early in Mr. Jobs’s career, journalists were wary of stepping within range of his “reality distortion field,” his perceived ability as a showman to make products seem better than they actually were. But it was Mr. Jobs’s personal reality in his later years, making the most of a life that both he and we knew would be cruelly cut short, that proved most influential in the end. The public tributes to Edison in 1931 and those to Mr. Jobs 80 years later were similar, but only superficially. With Edison, the public thought of the Wizard, an outsize persona, through which it was impossible to see an actual person. But with Mr. Jobs, the tributes were to a fellow mortal, exactly our own height, just as vulnerable as we all are to the random strike of a life-ending catastrophe.

Mr. Jobs did not make the technology himself; he led the teams that did, prodding, cajoling and inspiring. His track record as a business team leader is unique — as Apple’s Macintosh, iPod, iPhone and iPad testify. In two stints at Apple, he made computers into coveted consumer goods and transformed not only product categories, like music players and cellphones, but also entire industries, like music and mobile communications. Mr. Jobs even failed well. NeXT, a computer company he founded during his years in exile from Apple, was never a commercial success. But it was a technology pioneer. The World Wide Web was created on a NeXT computer, and NeXT software is the core of Apple’s operating systems today. Part of Mr. Jobs’s legacy will be the lessons learned by those who worked closely with him over the years. Here are just a few: DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO DELIGHT CUSTOMERS Six weeks before the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, Mr. Jobs ordered a crucial design change. Until then, the planning for supplies, manufacturing and engineering had been based on the assumption that the smartphone’s face would be plastic, recalls Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who led iPod and iPhone development from 2001 to 2009. Plastic is less fragile than glass, and easier to make. But the plastic touch screen had a drawback. It was prone to developing scratches. Those scratches, Mr. Jobs insisted, would irritate users and be seen as a design flaw. “All the logical facts told us to go with plastic, and Steve’s instinct went the other way,” Mr. Fadell says. “It was Steve’s call — his gut.” The glass choice was a challenge that seemed “nearly impossible” at the time, he says — a last-minute scramble to get supplies of specialized glass and tweak the design of the phone’s casing to reduce the chances the glass would crack when an iPhone was dropped. But with extra investment and a frenetic work regimen, the switch proved doable, despite the tight deadline. The episode, Mr. Fadell says, points to a principle he took away from his years working with Mr. Jobs. “You do not cut corners and you make sure the customer gets an experience that is an absolute delight,” observes Mr. Fadell, who heads a Silicon Valley start-up company whose product has not yet been disclosed and will not compete with Apple. GOOD IDEAS TAKE TIME After he was ousted from Apple, Mr. Jobs founded NeXT in 1985. It produced a powerful desktop computer, a stylish black cube, and its initial market was going to be in education. The idea was that the machine would be more than hardware and software; it would also offer content, “a universe of wisdom,” recalls Michael Hawley, a computer scientist who worked closely with Mr. Jobs at NeXT and lived part time in Mr. Jobs’s house, as Mr. Hawley shuttled between California and his post at the M.I.T. Media Lab. NeXT computers, in Mr. Jobs’s vision, would marry technology and the liberal arts by including digital books, music and art. Mr. Jobs began pursuing the rights to works that could be converted to digital form. He persuaded a few publishers that because they would save the expense of paper, printing and distribution, NeXT should pay a royalty that was a fraction of the cost of a printed book. Mr. Jobs, Mr. Hawley recalled, struck a deal with the Oxford University Press for the complete works of Shakespeare for a royalty of $1 a digital copy. NeXT’s foray into education fizzled; its machines were too expensive for that market. But Mr. Jobs’s concept and business model for digital media were “the instinct that was translated to Apple with the iTunes store, 99-cents-a-song pricing and all the media offerings that have followed,” Mr. Hawley says. “When Steve believed in an idea, he was both passionate and patient, scratching away over the years until he got it right,” says Mr. Hawley, a scientist, concert pianist and host of the EG Conference, an annual gathering for technologists, educators and people in media and entertainment. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/business/how-steve-jobs-infused-passion-into-a-commodity.html?ref=applecomputerinc">How Steve Jobs Infused Passion Into a Commodity<date>Published: October 7, 2011</date><text>In the early 1990s Compaq Computer was the technology darling of the day, and PC sales were surging. Dell was promoting its build-on-demand model, Gateway computer shipped its products in boxes with Holstein cow markings, and I.B.M. had introduced the ThinkPad with its Little Tramp marketing campaign. Apple’s Macintosh was introduced during the 1984 Super Bowl but was considered a marginal outlier with its quirky proprietary operating system.About this time I had lunch with Bill Gates, who dismissed PCs as nothing but components held together by plastic and screws manufactured on low-cost assembly lines, a commodity business with narrow profit margins. The future belonged to software and semiconductor makers like Microsoft and Intel, where the real innovation was going on. This made sense to me, and as the years unfolded, Mr. Gates seemed prescient. The PC makers were mostly reduced to commodity producers; I.B.M. sold off the ThinkPad, Hewlett-Packard bought Compaq and may now abandon the business; Gateway was sold off and the brand has all but vanished. Apple nearly went under. But today, the exception is so glaring as to have stood Mr. Gates’s prediction on its head: Apple’s operating profit margins have grown (to over 33 percent), and Apple’s market capitalization of $347.3 billion this week is bigger than that of Microsoft and Intel combined. Of all Steve Jobs’s accomplishments, this, to me, remains both the simplest and the most astonishing. How did he take a commodity — to borrow from the novelist Tom Wolfe, the “veal gray” plastic boxes that once weighed so heavily on both our desks and spirits — and turn it into one of the most iconic and desirable objects on the planet? “Steve Jobs and Apple never — ever — wanted to be a low-margin commodity producer,” Donald Norman, a former vice president for advanced technology at Apple and author of “Living With Complexity,” told me this week. “Even the Apple II had some charm to it. It was the first personal computer that had professional industrial designers. Before that they were designed strictly by engineers, and they were ugly. Steve was always, if not an artist, then someone who was charmed by style. He had this dream of something beautiful. If it was going to cost more, it didn’t matter. This was in his genes.” Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, recalled buying a 1990 Macintosh Classic and taking it back to Italy. “When I got home, I took it out of that brown, padded carrying case with the rainbow-colored Apple logo on it and put it on my desk in Milan. It was like a little pug dog looking at me. It wasn’t just something I worked with; it kept me company. It had such personality and such life.” My own conversion came much later. When I came across the MacBook Air, I thought it the single most elegant technology product I’d ever encountered, and not just because it looked good. Its light weight and paper-thin design made it easy to carry while offering all the functions and keyboard of a full-size PC. Even the packaging was so beautiful that I couldn’t bring myself to discard it. Now I refer to it as my third arm and can’t imagine life without it. Mr. Jobs “had an exceptional eye for design, and not just an eye, but an intelligence for design,” Ms. Antonelli said. “We don’t talk just about the looks, but how objects communicate: The specific shape, how it feels in the hand, under the fingers, how you read it in the eye and the mind. This is what Steve cared passionately about.” MoMA has 25 Apple products in its permanent design collection. And like many great artists, Mr. Jobs’s near-dictatorial control of Apple made possible the pursuit of perfection. “If you’re a visionary, and a dictator, you can take risks and be consistent,” Ms. Antonelli said. “NeXT was a risk and a beautiful failure. It brought him back to Apple. The dynamics of Apple and Steve’s personality and the course of history made for this perfect alignment of the stars.” Also like many artists (Frank Lloyd Wright comes to mind), Mr. Jobs was legendarily difficult at times. “He has always been focused, driven, demanding and, as a result, very difficult and abrasive,” Mr. Norman said. “This abrasiveness in the early days was too extreme and was destructive of the company. John Sculley had to fire him. When Steve came back, he had matured. He still had a demanding vision of perfection, but he brought focus. He was slightly less abrasive. He was brilliant at understanding what a product should be and he was a dictator.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

JOBS would be an influential figure in advertising even if Apple’s sole contribution had been the “1984” commercial that introduced the Macintosh, which pioneered the idea of big-concept, big-budget spots created especially for the Super Bowl.But his achievements were more far-reaching than that, according to executives who paid tribute to him on Thursday during the fourth day of Advertising Week 2011 in New York. “In a way, he was our P. T. Barnum; he was such a grand marketer,” said Jon Kamen, chairman and chief executive of @radical.media. “That showmanship is something we’re all going to miss.” Bill Koenigsberg, president and chief executive of Horizon Media, said: “Steve took game-changing to the highest level it could get. He didn’t move the line; he invented the line.” Manny Vidal, chief executive of the Vidal Partnership, praised Mr. Jobs as a “seducer.” “Apple constantly surprised us with something we didn’t think we needed,” Mr. Vidal said, but “Now, you can’t live without it.” “If you just wait for consumers to tell you what to do, you’ll never be an Apple,” he added. Allen DeBevoise, chairman and chief executive of Machinima, spoke of Mr. Jobs’s rare ability to combine “the technological prowess, the design and brand focus and the scale to innovate faster.” Because of the revolution fueled by Apple, Mr. DeBevoise said, marketers no longer need to think in terms of millions of households with TV sets, but can instead advertise on “a billion devices” with screens displaying video content. Frank Cooper, chief consumer engagement officer of PepsiCo, prefaced his remarks with some background: “Pepsi has a history with Apple. It’s not a great one.” The reference was to the question Mr. Jobs asked that helped lure John Sculley from Pepsi-Cola, where Mr. Sculley was chief executive, to become Apple’s chief executive: “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?” Mr. Jobs also endured “a lot of failures,” Mr. Cooper said, like the Lisa personal computer, but later inspired Apple’s employees to come back with successes like the iPod, iPhone and iPad. “For a packaged-goods company like Pepsi, smartphones change everything,” Mr. Cooper said, because in the past “our last point of contact” with consumers before they bought products was often media like billboards and radio. Now, contact becomes “a continuing process,” he added, with options like text messages and even “augmented reality, superimposing digital content at the shelf.” Michael Wolff, editorial director of Adweek, said he admired how “implacable” Mr. Jobs was in his decision not to license Apple’s software to other hardware makers. “There was not a person in the world who thought” that was the right strategy, Mr. Wolff said, but Mr. Jobs’s mantra was “I don’t waver.” Apple “is so ingrained, so ubiquitous, so part of everything we do,” Mr. Wolff said, that it “probably has a generation in which it’s dominant” after Mr. Jobs’s passing. As for Mr. Wolff’s own future, he said: “I have a job. I am still employed. That story may be different if you ask me or The New York Post an hour from now.” That was a reference to articles in The Post, and on gawker.com, reporting that Prometheus Global Media, the owner of Adweek, has decided to replace him, a year after his hiring and six months after Adweek, an advertising trade publication, was revamped to be more focused on media coverage and styled more like a general-interest magazine. “There is a discussion going on in my company over what this magazine should be,” Mr. Wolff told Richard Kirshenbaum, chairman of Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal &amp; Partners, who moderated a question-and-answer session with Mr. Wolff. One side “wants a magazine that tells a smaller story, the traditional ad trade magazine story, who’s winning what accounts,” Mr. Wolff said, adding, “I would not want to tell” that story. “I hope that by doing what we do, they get comfortable with it,” Mr. Wolff said, referring to those who want to change Adweek back. On the other hand, he added, “it’s their money, and you have to be comfortable how you spend it.” There were also events that did not include discussions of Mr. Jobs or Apple. One was a panel, sponsored by Univision Communications, devoted to marketing to the growing ranks of Hispanic consumers who are bilingual. Bernie Williams, the former New York Yankees outfielder, talked about his personal process of acculturation, which began when he left Puerto Rico to play baseball. Mr. Williams recalled how television shows like “Que Pasa USA,” a bilingual series on PBS, helped him learn English. For Mr. Williams’s children, he said, the process is different: he and his wife make sure they understand Spanish and appreciate Hispanic food and culture. “But they’re American,” Mr. Williams said. Advertising to bicultural Latinos is tricky for many marketers, said Tony Pace, chief marketing officer for Subway. Subway has determined that “we need to seem like the same brand when we are doing Spanish-language communication,” Mr. Pace said. So the phrase “$5 Footlong,” referring to the popular sandwich, is used in commercials in Spanish as well as English. At Macy’s, said Martine Reardon, executive vice president for marketing and advertising, there is an evolution of its strategy to reach the critical Hispanic shopper. For example, Ms. Reardon said, Macy’s changed in-store marketing materials for Lancôme to add products and spokeswomen that appeal more to Latina customers. It was a way of telling that customer, “We get it. We recognize you,” Ms. Reardon said. Advertising Week 2011, which began on Monday, concludes on Friday.</text></article>

Jobs had learned that, after years of fighting cancer, his time was becoming shorter. He quietly told a few acquaintances, and they, in turn, whispered to others. And so a pilgrimage began. The calls trickled in at first. Just a few, then dozens, and in recent weeks, a nearly endless stream of people who wanted a few moments to say goodbye, according to people close to Mr. Jobs. Most were intercepted by his wife, Laurene. She would apologetically explain that he was too tired to receive many visitors. In his final weeks, he became so weak that it was hard for him to walk up the stairs of his own home anymore, she confided to one caller. Some asked if they might try again tomorrow. Sorry, she replied. He had only so much energy for farewells. The man who valued his privacy almost as much as his ability to leave his mark on the world had decided whom he most needed to see before he left. Mr. Jobs spent his final weeks — as he had spent most of his life — in tight control of his choices. He invited a close friend, the physician Dean Ornish, a preventive health advocate, to join him for sushi at one of his favorite restaurants, Jin Sho in Palo Alto. He said goodbye to longtime colleagues including the venture capitalist John Doerr, the Apple board member Bill Campbell and the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger. He offered Apple’s executives advice on unveiling the iPhone 4S, which occurred on Tuesday. He spoke to his biographer, Walter Isaacson. He started a new drug regime, and told some friends that there was reason for hope. But, mostly, he spent time with his wife and children — who will now oversee a fortune of at least $6.5 billion, and, in addition to their grief, take on responsibility for tending to the legacy of someone who was as much a symbol as a man. “Steve made choices,” Dr. Ornish said. “I once asked him if he was glad that he had kids, and he said, ‘It’s 10,000 times better than anything I’ve ever done.’ ” “But for Steve, it was all about living life on his own terms and not wasting a moment with things he didn’t think were important. He was aware that his time on earth was limited. He wanted control of what he did with the choices that were left.” In his final months, Mr. Jobs’s home — a large and comfortable but relatively modest brick house in a residential neighborhood — was surrounded by security guards. His driveway’s gate was flanked by two black S.U.V.’s. On Thursday, as online eulogies multiplied and the walls of Apple stores in Taiwan, New York, Shanghai and Frankfurt were papered with hand-drawn cards, the S.U.V.’s were removed and the sidewalk at his home became a garland of bouquets, candles and a pile of apples, each with one bite carefully removed. “Everyone always wanted a piece of Steve,” said one acquaintance who, in Mr. Jobs’s final weeks, was rebuffed when he sought an opportunity to say goodbye. “He created all these layers to protect himself from the fan boys and other peoples’ expectations and the distractions that have destroyed so many other companies. “But once you’re gone, you belong to the world.” Mr. Jobs’s biographer, Mr. Isaacson, whose book will be published in two weeks, asked him why so private a man had consented to the questions of someone writing a book. “I wanted my kids to know me,” Mr. Jobs replied, Mr. Isaacson wrote Thursday in an essay on Time.com. “I wasn’t always there for them, and I wanted them to know why and to understand what I did.” Because of that privacy, little is known yet of what Mr. Jobs’s heirs will do with his wealth. Unlike many prominent business people, he has never disclosed plans to give large amounts to charity. His shares in Disney, which Mr. Jobs acquired when the entertainment company purchased his animated film company, Pixar, are worth about $4.4 billion. That is double the $2.1 billion value of his shares in Apple, perhaps surprising given that he is best known for the computer company he founded. Mr. Jobs’s emphasis on secrecy, say acquaintances, led him to shy away from large public donations. At one point, Mr. Jobs was asked by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates to give a majority of his wealth to philanthropy alongside a number of prominent executives like Mr. Gates and Warren E. Buffett. But Mr. Jobs declined, according to a person with direct knowledge of Mr. Jobs’s decision. 1 2 Next Page » Reporting was contributed by Julie Bosman, Quentin Hardy, Claire Cain Miller and Evelyn M.

I was stationed in Moscow for The Associated Press and I ordered an Apple IIc — by Telex — from a department store in Helsinki, Finland. They express shipped it to me, a month later, by train.The IIc was Apple’s first crack at a “portable” computer, which it sort of was if you didn’t mind a 7.5 pound weight, plus monitor, external floppy drive and all the cables. But it was sleek for its time, about the size of a loose leaf binder. The K.G.B. officers at the Soviet customs desk at Leningrad Station were annoyed. “Where is the computer,” one asked. “Right here,” I said. He gave me that contemptuous look that border guards all seemed to have: “That is the keyboard. Show me the computer!” This went on while a clutch of guards conferred over what to charge me. The Soviet Union assessed customs fees on electronics based on size and weight, which seemed guaranteed to maximize their take. We had no clue how Mr. Jobs would change that, along with so many other conventions. The Apple IIc with its 128KB of RAM, 125KB floppy drive, word processor and spreadsheet application, did everything I could imagine a computer doing, at the time. But visionaries like Mr. Jobs had no intention of settling for “at the time.” I’ve had a stream of computers — mostly Macs — since, each more incredible than the last. I have sometimes thought the power of computers had exceeded our ability to use them, but Mr. Jobs and his team kept giving us devices that made indispensable things easier in ways you never thought of. Other computer makers know how machines work and want humans to alter their behavior accordingly. Mr. Jobs and his team labored to understand how humans behave and think and built machines to suit us. I only met Mr. Jobs once, but like so many others, I carry a piece of him around. When I heard of his death, I thought how delicious it would have been to show those K.G.B. border guards my iPhone. </text></article>

His products, like the iPod, iTunes, iPad, iPhone and the Apple and Macintosh computers, helped us better communicate and gain access to music and movies; they helped educate us, and helped us enjoy life more and made life easier. He helped bring to the common man what was once only the exclusive domain of business, government, and the rich and the powerful. KENNETH L. ZIMMERMAN Huntington Beach, Calif., Oct. 6, 2011   To the Editor: Steven P. Jobs leveraged technology to improve and transform the way in which we work and play. He made business sexy. His contributions to the human condition are inestimable. I’m of the generation that grew up with black-and-white television, transistor radios, manual typewriters and rotary phones. I can truly appreciate how his extraordinary vision has enriched my life. BARRY K. HERMAN Radnor, Pa., Oct. 6, 2011 To the Editor: Amid all the hosannas to Steven P. Jobs, we might pause to remind ourselves that he was also known for publicly humiliating his employees and abruptly firing them during angry tantrums. The ultimate measure of a human being is not the objects he produced, but the way he treated other people — especially those over whom he had power or authority. And on that measure, Mr. Jobs fell short. JONATHAN ZIMMERMAN New York, Oct. 6, 2011 The writer is a professor of education and history at New York University. To the Editor: Steven P. Jobs said he never thought of himself as a manager but as a leader. Michael Hammer, the brilliant engineering innovator who, like Mr. Jobs, died far too young, once told me that the difference between a manager and a leader is that a manager gets you to do what he wants you to do and a leader gets you to want what he wants. Steve Jobs was certainly a leader, not only to Apple employees but also to all those he inspired to want the products he knew we would want. JOSEPH C.

    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/technology/steve-jobs-defended-his-work-with-a-barbed-tongue.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Steve Jobs Defended His Work With a Barbed Tongue<date>Published: October 6, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — The first time Steve Jobs ever bullied anyone was in the third grade. He and some pals “basically destroyed” the teacher, he once said.For the next half-century, Mr. Jobs never let up. He chewed out subordinates and partners who failed to deliver, trashed competitors who did not measure up and told know-it-all pundits to take a hike. He had a vision of greatness that he wielded to reshape the computer, telephone and entertainment industries, and he would brook no compromise. Maybe it is only the despair people feel about the stagnating American economy, but the announcement of the death of the Apple co-founder Wednesday seemed to mark the end of something: in an era of limits, Mr. Jobs was the last great tyrant. Even in Silicon Valley, where corporate chieftains are frequently larger than life, and soul-enhancing technology is promised with the morning e-mail, there was no one quite like him. He used his powers to make devices that are beloved by their owners in a way that very few American products manage to achieve, especially these days. “Amidst the oceans of enforced mediocrity in the bland, deflavorized culture of managed-by-committee corporate behemoths,” the entrepreneur Perry Metzger posted on his Google+ page, Mr. Jobs “showed that the real path to excellence was excellence — that you could do great things by, who would have imagined, being smart and having excellent taste and not ever settling for second best.” After his death became public, there was a waterfall of emotion on Twitter and blogs. Fans gathered outside Mr. Jobs’s house in Palo Alto, Calif., and they placed candles and flowers in front of Apple stores everywhere. His house is in the center of town, easy to find and rather modest for a guy worth about $6.5 billion. He was planning another house, but even that seemed as if it would be relatively restrained for a lord of Silicon Valley. Where he was unrestrained was in his work. Stories of him forcefully telling Apple employees that a product was not good enough are legion. (“You’ve baked a really lovely cake,” he told one engineer, adding that the hapless fellow had used dog feces for frosting). Make it smaller and better, he commanded. No element of design was too minor to escape his notice. (On a Mac interface: “We made the buttons on the screen look so good you’ll want to lick them.”) Mr. Jobs castigated competitors, particularly Microsoft. Bill Gates’s company, which dwarfed Apple in power and wealth during the 1980s and 1990s, was not even described as second-rate; it was deemed third-rate. Worse, it was not even trying. “The only problem with Microsoft is they just have no taste,” Mr. Jobs said in a typical broadside. “They have absolutely no taste. And I don’t mean that in a small way, I mean that in a big way, in the sense that they don’t think of original ideas, and they don’t bring much culture into their products.” This is not the sort of unvarnished comment you ever hear the founders of Google, say, publicly expressing about Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, or vice versa. “We’re mourning Steve because we don’t have much of his passion and directness in corporate life these days,” said Jay Elliot, a former Apple executive who has written a book about learning from Mr. Jobs’s lessons in leadership. “He wasn’t driven by the stock price.” Like many big tech companies, Apple has a formidable public relations staff, but Mr. Jobs was not constrained by this either. People knew his e-mail — “sjobs@apple.com” — and sent him queries and complaints. He often responded, if tersely. A persistent effort by a college student complaining about her inability to get information from the famously reticent P.R. staff finally elicited a testy, “Please leave us alone.” Mr. Jobs’s self-confidence could sometimes be indistinguishable from arrogance and self-aggrandizement. At an Apple Halloween party during the wild early years, he reportedly came dressed as Jesus. (In a rare tribute for a layman, Mr. Jobs’s career was celebrated Thursday on the front page of the Vatican newspaper.) But it was an arrogance tempered by faith in the power of technology to improve lives. The satirical newspaper The Onion underscored this point nicely in its news story on Mr. Jobs’s death. The headline, modified here to replace an expletive, said: “Last American Who Knew What the Heck He Was Doing Dies.” Funny, but it is deep in the nature of Silicon Valley to challenge such sentiments. “I don’t want to take anything away from the guy, he was brilliant and uncompromising and wonderful, but there’s a level of adulation that goes beyond what is merited,” said Tim O’Reilly, chief executive of the tech publisher O’Reilly Media. “There will be revolutions and revolutionaries to come.”</text></article>

A lot of people have not. That is because even though Steven P. Jobs helped upend so many businesses with a string of groundbreaking products in music, mobile phones, games and tablet computers, he barely made a dent in television.Under Mr. Jobs, Apple dipped its toe only slightly into the television business with Apple TV, a set-top box for accessing Internet video. That product has been one of the rare disappointments in its lineup, especially when compared with smashes like the iPhone and iPad. But many in the tech industry contend that television is ripe for technological makeover, and that the next big challenge for Apple, after the death of Mr. Jobs, is likely to be in that area. “It’s the big area they haven’t colonized,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s the thing we spend more of our time on than sleep."  In the meantime, companies like Microsoft have started to take a stronger leadership role in helping to push the technology of television forward, as Apple did in areas like music and mobile phones. Television is such a tantalizing target in part because people spend so many hours watching it, but also because the industry over all has been slow to innovate except perhaps in making screens larger. In particular, the consuming public is still waiting for television content — everything that people watch — to be delivered over the Internet in a convenient, affordable package on all the devices people are now using. One big reason for Apple’s failure to gain traction in television is that Apple TV has not had a compelling source of television and movie content that allows the product to stand out. Although the company’s iTunes store is stocked with many popular shows like “Glee” and “Sons of Anarchy,” network and movie studio executives have hesitated to make all of their content widely available at attractive prices, in large part over concerns about angering cable companies, a big source of their revenue, and their pipeline into living rooms. In August, Apple discontinued an iTunes rental service that allowed viewers to rent television episodes for 99 cents through the store for watching on devices like Apple TV, saying that consumers were not as interested in renting episodes as in buying them. Last year, talks between Apple and television executives, including NBCUniversal, Viacom and Discovery, stalled over a plan to license their programs for an Internet subscription service akin to Netflix and Hulu Plus, according to executives briefed on talks. The cold shoulder to Apple from television executives is a stark contrast to the success Mr. Jobs had in wooing the music companies when the iTunes Store was begun eight years ago. At the time, Mr. Jobs used his personal charisma to persuade record executives to let Apple sell songs for 99 cents each through iTunes. It also helped him that the iPod hadn’t yet turned into a blockbuster product. The subsequent explosion in sales of 99-cent digital singles on iTunes further eroded compact disc sales, many music executives say. Television executives were determined to avoid the same experience. “It didn’t work in TV and movies precisely because it did in music,” said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester Research. Mr. Jobs himself often downplayed Apple TV’s impact on the market. While he used lofty words like “magical” to describe the iPad, Mr. Jobs on more than one occasion referred to the $99 Apple TV as a “hobby” for Apple because of its lackluster sales. Analysts estimate the company has sold about two million of the devices. It has sold nearly 29 million iPads since the product was introduced in the spring of 2010. In an on-stage interview last year at the D: All Things Digital conference, Mr. Jobs further expounded on his pessimism about the market by saying that it was hard to sell innovative television devices like Apple TV to consumers, when cable companies give their customers a set-top box for little or no cost upfront. “That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because nobody’s willing to buy a set-top box,” he said. In the meantime, one of Apple’s rivals, Microsoft, announced a major new push into the television business on Wednesday, before the announcement of Mr. Jobs’s death. The company said it was entering a partnership with nearly 40 television providers, including Bravo, Comcast, HBO and Verizon FiOS, that will allow the 35 million members of its Xbox Live online service to watch mainstream cable programming through Microsoft’s game console. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

Jobs finally achieved his long-sought goal of bringing the Beatles to iTunes. But years before he made the deal, he began working on the promotional campaign for the music, personally designing advertisements that would sit in virtual mothballs as long as necessary.“He just sat them there waiting for the day,” said Roger Faxon, the chief executive of the EMI Group, the Beatles’ label. “They were beautiful ads.” As the man who introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad to the world, Mr. Jobs became a kind of folk hero of American business for his intuitive understanding of consumer sentiment and his ability to make deals with some of the most obstinate players in entertainment and media. He was, according to Bono of U2 in a statement on Thursday, “one of a very small group of anarchic Americans who through technology literally invented the 21st century. We all miss the hardware software Elvis.” In many ways, the Beatles agreement was the perfect distillation of Mr. Jobs’s determination — and his complete confidence — in melding technology and culture. But for the media companies at the other end of those deals, Mr. Jobs was a far more complex figure. As executives in music, film and publishing have learned, a deal with Mr. Jobs and Apple meant inclusion in one of the most important digital marketplaces on the planet, and the potential for greater sales than from any other outlet. But the deals were inevitably made on Mr. Jobs’s strict terms. “Steve’s approach to the magazine industry was, ‘My way or the highway,’ ” said Jann Wenner, the founder and editor of Rolling Stone, who dealt with Apple over the magazine’s iPad edition. Of all media businesses, music has had the most fraught relationship with Apple. It was the first entertainment industry to find its basic business model shaken by the Internet, when Napster in 1999 ushered in mass illegal file-sharing. ITunes was clearly the only workable solution, said one senior executive at a major label, but Mr. Jobs’s demands that songs be sold individually and all at 99 cents made the labels uncomfortable. “He was a genius and he was creative, but he was also fairly imperious,” said Bill Werde, the editorial director of Billboard. “When Apple has leverage, Apple uses leverage.” Stories about Mr. Jobs’s efforts to persuade the leaders of the industry to his side are legion. For years, he remained stubbornly, victoriously inflexible about matters like pricing. He personally demonstrated iTunes to figures like Bono and Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, wowing them in much the same way he did crowds of software developers and journalists at the company’s regular product introductions. “We swallowed hard,” said the senior label executive, who did not want his name used because of Apple’s well-known secrecy about negotiations and contracts. “But if anybody could pull this off, Steve could.” The iTunes store has sold 16 billion songs in its eight years in business. Yet for music companies, it has been a mixed blessing. Overall music sales declined 32 percent in 2010 from 2003, when the iTunes store was introduced, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Digital music, while still growing, has not made up for the money lost from CDs. For many in other forms of media, however, Apple has all but saved the music labels from a far worse fate. “The cautionary tale in music was not how they did business but that they waited,” said Robert W. Pittman, the chief executive of Clear Channel Communications and a former top executive at MTV and AOL. Music executives “didn’t realize that in the digital age, the consumer can get access to content in other ways that they had no control over,” he said. For others, music has been an example of an industry that gave up too much control to Apple. The company faced a revolt from magazine and newspaper publishers this year when it insisted on keeping 30 percent of the money from subscriptions sold in its app ecosystem and on controlling all customer data for those transactions. With services like Google offering more favorable terms to publishers, Apple agreed to some flexibility. 1 2 Next Page » Brooks Barnes and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.</text></article>

Last year, talks between Apple and television executives, including NBCUniversal, Viacom and Discovery, stalled over a plan to license their programs for an Internet subscription service akin to Netflix and Hulu Plus, according to executives briefed on talks. The cold shoulder to Apple from television executives is a stark contrast to the success Mr. Jobs had in wooing the music companies when the iTunes Store was begun eight years ago. At the time, Mr. Jobs used his personal charisma to persuade record executives to let Apple sell songs for 99 cents each through iTunes. It also helped him that the iPod hadn’t yet turned into a blockbuster product. The subsequent explosion in sales of 99-cent digital singles on iTunes further eroded compact disc sales, many music executives say. Television executives were determined to avoid the same experience. “It didn’t work in TV and movies precisely because it did in music,” said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester Research. Mr. Jobs himself often downplayed Apple TV’s impact on the market. While he used lofty words like “magical” to describe the iPad, Mr. Jobs on more than one occasion referred to the $99 Apple TV as a “hobby” for Apple because of its lackluster sales. Analysts estimate the company has sold about two million of the devices. It has sold nearly 29 million iPads since the product was introduced in the spring of 2010. In an on-stage interview last year at the D: All Things Digital conference, Mr. Jobs further expounded on his pessimism about the market by saying that it was hard to sell innovative television devices like Apple TV to consumers, when cable companies give their customers a set-top box for little or no cost upfront. “That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because nobody’s willing to buy a set-top box,” he said. In the meantime, one of Apple’s rivals, Microsoft, announced a major new push into the television business on Wednesday, before the announcement of Mr. Jobs’s death. The company said it was entering a partnership with nearly 40 television providers, including Bravo, Comcast, HBO and Verizon FiOS, that will allow the 35 million members of its Xbox Live online service to watch mainstream cable programming through Microsoft’s game console. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

A lot of people have not. That is because even though Steven P. Jobs helped upend so many businesses with a string of groundbreaking products in music, mobile phones, games and tablet computers, he barely made a dent in television.Under Mr. Jobs, Apple dipped its toe only slightly into the television business with Apple TV, a set-top box for accessing Internet video. That product has been one of the rare disappointments in its lineup, especially when compared with smashes like the iPhone and iPad. But many in the tech industry contend that television is ripe for technological makeover, and that the next big challenge for Apple, after the death of Mr. Jobs, is likely to be in that area. “It’s the big area they haven’t colonized,” said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s the thing we spend more of our time on than sleep."  In the meantime, companies like Microsoft have started to take a stronger leadership role in helping to push the technology of television forward, as Apple did in areas like music and mobile phones. Television is such a tantalizing target in part because people spend so many hours watching it, but also because the industry over all has been slow to innovate except perhaps in making screens larger. In particular, the consuming public is still waiting for television content — everything that people watch — to be delivered over the Internet in a convenient, affordable package on all the devices people are now using. One big reason for Apple’s failure to gain traction in television is that Apple TV has not had a compelling source of television and movie content that allows the product to stand out. Although the company’s iTunes store is stocked with many popular shows like “Glee” and “Sons of Anarchy,” network and movie studio executives have hesitated to make all of their content widely available at attractive prices, in large part over concerns about angering cable companies, a big source of their revenue, and their pipeline into living rooms.

Jobs finally achieved his long-sought goal of bringing the Beatles to iTunes. But years before he made the deal, he began working on the promotional campaign for the music, personally designing advertisements that would sit in virtual mothballs as long as necessary.“He just sat them there waiting for the day,” said Roger Faxon, the chief executive of the EMI Group, the Beatles’ label. “They were beautiful ads.” As the man who introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad to the world, Mr. Jobs became a kind of folk hero of American business for his intuitive understanding of consumer sentiment and his ability to make deals with some of the most obstinate players in entertainment and media. He was, according to Bono of U2 in a statement on Thursday, “one of a very small group of anarchic Americans who through technology literally invented the 21st century. We all miss the hardware software Elvis.” In many ways, the Beatles agreement was the perfect distillation of Mr. Jobs’s determination — and his complete confidence — in melding technology and culture. But for the media companies at the other end of those deals, Mr. Jobs was a far more complex figure. As executives in music, film and publishing have learned, a deal with Mr. Jobs and Apple meant inclusion in one of the most important digital marketplaces on the planet, and the potential for greater sales than from any other outlet. But the deals were inevitably made on Mr. Jobs’s strict terms. “Steve’s approach to the magazine industry was, ‘My way or the highway,’ ” said Jann Wenner, the founder and editor of Rolling Stone, who dealt with Apple over the magazine’s iPad edition. Of all media businesses, music has had the most fraught relationship with Apple. It was the first entertainment industry to find its basic business model shaken by the Internet, when Napster in 1999 ushered in mass illegal file-sharing. ITunes was clearly the only workable solution, said one senior executive at a major label, but Mr. Jobs’s demands that songs be sold individually and all at 99 cents made the labels uncomfortable. “He was a genius and he was creative, but he was also fairly imperious,” said Bill Werde, the editorial director of Billboard. “When Apple has leverage, Apple uses leverage.” Stories about Mr. Jobs’s efforts to persuade the leaders of the industry to his side are legion. For years, he remained stubbornly, victoriously inflexible about matters like pricing. He personally demonstrated iTunes to figures like Bono and Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, wowing them in much the same way he did crowds of software developers and journalists at the company’s regular product introductions. “We swallowed hard,” said the senior label executive, who did not want his name used because of Apple’s well-known secrecy about negotiations and contracts. “But if anybody could pull this off, Steve could.” The iTunes store has sold 16 billion songs in its eight years in business. Yet for music companies, it has been a mixed blessing. Overall music sales declined 32 percent in 2010 from 2003, when the iTunes store was introduced, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Digital music, while still growing, has not made up for the money lost from CDs. For many in other forms of media, however, Apple has all but saved the music labels from a far worse fate. “The cautionary tale in music was not how they did business but that they waited,” said Robert W. Pittman, the chief executive of Clear Channel Communications and a former top executive at MTV and AOL. Music executives “didn’t realize that in the digital age, the consumer can get access to content in other ways that they had no control over,” he said. For others, music has been an example of an industry that gave up too much control to Apple. The company faced a revolt from magazine and newspaper publishers this year when it insisted on keeping 30 percent of the money from subscriptions sold in its app ecosystem and on controlling all customer data for those transactions. With services like Google offering more favorable terms to publishers, Apple agreed to some flexibility. 1 2 Next Page » Brooks Barnes and Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.</text></article>

Jobs, Apple’s executives will face the challenge of how to keep its streak of hit products going while avoiding the problems that have befallen other companies that lost their beloved founders.The risk is this: How to follow the lessons Mr. Jobs imparted to his fellow Apple executives over the last 14 years without being trapped by his legacy and unable to adapt to future changes. Timothy D. Cook, Mr. Jobs’s longtime lieutenant at Apple, captured the difficult balancing act in an e-mail he sent to all Apple employees in late August after taking over from Mr. Jobs as chief executive. “I want you to be confident that Apple is not going to change,” Mr. Cook wrote. On one level, the message was an effort to reassure nervous Apple staff members that the commitment to innovation that Mr. Jobs established would not change, even if Mr. Jobs was no longer involved in Apple’s day-to-day operations. But management experts say change is often exactly what companies need as market conditions shift in the years after their founders are gone. The Walt Disney Company is one cautionary tale. In the years after the death in 1966 of the entertainment company’s founder, the executives strived to stay true to Walt Disney’s spirit. For years, Mr. Disney’s old office was preserved like an untouched museum. Its executives often praised corporate decision-making by saying, “Walt would have liked it.” But by the late 1970s, Disney was struggling after a string of box-office flops and was the subject of a hostile takeover attempt. It took the hiring of Michael Eisner and other top executives in the 1980s to revitalize Disney through more aggressive investments in animated filmmaking, theme parks and stores. “Apple can’t fall into that,” said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “It’s not, ‘What would Steve have done?’ That’s a recipe for problems.” Mr. Yoffie said Mr. Cook had to “walk a fine line” in how he managed the transition into the post-Jobs era. “For most of the people at Apple, they have to have a sense that the creativity and enthusiasm of Steve will continue,” he said. “He’s got to send a signal to troops that the heart of Apple won’t change. Otherwise he risks losing talent. “At the same time, Tim can’t be another Steve Jobs,” Mr. Yoffie continued. “At some level, the company will have to evolve. The way it evolves and the types of changes are yet to be understood, probably by Tim himself.” For the moment, Mr. Jobs has left Apple with so much momentum in the market, with surging sales of products like the iPad and iPhone, that it is unlikely to face any huge immediate challenges. The day before Mr. Jobs died, Mr. Cook made his debut at the first public event since taking over the top post: the introduction of a new model of iPhone. Rick Devine, an executive recruiter, said that the “market winds are at their back,” and that Mr. Cook is the best-qualified person to continue that success. “He knows that organization,” he said. “If there’s anyone who can keep that course, it’s him.” Mr. Devine is familiar with Mr. Cook because he was the recruiter who introduced him to Mr. Jobs in 1998, when Mr. Jobs was looking for a seasoned executive to help him clean up Apple’s disorganized manufacturing operations. Mr. Jobs and Mr. Cook quickly hit it off when they met, as Mr. Jobs told Mr. Devine after their meeting. “He said, ‘This is the guy,’ ” Mr. Devine said. Mr. Jobs’s death left technology executives and legions of Apple fans struggling to imagine an industry without one of its founding fathers. Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman and co-founder, said he would “miss Steve immensely.” “The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,” Mr. Gates said in a statement. “For those of us lucky enough to get to work with him, it’s been an insanely great honor.” Consumers of Apple products expressed somewhat similar emotions on Wednesday. Vansi Gadey, 30, a designer who works at a large technology company, was visiting the Apple store near Union Square in San Francisco, to charge his phone. He said: “I’m from India. In my childhood, Gandhi was an inspiration. After that, it’s been Steve Jobs.” Burt Miller, 56, was on his way to a San Francisco Apple store to pick up some replacement parts when his wife called to tell him that Mr. Jobs had died. He said he was crushed. Mr. Miller, who works in construction, said he had followed the presentation of the new iPhone the day before and was convinced that Mr. Jobs had too. “I think he saw it and knew Apple was going to make it and he let go.” Matt Richtel and Somini Sengupta contributed reporting.</text></article>

Those words popped up repeatedly on Wednesday in the outpouring of emotional responses to the death of Steve Jobs.Many people described the impact they felt Mr. Jobs had made on their own lives and businesses. He was, they said, a singular force. In a statement, President Obama described Mr. Jobs as one of “the greatest of American innovators” who exemplified the country’s ingenuity. “There may be no greater tribute to Steve’s success than the fact that much of the world learned of his passing on a device he invented,” Mr. Obama said. And many passed along the news with their iPads and Macintoshes and iPhones, simply because these devices of his creation had become so integral to their daily lives. Twitter briefly buckled under the mass of Jobs-related messages, a veritable technology 21-gun salute. Fans of Mr. Jobs paid tribute too in a more traditional way — with flowers and silence. Outside the flagship Apple store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, people had left two bouquets of roses and some candles late Wednesday, and some sat around quietly using their Apple laptops. By 11 p.m., the crowds gathering outside the store were thickening. Roughly three dozen people stood outside talking about Mr. Jobs, and many people stopped to take photos of the building even though its exterior, an iconic glass cube, was covered for remodeling. At an Apple store in the meatpacking district in New York, someone left an apple, with one bite taken out of it, mimicking the Apple logo. A note read: “iThankYou.” There were also flowers outside of Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, took to his own page on the site to write: “Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you.” Eric E. Schmidt, the chairman of Google, whose company has become a competitor to Apple in the phone business, said: “Steve defined a generation of style and technology that’s unlikely to be matched again.” People in the technology field described Mr. Jobs as someone they could only look up to — and try to emulate. At RocketSpace, a technology incubator in downtown San Francisco that is home to 94 start-up companies, the entrepreneurs and their employees said Mr. Jobs gave them something to aspire to. “He completely changed the way we operate,” said Quinn Duffy, 21, an intern at Wimdu, a travel Web site. “He’s a pretty good model for someone who wants to take a smaller company and become a global force.” TechShop, a warehouse in San Francisco equipped with high-tech tools, attracts the kind of people who might have been inspired by Steve Jobs’s hardware prowess. Brian Speir, a consultant who came to make wedding invitations using a laser cutter, described Mr. Jobs as “a legend, on par with any great artist.” “He’s meticulous,” Mr. Speir said. “More than anything, it’s not stopping until something’s perfect. My fiancée says, ‘It’s good enough,’ and I say, ‘Not yet.’ ” His fiancée, Megan Hoak, added: “And when he says that, he always refers to Steve.” At an Apple store in San Francisco, David Lauder-Walker, 42, was buying headphones for his iPhone when he got a text from a friend about Mr. Jobs’s death. “He was really somebody who changed the conversation,” he said, “for whom good enough wasn’t good enough.” Jenna Wortham, Claire Cain Miller and Sarah Maslin Nir contributed reporting.</text></article>

Second<date>October 6, 2011, 1:37 pm</date><text>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 2:45 p.m. | Updated Correcting the photo of the indicator light on the Mac laptop. If you walked into the office of almost any chief executive and asked him or her to describe a favorite font, I’m pretty sure you would be greeted with a blank stare and silence. If you asked Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, you had better make yourself comfortable: Mr. Jobs was passionate about typography and would have described, in great detail, the intricacies of a single serif. That is what made Mr. Jobs’s products feel so impeccable. He didn’t just pore over spreadsheets, personnel issues and revenue numbers, as most C.E.O.’s are expected to do. He thought about design, too. In fact, he went beyond thinking about it. He obsessed over it — every curve, every pixel, every ligature, every gradient. In his widely noted commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Mr. Jobs explained where this design passion came from, describing a typography class he attended after dropping out of college: “Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating. “None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.” His focus on the little things like the “space between different letter combinations” was a constant from the development of the Macintosh to the iPhone, which was released more than 20 years later. This is what separated Mr. Jobs, as a chief executive, from everyone else. When Mr. Jobs resigned as Apple’s chief executive in August, Vic Gundotra, senior vice president for engineering at Google, posted an account of an exchange with Mr. Jobs before the introduction of the iPhone. Mr. Gundotra said Mr. Jobs had called him on a Sunday morning with an “urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away.” Mr. Jobs said: “I’ve been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I’m not happy with the icon. The second O in Google doesn’t have the right yellow gradient. It’s just wrong and I’m going to have Greg fix it tomorrow. Is that O.K. with you?” The hundreds of designers who had been involved in the iPhone development didn’t notice that the shading in a yellow O might have a slightly incorrect gradient. But Mr. Jobs did. But the greatest example of Mr. Jobs’s attention to detail and design can be found in the little millimeter-sized glowing light that appears on every MacBook Laptop. The light, known as a sleep indicator, glows when the laptop is closed, or sleeping. Competing laptops have this feature too, but Apple’s is different. screenshot via Apple.com The sleep indicator light on MacBook laptops glows at the pace of a breathing adult. The Mac sleep indicator is timed to glow at the average breathing rate of an adult: 12 breaths per minute. As with the space between typographic letter on the Macintosh, only Mr. Jobs could pay attention to such detail. Correction: An image with an earlier version of this post was included in error. A correct MacBook laptop image of the sleep indicator light has been substituted.</text></article>

Well, editors, you can lower your weapons, a least a bit.As promised, Apple has begun to add features back in. The controversy began with the release of the cheaper, more amateur-oriented Final Cut Pro X. It was missing some crucial features of its predecessor, Final Cut Pro 7. The problem was that it was impossible to import work from the old Final Cut Pro 7 to the new Final Cut Pro X. The two are incompatible. That means projects from Final Cut 7 cannot be reworked on Final Cut Pro X, which was a problem for producers. They could not devote new computers to projects in progress because they could not get new software that would work with the continuing project. Apple addressed the problem initially by making Final Cut Pro 7 available again through telephone sales, and it still is. The inability of Pro 7 to work with Pro X will not change. One reason is that Final Cut Pro 7 was built on a 32-bit architecture, and Final Cut Pro X is built on 64-bit, so while a transfer can be made, it will not be of the quality the pros demand. But now Apple is addressing other complaints, bringing in enhanced versions of older features it said it would restore. The main ones will let multiple people work on a project over a shared network; another makes Final Cut files work with other programs (say, for color correction); and Apple has greatly simplified the process for exporting all of the soundtracks that go with a movie. If you aren’t a pro — just a hobbyist who is familiar with iMovie and are ready for a little more sophistication — don’t let the controversy put you off. The “missing” features will probably not matter to you, and you can try Final Cut Pro X free on a trial basis. ROY FURCHGOTT</text></article>

Since that moment, tributes, eulogies and retrospectives have poured over the world like rain. He changed industries, redefined business models, fused technology and art. People are comparing him to Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, Leonardo da Vinci. And they’re saying that it will be a very long time before the world sees the likes of Steve Jobs again. Probably true. But why not, do you suppose? After all, there are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. They’re all over Silicon Valley — all over the world. Many of them, maybe most of them, have studied Steve Jobs, tried to absorb his methods and his philosophy. Surely if they pore over the Steve Jobs playbook long enough, they can re-create some of his success. But nobody ever does, even when they copy Mr. Jobs’s moves down to the last eyebrow twitch. Why not? Here’s a guy who never finished college, never went to business school, never worked for anyone else a day in his adult life. So how did he become the visionary who changed every business he touched? Actually, he’s given us clues all along. Remember the “Think Different” ad campaign he introduced upon his return to Apple in 1997? “Here’s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.” In other words, the story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don’t go with the flow. Steve Jobs refused to go with the flow. If he saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Not internal politics, not economic convention, not social graces. Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it’s nimble. It’s incredibly focused. It’s had stunningly few flops. And that’s because Mr. Jobs didn’t buy into focus groups, groupthink or decision by committee. At its core, Apple existed to execute the visions in his brain. He oversaw every button, every corner, every chime. He lost sleep over the fonts in the menus, the cardboard of the packaging, the color of the power cord. That’s just not how things are done. Often, his laser focus flew in the face of screamingly obvious common sense. He wanted to open a chain of retail stores — after the failure of Gateway’s chain had clearly demonstrated that the concept was doomed. He wanted to sell a smartphone that had no keyboard, when physical keys were precisely what had made the BlackBerry the most popular smartphone at the time. Over and over again, he took away our comfy blankets. He took away our floppy drives, our dial-up modems, our camcorder jacks, our non-glossy screens, our Flash, our DVD drives, our removable laptop batteries. How could he do that? You’re supposed to add features, not take them away, Steve! That’s just not done! (Often, I was one of the bellyachers. And often, I’d hear from Mr. Jobs. He’d call me at home, or when I was out to dinner, or when I was vacationing with my family. And he’d berate me for not seeing his bigger picture. On the other hand, sometimes he’d call to praise me for appreciating what he was going for. A C.E.O. calling a reviewer at home? That’s just not done.) Eventually, of course, most people realized that he was just doing that Steve Jobs thing again: being ahead of his time. Eventually, in fact, society adopted a cycle of reaction to Apple that became so predictable, it could have been a “Saturday Night Live” skit. Phase 1: Steve Jobs takes the stage to introduce a new product. Phase 2: The tech bloggers savage it. (“The iPad has no mouse, no keyboard, no GPS, no USB, no card slot, no camera, no Flash!? It’s dead on arrival!”) Phase 3: The product comes out, the public goes nuts for it, the naysayers seem to disappear into the earth. Phase 4: The rest of the industry leaps into high gear trying to do just what Apple did. And so yes, there are other geniuses. There are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. Maybe, once or twice in a million, those skills even coincide in the same person. But will that person also have the vision? The name “Steve Jobs” may appear on 300 patents, but his gift wasn’t invention. It was seeing the promise in some early, clunky technology — and polishing it, refining it and simplifying it until it becomes a standard component. Like the mouse, menus, windows, the CD-ROM or Wi-Fi. Even at Apple, is there anyone with the imagination to pluck brilliant, previously unthinkable visions out of the air — and the conviction to see them through with monomaniacal attention to detail? Suppose there were. Suppose, by some miracle, that some kid in a garage somewhere at this moment possesses the marketing, invention, business and design skills of a Steve Jobs. What are the odds that that same person will be comfortable enough — or maybe uncomfortable enough — to swim upstream, against the currents of social, economic and technological norms, all in pursuit of an unshakable vision? Zero. The odds are zero. Mr. Jobs is gone. Everyone who knew him feels that sorrow. But the ripples of that loss will widen in the days, weeks and years to come: to the people in the industries he changed. To his hundreds of millions of customers. And to the billions of people touched more indirectly by the greater changes that Steve Jobs brought about, even if they’re unaware of it. In 2005, Steve Jobs gave the commencement address to the graduating students at Stanford. He told them the secret that defined him in every action, every decision, every creation of his tragically unfinished life: “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”</text></article>

Some employees said the mood at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., was a combination of sadness and business as usual. “We knew it was coming; it was just a matter of when, not if,” said one employee who declined to be named, citing company policy. “I’m just really happy he was surrounded by his family when it happened.” One former engineer who very recently left Apple to start her own company said she and the current employees she spoke with were shaken up by Mr. Jobs’s death, even though it seemed inevitable. “Everyone is surprised but saying we shouldn’t have been surprised,” said the former employee, who requested anonymity to protect her relationship with the company and her friends there. Mr. Jobs “wouldn’t have resigned if he was just a little ill or just a little tired. Being really sick — that’s the only thing that would make him get away from Apple.” The former employee said she and others also were experiencing a feeling of gratitude. “People are saying they are so happy to have crossed paths with him. They’re also saying, ‘This is a new beginning. It’s somebody else’s time to fly.’” The engineer said there had been a lot of conversation about whether the company would falter or see a drop in creativity. She said the consensus among her contacts was that the culture would remain intact so long as the company retained the talent and creativity that surrounded Mr. Jobs, notably top lieutenants like Jonathan Ive, the company’s design guru. Former Apple employees said they heard from friends at the company that the news of Mr. Jobs’s death had spread internally via social media and news sites. There was word that the company was planning some kind of celebration of Mr. Jobs for employees, but there were few details. Nick Bilton contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/steve-jobs-he-brought-the-show-to-business/?ref=applecomputerinc">Steve Jobs: He Brought the Show to Business<date>October 6, 2011, 2:06 pm</date><text>4:28 p.m. | Updated Much has been and will be written about Steve Jobs’s outsize footprint in digital culture: the screens we stare at, the music files we listen to, the hardware in our pockets. I’d stipulate to all that, but I found myself thinking about his less obvious influence on business and the journalists who cover it. Business has always been important, but until Mr. Jobs arrived, it was rarely accused of being cool. As a young reporter I made a lane change from writing about pop culture and politics to business, and I can remember the look of sympathy from my colleagues and the message that went with it: Good luck in the Land of the Suits. Business, while vital to the civic common, was not thought to be an important part of the stories that we tell each other. It was not always thus. In the 1940s, Henry Luce, using both Time and Fortune, made business seem remarkable, with portraits of the lions of capitalism coursing down the broad avenues of New York in taxis on the way to doing remarkable things that made the hopelessness of the Great Depression seem distant. But as success became routine, it also became institutionalized, with faceless corporations like U.S. Steel and General Motors lording over the smooth running engines of commerce. With the tumult of Vietnam and the battle for civil rights grabbing the headlines, news about business seemed very much beside the point. Business and business news regained luster when the masters of the universe began to lord over Wall Street in the 1980s, but it became obvious to the press, perhaps too slowly, that many of them were simply common thieves with extra zeroes behind their crimes. This was just after Mr. Jobs and Steve Wozniak came storming out of their garage in the late ’70s. They seemed remarkable in a business environment that seemed to belong to men with gray hair and fancy suits hiding their expansive guts, as well as their considerable earnings. As America switched from a country that made things to one that bought them, so much of business began to exist in the abstract, with deeds exchanged and stocks sold. Mr. Jobs did not just move money around. He made things that he promised would change the world, and they often did. The fact that Mr. Jobs and Apple made objects that consumers could touch, and often did, made him someone worth writing about and paying attention to no matter what he did. Steve Jobs was not a suit. He said that taking LSD was one of the formative experiences of his life and had very little interest in consumer research. Beyond that, no one played the press like Mr. Jobs. It had less to do with his black turtleneck than the head for business that floated above it. From the very beginning, he understood that any consumer enterprise had to have a strong element of show business, to create excitement and demand. An Apple launch had less to do with a traditional product rollouts than the magician’s “reveal,” a moment of wonder in which a mystery morphed into an actual product. Yes, sometimes the devices were magical, but all the more so because of how they arrived. In his presentations, his products sometimes literally introduced themselves. In this context, the press was neither enemy nor ally to Mr. Jobs, but just one more tool in the kit. He understood the media’s appetite for what they did not know, and he tantalized them with scarcity and secrecy. Other chief executives would play footsie with reporters, feeding them a little kibble now and then to keep them interested. When Mr. Jobs called a reporter — he called me a few times — it was to argue, compliment or admonish, probing and searching, but all the while giving away nothing fundamentally interesting about the company. Steve Jobs never showed any leg until he was good and ready. Others have tried to duplicate the approach, but over the long haul, theatrics don’t matter unless you deliver. Mr. Jobs was an impresario who came through, time and again, so his shows were always well attended. His well-documented force field extended to other corners of business coverage. Failure was never much of a credential until Mr. Jobs got hold of it. There was the flop of the Lisa computer during his first tour at Apple, the specter of him being forced to walk the plank at his own company, and then the face-planting when he was on his own with NeXT. Those pratfalls would be enough to sink any business executive for good, but Mr. Jobs never bought into things like reputational damage or fatal mistakes. To him, all those events were just inflection points on his way to changing computing, music, telecommunications and publishing. The future vindicated his past — first in his return to Apple and then as a creator and owner of Pixar. His ability to rise from the dead made him scary. No one commanded the respect of the press like Mr. Jobs. I can remember a visit he made to The New York Times when the first iPad came out. The Times is a notoriously blasé place, where heads of state have been known to come and go without raising an eyebrow. But when Mr. Jobs came, the effect was electric. For three days, his advance team swept through our place, attending to every detail and making sure his time there would be seamless and glitch-free. We were all seated when he came in, in part because there were medical reasons for him to avoid grip and grins, but the whole rock star thing was in high effect. And then it was on. No one asks a casual question of Steve Jobs. That’s partly because Steve Jobs loved to argue. One of his great gifts was his ability to deal with geeks, business wonks and media savants on their own terms and often come up on top. Sometimes he did it based on facts; other times, just plain stubbornness. Just as he made the mouse and the disc drive disappear simply by saying it should be so, he prevailed in long-running debates over software and the media business through steady assertion — using all the leverage that his products and online retail presence conveyed. Which brings us back to how he changed business journalism — its image and its attractiveness. Because he was a showman, because he made interesting things that consumers cared about, readers began to follow his products as they might a band or their favorite team. Being an Apple user became a marker of cultural identity and conveyed cool. Some of that splashed onto those who covered business. Now, young reporters with good prospects often start in business coverage, becoming conversant in unit sales, earnings per share, and Ebitda. The best and brightest of them can be found chasing the latest rumor out of Silicon Valley or peering under the hood of the just-hatched start-up. There are a lot of forces in play that make that so, but you’d have to credit Steve Jobs with making business something that did not belong to the suits. Business reporters hated Apple’s secrecy and found Mr. Jobs’s arrogance wearying, but we all knew that our craft picked up some glitz and esteem because of his involvement. Our readers, his consumers, cared about the guy and everything he did. He made business cool by using it to make cool stuff. It was fun to be along for the ride.</text></article>

I was leaning toward a Mac. The person I was dating at the time, who knew a lot more about computers than I did, advised me to get something else. “Apple won’t be around in a year,” he said. I bought a Mac anyway. The relationship ended a few years later, not long before I bought my first iPod. . . .</text></article>

Since that moment, tributes, eulogies and retrospectives have poured over the world like rain. He changed industries, redefined business models, fused technology and art. People are comparing him to Thomas Edison, Walt Disney, Leonardo da Vinci. And they’re saying that it will be a very long time before the world sees the likes of Steve Jobs again. Probably true. But why not, do you suppose? After all, there are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. They’re all over Silicon Valley — all over the world. Many of them, maybe most of them, have studied Steve Jobs, tried to absorb his methods and his philosophy. Surely if they pore over the Steve Jobs playbook long enough, they can re-create some of his success. But nobody ever does, even when they copy Mr. Jobs’s moves down to the last eyebrow twitch. Why not? Here’s a guy who never finished college, never went to business school, never worked for anyone else a day in his adult life. So how did he become the visionary who changed every business he touched? Actually, he’s given us clues all along. Remember the “Think Different” ad campaign he introduced upon his return to Apple in 1997? “Here’s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.” In other words, the story of Steve Jobs boils down to this: Don’t go with the flow. Steve Jobs refused to go with the flow. If he saw something that could be made better, smarter or more beautiful, nothing else mattered. Not internal politics, not economic convention, not social graces. Apple has attained its current astonishing levels of influence and success because it’s nimble. It’s incredibly focused. It’s had stunningly few flops. And that’s because Mr. Jobs didn’t buy into focus groups, groupthink or decision by committee. At its core, Apple existed to execute the visions in his brain. He oversaw every button, every corner, every chime. He lost sleep over the fonts in the menus, the cardboard of the packaging, the color of the power cord. That’s just not how things are done. Often, his laser focus flew in the face of screamingly obvious common sense. He wanted to open a chain of retail stores — after the failure of Gateway’s chain had clearly demonstrated that the concept was doomed. He wanted to sell a smartphone that had no keyboard, when physical keys were precisely what had made the BlackBerry the most popular smartphone at the time. Over and over again, he took away our comfy blankets. He took away our floppy drives, our dial-up modems, our camcorder jacks, our non-glossy screens, our Flash, our DVD drives, our removable laptop batteries. How could he do that? You’re supposed to add features, not take them away, Steve! That’s just not done! (Often, I was one of the bellyachers. And often, I’d hear from Mr. Jobs. He’d call me at home, or when I was out to dinner, or when I was vacationing with my family. And he’d berate me for not seeing his bigger picture. On the other hand, sometimes he’d call to praise me for appreciating what he was going for. A C.E.O. calling a reviewer at home? That’s just not done.) Eventually, of course, most people realized that he was just doing that Steve Jobs thing again: being ahead of his time. Eventually, in fact, society adopted a cycle of reaction to Apple that became so predictable, it could have been a “Saturday Night Live” skit. Phase 1: Steve Jobs takes the stage to introduce a new product. Phase 2: The tech bloggers savage it. (“The iPad has no mouse, no keyboard, no GPS, no USB, no card slot, no camera, no Flash!? It’s dead on arrival!”) Phase 3: The product comes out, the public goes nuts for it, the naysayers seem to disappear into the earth. Phase 4: The rest of the industry leaps into high gear trying to do just what Apple did. And so yes, there are other geniuses. There are other brilliant marketers, designers and business executives. Maybe, once or twice in a million, those skills even coincide in the same person. But will that person also have the vision? The name “Steve Jobs” may appear on 300 patents, but his gift wasn’t invention. It was seeing the promise in some early, clunky technology — and polishing it, refining it and simplifying it until it becomes a standard component. Like the mouse, menus, windows, the CD-ROM or Wi-Fi. Even at Apple, is there anyone with the imagination to pluck brilliant, previously unthinkable visions out of the air — and the conviction to see them through with monomaniacal attention to detail? Suppose there were. Suppose, by some miracle, that some kid in a garage somewhere at this moment possesses the marketing, invention, business and design skills of a Steve Jobs. What are the odds that that same person will be comfortable enough — or maybe uncomfortable enough — to swim upstream, against the currents of social, economic and technological norms, all in pursuit of an unshakable vision? Zero. The odds are zero. Mr. Jobs is gone. Everyone who knew him feels that sorrow. But the ripples of that loss will widen in the days, weeks and years to come: to the people in the industries he changed. To his hundreds of millions of customers. And to the billions of people touched more indirectly by the greater changes that Steve Jobs brought about, even if they’re unaware of it. In 2005, Steve Jobs gave the commencement address to the graduating students at Stanford.

A video of the commencement address that Mr. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple, delivered at Stanford in 2005 drew more than 1.5 million views on YouTube starting shortly after his death was announced Wednesday night and into Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for YouTube said. Already the most viewed graduation speech on YouTube, it now has more than five million views. By noon on Thursday, people had uploaded more than 3,000 videos tagged “Steve Jobs” onto YouTube. In many of the videos, people are solemnly sharing their sadness and reflections about Mr. Jobs. Others are proudly displaying the Apple products they love and use. There were also multiple mash-up videos, where people combined music, video and photos as tributes to Mr. Jobs and the impact his work has had on their lives. At 8 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, shortly after news broke about the death of Mr. Jobs, Twitter counted 6,049 posts per second, making it one of the most discussed news events ever on the micro-blogging platform, exceeding the 5,008 posts per second recorded moments after President Obama announced the death of Osama Bin Laden on May 1. But the volume did not break the record set for conversation last August during the MTV Video Music Awards, when there were 8,868 posts per second recorded, according to a Twitter spokesman. Here’s a link to a collection of Twitter posts gathered Wednesday night from @nytimes users with people sharing their thoughts about Mr. Jobs and the contributions he made to the personal computer world. Crimson Hexagon, a social media analytics firm, counted almost five million posts on Twitter from Wednesday night until 5 p.m. on Thursday. Its analysis showed there were more than seven million posts from the time that Mr. Obama made the Bin Laden announcement on a Sunday night through the following day. To show how the conversation spiked about Mr. Jobs, there were 50,016 mentions of him on Wednesday, rising to more than 879,000 on Thursday, which was the single largest volume of conversation about him since he resigned as Apple’s chief executive, according to General Sentiment, another firm specializing in social media analytics. On Facebook, some people changed their profile picture to the Apple logo as a tribute. Others found their way to this official Steve Jobs Facebook page that now has more than one million fans with more 7,000 people posting comments and sharing items on the wall. Many memorial pages were created for Mr. Jobs on Facebook and what appeared to be a record number of people were sharing news links and making tributes. But at least one company took advantage of the occasion. People who clicked through one “R.I.P. Steve Jobs” link on Facebook found themselves victims of a scam as a company promising to give away free iPods and iPads used it as a way to automatically direct users to a survey site.</text></article>

It’s a pattern at Apple, and the iPhone 4S — despite disappointment from some — fits right into it. Look back at Apple products and you see this pattern at work. The first iMac was a colorful, one-box machine that was released in 1998. By 2002, the iMac had changed — radically. It became a flat-screen model that was attached to its semicircular base by an articulated arm. But in 2004, a new design surfaces. As opposed to the slightly ungainly combination of screen and base, the iMac turns into a minimalist white panel. Watch this space, because it’s not going to change very much. In 2006, the iMac trades in its white polycarbonate shell for a sleeker aluminum one. And over the years that follow, screws are tightened, millimeters are halved, but the overall design stays more or less the same. The real improvements are all inside the box, in the form of faster processors and new connection ports, among other things. Take a look at Apple’s portable computers and the change is even slower — the current line of MacBooks hasn’t changed significantly in design in nearly six years. It would appear that once Jonathan Ive, Apple’s chief designer, and his merry band settle on something they like, they don’t go changing for the sake of change. Which makes sense if you’ve ever heard Mr. Ive speak about design. His approach is a modern application of Dieter Rams’s “10 Principles of Good Design,” which was employed while Mr. Rams was at Braun, a design leader in the 1970s and ’80s. It is Mr. Rams’s last principle that one imagines Mr. Ive has posted on a wall somewhere in Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.: Good design is as little design as possible — Less, but better — because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with nonessentials. Back to purity, back to simplicity. The iPhone 4S is not a misstep — it fits right in with what Apple does.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/technology/samsung-to-seek-block-on-iphone-in-europe.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Samsung Wants Courts in 2 Nations to Bar iPhone<date>Published: October 5, 2011</date><text>SEOUL, South Korea — Samsung Electronics said on Wednesday that it would seek to block the sale of Apple’s iPhone 4S in France and Italy, asserting that the phone violated its patents. In seeking a court order against its rival in the two large European markets, Samsung indicated a more aggressive stance in its expanding patent battle with Apple. Samsung said each of its injunction requests would cite two patent infringements related to wireless telecommunications technology, specifically the wide-band code-division multiple access standards for mobile handsets, or WCDMA. Samsung planned to file for preliminary injunctions in other countries after further review, the company said without elaborating. “The infringed technology is essential to the reliable functioning of telecom networks and devices,” Samsung said in a statement. “Apple has continued to flagrantly violate our intellectual property rights and free-ride on our technology, and we will steadfastly protect our intellectual property.” Comment from Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., was not immediately available. The two companies are locked in about 20 legal disputes over patents in nine countries, including Australia, Britain, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States. The fight began when Apple sued Samsung in April in the United States, asserting that the Samsung Galaxy lineup of smartphones and tablet devices “slavishly” copied the design, user interface and packaging of the iPhone and iPad. Samsung has responded with its own lawsuits accusing Apple of violating its intellectual property. In recent weeks, Samsung officials have said they will become bolder in their fight with Apple, though the company is one of the top customers for Samsung components. Samsung’s action came after Apple’s legal actions hurt the South Korean company’s sales. Last month, a German court ruled that Samsung could not sell its new Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet directly in Germany, Europe’s largest market, saying the design too closely resembled that of Apple’s iPad 2. On Tuesday, Apple turned down an offer from Samsung to settle their patent dispute in Australia, which has kept the Galaxy Tab 10.1 off store shelves in that country. Separately, a court in the Netherlands barred Samsung from selling three smartphones that rival the iPhone. Samsung is appealing the decision. Apple and Samsung are not only competitors in the fast-growing global market for smartphones and tablet computers; they also have a close buyer-supplier relationship. Samsung, the world’s biggest maker of memory chips and flat-panel screens, supplies some of the important components in Apple products. Lee Soon-hak, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities in Seoul, said that by initiating legal action in France and Italy, Samsung had done its homework on where it had the best chance of winning a case against Apple with a significant market effect on its rival. But he said the two companies might be seeking to settle their dispute. “I don’t think Apple wants to prolong this battle forever,” he said. “At the same time, Samsung will also want a compromise.” In June, the Finnish cellphone maker Nokia settled a two-year global patent fight with Apple over smartphone technology through a licensing agreement that would commit Apple to a one-time payment and regular royalties. Samsung’s action came on the same day that Asian smartphone makers were encouraged by the new iPhone 4S, which failed to whip up as much market enthusiasm as its predecessors. Shares of Samsung Electronics, HTC and LG Electronics, all of which make phones using the Google Android operating system, jumped Wednesday. Samsung was ranked No. 2 globally in smartphones, behind Apple, in the second quarter of this year. In overall mobile phone sales, Samsung ranks second behind Nokia.</text></article>

Jobs and Eric E. Schmidt at a 2006 Macworld conference in San Francisco, when a partnership to provide Google software on an Apple iPhone was announced. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google and a longtime friend and competitor of Steve Jobs, says Mr. Jobs’s influence may yet be seen in new ways. “This is a man whose impact is equal to any global leader,” he said. “He very much wanted to live and have a third act” beyond Apple’s founding and its revival. As for whether that impact may grow through the wealth he leaves behind, Mr. Schmidt said, “it is not for me to characterize” what will happen with Mr. Jobs’s fortune. “All of that will unfold,” he added. “I will say that he was a very thoughtful person, and he cared a lot about the world.” Mr. Schmidt knew Mr. Jobs for decades and did business with him while Mr. Schmidt was at Sun Microsystems and Mr. Jobs was starting the computer company NeXT. He was also a member of Apple’s board from 2006 to 2009. “The NeXT thing was really important” in Mr. Jobs’s life, Mr. Schmidt said. “It helped him think in whole new ways, how to lead and innovate.” NeXT was purchased by Apple in 1996, bringing Mr. Jobs back into Apple after his dismissal in 1985. While an Apple board member, Mr. Schmidt said, he had extensive dealings with Tim Cook, now Apple’s chief executive. “The culture of this company is strong, and it will continue,” he said. “Tim was an extremely good operational executive, and he will move to preserve the culture.” “He is not an ordinary executive,” Mr. Schmidt added. Mr. Schmidt left Apple’s board when Google’s entry into both mobile communications and computers — with, respectively, the Android and Chrome operating systems — presented numerous business conflicts between the two companies. “I learned an attention to style and quality” while sitting on Apple’s board, he said. “The board would see a lot of demos. Steve had a real level of pride in what they were producing.” Since that time, there have been reports in The Times and elsewhere of open discord between the two men and their companies. Mr. Schmidt, however, denied any such personal enmity. “We understood it was a possibility when I joined the board,” he said of the business conflicts. “We had adult conversations about it at the beginning and the end. “All those reports in the press were wrong,” he added. “After I left the board, they had me to events and to private dinners.”</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/a-tribute-with-iphones/?ref=applecomputerinc">A Tribute, With iPhones<date>October 6, 2011, 2:39 am</date><text>At 9 p.m. on Wednesday in San Francisco, a few dozen start-up entrepreneurs, Apple employees and iPhone fans gathered in Dolores Park, the four-square-block park in the middle of the city’s Mission district, home to hipsters and artists tethered to their MacBooks and iPhones. They were there for an iPhone vigil, advertised on Dolores Park’s Facebook page and organized by a group of tech people. “In memory of Steve Jobs, an iPhone vigil will be held tonight,” the Facebook page said. “Come, turn up your brightness, and remember, together.” “Consider it a celebration of innovation rather than of any one man.” Most of the mourners, almost all men, were quiet, holding iPhones and a couple of iPads. Most seemed to be reading on their phones, but a few waved them in the air, with Apple’s home page, showing simply a photo of Steve Jobs and the dates 1955-2011, filling the screen. Later they broke into groups, mostly talking about why they were upset, the legacy Mr. Jobs left and the way he and his products changed their lives. Dave Black, 43, founder of Thingsly, a Web site for making connections between things, worked at Apple for 11 years until last January, first as an engineer and then in education marketing. He said: “I’m still scared to talk to the press after 11 years of indoctrination.” “My entire career was defined by all the innovation that Steve Jobs created, from the PC I first wrote little apps on to NeXT. All the components collided in the late ’90s for someone who wasn’t sure if he was an engineer or designer. He created a world for people like me.” “It’s that last 1 percent that he talks about. In that last 1 percent is when things come to life, his products took on a whole new quality.” Jason Wong, 35, founder of ReReply, a start-up for detecting issues on social media, said: “His entire story is that of entrepreneurship and passion and that’s what gets you up in the morning, and you can only hope to be half the entrepreneur he was.” Judy Hu, 33, director at a nonprofit, said: “I was devastated and shocked. I didn’t think I would be. But he’s influenced all of our lives every second. I called my first iPod iHappy. He is emblematic of a generation.” Joe Edelman, 35, works for a start-up called Citizen Logistics. He was part of a group that went to the Apple store as soon as they heard the news, then to the park vigil. “We’ve been talking all night about what is it we want to hold up as a value in our own lives.” Mr. Edelman described what it was for him: “He was one guy who stuck to a utopian vision his whole life — a platform that helps people be creative, and worked on that a long time. A lot of repeat entrepreneurs pivot to what the market wants. It’s something a lot of us in the Bay Area can use more of — that utopian vision.” Tristan Harris, 27, with a start-up called Apture, said he was a former Apple employee. He said Mr. Jobs’s legacy was either the message of the Stanford speech — “stay hungry, stay foolish” — or that “the company exemplifies the best design, holding itself to a higher standard.” Alex Peake, 29, was dressed all in black, with a long trench coat. The founder of Primer Labs, he was working on a game called Code Hero featuring characters like Apple cofounders Mr. Jobs and Steve Wozniak teaching people to write code. “We’ve all started Internet companies using the technology Steve gave us,” he said, “and we all want to give back. Going for things that will change the world, not what’s hot in Silicon Valley right now — that’s what Apple gave us. “What’s so hard about this is Steve Jobs’s Mac is my third parent. This is so hard because I’m reliving all the memories of my first Mac. It changed my life. People ask, have I met him? No. I saw him at a developers’ conference once 100 feet away. But he made you feel like you could do it.”</text></article>

There was clearly some disappointment after Apple’s iPhone 4S announcement Tuesday. Twitter was awash with despondent Apple fans who had expected an iPhone 5.   Investors seemed just as crestfallen. Apple’s stock fell sharply during the speech. (It bounced back a bit by the close of trading.) Many people had hoped the company would showcase a new phone, specifically called the iPhone 5, that would come with newly designed hardware. It was like the child who convinces himself there will be a pony waiting for him under the Christmas tree even though no one promised one or even suggested such a gift existed. Instead, Apple announced a device that on the outside, looks exactly like the iPhone 4. Although it would have been nice to see some new iPhone design, just for the sake of metamorphosis, it’s what’s inside that counts. The new iPhone features make it a different phone than its predecessor, the iPhone 4.  Siri, the personal assistant software that will only work with the iPhone 4S, is the closest thing to artificial intelligence that I’ve seen on a phone to date. You can ask Siri to remind you to call someone when you leave the office, find a reservation for a restaurant and text message or call people by name. It can also give you directions based on locations, play music, look up facts and set up meetings with people. The iPhone 4S camera will also be a big draw for many. With an 8-megapixel camera packed into the phone, people won’t feel the need to carry around their point-and-shoot camera. And Apple promises the download speeds on the iPhone 4S have doubled the download speeds when connecting to the Internet. A letdown, after months of hype that Apple doesn’t feed, but doesn’t quell either, isn’t unusual with Apple product introductions. It happened after several phone iterations and even with the iPad. (Remember the antenna that was to doom the company or the misnaming of the tablet?) All those devices have gone on to sell extremely well. So as people start asking me if I’m disappointed, I have to remind them there still was a shiny new firetruck under the tree there Tuesday morning.</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/siri-and-apples-future/?ref=applecomputerinc">Siri and Apple's Future<date>October 5, 2011, 5:59 pm</date><text>Not enough hardware eye candy. That was the undertone of disappointment that surrounded the introduction of Apple‘s new iPhone on Tuesday. But look beyond that to something really significant: Siri, the personal assistant application that Apple also showed off. Siri matters for two reasons. First, it represents the future of Apple as a business. Second, Siri potentially is the future of what is now called search. Apple, no doubt, will continue to design great hardware. But its profit margins from selling devices will most likely erode. It’s an iron law of computing: hardware becomes commoditized, and the only question is how quickly. So Apple is broadening its reach by offering iPhones in a wider price range, including the 3GS free with a two-year contract, and adding more carriers, like Sprint. Thus the iPhone becomes a larger — and yes, stylish — delivery vehicle for software and services, like Siri. “In the long term, the best strategy for Apple will be to get more and more of its revenue and profit from its software and services platform,” said Michael Cusumano, a professor at M.I.T.‘s Sloan School of Management. Siri, put simply, listens to voice commands, searches the Web and online services, and delivers answers. Even today, it is an impressive technology, and one that was nurtured for years by America’s tax dollars — it originated as a program in the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Siri is an evolving artificial intelligence application for things like making restaurant reservations and answering simple questions. And it has been impressing technologists long before Apple bought it last year. My colleague John Markoff and I described Siri as one example of advances in artificial intelligence in an article we wrote last year, before Apple bought the company. If mobile computing is the future, as everyone says, then Siri or something like it is going to be crucial. Typing in commands and conventional search are limited on smartphones. When Microsoft talks about making Bing a “decision engine,” something like Siri is what it has in mind. And Google, of course, is aggressively pursuing the same goal; it is the larger Android vision. For Apple, Siri opens the door to getting into the search business in the future. And the way it makes money need not be in click-throughs on intrusive ads. That’s the old business model. The new model may well be sharing transaction revenues on all kinds of online commerce, for example. We’ll see how things play out, but Siri says a lot about where Apple is headed. .</text></article>

    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/technology/apple-introduces-a-new-iphone-with-a-personal-assistant.html?ref=applecomputerinc">IPhone 4S Gets More Power, a Better Camera and Siri<date>Published: October 4, 2011</date><text>CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple introduced its long-awaited new iPhone on Tuesday. But it wasn’t an iPhone 5. That will have to wait.Instead, the company unveiled something that looks an awful lot like an iPhone 4 on the outside, with an innovative feature that turns the device into a voice-activated mobile assistant for scheduling appointments and performing other tasks. It’s a measure of how Apple has habituated its legions of fans to regular, eye-catching design changes that the news about the latest version of the iPhone qualified as a disappointment for some. Grumbling about the announcement of the new phone, the iPhone 4S, spread on Twitter throughout the day and the company’s shares fell as much as 5 percent, though they regained most of those losses by the end of trading. “At the end of the day, there are still going to be long lines for this,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “They could have been even longer if they’d changed the hardware more.” The new model of the iPhone, which will go on sale Oct. 14, with preorders starting Friday, is virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor on the outside. But beneath its skin Apple made big changes, packing it with a better camera that shoots crisper pictures and video. The device also includes a more powerful chip, the A5, the same microprocessor that is the brains of the iPad, for producing better graphics and other improvements. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, presided over the event just as Steven P. Jobs had on similar occasions before he left the top job in August. Mr. Cook said that although the iPhone 4 is the best-selling smartphone in the world, Apple believes that the company still has plenty of people it wants to convert. “We believe over time all handsets become smartphones,” he said. “This market is 1.5 billion units annually. It’s an enormous opportunity for Apple.” Mr. Cook and other Apple executives also highlighted an array of supporting products for the new phone, but the centerpiece of the presentation, and of the new device, is the “virtual assistant” feature, Siri, named after a company Apple acquired last year that originally developed the technology. While the iPhone 4 already responds to some basic voice commands — to make phone calls, for example — Siri is designed to comprehend a much broader range of instructions in natural language. For example, Apple executives demonstrated the technology by asking an iPhone, “Do I need a raincoat today?” to which the device responded, “It sure looks like rain today.” While Apple’s decision not to call its new phone the iPhone 5, as many expected, raised some eyebrows, it has some precedent. A couple of years ago the company introduced the iPhone 3GS, which made modest improvements over the iPhone 3G. Michael Mace, the chief executive of a mobile application start-up and a former Apple and Palm executive, said Apple most likely wanted to telegraph that the iPhone 4S was an incremental change to the product, rather than a big redesign denoted by a change in the model number. “You don’t want to oversell what you’re doing so you hurt your credibility,” Mr. Mace said. Even incremental changes to the iPhone can help sales. Mr. Munster of Piper Jaffray said the annual growth rate in the number of iPhones that Apple sold during the fiscal year the iPhone 3GS was introduced was 93 percent, compared with 78 percent when the iPhone 3G came out. With the new phone, Apple is taking on a growing challenge in the mobile market from the Android operating system made by Google. Smartphones powered by Android now outsell iPhones by more than two to one. While Android phones also let people use basic voice commands to do simple tasks, Apple is betting that the more sophisticated capabilities of Siri will make it stand out. Many of the best minds in technology in the last several decades have been stymied by how to decipher speech, given variations in how people talk. Mr. Mace called what Apple is doing the “holy grail” for mobile devices; voice recognition could make it much easier for people to use them on the go without having to peck words into a keyboard. But he said the technology needed to be accurate or users would ignore it. “When you start talking to a computer you expect it to really understand you, and if it doesn’t, you get really frustrated,” he said. “If Siri is like that, forget about it.” 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 4, 2011 An earlier version of this article misstated the previous price of the iPhone 3GS.

That philosophical observation applies to proposals for a big American debt jubilee that are now doing the rounds. The basic idea is to slash consumer debt, which is an admirable aim for an overleveraged nation. Household debt is still 90 percent of gross domestic product, down only modestly from the 2008 peak of 100 percent. But even bank-haters should recognize that this cure might be worse than the disease.To start, writing off debts would not necessarily increase economic growth. Every liability is also an asset, so while a dollar that is no longer required for debt repayment might add some cents to consumer spending, it is also a dollar cut out of a bank’s capital or of an investor’s net worth — subtracting from resources and confidence. And write-offs big enough to change consumer behavior would probably be big enough to destabilize banks. The Federal Reserve or the government would need to help, presumably by injecting newly printed money as capital. Such government control is usually inefficient, and abundant printing of money increases the risk of uncontrolled inflation, which has its own way of making people feel poorer. The issue of moral hazard also cannot be ignored. Much of the excess debt was incurred through irresponsible mortgage refinancing, which peaked in 2006 at $322 billion, representing 2.4 percent of G.D.P. The reckless use of houses as A.T.M.’s was a major factor in decapitalizing and destabilizing the American economy. Forgiving such debts will teach the wrong lesson: borrow in haste, repent never. Finally, investors would rightly see a jubilee as an attack on property rights. That runs the risk of throwing markets into disarray and discouraging foreign investors from buying assets in the United States. Risk premiums on both debt and equity capital would increase. There are better ways to deleverage. Higher inflation does the job more naturally, without invidious choices about whose debt got reduced. But inflation also discourages savers, weakening capital formation. The best way to get debts under control is the hard slog of paying some back and writing the rest off. Sound money, including interest rates above inflation, would help by preserving existing capital and promoting savings. After all, capital creation, not its destruction through debt forgiveness, is what makes capitalism work. Apple’s New Victims Apple has an astonishing ability to casually unleash creative destruction. Its latest iPhone, the 4S, offers faster data processing and downloads as well as voice-powered software. The phone, released Tuesday, may not have lived up to the most feverish expectations of investors. Apple shares fell while the market rallied. But it will do more than enough to create headaches for companies ranging from Research in Motion to American Greetings. Smartphones started by devouring the personal digital assistant, as any former Palm Pilot aficionado can testify. Wristwatch sales declined. They terrorized the market for fixed-line phones, which are now in sharp decline. Apple’s newest gadget shows just how hungry smartphone makers, and Apple in particular, are to eat the lunches of all sorts of rivals. For instance, the new iPhone offers an improved video camera. That will further hurt sales of digital still and video cameras. Its software allows easy and free texting to other Apple devices. That’s bad news for telephone operators, who make fat margins on such services. Instant messaging has also been the killer app for BlackBerry users. Apple also unveiled a function that lets users digitally create their own greeting cards and send them in physical form. That may not excite Apple’s most ardent fans, but it was enough to send shares of the card makers American Greetings and the British company International Greetings reeling. Oh, and the new iPod Nano allows runners to track their performance, which will take a chunk out of the market for personal fitness monitors and shoes with sensors. In a sense, though, these are the easily quantifiable effects of the new iPhone. The device also comes with software allowing users to search the Internet, answer queries, take dictation or set up phone commands using their voice. It’s hard to judge how effective this software is until the 4S hits the shelves. But investors on the lookout for Apple’s creative/destructive impact should be drawing up a new list of victims.

There was clearly some disappointment after Apple’s iPhone 4S announcement Tuesday. Twitter was awash with despondent Apple fans who had expected an iPhone 5.   Investors seemed just as crestfallen. Apple’s stock fell sharply during the speech. (It bounced back a bit by the close of trading.) Many people had hoped the company would showcase a new phone, specifically called the iPhone 5, that would come with newly designed hardware. It was like the child who convinces himself there will be a pony waiting for him under the Christmas tree even though no one promised one or even suggested such a gift existed. Instead, Apple announced a device that on the outside, looks exactly like the iPhone 4. Although it would have been nice to see some new iPhone design, just for the sake of metamorphosis, it’s what’s inside that counts. The new iPhone features make it a different phone than its predecessor, the iPhone 4.  Siri, the personal assistant software that will only work with the iPhone 4S, is the closest thing to artificial intelligence that I’ve seen on a phone to date. You can ask Siri to remind you to call someone when you leave the office, find a reservation for a restaurant and text message or call people by name. It can also give you directions based on locations, play music, look up facts and set up meetings with people. The iPhone 4S camera will also be a big draw for many. With an 8-megapixel camera packed into the phone, people won’t feel the need to carry around their point-and-shoot camera. And Apple promises the download speeds on the iPhone 4S have doubled the download speeds when connecting to the Internet. A letdown, after months of hype that Apple doesn’t feed, but doesn’t quell either, isn’t unusual with Apple product introductions. It happened after several phone iterations and even with the iPad. (Remember the antenna that was to doom the company or the misnaming of the tablet?) All those devices have gone on to sell extremely well. So as people start asking me if I’m disappointed, I have to remind them there still was a shiny new firetruck under the tree there Tuesday morning.</text></article>

That was the undertone of disappointment that surrounded the introduction of Apple‘s new iPhone on Tuesday. But look beyond that to something really significant: Siri, the personal assistant application that Apple also showed off. Siri matters for two reasons. First, it represents the future of Apple as a business. Second, Siri potentially is the future of what is now called search. Apple, no doubt, will continue to design great hardware. But its profit margins from selling devices will most likely erode. It’s an iron law of computing: hardware becomes commoditized, and the only question is how quickly. So Apple is broadening its reach by offering iPhones in a wider price range, including the 3GS free with a two-year contract, and adding more carriers, like Sprint. Thus the iPhone becomes a larger — and yes, stylish — delivery vehicle for software and services, like Siri. “In the long term, the best strategy for Apple will be to get more and more of its revenue and profit from its software and services platform,” said Michael Cusumano, a professor at M.I.T.‘s Sloan School of Management. Siri, put simply, listens to voice commands, searches the Web and online services, and delivers answers. Even today, it is an impressive technology, and one that was nurtured for years by America’s tax dollars — it originated as a program in the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Siri is an evolving artificial intelligence application for things like making restaurant reservations and answering simple questions. And it has been impressing technologists long before Apple bought it last year. My colleague John Markoff and I described Siri as one example of advances in artificial intelligence in an article we wrote last year, before Apple bought the company. If mobile computing is the future, as everyone says, then Siri or something like it is going to be crucial. Typing in commands and conventional search are limited on smartphones. When Microsoft talks about making Bing a “decision engine,” something like Siri is what it has in mind. And Google, of course, is aggressively pursuing the same goal; it is the larger Android vision. For Apple, Siri opens the door to getting into the search business in the future. And the way it makes money need not be in click-throughs on intrusive ads. That’s the old business model. The new model may well be sharing transaction revenues on all kinds of online commerce, for example. We’ll see how things play out, but Siri says a lot about where Apple is headed. .</text></article>

But it wasn’t an iPhone 5. That will have to wait.Instead, the company unveiled something that looks an awful lot like an iPhone 4 on the outside, with an innovative feature that turns the device into a voice-activated mobile assistant for scheduling appointments and performing other tasks. It’s a measure of how Apple has habituated its legions of fans to regular, eye-catching design changes that the news about the latest version of the iPhone qualified as a disappointment for some. Grumbling about the announcement of the new phone, the iPhone 4S, spread on Twitter throughout the day and the company’s shares fell as much as 5 percent, though they regained most of those losses by the end of trading. “At the end of the day, there are still going to be long lines for this,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “They could have been even longer if they’d changed the hardware more.” The new model of the iPhone, which will go on sale Oct. 14, with preorders starting Friday, is virtually indistinguishable from its predecessor on the outside. But beneath its skin Apple made big changes, packing it with a better camera that shoots crisper pictures and video. The device also includes a more powerful chip, the A5, the same microprocessor that is the brains of the iPad, for producing better graphics and other improvements. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, presided over the event just as Steven P. Jobs had on similar occasions before he left the top job in August. Mr. Cook said that although the iPhone 4 is the best-selling smartphone in the world, Apple believes that the company still has plenty of people it wants to convert. “We believe over time all handsets become smartphones,” he said. “This market is 1.5 billion units annually. It’s an enormous opportunity for Apple.” Mr. Cook and other Apple executives also highlighted an array of supporting products for the new phone, but the centerpiece of the presentation, and of the new device, is the “virtual assistant” feature, Siri, named after a company Apple acquired last year that originally developed the technology. While the iPhone 4 already responds to some basic voice commands — to make phone calls, for example — Siri is designed to comprehend a much broader range of instructions in natural language. For example, Apple executives demonstrated the technology by asking an iPhone, “Do I need a raincoat today?” to which the device responded, “It sure looks like rain today.” While Apple’s decision not to call its new phone the iPhone 5, as many expected, raised some eyebrows, it has some precedent.

Sell, Sell, Sell<date>October 5, 2011, 7:03 pm</date><text>GazelleOnline marketplaces are buying used iPhones in record numbers. So you want an iPhone 4S? Do I have a deal for you. Online marketplaces are breaking records in buying used smartphones as customers clamor to get ready for the next iteration of the iPhone. Gazelle, an online marketplace that buys and sells used electronics, said Wednesday that it purchased more than 5,000 iPhones from customers in the hours after the iPhone 4S announcement. At the peak, Gazelle was buying a used iPhone every 6 seconds, said Anthony Scarsella, chief gadget officer at Gazelle. The company is buying 32-gigabyte AT&amp;T iPhones in good condition for approximately $200. The iPhone 3GS is selling for about $148. “We were not expecting this kind of behavior; it’s really unprecedented for us,” Mr. Scarsella said, noting that Tuesday was the company’s most successful sales day ever. “We estimate that the sale of iPhones will stay this strong for about 60 days, based on what we saw last year when the iPhone 4 was introduced.” EBay said the Instant Sale section of its Web site had also experienced a big jump in smartphone resales. A company spokesman said in an e-mail that “more than 50,000 smartphone trade-in offers were generated” on Tuesday alone. Of the iPhones sold Tuesday through eBay, the company said 65 percent were iPhone 4s and 30 percent were iPhone 3GSs. Gazelle said it had also seen a 50 percent increase in the sale of Android phones and a 100 percent increase in BlackBerry resales. “A lot of people who are selling their BlackBerry and Android devices are on the Sprint network and are selling because they now have the opportunity to get an iPhone on this carrier,” Mr. Scarsella said. So where do all these poor, rejected iPhones go? Mr. Scarsella said the majority of used iPhones are “sold in bulk to gadget dealers domestically and internationally.” If you plan on selling your old smartphone you should probably act quickly. Mr. Scarsella said that the higher sale prices for used iPhones will most likely continue for the next 60 days, based on patterns the company has observed from previous new Apple products.</text></article>

Jobs of Apple, who died of cancer on Wednesday, was a visionary who made the technology company he co-founded one of the world’s biggest. In a brief statement late on Wednesday, Apple’s directors said: “Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.” (The company also has a memorial section to its longtime leader on its Web site.)

His return to the company in 1997 sparked the resurrection of Apple, transforming it from a collapsing computer maker into the envy of the tech world, its products nearly always in insatiable demand. But Apple has extended its influence far beyond its own gadgets, having helped usher in a new era of digital music and movies and a renewed focus on the way consumer products look and feel. DealBook has written about Mr. Jobs and his tenure many times over the years, most recently when he stepped down as Apple’s chief executive in August. Then, we evaluated his history as a deal maker, noting his relatively sparse record of acquisitions. Mr. Jobs and Apple were selective in their acquisitions, choosing targets that could provide crucial new features for the company’s signature products. The $200 million purchase of Siri last year led to the top feature of the new iPhone 4S, a voice-controlled digital personal assistant that has won high praise. Nevertheless, under Mr. Jobs Apple accumulated an enormous war chest — currently more than $76 billion — one that has often prompted speculation about what the company could buy. Mr. Jobs’s outsize presence did not stop at Apple. He was also a director at the Walt Disney Company, by dint of his significant holdings in the media conglomerate. He came about his stake through perhaps the biggest deal of his career, selling the animation company Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion.

It is the future model looked to by struggling record labels and the foundation of big-thinking start-up companies that, by at least one count, have raised more than $400 million in investment so far this year. But when Steven P. Jobs began to put together the plan for Apple’s iTunes music store, which opened in 2003, the major powers in the music industry looked at digital music as a losing game. Napster, which opened in 1999, unleashed the menace of piracy that still ravages the business, and the alternatives licensed by the major labels had limited catalogs and set awkward restrictions on users. The major labels sued ordinary fans who downloaded music without authorization, a move that may have temporarily scared some people into acquiring music legitimately but proved to be a disastrous public relations move. Mr. Jobs has been worshiped and feared in the music industry ever since because of the way he broke through its institutional resistance and got the record companies and music publishers to license their songs to iTunes. “Steve Jobs came into the music industry at a time when the incumbents had given up on their own fans,” said Eric Garland, chief executive of the media tracking firm BigChampagne. “Virtually all the leaders in the industry retrenched and began to focus on a scheme of locks and braces on music. Steve Jobs recognized that people on the Internet were not thieves. They were fans – rabid fans.” Stories about Mr. Jobs’s efforts to persuade the leaders of the industry to his side are legion. He remained stubbornly, victoriously inflexible about matters like pricing. He personally demonstrated iTunes to figures like Bono of U2 and Jimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope Geffen A&amp;M, wowing them in much the same way he did crowds of software developers, journalists and consumers at the company’s regular product introductions. For years he doggedly pursued the Beatles, one of the last major holdouts to digital music, and last November finally closed the deal with the band’s company, Apple Corps, and its label, EMI. The Beatles sold 5 million songs in the first two months on iTunes. When the iTunes store opened, the music industry’s revenue from digital sales was negligible, but by last year it had grown to $4.6 billion around the world, representing 29 percent of all revenue from recorded music. This week at Apple’s unveiling of the iPhone 4S, it noted that the store has sold 16 billion songs in its eight and a half years operation. And iTunes remains the only place where you can download Beatles songs. Mr. Jobs’s relationship with the industry was complicated by competing forces — the wariness it held for what he might do to the business model, and the admiration it had for his vision. “Today, the music business has a complex relationship with Apple, which has become yet another entity that built an enormous business atop the rights of music companies, much like radio and MTV before it,” Bill Werde, editorial director at Billboard, said in a statement. “But I think you’d be hard-pressed to find one music executive worth his or her salt who wouldn’t agree that Jobs’ vision and tenacity blazed a trail for digital music as we know it today. Without a doubt, when you think of the Mount Rushmore of the music business – pioneers like Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler, Clive Davis and Jimmy Iovine – Steve Jobs has earned his prominent place.”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/will-siri-bring-back-the-iphones-wow-factor/?ref=applecomputerinc">Will Siri Bring Back the iPhone's Wow Factor?<date>October 5, 2011, 5:02 pm</date><text>screenshot via Apple.com Do you remember the first time you saw the iPhone? Chances are someone was showing off an application — perhaps using Shazam to identify a song or shaking his phone to serve up restaurant recommendations on UrbanSpoon. Those novel and quirky apps, and many more, have helped Apple sell hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPod Touches and iPads around the globe. Now, here’s another question. When is the last time someone showed off an app to you? Apple has long cultivated a devoted following of fans who are obsessed with its products. But as Google and its Android operating system nip at the company’s heels, it becomes ever more crucial that Apple still be able to dazzle consumers — and a new hardware design may no longer be sufficient. Siri, analysts say, may be the answer. Siri acts as a virtual personal assistant that uses a combination of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to perform tasks like scheduling appointments and helping users figure out whether or not they need an umbrella. If it’s as impressive as early reports seem to suggest, it could be the feature of the otherwise fairly predictable iPhone 4S that, when experienced firsthand, will help the phone gain a solid footing among consumers whose attention and eyes might otherwise drift to a Google-powered phone. “The software enhancements are becoming more and more critical because we’ve ultimately settled on the current form factor,” said Roger Entner, founder and analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s a slab of glass with a little bit of plastic around it. How much can you innovate on that?” Siri, he said, “transforms how you interact with your phone, and that is a huge differentiator for Apple.” Voice recognition technology certainly isn’t new, and neither are virtual personal assistants. Siri was available as a stand-alone app before Apple acquired it last year. But the full integration into a phone’s operating system, where the software can start to learn about the daily habits of a user, could help recreate the early wonder of playing with an iPhone. It could even have a trickle-down impact on the entire phone ecosystem — much as the App Store did. “The other phones will now look dumb if they don’t have an assistant, too,” said Mr. Entner.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/jobs-biography-is-highly-anticipated/?ref=applecomputerinc">Jobs Biography Is Highly Anticipated<date>October 5, 2011, 9:49 pm</date><text>For months, a biography of Steven P. Jobs has been one of the most highly anticipated books of the year. Mr. Jobs’s death on Wednesday will only intensify interest in the book, which was written by Walter Isaacson, the author of biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. Mr. Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, cooperated with Mr. Isaacson in the book about his life, agreeing to more than 40 interviews over two years. Mr. Isaacson, the chief executive of the Aspen Institute, also conducted interviews with Mr. Jobs’s family members and colleagues at Apple. The book was first announced by Simon &amp; Schuster in April, bearing the title “iSteve: The Book of Jobs,” and scheduled for a spring 2012 publication. Simon &amp; Schuster later moved up the release date to Nov. 21 of this year and changed the title to the simpler “Steve Jobs.” The publisher has said that Mr. Jobs did not ask for control over the content of the book, and that Mr. Jobs spoke “candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against.” On Thursday evening, the book was ranked No. 384 on Amazon.com, thanks to early orders. Many admiring biographies of Mr. Jobs – and some not so admiring – have been published in the last several decades. In 2005, John Wiley &amp; Sons released “iCon Steve Jobs” by Jeffrey S. Young, a book that spurred Apple to banish all titles by the publisher from its retail stores. Michael Moritz gave an account of Apple’s early years in “The Little Kingdom,” originally released in November 1984 and reissued in 2009.</text></article>

Jobs, the visionary co-founder and former chief executive of Apple, who has died at 56. 11:55 P.M. |More Tributes, Including a will.i.am Tweet Erin Lubin/Bloomberg News The condolences span the many industries that Steve Jobs touched through Apple, including simple billionaires like Warren Buffett, who was quoted by CNBC as saying: “He was one of the most remarkable business managers and innovators in american business history.” Google spoke through each of its leaders. Sergey Brin posted on Google Plus, his reaction: From the earliest days of Google, whenever Larry and I sought inspiration for vision and leadership, we needed to look no farther than Cupertino. Steve, your passion for excellence is felt by anyone who has ever touched an Apple product (including the macbook I am writing this on right now). And I have witnessed it in person the few times we have met. On behalf of all of us at Google and more broadly in technology, you will be missed very much. My condolences to family, friends, and colleagues at Apple.” Notably, the Google home page included a link to Apple’s memorial page. The president of the Walt Disney Company, Bob Iger, issued a statement: “Steve Jobs was a great friend as well as a trusted advisor. His legacy will extend far beyond the products he created or the businesses he built. It will be the millions of people he inspired, the lives he changed, and the culture he defined. Steve was such an ‘original,’ with a thoroughly creative, imaginative mind that defined an era. Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started. With his passing the world has lost a rare original, Disney has lost a member of our family, and I have lost a great friend. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Laurene and his children during this difficult time.” Billboard Magazine compiled a handy list of music industry reaction, including Coldplay, who wrote on Twitter: “Just learned the terrible news of Steve Jobs’ passing. What an incredible, inspiring life. Changed the world in so many ways.” Just learned the terrible news of Steve Jobs’ passing. What an incredible, inspiring life. Changed the world in so many ways.

Other sites had articles at the ready. Gizmodo included a tribute video to the man the site acknowledged “may have hated us.” But Boing Boing had the most inspired tribute, it seems, with an early-Mac-inspired redesign. 11:04 P.M. |Do-It-Yourselfers in S.F. Admire How He Did It Claire Cain Miller reports from TechShop in San Francisco, a warehouse equipped with board cutters, oscilloscopes and saws where people mill around in goggles and take classes like laser cutting and intro to electroluminescent wiring. In a word, it is filled with the kind of people who might have been inspired by Steve Jobs’s hardware prowess. Ramon Yvarra, 32, a user-interface designer at JPMorgan Chase who worked as a designer at Apple for 10 years, was at TechShop building robots and teaching Autodesk Inventor and 3D scanning on Wednesday when he got a text message from an ex-girlfriend to check Twitter. “I have letters that I wrote to Steve in high school, handwritten letters with my ideas for virtual reality operating systems,” said Mr. Yvarra, who wore a black fedora, black pants, black shirt and black blazer. “Apple’s had a significant effect on my life. The man has a singular vision,” he said retaining the present tense. Sean Cusack, 29, a chemist by day, was building an audio rack and teaching an electroluminescent wiring class, and took the contrary position. “I’m not a giant Apple fan,” he said. “He hasn’t had much of an impact on my life. I’m more of a hacker type. Apple as a company has beautiful design, but it locks you into a certain way of doing things, and I’m a D.I.Y.-er.” Brian Speir, a consultant was with his fiancée, Megan Hoak, making their wedding invitations. He has worked at an Apple retail store, and his first reaction was shock, he said. “I can’t really describe it. He’s a legend, on par with any great artist.” He continued: “He’s meticulous. More than anything, it’s not stopping until something’s perfect. My fiancée says, ‘It’s good enough,’ and I say, ‘Not yet.’ ” Ms. Hoak chimed in, “And when he says that, he always refers to Steve.” 11:00 P.M. |How to Measure Jobs’s Legacy We asked our Twitter followers on @nytimes to comment on the influence of Steve Jobs on their lives, using the hashtag #stevejobslegacy.

Steve Jobs put one in every pocket, purse, dorm room and bedroom.” No doubt, it is that ubiquity of computing — and the personal affection people have for their Apple gadgets, and the man who conceived their creation — that accounts for the overflow of responses across the Internet, from the president of the United States, who through the Twitter account for his re-election campaign wrote: Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. From all of us at #Obama2012, thank you for the work you make possible every day—including ours.Thu Oct 06 00:28:31 via webBarack Obama BarackObama Lance Armstrong fondly posted to Twitter a quote: “A computer is the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with.

It was potent when I first watched it and particularly powerful this evening, given his passing. First he spoke of the merits of a multidisciplinary life, noting how a stray course in calligraphy led to some of the richness of the typography he and the early Apple team developed for the Macintosh: [Y]ou can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. He spoke of the liberation that came with being fired: The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. And then there was his discussion of learning about his cancer, and the lessons that knowledge offered, among them that “time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.” (At the time of the speech, he’d had surgery and the pancreatic cancer appeared to have been eliminated.) That’s certainly not something anyone could ever have accused Steven Jobs of doing. Here’s the full transcript. Pass it around. The package on Jobs in The Times, centering on a sweeping obituary by John Markoff with Steve Lohr, provides much more to explore on this master of box-free thinking and designing with both function and aesthetics in mind.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/live-blogging-the-apple-iphone-5-announcement/?ref=applecomputerinc">Apple Unveils iPhone 4S With Voice-Recognition Features<date>October 4, 2011, 12:17 pm</date><text>Nick BiltonTimothy D. Cook talks about Apple’s retail stores on stage. Tech journalists descended upon Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., on Tuesday for some iPhone-related announcements. Our updates from the event are below, with the most recent at the top. 2:38 P.M. |Tim Cook Wraps It Up Tim Cook is back on stage. He’s reviewing everything we’ve heard today. Now he’s pivoting from the devices to the company. “Only Apple could make such hardware and services…” “I am so incredibly proud of this company and all of the teams that worked so hard to bring all the amazing things you’ve seen to reality.” And that’s your Apple press event. Mr. Cook exits, stage left. “Layla” now playing over the speakers. So, in spite of the many mockups that circulated online, and “new cases” that were “revealed,” the iPhone 4S looks exactly the same as the iPhone 4. Investors seem unhappy with what they’ve heard. Apple’s stock is down 2.6 percent on heavy volume. We’ll have more coverage soon. Thanks for reading. 2:35 P.M. |Pricing for the iPhone 4S Prices for the iPhone 4S are as follows: $199 for 16 gigabytes of storage, $299 for 32 GB, and $399 for 64 GB. There will be an iPhone 4 with 8 GB for $99. And there will be an iPhone 3GS for… free, with a two-year contract. Preorders for the 4S start Oct. 7, delivery on the 14th. Sprint gets it too! So a world phone on three out of four major networks. 2:22 P.M. |More Features of Siri, Voice Control on iPhone Nick Bilton Siri can schedule events in your calendar, read messages, take dictation, all by voice. You can create a reminder by voice. “Remind me to call my wife when I leave work,” says Mr. Forstall. Siri, based on previous conversations, knows who your wife is and uses geolocation to remind you when you leave a location. You can search Wikipedia by voice. Apple has also linked up with Wolfram Alpha to provide data and definitions for Siri to access. “Define mitosis,” says Mr. Forstall. Siri generates and reads back a definition. We are clearly headed to Terminator/HAL territory here. Humans are doomed. Deal with it. Mr Forstall asks Siri, “Who are you?” Siri replies, “I am a humble personal assistant.” That’s just chilling. Jenna Wortham adds: Will this kind of personal assistant technology turn into the latest battleground between Apple and Google? Android has already baked several voice-recognition features into its software, including transcribing voice messages to text and letting users browse the Web using verbal commands. But Siri could help nudge the technology into the mainstream. More voice recognition: Anywhere a keyboard appears on the phone’s screen, there will be a microphone button, so you can dictate anything. Siri will initially support English, French and German. It will be released in a beta version, with more languages and features added in time. We’re watching a video now. Just a recap. 2:16 P.M. |Demonstrating Voice Control on the iPhone Scott Forstall, Apple’s iOS chief, is back on stage. He asks the phone, “What is the weather today?” The phone replies, “Here is the weather for today,” and displays the weather screen. Mr. Forstall asks, “Do I need a raincoat today?” The phone replies, “It sure looks like rain today,” and shows the weather screen again. “What time is it in Paris?” he asks. The phone replies with the time in Paris and shows a clock. “Wake me up at 6 a.m.,” says Mr. Forstall. “O.K., I’ve set an alarm for 6 a.m. tomorrow,” the phone replies. This is amazing. And freaky. Apple’s set up a partnership with Yelp as well. “Find me a great Greek restaurant in Palo Alto.” The phone says: “I’ve located 14 Greek restaurants. Five are in Palo Alto. I’ve sorted them by rating.” You can ask Siri for directions. It can read text messages to you. You can reply or ask it to read them again. Mr. Forstall: “Do I have any meetings this Friday at noon?” Phone: “You don’t have any meetings on Friday at noon.” 2:14 P.M. |Better Voice Control for the iPhone “We left one thing out,” says Mr. Schiller. “It’s about our voice.” This is the fruit of Apple’s acquisition of Siri, a startup that has been working on voice-control features. Siri is now a feature on the iPhone. “It’s an intelligent assistant that helps you get things done, just by asking.” “Probably the craziest thing you can do is do a voice-recognition demo on stage, live,” says Mr. Schiller. “But we’re going to do it anyway.” 2:12 P.M. |But Where’s the iPhone 5? A slide just went up with the number 5. But then it was quickly replaced with a slide about AirPlay. What’s up with that? Is there an iPhone 5? These are all the kinds of changes people were expecting for the iPhone 5, so it’s hard to say. 2:04 P.M. |The Camera in the iPhone 4S Nick Bilton We’re now on to the camera in the iPhone 4S. “We set our sights on competing with the best point-and-shoot cameras,” Mr. Schiller says. The camera has an 8-megapixel sensor, 60 percent more pixels than the iPhone 4’s camera. It has a backside-illuminated CMOS sensor that captures 73 percent more light. It’s 33 percent faster. Translation: the photos will be better. The iPhone already has a pretty good camera. These improvements may well make it a really good one. Point-and-shoots should be afraid. The iPhone 4S takes 1.1 seconds to take its first photo once you start up the Camera app. The Droid Bionic, by comparison, takes 3.6 seconds, says Mr. Schiller. Mr. Schiller is showing unretouched photos taken with the iPhone 4S. They are pretty. The same camera system also works for video, which is now 1080p, the highest high-definition standard available. There’s also video image stabilization. We’re now going to see some video from the iPhone 4S. 2:02 P.M. |Stats on the iPhone 4S The new chip is twice as fast as the older one, we are told. Battery life is 8 hours of talk time on 3G, 14 hours on 2G, 10 hours of watching video. Mr. Schiller is now talking about the wireless system. The 4S now can switch between the two antennas to transmit and receive, for better call quality. He says downloading data can be twice as fast. Mr. Schiller is saying that the speed bump the 4S gets from the new chip makes it competitive with devices that can use faster 4G wireless networks. The 4S is also is a world phone, meaning it has both GSM and CDMA network capabilities. That’s huge for Verizon. 1:55 P.M. |Unveiling the iPhone 4S “Next: iPhone,” says Mr. Schiller. We’re looking at the existing iPhone 4, hearing how great it is. But now he’s talking about the iPhone 4S. Muted applause. “Inside, it is all new.” It has an A5 chip, same as the iPad 2. So, no new design. At least, not for this model — is there an iPhone 5 as well? Of course, Apple did the same thing with the iPhone 3G. The model after that was the 3GS. This is sort of funny — reports were out there that Apple was “hiding” the iPhone 5 in an iPhone 4 body. Maybe Apple wasn’t hiding it at all. Developers of the game Infinity Blade 2 are now on stage, showing off the iPhone 4S’s graphics ability. They point out that there are koi in a pond in a gaming scene. People applaud here in the auditorium. People love koi. The Infinity Blade person describes the graphics as “eye-melting.” I should certainly hope not. 1:52 P.M. |Schiller on the iPod Touch Mr. Schiller is talking about the iPod Touch. As mentioned earlier, iMessage works over Wi-Fi, so even though the Touch can’t do text messages, it can communicate free over Wi-Fi. There is now a white iPod Touch. The 8-gigabyte Touch is now $199, 32 GB is $299, 64 GB is $399. The iPod Shuffle starts off the lineup at $49. 1:48 P.M. |An Update to the Nano Phil Schiller is now on stage, looking trim. He’s talking about an update to the iPod Nano. The apps on the Nano are now swipeable, making it easy to move from one app to another. Mr. Schiller is talking about the Nano’s use among fitness buffs. There are now 16 new clock faces for people who want to wear their Nano as a watch. The faces are cute: chronometers, and Mickey Mouse! “We worked with Disney,” says Mr. Schiller. Given that Steve Jobs is Disney’s largest individual shareholder, that mustn’t have been too hard. The Nano is now $129 for 8 gigabytes, $149 for 16. 1:46 P.M. |Music in the Cloud Mr. Cue is now talking about iTunes Match, which Apple has already previewed. Music that you did not purchase from iTunes can still be shared among devices and backed up in the cloud. Apple will match what you have on your PC with its own online catalog. If you have something that Apple does not, it will be uploaded to the cloud. iTunes Match will cost $25 a year. iCloud and iOS 5 ship on Oct. 12, and iTunes Match at the end of the month. We’re now watching a video about iCloud. It’s like the old journalism rule: Tell them what you’re about to tell them. Tell them. Then tell them what you’ve told them. 1:41 P.M. |Location Features: Find My Friends The Find my iPhone function, which lets you see your lost phone on a map, is being adapted for Macs too, so you can find your lost MacBook Pro. And there’s a new app, called Find My Friends. You see a list of friends and family who are sharing their location with you on a map. You can create temporary events, and you can invite friends to share their location with you, but you can set a time for the location-sharing to end. There will undoubtedly be major social snafus because of this feature. iCloud is free, but heavy users can get storage updates. (More on that later. The slide went by fast.) 1:38 P.M. |Up in the iCloud Eddie Cue is next to talk about iCloud. (He is clearly reading from a teleprompter.) “It just works.” First: iTunes in the cloud. Music purchased on one device will be downloaded to all your iOS devices. Previously purchased music (or TV shows) can be accessed by any iOS device. This is not entirely new: some of these features have already been available. We’re now on to Photostream. Photos taken by one device will be pushed to all other iOS devices, as well as iPhoto on your computer. Basically, all of your stuff is available from all of your devices. Mr. Cue is applying this to different apps (Pages, Keynote, etc.), but that’s the gist. iCloud does a daily backup from all your devices. Contacts and calendars are synced. 1:33 P.M. |On Safari and Mail The Safari browser is next. Reader is a new button on Safari. Tap that button, and you get a text-only version, formatted for your device. It’s like Readability (sorry, Readability). Reading List lets you save articles for later, like Instapaper (sorry, Instapaper). Tabbed browsing is also now available. And in the Mail app, there are new formatting tools, and you can search the text of an e-mail, not just the subject and address lines. (Finally.) iOS 5 is now PC free, says Mr. Forstall, meaning you don’t have to connect your device to a computer to get started. And iOS updates are also wireless. The new operating system will be available next week. 1:32 P.M. |Changes to the iPhone’s Camera App The camera app is now accessible from the lock screen. Double-tap the home button and you can go directly to the camera app, no password or anything required. You can lock autofocus and exposure on a single point in the frame. Red-eye reduction, auto-enhance and other improvements have been made to Camera. 1:27 P.M. |New Features in iOS 5 We’re now talking about iOS 5 and getting a recap of new features. Notifications is one of the big ones. All of those old pop-ups are now sent to the notifications center. Notifications can be displayed on the lock screen too. Swipe any notification and you will be taken to the app that is associated with it so you can respond appropriately. iMessages is next. It’s a souped-up text messaging system, basically. These are sent over 3G and Wi-Fi. Then there’s Reminders. It will remind you to do things (duh), and also uses the iPhone’s location capabilities to remind you to do something when you’re near the place where you need to do that thing. Twitter gets a spot in the lineup, as Mr. Forstall explains how Twitter is deeply integrated into iOS 5. Newsstand is iOS’s way to manage publications like magazines and newspapers. New issues are downloaded in the background. 1:23 P.M. |Apple’s Mobile Operating System Scott Forstall, Apple’s iOS chief, is now on stage. (Steve Jobs does not appear to be here, but there is a bottle of SmartWater, his preferred beverage, on a podium.) Mr. Forstall is talking about how more than 1 billion apps are downloaded in a month. A new app is being shown: Cards. You can create cards on your phone or iPod Touch, and Apple will print them out and mail them. If you mail something within the United States, Apple can use the postal service’s intelligent barcode system, letting you know when the card will be delivered. The price is $2.99 to mail in the United States, $4.99 for the rest of the world. My colleague Jenna Wortham adds: Apple is getting into the snail-mail business — one that start-ups like Postagram, which lets people send real postcards created from pictures taken on their iPhones, have tried to corral. Or is Apple setting its sights on Hallmark? 1:19 P.M. |On to the iPad Mr. Cook is talking about how pilots are using the iPad to replace 40-pound flight plans, which he claims makes the planes more fuel efficient. And that, technically, is true. But come on. Three out of four tablets sold are iPads, Mr. Cook says. There have been more than 250 million iOS devices sold. “Today we take this to the next level.” 1:16 P.M. |Talking About iPhone “Next up is iPhone — this could be a reason why the room is so full today.” More stats supporting Apple’s dominance. Ninety-three percent of Fortune 500 companies are testing or deploying the iPhone, Mr. Cook says. He’s smooth, totally on his game. In spite of all this success, Mr. Cook says, the iPhone has only 5 percent of the worldwide handset market. “We believe all handsets will become smartphones,” he says. There have been rumors about Apple releasing a cheaper iPhone for other markets, but previous-generation iPhones are sold at a fairly steep discount, so it’s unclear how a purpose-built device would be useful. 1:13 P.M. |On to the iPod Mr. Cook is now talking about the iPod. They’re showing an image of the original iPod, which now seems so old and foreign. Who buys the iPod Classic anymore? There have been rumors that it may go away. Apple has sold more than 300 million iPods, 45 million in the year that ended in June. ITunes has more than 20 million songs for sale. It is the No. 1 music store in the world, with 16 bilion songs downloaded, Mr. Cook says. 1:09 P.M. |Some Product Updates We’re now getting news about other Apple product lines, like Lion, the Mac operating system. This is the rhetorical equivalent of putting the milk in the back of the supermarket: We’re all here for iPhone news, but first you have to walk past all this other stuff. Mr. Cook is talking about how Lion was adopted at a rate 10 times faster than Windows 7. (Which is nice for Apple, but let’s not forget there are still boatloads more Windows users out there.) Apple is approaching 60 million Mac users and has 23 percent of the PC market, Mr. Cook says. “We have a lot to go,” he says, referring to the other 77 percent. 1:02 P.M. |Tim Cook Kicks It Off Tim Cook has taken the stage: “I love Apple. I consider it the privilege of a lifetime.” “This room has quite a history at Apple. Just 10 years ago, we launched the original iPod here. And just one year ago, we launched the MacBook Air. Today we will remind you of the innovations of this company.” Mr. Cook, who is wearing dark jeans and a navy Oxford shirt with a black t-shirt underneath, is now talking about the retail stores. New shops are in China — Shanghai and other cities. Shanghai is their largest store in Asia, and 100,000 people came over opening weekend. By comparison, the Los Angeles store had 100,000 people in a month. Now we’re seeing images of the Hong Kong store. And a video about the company’s retail arm. Apple now has 357 stores in 11 countries. 12:57 P.M. |Gearing Up for Announcements Photos by Nick Bilton We’re here in the auditorium; people are being seated and Led Zeppelin’s “When the Levee Breaks” is playing. Prior to that, it was the Rolling Stones and “Under My Thumb.” Get it? Thumb? Oh, Apple — you so funny. We’ve now moved on to “Can’t Explain,” by the Who, a phrase that is often heard from Apple’s P.R. department. We should be starting shortly — we’ve been asked to silence our phones.</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/the-iphone-4s-announcement-was-about-google-not-apple/?ref=applecomputerinc">The iPhone 4S Is as Much About Google as Apple<date>October 4, 2011, 7:15 pm</date><text>Nick Bilton/The New York Times The new iPhone 4S will start at $200; the iPhone 3GS will be free with a 2-year contract. Tuesday’s iPhone unveiling didn’t have as much to do with Apple as it did with Google. And in regards to Google, Tuesday’s announcement was, to quote the rapper Diddy, “All about the Benjamins.” It’s no secret that Google and Apple are currently embroiled in a smartphone war. According to the latest numbers by several research firms that track smartphone sales, twice as many Android devices are currently being activated each day as Apple devices. Analysts have repeatedly said that one of the main reasons people opt for Google’s Android over Apple’s  iOS is the price of the phone. “The Android phone is available on almost any carrier at almost any price,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst for Forrester Research specializing in mobile technology. “And now the big growth in the smartphone space is not coming from people that need a new phone every three weeks. It’s your brother or your cousin or your aunt.” This means that Apple needed to compete with Android in the same way. To do this the company had to offer a high-end phone that is very Applesque, complete with the slickest new features and software: the iPhone 4S, which starts at $200 and goes as high as $400. In addition, the company needed to offer iPhones for the masses: the iPhone 3GS, which is now free. All of these prices are valid with a two-year contract with the carrier for wireless service. The iPhone may have lacked a new design, but the broad pricing plan represented the first time Apple had used this strategy for its phones. “Just like Apple built a product portfolio for the iPod that allowed anyone to get an iPod, no matter how much money they had, it’s the same now, if you want an iPhone,” Mr. Golvin said. “There’s everything from the high-end version to the free one.” Apple has also streamlined the cost of building the iPhone. The iPhone 4S uses a chip that will work globally across all carriers. This means Apple can manufacture a smartphone that will work on Sprint, Verizon and AT&amp;T in the United States, and a long list of others abroad. This will bring huge savings to Apple, which in the end will help Apple compete with Google globally.</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/technology/apple-iphone-faces-divided-loyalties.html?ref=applecomputerinc">Apple iPhone Faces Android, and Split Loyalties<date>Published: October 3, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — As soon as Apple unveils its highly anticipated new version of the iPhone on Tuesday, millions of people are likely to start plotting how to be among the first to buy it. But millions more may be considering a competitor — an Android phone.Despite all the hoopla surrounding the Apple announcement, more people buy smartphones running Google’s Android operating system than buy Apple phones. Android’s share of new smartphone sales is now more than double Apple’s share, a striking change from a year ago, when the two were roughly even, and a reflection of how Android phones have improved and become more broadly available. In this altered competitive landscape, any new phone from Apple will have to stack up favorably against the most popular Android phones. Even app developers, many of whom once devoted all their energy to building for the iPhone, now have more divided loyalties. “The more the Android platform matures, the more it becomes a real competitor,” said Mike Novak, an Android engineer at GroupMe, a group messaging service that has over a million users. “It’d be foolish not to support both Apple and Android.” Yet Apple, by many measures, still remains the smartphone player to beat, with better profits from the business, huge influence among mobile app makers and innovations that rivals scramble to copy. Apple is expected to introduce a new iPhone with a variety of slick new features, but the product could also get a lift from an old-fashioned distribution deal. Apple has struck a deal with Sprint Nextel to offer the new iPhone to its customers, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to speak about the arrangement. The agreement could help blunt some of the distribution advantages that have helped propel Google’s Android into more and more smartphones. Until now, Apple phones have been available in the United States only on AT&amp;T and Verizon. Apple also faces another big challenge in releasing a new iPhone: it has to top itself. It must show it can still deliver enough of the cutting-edge features that have made the company a trend-setter. “They set the bar,” said Phil Libin, the chief executive of Evernote, a start-up that makes a mobile note-taking app, who said he had no knowledge of Apple’s new phone. “Android and other devices have had to catch up.” Analysts widely expect the new iPhone to include a faster microprocessor for running applications at a greater speed, along with a more powerful camera. Some have speculated that Apple might finally include big improvements in the voice recognition capabilities of the new phone using technology the company acquired when it bought Siri, a start-up, last year. Some have also speculated that Apple might introduce more than one phone, including one with fewer new features that could sell for $99 with a carrier contract. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment before Tuesday’s event, which is to take place at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. In the second quarter, handsets running the Android system accounted for 43.4 percent of worldwide smartphone sales, compared with 18.2 percent for Apple, according to the research firm Gartner. During the same period last year, the two companies were roughly neck-and-neck, with Android and Apple holding 17.2 percent and 14.1 percent of the market, respectively. For both companies, growth in market share has come at the expense of technology laggards like Symbian, the mobile software backed by Nokia, and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, rather than each other. Despite its smaller share of the market, Apple earns outsize profits. Thanks to its comparatively healthy profit margins, Apple had about half of the operating profits in the mobile handset business in the first quarter of the year, even though its sales accounted for only 4.9 percent of the phones sold, according to a recent report by the analyst Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. Apple could get a boost from its new relationship with Sprint, which may have a card up its sleeve to lure customers — its unlimited mobile data plan. That plan allows cellphone users to gorge themselves on streaming media services like Spotify and Netflix, without worrying about accidentally going over the monthly allotment. AT&amp;T and Verizon both have monthly limits on the data its iPhone customers can consume. A Sprint spokesperson declined to comment. Android’s surge in the market means app developers are splitting more of their time between the competing phone systems. Mr. Novak, the engineer at GroupMe, who also helps organize a monthly gathering in New York for Android developers, said Apple would need to impress developers, as it did with the iPhone 4, if the company hoped to persuade them to stay committed to the iPhone. “It really comes down to the wow factor,” Mr. Novak said. “Without that, it leaves the door wide open for whatever announcements Google plans to make.” Adam Goldstein, a founder of a flight search engine called Hipmunk, said the company decided to release a version of its mobile application for Android earlier this month after watching the popularity of the platform grow. “We definitely did the iPhone first,” he said. “But requests kept coming in from the Android side.” Mr. Goldstein said the company was dividing its programming resources equally between Android and Apple phones.</text></article>
