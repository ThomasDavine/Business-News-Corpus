The court upheld a state appellate court’s ruling in February that sends the case back to Madison County. A judge there had sided with plaintiffs after a 2003 trial in a class-action lawsuit over Philip Morris’s marketing of “light” cigarettes. The state’s Supreme Court threw out that verdict. With the latest ruling, the plaintiffs expect to argue that a favorable 2008 United States Supreme Court decision may be applied to reinstate the Madison County case. A lawyer for Philip Morris’s corporate parent played down the development as the court merely deciding a procedural question about whether the plaintiffs met a statute of limitations, and not the merits of the bid to reopen the case. In 2003, a Madison County circuit judge, Nicholas Byron, who is now retired, found that Philip Morris misled customers about “light” and “low tar” cigarettes and broke state law by marketing them as safer. The state’s Supreme Court overturned that verdict in 2005, saying the Federal Trade Commission allowed companies to characterize or label their cigarettes as “light” and “low tar,” so Philip Morris could not be held liable under state law if such terms could be found false or misleading. The United States Supreme Court let that ruling stand. But in 2008, it ruled in a lawsuit on behalf of three Maine residents that smokers may use state consumer protection laws to sue cigarette makers for the way they promote “light” and “low tar” brands.The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday cleared the way for plaintiffs’ lawyers to push the revival of a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris.

A copy of the court document was not immediately available. Australia, which has already banned the public display of tobacco products in retail outlets, wants to outlaw logos on cigarette packs and force them to be sold in plain dark-olive packaging, carrying health warnings instead of company logos.

The legislation, if passed by Parliament, would come into force in 2012. “The forced removal of trade marks and other valuable intellectual property is a clear violation of the terms of the bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong,” Anne Edwards, a spokeswoman for Philip Morris Asia, said in the statement. “We believe we have a very strong legal case and will be seeking significant financial compensation for the damage to our business.” The government raised tobacco taxes by 25 percent last year as it sought to curb smoking, which is the nation’s largest single preventable cause of death, according to the nation’s health minister, Nicola Roxon. “We don’t believe that taking that action is in breach of any of our international obligations,” Ms. Roxon told Sky News. “We believe that we are able, and the Australian people I think would expect their government, to take action in the interests of public health.”Philip Morris International said it had started legal action against the Australian government over the nation’s plans to allow the sale of cigarettes only in plain packages.

J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the Lorillard Tobacco Company and other cigarette makers in 1998, claiming they manipulated the nicotine content in cigarettes and misrepresented the health effects of smoking. The hospitals were seeking more than $455 million in damages, ranging from about $300,000 for some hospitals to $86.4 million for the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, Mo. The hospitals argued that the industry’s actions had raised spending for unreimbursed and uncompensated tobacco-related health care. The tobacco companies denied any responsibility for patient care costs at the hospitals or any financial losses by the hospitals. The jury, in Missouri Circuit Court in St. Louis, rejected the hospitals’ claims on a 9-3 vote Friday in the seventh day of deliberations. “The jury correctly rejected the entirety of the hospital’s claims,” Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said in a statement. The jury agreed with Philip Morris “that ordinary cigarettes are not negligently designed or defective,” he said. The hospitals haven’t decided whether to appeal, their lawyer, Kenneth Brostron, said. The case is the third such health care cost-recovery claim to reach trial, according to regulatory filings by Altria. The tobacco industry won the first, in Ohio, in 1999. The second initially resulted in a $17.8 million award for a health insurer by a New York jury in 2001. That was reversed on appeal in 2004. The Missouri suit, which did not include patients as plaintiffs, went to trial in January. The hospitals, which provide care to indigent patients and others who do not pay, represent the majority of licensed, adult acute care hospital beds in Missouri, according to the complaint. The hospitals said medical ethics required them to serve people in need regardless of their ability to pay. Tobacco companies should reimburse the hospitals for care provided to patients who were unable to pay and were suffering from tobacco-related illness, the plaintiffs said. Hospitals also should “recover the increased costs incurred to providing all health care services” as a result of tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke, according to the complaint.Tobacco companies are not liable to Missouri hospitals for money spent on patients with smoking-related illnesses who could not pay their medical bills, a St. Louis jury said.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/big-tobacco-wins-missouri-case/?ref=altriagroupinc">Big Tobacco Wins Missouri Case<date>April 29, 2011, 2:37 pm</date><text>A jury in Missouri has decided after several months that major tobacco companies are not liable for hundreds of millions of dollars spent by more than 40 of the state’s hospitals on smoking-related illnesses in patients who could not afford to pay for their care, according to news reports. In a trial that started three months ago, the hospitals had contended that tactics employed by the tobacco industry, including the major defendants Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and Lorillard, had fueled higher costs and more illnesses. The industry asserted that hospitals made more money, not less, among other assertions. Jurors had deliberated for about a week before deciding 9-to-3 against the hospitals’ assertions, Bloomberg News reported. The Times’s Barry Meier previewed the case in an article published in late January, noting that the case was finally headed to trial after 12 years.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/nyregion/30smoking.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Antismoking Poster Law in New York City Is Struck Down<date>Published: December 29, 2010</date><text>A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a New York City law that would have forced all bodegas and convenience stores to post gruesome images of diseased lungs, brains and teeth in the shops to discourage people from buying cigarettes. In a 13-page ruling, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court in Manhattan wrote that while the law was well intentioned, it violated federal law since only the federal government had the authority to regulate cigarette warnings and advertisements. “Even merchants of morbidity are entitled to the full protection of the law,” Judge Rakoff wrote, “for our sake as well as theirs.” The decision puts an end — at least for now— to the city’s plan to have the placards displayed beside cash registers in more than 11,000 establishments across the city. While awaiting Judge Rakoff’s ruling, the city had agreed that it would postpone enforcement of its rule until this weekend. Lawyers with the city’s Law Department said they planned to appeal the decision. The city’s health department created the rule in late 2009. In June, the nation’s three biggest tobacco companies — Philip Morris, Lorillard and R. J. Reynolds — joined forces with the New York State Association of Convenience Stores in filing a lawsuit challenging the rule. In their suit, the tobacco companies and convenience stores said the rule violated the First Amendment rights of retailers who disagreed with the message, and breached a law stating that only the federal government can regulate cigarette warnings and advertising. In his ruling, Judge Rakoff said that health officials had good reason to view smoking as a “public health threat,” citing smoking as the leading cause of preventable death in New York City and the rest of the country. “Within New York City, roughly 7,500 people die from smoking annually — more than from AIDS, homicide and suicide combined,” he wrote. But Judge Rakoff also cited a federal law enacted in 1965, the Labeling Act, which gave the federal government exclusive authority over cigarette warnings. That law, he wrote, seeks to balance public and commercial interests: the federal government protects the public, but also sets clear and uniform cigarette regulations that protect “commerce and the national economy.” In his ruling, Judge Rakoff pointed out that the Labeling Act also contained a provision forbidding any state laws from conflicting with the federal government’s policies on cigarette warnings and advertisements. That, he concluded, makes the city’s placard policy illegal. Floyd Abrams, a lawyer who represented the convenience store association, said that even though the city had agreed not to enforce the rule until this weekend, many retail shops had put up the graphic placards anyway. He said he was “very pleased” with Judge Rakoff’s decision. “It will allow the retail stores in New York to be freed of the obligation to put signs up urging customers not to buy their lawful products,” he said. In a statement, the health department said that the city “strongly disagrees” with the ruling and that tobacco companies “trying to prevent these messages from being seen should be ashamed of themselves.” “The city’s warning signs portray completely factual messages about the dangers of smoking,” the statement added. “They do so at the exact moment when smokers are making decisions about purchasing tobacco. We believe it is the city’s responsibility to help smokers quit and to protect children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/bloomberg-backs-uruguays-anti-smoking-laws/?ref=altriagroupinc">Bloomberg Backs Uruguay's Anti-Smoking Laws<date>November 15, 2010, 4:26 pm</date><text>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York telephoned the Uruguay’s president, José Mujica, on Monday morning to pledge his financial assistance to that nation’s fight against the world’s leading cigarette company. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire with a long record of antismoking activism, made the announcement after a front-page article in The New York Times on Sunday detailed some of the lobbying, marketing and court activities by multinational tobacco companies. On Monday afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg announced at a news conference that he would direct to Uruguay’s legal defense some of the $375 million he has set aside in a philanthropy to fight smoking. In a news release, he did not name a precise figure. Uruguay, viewed as a world leader in antismoking laws, is being sued by Philip Morris International in a Washington-based affiliate of the World Bank. The cigarette giant objects to two new Uruguayan laws. One covers 80 percent of the front and back of cigarette packages with a graphic health warning. The other bans more than one type of any brand of cigarette, such as Marlboro red, gold and silver. The suit has rallied antismoking forces globally. They interpreted it as an attempt to intimidate Uruguay and send a message to other developing nations on the eve of a conference of tobacco control officials from 171 nations. The conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay, is expected to produce guidelines to enforce a broad antismoking treaty sponsored by the World Health Organization. In the press release, Mr. Bloomberg said his money “will assist Uruguayan government officials by providing legal research and expertise, launching public education mass media campaigns, and galvanizing world support and public opinion.” Peter Nixon, a spokesman for Philip Morris International, said in recent interviews that the lawsuit was necessary to protect the company’s trademark and intellectual property rights. He said its filing in February was unrelated to the conference of tobacco control officials. The suit seeks unspecified damages. Of the size of the health warning, Mr. Nixon said, “The previous ones were 50 percent and we thought that was reasonable. Once you take it up to 80 percent, there’s no space for trademarks to be shown. So we thought that was going too far.” The limit on brands, he added, forced Philip Morris to remove a number of brands from the market. A group of health-related nonprofit organizations bought a full-page advertisement in Uruguay’s leading newspaper Monday to thank the country’s president for standing up to tobacco companies. Philip Morris International’s $66 billion in annual revenues is twice the size of Uruguay’s gross domestic product.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/business/global/14smoke.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Philip Morris Said to Benefit from Child Labor<date>Published: July 14, 2010</date><text>MOSCOW — One woman said children as young as 10 working in the fields developed red rashes on their stomachs and necks as they harvested tobacco for use in cigarettes made by Philip Morris.Another migrant laborer working in the tobacco fields in Kazakhstan said a farmer confiscated her identification papers and withheld pay to force her to continue working despite dismal conditions. Human Rights Watch, the group best known for documenting governmental abuse and war crimes, plans to release a report on Wednesday showing that child and forced labor is widespread on farms that supply a cigarette factory owned by Philip Morris International in Kazakhstan, in Central Asia. While child labor should be condemned in any setting, the report said, employing children on tobacco farms is particularly hazardous because tobacco field laborers are exposed to high levels of nicotine while doing their jobs. Only a tiny fraction of Philip Morris’s global tobacco purchases are made in the country, and no tobacco raised on the farms employing child labor went into cigarettes sold outside of former Soviet countries. Philip Morris, after being provided with an advance copy of the report, said it agreed to sweeping changes in its purchasing policies in Kazakhstan. “Philip Morris International is firmly opposed to child labor,” Peter Nixon, a spokesman, said in a telephone interview from the company’s office in Lausanne, Switzerland. Although child labor is widespread in agriculture in Central Asia, Human Rights Watch said, the particularly harmful environment on the Kazakh tobacco farms warranted special attention. The report cited conditions it said were dangerous to children and adults alike. Lacking easy access to potable water, for example, laborers had resorted to drinking from irrigation channels contaminated with pesticides, the report said. The group interviewed 68 tobacco farm employees in one district of Kazakhstan during the harvest last fall, identifying them only by their first names and initials. All, including the children, were migrant laborers from neighboring Central Asian countries, mostly from impoverished Kyrgyzstan. The report also documented violations of basic farm safety rules, like laborers wearing open-toed shoes while working with sharp hoes. Human Rights Watch researchers documented 72 instances of children working in the Kazakh tobacco fields, which employ about a thousand migrants each season. Many are paid on a piecework basis, by the ton of harvested tobacco. The group said this was an inducement for parents to bring their children into the fields at harvest time. Even then, the report said, families made only a few hundred dollars for a half-year of farm work, after covering debts to farmers for board and travel. “A company like Philip Morris certainly has the resources to put an end to these practices,” Jane Buchanan, a senior Human Rights Watch researcher and the author, said in an interview. Mr. Nixon, the Philip Morris spokesman, said the company already had policies in place prohibiting purchases from farms that used child labor. Over the years, he said, this policy had reduced abusive practices at Kazakh tobacco farms — an assertion that Human Rights Watch said was supported in its interviews. All the same, Mr. Nixon said, Philip Morris would step up its efforts to eliminate child labor. The company, he said, was “appreciative” of Human Rights Watch for drawing the continuing abuse to its attention. But Ms. Buchanan said Philip Morris bore moral responsibility for the fate of child laborers in Kazakhstan, even though it was not their direct employer, citing precedents established by apparel and athletic shoe companies that over the last decade had demanded Asian suppliers prohibit child labor. “Companies are supposed to have policies to recognize and rectify problems with human rights in their supply chain,” she said. That many of the children worked alongside their migrant-laborer parents during the harvest, she said, did not diminish Philip Morris’s responsibility for their safety. Tobacco can be an unhealthy crop even before it winds up in cigarettes. Nicotine is absorbed through the skin through continual handling of tobacco leaves. The resulting ailment in tobacco farm laborers is called green tobacco sickness, causing nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Rashes are also common. The report cited studies indicating that laborers can absorb, in one day, the amount of nicotine equivalent to smoking 36 cigarettes. “Children are especially vulnerable due to their small body size in relation to the dose of nicotine they absorb,” the report said. The farmers studied by Human Rights Watch supply Philip Morris Kazakhstan, a wholly owned subsidiary of Philip Morris International, which is based in New York. The company, spun off from its parent, the Altria Group, in 2008, sells cigarettes in 160 countries outside of the United States, including Kazakhstan. Philip Morris USA markets many of the same brands in America, most notably Marlboro, but is a distinct company. Mr. Nixon said the company would require farmers to sign written contracts with adult laborers during this year’s growing season, and would hire an outside monitor to police farms for compliance with child labor laws. This year, the company opened a summer camp for the children of migrant laborers in Kazakhstan’s tobacco-producing region. It will also require its suppliers to pay monthly salaries, rather than piecework pay, to discourage migrant parents from enlisting the help of their children. In 2009, Philip Morris International’s net revenue was $25 billion on sales of cigarettes including globally marketed brands like Marlboro, L&amp;M, Chesterfield and Bond Street. The company’s purchases in Kazakhstan are tiny compared to its global operations; it bought 1,500 tons in 2009, compared to its global total of 400,000 tons. The company said it contracts with 300 farms in Kazakhstan, employing about 1,200 seasonal workers. These workers are typically accompanied by about 200 children, Mr. Nixon said. The Kazakh tobacco is used only in local brands unknown outside their markets in former Soviet countries, including Polyot and Apollo-Soyuz.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/health/01altria.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Chancellor’s Slip Benefits Tobacco Research<date>Published: June 30, 2010</date><text>The chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, has donated $134,000 from the sale of her stock in the nation’s largest cigarette company to the university’s tobacco control center, officials said Wednesday. Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, the leader of the campus since last summer, had ordered the Altria Group stock sold on Friday, a day after being questioned about it by The New York Times. Altria owns Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. In a statement this week, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann said she and her husband, also a doctor, had not realized their financial adviser had bought Altria among more than 100 other stocks in their investment portfolio. “Let there be no question: I am strongly antitobacco,” she said, adding that tobacco company stock “conflicts with our values.” In an interview Monday, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann said she had written the Altria stock among others on financial disclosure forms in August 2009 and again last April, when she listed its value as $10,000 to $100,000. Dr. Desmond-Hellmann said she had thought about disposing of it earlier but it slipped her mind because she was busy running the university. “As chancellor of a leading biomedical university, my actions must advance the patient care, discovery and educational mission of U.C.S.F.,” she wrote in the statement. “Therefore, my husband and I will donate all proceeds made from the sale of the tobacco company stock to U.C.S.F.’s Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.” Stanton A. Glantz, director of the center, said the value of the donation was $134,000. “She did have this little faux pas, but I think she acted decisively, and her policy before this was excellent,” he said Wednesday.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE4DA103DF93AA15755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=altriagroupinc">University Chief Is Selling Tobacco Holdings<date>Published: June 29, 2010</date><text>When Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann was named chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco, last summer, she took over a medical institution focused on world health generally and tobacco control in particular. But she forgot one thing in adjusting to her new role: personal stock holdings listed last year in the range of $100,000 to $1 million in Altria, owner of Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Altria has been blamed for thousands of deaths and repeatedly criticized by the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the university. Last week, a day after The New York Times inquired about the Altria stock, Dr. Desmond-Hellmann and her husband, also a doctor, ordered it to be immediately sold and imposed ''values screening'' on their personal investments. ''I'd been focused on compliance, dutifully writing down every stock,'' she said in an interview on Monday, ''and we didn't focus on what are the stocks in our holdings and what message does that give to people who care about your values.'' In an updated filing, she listed the value within the range of $10,000 to $100,000, but would not explain the reason for the change in amounts. Dr. Stanton A. Glantz, director of the university's tobacco control center, said he was unaware of Dr. Desmond-Hellmann's Altria stock, which was contained in a university filing but not made public until now, after a public records request by a former student who passed it on to The Times. ''I do find that kind of shocking, but at least she got rid of it,'' Dr. Glantz said on Monday, adding that Dr. Desmond-Hellmann had been very supportive of the center. Dr. Kenneth E. Warner, dean of the school of public health at the University of Michigan and a national antitobacco leader, said, ''I find it frankly a bit appalling that the chancellor of a major medical center would have held such stock. It strikes me as unthinking, frankly.'' Tobacco stocks have been divested over the last two decades by a number of public officials and organizations, like churches, pension funds and universities -- including the University of California in 2001. Dr. Desmond-Hellmann made a fortune during 14 years at the biotech company Genentech.. She said she had not been aware that her investment adviser had bought Altria. Last summer, she said, she noticed the Altria stock while hand-writing it on a list of 133 stock holdings for a state disclosure report. It was valued at $100,000 to $1 million. ''I thought, 'Hmm, I didn't know about Altria. We should go back and think about that,' '' she said. But she said it slipped her mind. Then on Thursday, a reporter called with questions. ''When this came up, we thought, 'Gee, what are we thinking?' '' Dr. Desmond-Hellmann said of the resulting discussion with her husband. ''I'm an oncologist, he's an AIDS doctor, we're both physicians, and I'm in charge of a public university. So we both said that isn't consistent with our values.'' An Altria spokesman declined to comment. Dr. Neal L. Benowitz, a medical professor at the university and a nicotine expert, was surprised that Dr. Dedman-Hellmann owned the stock. ''I don't think people in public health should personally hold tobacco stock because it's antithetical to the public health mission, '' he said. The University of California, San Francisco, is the second-largest recipient of National Institutes of Health funding in the nation, behind Johns Hopkins University, and it also keeps a database of more than 50 million pages of tobacco industry files unearthed in litigation and investigation. Dr. Desmond-Hellmann has now ordered her investment adviser to screen for holdings in tobacco, alcohol and firearms.

Seeks Explanation Of Marlboro Marketing<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>When the F.D.A. says no ''light'' cigarettes, it evidently means it. Days before a new federal ban on making tobacco products using the words ''light'' or other terms that might imply a safer smoke, federal regulators on Thursday sent a stern letter to the Altria Group, maker of the cigarettes known as Marlboro Lights. The Food and Drug Administration asked Altria about notes that have been placed on the last packs of Marlboro Lights reading, ''Your Marlboro Lights package is changing, but your cigarette stays the same.'' The notes also say ''In the future, ask for Marlboro in the gold pack.'' The F.D.A. said it was opening an investigation into the marketing of the cigarettes, which are the nation's best-selling brand and are sold by the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria. Starting next Tuesday, tobacco companies are barred from making any products labeled ''light,'' ''mild,'' ''low'' or with ''similar descriptors,'' according to the tobacco law, which President Obama signed a year ago on that day. Anticipating the new rules, Altria and other tobacco companies have been phasing out the banned terms. But they have repackaged the same products using what critics call ''color coding'' -- lighter hues of blue, gold, silver or orange for the former ''light'' products, or in the case of menthol cigarettes, greens. Through this makeover, Marlboro Lights became simply Marlboro in a gold box. Although the cigarette companies have said they are using the colors legally to differentiate brands, the F.D.A. has already opened an investigation into the industry color coding. Now the agency wants to know more about Altria's effort to tell consumers that light is now gold, by attaching the notes -- called onserts -- onto packs of Marlboro Lights still in the distribution pipeline. The F.D.A. told Altria it had until July 30 to produce all documents related to the company's market research on consumer perceptions about the gold packages and the health risks of the cigarettes inside. The letter said the onserts ''may perpetuate the mistaken beliefs associated with your 'light' cigarettes when marketed as Marlboro in the gold pack.'' An Altria spokesman declined to discuss the specifics of the F.D.A.'s query. ''We just got this letter,'' Brendan J. McCormick, the spokesman, said Thursday afternoon. ''This is a request for information, and we certainly plan to respond to the letter and comply with the request.'' Separately, the New York City health department on Monday began an advertising campaign to tell consumers that cigarettes in lighter colored packages are still deadly. ''Don't be fooled,'' one television ad says. ''All cigarettes contain the same poisons that make you sick and kill you.''</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E2D9143FF931A35755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=altriagroupinc">Altria to Pay $971 Million To Resolve a Tax Dispute<date>Published: June 2, 2010</date><text>The Altria Group, the nation's largest tobacco company, announced on Tuesday that it would pay $971 million to resolve a tax dispute concerning leasing transactions in the years 2000 through 2003. Analysts said the decision was not surprising. ''A big number, but expected,'' David J. Adelman, tobacco industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to investors. The company made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Adelman said Altria previously paid about $150 million to conclude an Internal Revenue Service examination of its 1996-99 tax returns on a similar tax issue. He said it had also previously disclosed that it expected to face another tax liability of about $900 million for 2004 to 2009. ''This cash tax payment, just like the 2006 payment, is part of the 'normal' cadence of a federal income tax related challenge,'' Mr. Adelman wrote after the announcement. Altria, makers of the dominant Marlboro cigarette brand, said in its filing that it still reserved the right and intended to seek a refund from the I.R.S. or to bring a legal action over the tax depreciation issue. The I.R.S. declined to comment. Altria said the payment, to be made in the third quarter, would not affect its 2010 earnings guidance. The company's stock dipped in the last 15 minutes of trading on the New York Stock Exchange to close down 0.84 percent at $20.12 a share. The tax issue, not unique to Altria, concerns depreciation of some leveraged leases at the Philip Morris Capital Corporation. In recent years, the I.R.S. has challenged the decisions of some companies to accelerate tax deductions on certain leasing transactions between nonprofit and profit-making entities. Altria recently lost a federal jury decision on the issue over its acquisition of interests in a Long Island Rail Road maintenance facility, a Dutch wastewater treatment plant and two power plants. Altria, based in Richmond, Va., made a $3.2 billion profit on sales of $23.6 billion last year.

Come June, under the new federal tobacco law, cigarette companies will no longer be allowed to use words like “light” or “mild” on packages to imply that some cigarettes are safer than others. But in a move that critics say simply skirts the new rules, tobacco companies plan to use packaging to make those same distinctions: light colors for light cigarettes. So Marlboro Lights, the nation’s best-selling brand, from Philip Morris, will be renamed Marlboro Gold, according to a flier the company recently sent to distributors. Likewise, Marlboro Ultra Lights will change into Marlboro Silver. And anticipating the new rules, R.J. Reynolds has already changed Salem Ultra Lights, which are sold in a silver box, to Silver Box. “They’re circumventing the law,” said Gregory N. Connolly, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health. “They’re using color coding to perpetuate one of the biggest public health myths into the next century.” The National Cancer Institute says there are no health benefits from light cigarettes and that they may be more dangerous because some people inhale them more deeply than regular cigarettes. The Food and Drug Administration has begun a federal review of the color-coding approach, a step that could conceivably lead to further actions against products designated as light. The law taking effect this summer does not bar companies from making light cigarettes, only from using words like “light” in marketing. The industry says that it is complying and that it should be free to use colors on its packages to market different product lines to adult consumers. “Colors are really used to identify and differentiate different brand packs,” David M. Sylvia, a spokesman for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, said Thursday. “We do not use colors to communicate whether one product is less harmful or more harmful than another.” In a letter to the F.D.A. on Thursday, James E. Dillard III, a senior vice president of Altria, said banning certain colors would be unconstitutional under commercial speech and property protections. The tobacco regulation passed last year gave the F.D.A. sweeping new regulatory authority over tobacco. One new requirement is that companies must prove to the F.D.A. that a product is safer than conventional cigarettes before it can be marketed as such. While Congress specifically banned some terms, including “low” and “mild”  present on about half the packages of cigarettes sold in the United States  it also gave the F.D.A. authority to act against “similar descriptors” that could mislead consumers to think certain products were less risky. Last month, the agency published a notice that it could take action against colors like silver or pastels, as well as additional words like “silver,” “smooth” and “natural,” which some companies are still planning to use on cigarette packages. The notice sought public and industry comments, which are due Friday. Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the new F.D.A. Center for Tobacco Products, said Thursday that the agency would “thoroughly review” the use of color on cigarette packages by June 22, the effective date of the wording ban and the first anniversary of the law’s passage. As it happens, Friday is also the deadline for petitions to be filed with the Supreme Court asking it to hear appeals from the 2006 conviction of tobacco makers for racketeering in making fraudulent claims about light cigarettes. According to Professor Connolly of Harvard, the tobacco industry has known for at least a decade from World Health Organization actions that words like “light” would eventually have to come off the boxes, giving it time to prepare the other visual cues on packaging. He shared with The New York Times a set of marketing materials about the new color system that he said had been given to him by people working in the tobacco industry. The color coding, Professor Connolly said, is red and dark green for regular and menthol; blue, gold and light green for light cigarettes; and silver and orange for ultra lights. “The myth of safer cigarettes is perpetuated,” Professor Connolly said. “Light cigarettes unleashed a monster.” But rather than fight over shading and coloring on the packages, he urged the F.D.A., using its new authority, to regulate filters and ingredients in those cigarettes to make them taste harsher. Light cigarettes have a different taste because they are filtered differently and may contain additives, Professor Connolly said. Studies have shown that people who smoke light cigarettes satisfy their nicotine cravings by inhaling the smoke more deeply, smoking more cigarettes and taking more puffs on each cigarette. Altria said it had used terms like “light” as well as packaging colors to connote different tastes, not safety. But study after study  including ones by the industry disclosed in tobacco lawsuits  has shown consumers believe the terms and colors connote a safer product. Moreover, adults believe cigarette packs with the terms “smooth,” “silver” or “gold” are also easier to quit than other ones, and teenagers said they were more likely to try them, according to a survey and study published in September in the European Journal of Public Health. The survey authors, led by David Hammond, a health studies professor at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, called for plain, uncolored packaging. Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, a Washington advocacy group, said cigarette companies had responded to bans of terms like “light” and “low tar” in at least 78 countries by color-coding their packaging to convey the same ideas. “If the F.D.A. concludes that either new wording or color coding is misleading consumers,” he said, “then the F.D.A. has authority to take corrective action.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 19, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.When it comes to new rules for marketing so-called light cigarettes, tobacco companies plan to honor the letter of the law  but to shade the truth, critics say.

The company posted $25 billion in net revenue for the year, down from $25.7 billion in 2008. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $6.7 billion, up from $6.1 billion a year earlier. “Widespread market share growth and productivity initiatives, largely offset the significant market contractions and consumer down-trading that we witnessed in those countries that suffered the most from the global economic downturn,” Louis C. Camilleri, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The new share buy back program will begin in May and last three years.

After eventually acknowledging, like others in its industry, that cigarette smoking was, indeed, addictive and caused disease, Altria went a step further. It broke from the Big Tobacco pack and began supporting legislation that would ultimately put the company under the regulatory thumb of the Food and Drug Administration.Altria’s motives for submitting to strict oversight have long been a mystery. Did the company and its executives, who were internally pursuing a strategy of “societal alignment,” suddenly embrace a true partnership on public health? Or was this a case, as its longtime foes and competitors have argued, of Altria seeking to generate good P.R. or lock in its market dominance by cozying up to a regulator that could restrict rivals from marketing new products? Another possible answer was highlighted this month, as the federal government began fine-tuning aspects of a law that President Obama signed last summer that gives the government sweeping new powers to regulate the production and marketing of tobacco products. A series of letters that Altria submitted to the F.D.A. as part of that process argues that the government should, effectively, sign off on the notion that smokeless tobacco products are less harmful than cigarettes — and that Altria and other companies should be allowed to market them as such to consumers. It is a pivotal and divisive claim. While public health doctors agree that the smokeless products are far less hazardous to individuals than cigarettes, they still have concerns because all tobacco products contain nicotine and carcinogens. They also contend that promoting smokeless products — some in tiny packages in the shape of cigarette packs — would attract new, perhaps younger customers and maintain the addiction for smokers who might otherwise quit. They note that Altria is adding flavorings to its smokeless products that have long been used in candy. Furthermore, critics say, Altria’s suggestion to the F.D.A. that it be allowed to market its products as less risky is part of an effort to dodge indoor-smoking laws (which are credited with encouraging more smokers to quit) and to encourage smokers to use oral tobacco products as supplements. “If you look at how they’re marketing smokeless now, they’re marketing for dual use, and to protect the cigarette market, which is their big money maker,” says Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of cardiology and a specialist in tobacco research at the University of California, San Francisco. UNDER its gregarious chief executive, an occasional smoker named Michael E. Szymanczyk, Altria is treading carefully when it comes to talking about its business strategies or its relationship with the F.D.A. After its letters to the regulator made headlines this month, the company canceled interviews for this article with top executives at its headquarters in Richmond, Va. An Altria spokesman says the executives declined to comment because “we don’t want to be perceived as leading the discussion” on the regulatory front. Brendan J. McCormick, another Altria spokesman, says the company supported the legislation enacted last summer because it believed that the F.D.A. offered the best way to settle the debates about tobacco use and marketing, which have raged for decades. He says the company believes that F.D.A. standards will create more predictability in the industry and a level playing field for competitors. Moreover, he says, the F.D.A. provides a forum to evaluate products that are potentially less harmful — and if the agency agrees with its argument, the company could market them with a federal imprimatur. Mr. McCormick says Altria doesn’t agree with criticisms that the new tobacco law and the company’s willingness to work closely with its regulator cement its market dominance. “This is a dynamic industry,” he says. And Altria is a changing company. It spent $11.7 billion last year to acquire UST, formerly the United States Tobacco Company and home to popular snuff brands like Copenhagen and Skoal. The merger made Altria the biggest cigarette and chew company in the country, controlling 50 percent of the cigarette market and 55 percent of the smokeless market. The deal also solved several quandaries facing the company. The biggest was that, after its spinoff of Kraft Foods and the less-regulated, faster-growing Philip Morris International units in recent years, Altria had become a stand-alone domestic cigarette company in a declining industry. Bans on indoor smoking, along with rising federal and state excise taxes, have accelerated a long-term decline in the volume of domestic cigarette sales. Volumes may be declining, but cigarettes remain Altria’s biggest business by far, accounting for $14.4 billion in revenue in 2009. (Smokeless brought in $1.2 billion.) Cigarette profits are growing thanks to price increases and a customer base of people who haven’t kicked the habit. About 70 percent of the nation’s 46 million smokers say they want to quit, government surveys show, and about 40 percent try every year. But only 2.5 percent succeed, the surveys say. The government estimates that 400,000 Americans die of smoking-related diseases each year.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/opinion/27fri3.html?ref=altriagroupinc">A Big Loss for Big Tobacco<date>Published: November 26, 2009</date><text>A Florida jury has ordered Philip Morris USA to pay $300 million to a former smoker who developed severe emphysema and may need a lung transplant.

Last week, the jury awarded her $56 million in compensatory damages and $244 million in punitive damages, the most damages for an individual suing a tobacco company. Florida has become a hotbed of tobacco litigation. A few years ago, its Supreme Court rejected a class-action lawsuit, and a $145 billion plaintiffs’ award, and told the class members they had to sue individually. It said the plaintiffs would not have to again prove important elements of the case, including that nicotine is addictive and that smoking causes illnesses. Those suits are working their way through the courts. The tobacco industry likes to argue that smokers assumed the risk of smoking, and are responsible for their injuries. But the industry spent years denying that its products were addictive or deadly. It continues to spend billions on advertising, giveaways and other marketing to persuade people to smoke. Lawyers are often reluctant to represent smokers and former smokers. Suits against the tobacco industry, which is known for its tough litigation tactics, can take years and be extremely expensive. Last week’s $300 million verdict, which could still be reversed or reduced on appeal, provides a strong incentive for others to sue. Big awards can send a message to the tobacco industry, or be regarded as simply a cost of doing business.

Douglas of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network. A state supreme court ruling in Florida a few years ago made it easier to pursue tobacco lawsuits there than in other states. But the tobacco industry, which plans to appeal, appeared unfazed. Tobacco companies have considered product liability suits as little more than a cost of doing business since the seven biggest companies agreed to pay $206 billion in a master settlement agreement with 46 states in 1998. Florida, despite being one of those states, had a major legal ruling in 2006 that lowered a plaintiff’s burden of proof against a tobacco company. The Florida Supreme Court rejected a class-action verdict and a $145 billion award to plaintiffs, saying smokers would have to sue individually. But the court said plaintiffs would not have to prove some key elements that had been upheld in the first stage of the class action: that nicotine is addictive, that smoking causes diseases, and that cigarette companies fraudulently hid those facts. “That makes these cases in Florida unique,” Mr. Douglas said. Smokers in other states are still suing cigarette makers, he said, but they have higher legal hurdles. A spokesman for the Altria Group, the Virginia-based parent company of Philip Morris USA, indicated it would appeal the verdict and said the Florida rules were “fundamentally unfair and unconstitutional.” Shares of Altria, which had been up more than 27 percent this year, dropped 1.2 percent Friday, to $18.98. Lucinda Naugle, the 61-year-old sister of a former Fort Lauderdale mayor, was awarded $56 million in compensatory damages and $244 million in punitive damages Thursday after a three-week trial and three hours of jury deliberation in Broward County Circuit Court. Ms. Naugle, an office manager, had started smoking when she was 20 and quit when she was 45 years old, her lawyer, Robert W. Kelley of Fort Lauderdale, said in a telephone interview Friday. She now has severe emphysema and needs a lung transplant she cannot afford, he said. The jury assigned her 10 percent of the liability for her smoking and disease, and Philip Morris 90 percent. “She’ll get paid, I would hope, within a year or two,” Mr. Kelley said. “The question is will she live long enough.” Mr. Kelley said about 25 more cases were lined up for trial in Florida next year. In all, more than 9,000 people from the former class action filed individual suits in various courts in Florida against tobacco makers by January 2008, the deadline set by the state Supreme Court. About 4,000 of those cases were filed in federal court and have been stayed, pending a review scheduled in January by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta. Brendan J. McCormick, a spokesman for Altria, said Friday that the company expected the federal appellate court to reject the standards of proof set by the state Supreme Court. “What you have is a defined number of cases in Florida with unique issues that will ultimately be resolved on appeal,” he said. David J. Adelman, a tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley, said the Florida case and, separately, forthcoming class-action lawsuits over light cigarette claims pose an “undeniable” increase in the industry’s legal risk “which had previously declined to an unprecedented low point.” In an interview, Mr. Adelman noted that there were no jury trials in cigarette cases all of last year, and that other states had decertified class-action suits in ways more favorable to the tobacco industry. Further, Mr. Adelman said, the major legal threats to the industry were removed by the 1998 settlement with states. And since then, the industry has fended off calls in court and Congress for a huge disgorgement of its profits. Even in light of the Florida verdict, Mr. Adelman said the tobacco industry could afford several hundred million dollars a year in legal losses if it had to. “That is a financially manageable issue,” he said. Of more concern, he said in the interview and a note to investors, is a coming round of cases claiming fraud and damages from past marketing of so-called light cigarettes. Those products have been shown to be no less harmful than regular cigarettes because smokers inhale them more deeply. Congress, in landmark tobacco legislation earlier this year, prohibited the use of the terms “light,” “low” or “mild” in all cigarette labeling and marketing, effective June 22, 2010. The first of the “light cigarette” class-action cases is scheduled in Minnesota next October, followed by Missouri in January 2011.

But the investor Warren Buffett has said that some apparently drooping businesses can deliver more puff than expected. He called such stocks cigar butts, and Altria could be one of them. Most of Altria’s profit comes from its cigarette subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, which in turn relies heavily on Marlboro. So it’s somewhat alarming that Altria shipped 16 percent fewer cigarettes in the third quarter than a year earlier  even though Marlboro’s share of the United States market actually edged up to 41.9 percent in the quarter. With health care reform top of the agenda in Washington, the tobacco business is also still an obvious target. From 2000 to 2004, smoking was responsible for $193 billion in annual health-related economic losses, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the government tries to cut health care costs by discouraging smoking, there could be more taxes imposed like the April increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes. Yet it wasn’t all bad at Altria in the third quarter. Net revenue excluding excise taxes fell 11.3 percent in the cigarette segment  less than the decline in volume, suggesting the company managed to raise average prices. Add in other businesses including UST, the chewing tobacco and snuff maker acquired by Altria this year, and the group managed to eke out a 1.7 percent overall increase in profit as net revenue excluding taxes slid just 0.5 percent in the quarter. Cost cutting helped, too. Altria’s stock currently trades at just under 10 times consensus estimates of 2010 earnings, slightly below Reynolds American’s multiple, despite what some analysts view as a more powerful stable of products. Pricing power, especially at Marlboro, could surprise  as could cost cutting and contributions by the smaller business units. It would be oddly fitting if the tobacco-dominated company did turn out to be one of Mr. Buffett’s cigar butts. Overvalued Euro? How times have changed for the euro. It was once widely seen as an experiment bound to fail. Now, as the dollar wanes, the common European currency is the star, riding high at $1.50. But does the euro deserve it? The answer is probably not. Back in October 2000, the single currency was at $0.84. Then, commentators wrote about how it was at a “critical stage.” The obituaries were ready to run. But the euro didn’t die. Over the next nine years, it strengthened by 79 percent. Buying the euro when all looked dark would have been a good idea. Now, investors are writing obituaries for the dollar. It seems to have nothing going for it. The Federal Reserve’s target overnight interest rate is virtually zero. The Obama administration’s fiscal deficit is stratospheric. And even good news about United States economic growth provokes dollar selling. But the euro really isn’t worthy of its current star status. The strains in the region where it is used weren’t serious in 2000, but they are now. Germany and Italy are on course for 5 percent declines in their economies  twice the pullback seen in the supposedly hopeless United States. The German unemployment rate, at 8.2 percent, is healthy compared with Belgium’s or Ireland’s, at over 12 percent. Spain’s is a horrific 19 percent. To aid recovery, the euro zone needs an active economic policy and a competitive currency. But estimates of the euro’s purchasing power against other currencies suggest it is close to 30 percent overvalued. For countries like Spain, Greece, Italy and Ireland, where wages raced ahead in the good years, the effective level of overvaluation is even higher. What can be done? Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, can try to talk the euro down. But more effective would be recognition that reports of the dollar’s demise are exaggerated. That will come when the Fed hints that growth has returned and that interest rates will soon be rising. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.

He was 90. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Neal Boenzi/The New York Times George Weissman, long an executive at Philip Morris, became chairman of Lincoln Center in 1986, serving until 1994. The cause was complications of a recent fall at his home in Rye, N.Y., his son Paul said. Mr. Weissman began his corporate ascent in the movie and public relations businesses, and one of his early tasks as a young marketing executive at Philip Morris  which became part of the Altria group in 2003  was to help develop the very effective masculine mythology of Marlboro cigarettes. He applied similar deftness when Philip Morris acquired Miller Brewing in 1969 and came up with the new Miller Lite brand. Mr. Weissman also pushed Philip Morris to become a major donor to arts groups, particularly experimental undertakings like the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. He said in an interview with The New York Times in 1990 that the arts initiative began with a traveling exhibition of modern art in 1965. “We wanted to demonstrate to our own employees that we were an open-minded company seeking creativity in all aspects of our business,” Mr. Weissman said. “And we were determined to do this by sponsoring things that made a difference, that were really dangerous.” In an interview with Forbes in 1983, he said that giving to the arts also impressed customers, and that more people go to museums than ballgames. In 1983, Mr. Weissman installed a branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art on the ground floor of the company’s new Park Avenue headquarters, across from Grand Central Terminal. He was on the Whitney board from 1979 to 1990. When Mr. Weissman retired as chairman of the company in 1984, he spoke of fishing for salmon. But he was soon as busy as ever, becoming vice chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1984, then serving as chairman from 1986 to 1994. He oversaw the construction of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building and united all 12 Lincoln Center constituents in a 19-month festival to honor Mozart’s bicentennial. He also encouraged the Classical Jazz series, a forerunner of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which eventually got its own space, in 2004. George Weissman, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, was born in the Bronx on July 12, 1919. After graduating from Townsend Harris High School, he earned a degree in business administration from the business school of the City College of New York. He then edited a small weekly newspaper in New Jersey and worked as a reporter for The Star-Ledger, based in Newark. He joined the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor, helping to chase submarines and shell beachheads for 3 1/2 years. After his discharge, he wrote a review of the Samuel Goldwyn movie “The Best Years of Our Lives” for some labor papers. Goldwyn hired him as a publicity agent at $125 a week. After Goldwyn fired him in a dispute over promoting a movie, he got a job with Benjamin Sonnenberg, who is credited with helping create the modern public relations industry. Soon, Mr. Weissman was devoted full time to the Philip Morris account. He was hired in 1952 as assistant to the president of Philip Morris. In 1960, Mr. Weissman became chief executive of Philip Morris International, where he helped build up overseas sales to the point that they accounted for a third of both sales and earnings for the entire company. In 1966, he was named president of Philip Morris itself, and he guided the company’s strategy of using profits from cigarettes to expand into other businesses, including the acquisition of the Seven-Up Company in 1978. When Mr. Weissman became chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris in 1978, he told Fortune magazine that he saw himself as the quintessential Marlboro man. “I’m no cowboy and I don’t ride horseback,” he said, “but I like to think I have the freedom the Marlboro man exemplifies. He’s the man who doesn’t punch a clock. He’s not computerized. He’s a free spirit.” Mr. Weissman had few compunctions about describing his own habits. “Forty cigarettes a day, one or two beers and I also drink some wine,” he said in a press conference in Paris in 1980. Under his leadership, Philip Morris employed blacks in prominent executive positions, resulting in boycotts in some places in the South. The company also advertised in black and Hispanic newspapers and magazines. Mr. Weissman joined other business leaders in signing petitions against the Vietnam War. When the Nixon administration’s “enemies list” was released by a Senate committee in 1973, he was on it. In addition to his son Paul, Mr. Weissman is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Mildred Stregack; his daughter, Ellen; his son Daniel; and a grandson. Mr. Weissman told Forbes in 1980 that he felt Philip Morris had a “Masada complex,” referring to the desperate defense of first-century Jews against powerful Roman legions. He said it first fought the tobacco industry as it clawed its way up the ladder, then the government and anti- smoking activists. He seemed to have trouble understanding the view of those who argued that arts organizations should refuse tobacco money as tainted. “Do you stop the Bolshoi from coming here because you don’t believe in the Russian system?” he said in an interview with The Times in 1987.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Heidi Schumann for The New York Times Analynn LaChica smoking on a work break in San Francisco. Related Cost of Cigarette Litter May Fall on San Franciscos Smokers (May 19, 2009) “Littering is one of my pet peeves, and I always told my kids they’d be in big trouble if I catch them doing it,” said Ms. Scott, a 43-year-old financial executive, as she sat outside an office tower on Michigan Avenue in Chicago on a recent sunny afternoon. “I see people throw stuff out their car windows, and I cringe.” Yet she confesses that she routinely discards cigarette butts on the sidewalk. For her and countless other American smokers, cigarette butts are an exception to the no-littering rule. “Aren’t cigarettes biodegradable?” volunteered Libby Moustakas, a co-worker who was enjoying a smoking break with Ms. Scott. But dozens of municipalities across the nation have had enough. Weary of the butts’ unsightliness and the costs of sweeping them up, cities have passed bans on smoking on beaches and playgrounds. In San Francisco, Mayor Gavin Newsom said last week that he would go a step further, seeking a 33-cents-a-pack tax to cover the $11 million that the city spends annually to remove cigarette litter. Nationally, cigarette butts account for one-quarter or more of the items tossed onto streets and other roadways, San Francisco and other cities report. Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, described this as a predictable outcome of poor product design. “There is no good practical way of dealing with cigarettes,” he said. “You have a fiery object in your hand and so you have to throw it down and crush it under your heel. And then we have to clean it up.” In her defense, Ms. Scott, the Chicago executive, pointed out that her city does not provide enough receptacles, like concrete planters filled with sand. And she fears that throwing them in a trash can could ignite a fire. Still other smokers see butts as a more natural kind of trash than, say, a plastic bottle. But they are not biodegradable: they contain plastic filters that enter sewers and storm drains, and get swept into rivers and then out to sea, where they can release toxic chemicals including nicotine, benzene and cadmium. For years, campaigns for heavy per-pack taxes and smoking bans in office buildings, restaurants and bars were driven mainly by health concerns about secondhand smoke, which can lead to lung cancer, emphysema and other diseases. In moving on to butt litter, municipalities are reckoning with the broader environmental consequences of the country’s most vilified personal habit. Cigarette companies acknowledge the problem. The Cigarette Litter Prevention Program, created by the nonprofit group Keep America Beautiful, is financed by Philip Morris, the cigarette giant. The prevention program’s statistics show that butts constitute 28 percent to 33 percent of all litter nationwide  measured by item number, not volume. Similarly, the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which also receives money from Philip Morris, has found that butts account for 28 percent of littered items washing up on beaches worldwide. The manufacturers say they are working on making their product more environmentally friendly. Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest cigarette maker, said the industry viewed the development of a biodegradable cigarette to be its “holy grail,” but that challenges persisted. Cigarette company documents indicate that consumers have not liked the taste or the draw of alternative filters. William R. Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said his company favored programs that hold smokers and cities responsible for reducing the trash. For example, the Keep America Beautiful campaign promotes solutions like portable ashtrays, more receptacles in public areas and better enforcement of littering laws, he said. Last year, the program had 178 cities or urban districts enlisted  the university district in Philadelphia and the arts district in Dallas, for example  that reduced cigarette littering by an average of 46 percent, officials said. That approach is favored by Analynn LaChica, 34, who works for AT&amp;T in San Francisco. Ms. LaChica estimates that of the 5 to 10 cigarettes she smokes each day, at least three butts end up on the ground. “People who smoke use it as a stress reliever,” she explained. “It is satisfying to just toss it down when you are done.” Nonetheless, she said, she would change her behavior if San Francisco installed ashtrays on top of trash receptacles. Putting it out that way would be more “ladylike,” she said. For many environmentalists, the problem is not just the litter, but the toxicity. Thomas Novotny, a professor of global health at San Diego State University who supports the San Francisco proposal and beach bans elsewhere, said recent experiments had shown that one butt has enough poisons to kill half the minnows in a liter of water  a standard laboratory test for toxins  in 96 hours. “Butts are full of poisonous substances, including nicotine, which is a pesticide,” Professor Novotny said. Some smokers are getting the message. Alex Ceruti, 32, a business owner in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, said he had always discarded his butt in an ashtray or other receptacle after finishing a cigarette. “That’s the only part of the cigarette that is not biodegradable,” he said. “I think it’s nasty the way people throw them on the ground,” Mr. Ceruti added, observing a young tattooed woman who cast her cigarette on the sidewalk before entering a coffee shop. Mr. Ceruti and his friend Marcos van Dulken, 26, who also smokes, say they even patrol their favorite beach once in a while to pick up filters. “I’m not going to lie,” said Mr. van Dulken, an actor who owns a small production company. “Sometimes I throw them on the ground. But I really try not to do that.” Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting from Chicago, Malia Wollan from San Francisco and Carmen Gentile Jr. from Miami Beach.

Nathan Ballard, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom, described this as a predictable outcome of poor product design. “There is no good practical way of dealing with cigarettes,” he said. “You have a fiery object in your hand and so you have to throw it down and crush it under your heel. And then we have to clean it up.” In her defense, Ms. Scott, the Chicago executive, pointed out that her city does not provide enough receptacles, like concrete planters filled with sand. And she fears that throwing them in a trash can could ignite a fire. Still other smokers see butts as a more natural kind of trash than, say, a plastic bottle. But they are not biodegradable: they contain plastic filters that enter sewers and storm drains, and get swept into rivers and then out to sea, where they can release toxic chemicals including nicotine, benzene and cadmium. For years, campaigns for heavy per-pack taxes and smoking bans in office buildings, restaurants and bars were driven mainly by health concerns about secondhand smoke, which can lead to lung cancer, emphysema and other diseases. In moving on to butt litter, municipalities are reckoning with the broader environmental consequences of the country’s most vilified personal habit. Cigarette companies acknowledge the problem. The Cigarette Litter Prevention Program, created by the nonprofit group Keep America Beautiful, is financed by Philip Morris, the cigarette giant. The prevention program’s statistics show that butts constitute 28 percent to 33 percent of all litter nationwide  measured by item number, not volume. Similarly, the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which also receives money from Philip Morris, has found that butts account for 28 percent of littered items washing up on beaches worldwide. The manufacturers say they are working on making their product more environmentally friendly. Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest cigarette maker, said the industry viewed the development of a biodegradable cigarette to be its “holy grail,” but that challenges persisted. Cigarette company documents indicate that consumers have not liked the taste or the draw of alternative filters. William R. Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said his company favored programs that hold smokers and cities responsible for reducing the trash. For example, the Keep America Beautiful campaign promotes solutions like portable ashtrays, more receptacles in public areas and better enforcement of littering laws, he said. Last year, the program had 178 cities or urban districts enlisted  the university district in Philadelphia and the arts district in Dallas, for example  that reduced cigarette littering by an average of 46 percent, officials said. That approach is favored by Analynn LaChica, 34, who works for AT&amp;T in San Francisco. Ms. LaChica estimates that of the 5 to 10 cigarettes she smokes each day, at least three butts end up on the ground. “People who smoke use it as a stress reliever,” she explained. “It is satisfying to just toss it down when you are done.” Nonetheless, she said, she would change her behavior if San Francisco installed ashtrays on top of trash receptacles. Putting it out that way would be more “ladylike,” she said. For many environmentalists, the problem is not just the litter, but the toxicity. Thomas Novotny, a professor of global health at San Diego State University who supports the San Francisco proposal and beach bans elsewhere, said recent experiments had shown that one butt has enough poisons to kill half the minnows in a liter of water  a standard laboratory test for toxins  in 96 hours. “Butts are full of poisonous substances, including nicotine, which is a pesticide,” Professor Novotny said. Some smokers are getting the message. Alex Ceruti, 32, a business owner in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, said he had always discarded his butt in an ashtray or other receptacle after finishing a cigarette. “That’s the only part of the cigarette that is not biodegradable,” he said. “I think it’s nasty the way people throw them on the ground,” Mr. Ceruti added, observing a young tattooed woman who cast her cigarette on the sidewalk before entering a coffee shop. Mr. Ceruti and his friend Marcos van Dulken, 26, who also smokes, say they even patrol their favorite beach once in a while to pick up filters. “I’m not going to lie,” said Mr. van Dulken, an actor who owns a small production company. “Sometimes I throw them on the ground. But I really try not to do that.” Karen Ann Cullotta contributed reporting from Chicago, Malia Wollan from San Francisco and Carmen Gentile Jr. from Miami Beach.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/us/23tobacco.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Tobacco Companies Lose Appeal<date>Published: May 22, 2009</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP)  A federal appeals court on Friday agreed with the major elements of a 2006 landmark ruling that found the nation’s top tobacco companies guilty of racketeering and fraud for deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Jim Wilson/The New York Times San Francisco spends an estimated $10.7 million a year removing cigarette butts from gutters, drainpipes and sidewalks. The proposal, to be introduced next month to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, would add 33 cents to the cost of a pack of cigarettes, to offset the estimated $10.7 million the city spends annually removing discarded butts from gutters, drainpipes and sidewalks. The added cost, Mr. Newsom hopes, will also dampen smokers’ urge to light up. “In general, fees help reduce the consumption and use of tobacco,” he said in an interview. “And we think that will have a very beneficial public health component.” Officials here say the municipal fee would be the first in the country to take aim specifically at cigarette butts, particularly filters, which are not biodegradable. But the idea is expected to run into fierce opposition from tobacco companies. “Obviously we think people should follow the littering laws, in California and elsewhere,” said Frank Lester, a spokesman for Reynolds American Inc., the nation’s second-largest manufacturer of cigarettes. “But we oppose any additional taxation on smokers to pay for that.” Philip Morris USA, the nation’s biggest cigarette company, generally echoed that anti-fee sentiment, though it said it would not comment on Mr. Newsom’s proposal specifically until it was formally presented to the board. San Francisco has already proved to be tough on smokers. Last year the city imposed a ban on the sale of tobacco at drugstores, a restriction that is being challenged in state and federal courts. Mr. Newsom, moreover, has shown a willingness to legislate good health in other ways, proposing a fee in 2007 on any large store that sells drinks with high levels of fructose corn syrup. This so-called soda tax has not yet been taken up by the Board of Supervisors but is expected to be debated there this summer, said Nathan Ballard, a mayoral spokesman. Mr. Newsom said cigarette butts became a target after San Francisco’s annual “litter audit” found that cigarette detritus made up a quarter of all the trash in the city’s public spaces. With the city spending some $44 million a year on litter cleanup  and facing a $500 million deficit for the coming fiscal year  a fee was born. “It’s not a huge part of the overall budget,” the mayor said of the $11 million or so in annual revenue that the fee could generate. “But it’s enough to keep street sweepers employed.” But Mr. Lester, of Reynolds American, said smokers were often targets of budget-crunched legislators, most recently on April 1, when the federal excise tax on cigarettes rose 62 cents a pack, to $1.01. “We feel smokers are already paying their fair share,” he said. Serena Chen, regional director of policy and tobacco programs for the American Lung Association in California, said litter-mitigation efforts aimed specifically at cigarettes had been proposed in legislatures in a couple of states (though never enacted), but that a city-level approach was new and welcome. “Anytime you raise the price of cigarettes, you discourage new starters,” Ms. Chen said, “and you increase the motivation of people who want to quit.” More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on May 19, 2009, on page A14 of the New York edition.SAN FRANCISCO  In what he casts as an attack on litterbugs and nicotine addiction alike, Mayor Gavin Newsom wants to impose a fee on an age-old inhabitant of city streets: the cigarette butt.

Philip Morris International emphasized its 2008 profit: $16.3 billion on the sale of 850 billion cigarettes outside the United States. But antitobacco advocates in the audience chose to cite the estimated 5.4 million people around the globe who died last year from smoking-related causes. The meeting in Midtown Manhattan was the first annual shareholder event since Philip Morris split off its international unit last year as a separate business from the American tobacco operations. Louis C. Camilleri, the chairman of Philip Morris International, noted that profits rose from a range of price increases, even as sales of cigarette units were virtually flat. Highlighting figures previously released, Mr. Camilleri said the company’s revenue was up 6.6 percent last year, to $25.7 billion, excluding excise taxes. “We have demonstrated our ability to use pricing in order to improve profitability even in recessionary times,” Mr. Camilleri said. First-quarter 2009 sales increased another 6.3 percent, he said, “driven by price increases across a broad range of markets.” While many in the audience of about 200 shareholders seemed pleased with the data, about 30 dissidents in the room used the event to protest smoking’s toll. One woman asked for a minute of silence for people who died last year from smoking-related causes. The ballroom fell silent. Then Mr. Camilleri said, “Thank you” and took the next question, from a supportive shareholder, whom he promised handsome dividends. He said the company, midway through a two-year, $13 billion share repurchase program, would return more than 65 percent of earnings to stockholders this year. During the meeting, six people in the audience, their heads covered with black hoods, held signs about the death toll from smoking. Among items up for vote, shareholders approved Mr. Camilleri’s eligibility for $9.4 million in incentive pay for 2008, making his total compensation $32 million, up from the $24 million in compensation Mr. Camilleri made the previous year, as chairman of Philip Morris’s parent, Altria.

The question this time was, in essence, whether the Oregon Supreme Court had acted with lawless impudence in refusing to follow the United States Supreme Court’s instructions in an earlier decision in the case. In 2007, in its second ruling in the case, the United State Supreme Court said that jurors might have impermissibly calculated the damages against Philip Morris at the trial in 1999. The jury instructions allowed for the possibility of awarding damages based in part on harm to other, unnamed smokers in addition to Jesse D. Williams, the man whose widow, Mayola Williams, brought the lawsuit. “The Oregon Supreme Court applied the wrong Constitutional standard,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote for the majority in 2007, and it should now “apply the standard we have set forth.” But the Oregon Supreme Court stuck to its original ruling, saying for the first time that it was supported by a principle of state law, one beyond the power of the United States Supreme Court to re-examine. The jury instructions Philip Morris had submitted at trial violated state law in minor but fatal ways, the state supreme court said. At the argument before the United States Supreme Court in December, Stephen M. Shapiro, a lawyer for Philip Morris, called the state court proceedings “a game of gotcha.” Some justices seemed to indicate that they were frustrated by the possibility of intransigence and gamesmanship. “Is there any way for us to ensure against, in effect, a bad-faith response to our decision?” Justice David H. Souter asked, for instance. But there were also indications that the Oregon court had discovered a winning strategy in the case, Philip Morris USA v. Williams.

But he added, “I’m not sure I think that now.” Near the end of the argument, it seemed possible that the justices might use the case to explore again the broader question of the proper ratio between compensatory damages, which are meant to make the plaintiff whole, and punitive ones, which are meant to punish and deter. “There is, of course, another way to protect our Constitutional authority in this case,” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. “If there is something malodorous about the fact that the Oregon Supreme Court waited until the last minute to come up with this rule that was before them all the time,” he continued, perhaps the United States Supreme Court should agree to decide whether the punitive award here, which was 97 times as large as the compensatory award of $821,000, should be allowed to stand. With interest, the $79.5 million award has roughly doubled since 1999. Recent Supreme Court decisions have suggested that the ratio between punitive and compensatory awards should not ordinarily exceed a single digit and should perhaps be capped at 1:1. In the end, though, the court did not call for further briefing on that point or explain why it threw in the towel altogether.

The case was brought by three smokers from Maine as a proposed class action. They sued Altria and its Philip Morris USA unit, alleging fraud under Maine's Unfair Trade Practices Act and saying they had been injured by what they called the false statements of the companies. They sought compensation for economic rather than medical harm. They claimed, in other words, that they had overpaid for cigarettes based on deceptive advertisements suggesting that ''light'' cigarettes were safer than regular ones; they did not seek money for injuries caused by smoking itself. It is undisputed that brands like Marlboro Lights, made by Philip Morris, register lower levels of tar and nicotine than ordinary cigarettes when smoked by machines under a standard method authorized by the Federal Trade Commission. But many smokers compensate by puffing harder, smoking more cigarettes or inhaling deeper. The question before the court was not whether use of the term ''light'' amounted to fraud. It was, rather, whether plaintiffs should be allowed to sue at all given the federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, which required tobacco companies to place rotating warnings on their packaging and advertising. The law also said that ''no requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion'' of cigarettes so long as the law's labeling requirements were followed. Sixteen years ago, in a decision that produced no majority opinion, a four-justice plurality said the phrase ''based on smoking and health'' in the labeling law did not apply to pre-empt suits under state laws based on the ''general duty not to make fraudulent statements.'' Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by three justices no longer on the court, wrote the plurality opinion in the case, Cipollone v. Liggett Group Inc. He conceded that the distinction he drew lacked ''theoretical elegance.'' Indeed, the lower courts have struggled to make sense of that fractured decision. At the argument of the Altria case in October, its lawyer, Theodore B. Olson, called the plurality opinion in Cipollone ''baffling, confusing, litigation-generating.'' Justice Stevens asked Mr. Olson whether the court would need to ''reject the fraud analysis in Cipollone'' for Altria to win. Mr. Olson said yes. But Justice Stevens, writing for the majority on Monday, instead reaffirmed his plurality opinion in Cipollone and turned it into binding law. He was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. Alan E. Untereiner, the author of a book on the pre-emption defense and a lawyer who often represents business groups and companies arguing for pre-emption, said Monday's decision was ''a step backward in the recent trend of making pre-emption law more coherent. I can't remember the last time the court took a plurality opinion that caused this much confusion and bewilderment in the lower courts, and elevated it into a majority opinion.'' The majority also rejected Altria's backup argument, that the Federal Trade Commission's policies and actions had pre-empted the plaintiffs' claims by implication. Altria argued that the commission had authorized the use of words and phrases like ''light'' and ''low tar.'' The majority flatly rejected that assertion, in language that may be helpful to the Justice Department in a separate racketeering suit against the tobacco industry pending in the federal appeals court in Washington. ''It seems particularly inappropriate,'' Justice Stevens wrote, ''to read a policy of authorization into the F.T.C's inaction'' given tobacco companies' failure to tell the commission about studies concerning how ''consumers of 'light' cigarettes actually inhale.'' The plaintiffs in the case, Altria Group Inc. v. Good, No. 07-562, were supported on the implied pre-emption argument by the federal government, which took no position on whether the labeling law pre-empted the Maine statute in so many words.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/opinion/16tue1.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Big Loss for Big Tobacco<date>Published: December 15, 2008</date><text>The Supreme Court handed tobacco companies a major and well-deserved setback on Monday, saying smokers may proceed with lawsuits arguing that they were deceived by the marketing of “light” cigarettes.

They argue that Philip Morris’s contention that these cigarettes deliver less tar and nicotine to smokers than regular brands was untrue. Even though each light cigarette has less tar and nicotine than a regular cigarette, the plaintiffs say that Philip Morris knew that smokers unconsciously smoke them differently, taking larger puffs, for instance, or holding the smoke longer in their lungs to make up for the difference in the cigarettes’ strength. Because that allows them to extract the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes, the smokers argue that the company’s marketing violates the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act’s prohibition on deceptive business practices. Philip Morris, which denied that its marketing was inaccurate, argued that the smokers’ case had to be thrown out because state laws like Maine’s are pre-empted by federal cigarette regulations when they are applied to cigarette marketing. The pre-emption defense is based on the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which says that where there are conflicts between federal and state laws, federal laws must prevail. The majority opinion, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, rightly said that there is no actual conflict between federal and state law. Philip Morris argued that the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, passed in 1965, wiped away the plaintiffs’ state deceptive-marketing claim. But as the majority pointed out, the labeling act  which requires health warnings on cigarette packages  was intended to prevent states from imposing their own rules relating to smoking and health. It does not pre-empt laws like Maine’s that create a general duty not to deceive consumers. The ruling, which breaks with the court’s previous major decision involving cigarettes and pre-emption, clears the way for similar lawsuits against cigarette companies to proceed in other states. Important as such litigation is for deterring false cigarette advertising, the case may have broader reverberations. In recent years, the Supreme Court has issued a series of rulings  on everything from punitive damages to the criminal case against Enron’s accounting firm  that have made it harder for ordinary Americans to hold corporate wrongdoers accountable. In these troubled economic times, as the nation is still trying to come to terms with the enormous damage done by the deregulation of the mortgage industry, the national mood is turning strongly toward greater regulation. It has often been observed that the Supreme Court has a tendency to follow the election returns, and it may have done so here. With this decision, the court might be indicating a greater appreciation that when companies do wrong, there needs to be a legal means of holding them accountable.

Go to The Board » The 5-to-4 ruling  with Justice Anthony Kennedy casting his swing vote with the court’s four most liberal members  could do a great deal to rein in deceptive advertising by cigarette manufacturers.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Altria Group Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Chester Higgins Jr./The New York Times About 440,000 square feet of office space is available for rent at 120 Park Avenue. Altria, which was in the midst of a corporate restructuring, moved its headquarters to Richmond, Va., in March, and spun off Philip Morris International. On Monday, the Altria Group, which still owns Philip Morris USA, announced it would acquire UST for more than $10 billion in cash. Somewhat overlooked in all of this corporate churn has been the tobacco company’s grand, but also quirky, former headquarters building in New York, which is directly opposite the main entrance to Grand Central Terminal. In the early 1980s, the company built a lavish new skyscraper at 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, which was initially called the Philip Morris Research Center and Headquarters. The building was designed in the International Style by the prominent New York architect Ulrich Franzen and constructed on the site of a low-rise building known as the Airlines Terminal Building.. Until this year, the company was the sole occupant of the 26-story, 650,000-square-foot tower. So, although the building sits at a highly visible crossroads in Midtown Manhattan, its interior largely remained a mystery in real estate and business circles. But that changed this summer, when brokers began leading tours through 120 Park Avenue, where 440,000 square feet of office space is available for rent. Altria and Philip Morris International have leased back the fifth through eighth floors, around 100,000 square feet altogether. The lower four floors hold the lobby and public spaces. Most floors from the ninth up are exactly as Altria left them, including the ceiling fans to accommodate smokers in the days before strict antismoking laws. “We bought a private building,” said Michael Alter, president of 120 Park Avenue Associates, a unit of Global Holdings, which is part of the family interests of Eyal Ofer, an Israeli-born, London-based global real estate investor. “This building did not belong to the office inventory in New York City, so we need to introduce it to the market.” Altria sold the building for $525 million in March, and the closing was timed to coincide with its corporate restructuring that month, according to an Altria spokesman, David Sutton. The company reported a pretax gain of $404 million from the sale of the building. Mr. Ofer has spent three decades building a global real estate investment portfolio. Mr. Alter said the potential tenants were expected to be primarily financial and law firms. He said he was confident that the building would command the rents being sought. Brokers say the asking annual rents are $110 to $120 a square foot for space up to the 21st floor and $130 to $150 a square foot for the former Altria executive suites on the 22nd to the 26th floors. Professionals say such rates are above average for Park Avenue office rents south of Grand Central Terminal. But 120 Park Avenue is an unusual building. Philip Morris executives enjoyed some perks that brokers say could appeal to hedge fund managers, corporate executives and law firm partners. For example, there is an executive parking garage four levels below ground with 15 private spaces. If a single large company rented all of the available floors in 120 Park Avenue, it would be given the use of this garage. If the building were split up among several tenants, each of them might get one or more spaces, said Paul N. Glickman, the vice chairman of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who is the leasing agent for this building. Three other levels below ground have more than 70,000 square feet combined. Altria used these floors for its company cafeteria, mailroom, copy center and other back-office functions. Mr. Glickman said new tenants might get to use some of this space for similar purposes, depending on how much space they leased. At the other extreme of the building, each of the executive offices on the 22nd floor has sliding glass doors to balconies wrapping around three sides of the building, which have sweeping views of the Chrysler building and south across Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Mr. Glickman said another appealing feature was the potential branding opportunity, which includes the possibility of adding a facade sign on the Park Avenue side of the building and a flag at the 41st Street entrance. The owners also plan to renovate the lobby, which is entered from 41st Street. The 42nd Street entrance leads to an open space, which must be reserved for public use, in accordance with zoning variances issued when 120 Park Avenue was built. Until recently, the Whitney Museum, of which Altria was a major supporter, had a gallery here. Mr. Glickman said a major corporate tenant might use this public space for a similar charitable purpose. Given the building’s prime location and its unusual features, real estate experts say that the $525 million price seems like a bargain. When the deal was struck, it was difficult to estimate the yield  or the capitalization rate, which is the measure of a building’s net operating income divided by the purchase price  because there were no tenants. But if the owner succeeds in leasing the 540,000 square feet, including the space already taken by the previous owners, at an average rent of $100 a square foot annually, the deal would yield around 8 percent, experts say. When Global Holdings signed the contract late last year, towers in New York were selling with yields around 5 percent. But price was not the only consideration for Altria. Bill Shanahan, the vice chairman at CB Richard Ellis, the real estate brokerage company that represented Altria in the sale of the building, said the company had a very narrow window of time to close the deal to coincide with its restructuring plan. “We picked the buyer who we knew was going to be able to close even if conditions changed,” Mr. Shanahan said.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Altria Group Go to your Portfolio » The acquisition, at $69 a share, is Altria’s first major deal since it spun off its international tobacco business in March, and it may prompt more consolidation in the tobacco industry. The price tag represents an almost 28 percent premium to UST’s closing price on Thursday, the day before reports that the companies were in negotiations. Shares in UST were up 1.5 percent to $68.59 on Monday after rising 25 percent on Friday. Shares in Altria were flat Monday after rising about 1.4 percent on Friday to $20.95. The move by Altria, formerly known as Philip Morris, will come as no surprise to analysts, who said on Friday that the combination made sense. Cigarette sales have been declining for decades. Altria said in July that it expected shipments to fall 3.5 percent this year, more than it had initially projected. Rising cigarette prices and higher federal excise taxes are expected to contribute to that drop, analysts say. But smokeless tobacco has grown about 7 percent annually over the last four years. Acquiring UST, formerly the U.S. Tobacco Company, would significantly strengthen Altria’s presence in the smokeless tobacco business. To date, Altria’s only major competitor to Copenhagen and Skoal has been Marlboro-branded moist smokeless tobacco and snuff, which have not been popular in the United States. Altria’s marketing and distribution muscle may also lift UST’s fortunes, as the smaller company faces increased competition on the lower end of the smokeless tobacco market. With consumer spending falling, many analysts and industry executives expect that buyers will spend less on premium products and switch to lower-end smokeless tobacco. In a way, Altria is playing catch-up with its biggest competitor, Reynolds American. In 2006, Reynolds bought Conwood, the second-largest maker of smokeless tobacco after UST, for $3.5 billion. Analysts speculated that Altria’s deal might prompt Reynolds American to respond by making a bid for Lorillard, the other major American tobacco company. UST also owns Ste.

The terms could not be learned. The acquisition, which is at a delicate state and could still fall apart, would be Altria's first major purchase since the company split in March, spinning off Philip Morris International to become an independent company focused on the overseas tobacco business and giving the Altria name to Philip Morris USA. People involved in the transaction were planning to work through the weekend to complete the deal as soon as Monday, these people said, but they suggested that the release of the news could speed up the process. ''We don't comment on any speculation that's out there,'' said David M. Sylvia, Altria's director of media affairs. Officials at UST, which is based in Stamford, Conn., did not return messages. Speculation about the deal swirled on Thursday after UST's chief executive, Murray S. Kessler, abruptly withdrew from an analysts' conference, prompting a surge in the share price and heavy options trading. By the end of the day, after UST said that there had been a scheduling conflict, company shares fell back. Stock in UST, formerly the United States Tobacco Company, closed down 4 cents, at $54 a share, while Altria fell 60 cents, to $20.66 a share. UST also owns Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, which is one of the 10 largest producers of premium wines in the United States. The company has a current market capitalization of $8 billion and last year earned $520 million on revenue of $1.95 billion. Analysts have long been bullish on the deal because of Altria's weak position in the growing smokeless tobacco market and because huge cost savings are possible by eliminating redundancies between the two companies. Both have extensive marketing and distribution operations that cater to essentially the same stores. ''It's very logical,'' said Christopher Growe, an analyst in St. Louis for Stifel Nicolaus. Smokeless tobacco is one of the few areas of the tobacco business that is still growing, Mr. Growe said, adding that it has increased about 7 percent a year over the last four years. Altria, which is based in Richmond, Va., and is the nation's largest cigarette maker, had hoped to use its potent Marlboro brand to create its own successful smokeless tobacco products. It has introduced Marlboro-brand moist smokeless tobacco and snus, which are packets filled with tobacco that are popular in Sweden. Neither product has taken off. By splitting Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International into two companies, company officials had hoped to allow the international company to pursue potentially lucrative markets in developing countries without the worries of potential litigation and legislation in the United States. The company's strategy in the United States has been clear for some time as cigarettes sales have followed decades of decline. As part of that strategy, Philip Morris USA acquired John Middleton, a maker of cigars and pipe tobacco, last year. It has opened a research facility in Richmond to create tobacco products that are lower risk than regular cigarettes. The House has already approved legislation that would allow the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. The measure, which the White House opposes, is expected to be taken up by the Senate this fall. PHOTOS: Skoal is among UST's premium smokeless products.(PHOTOGRAPH BY TIM BOYLE/GETTY IMAGES) (pg.

Altria shares fell $1.35, or 6.2 percent, to $20.35 on the New York Stock Exchange.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/opinion/26sat1.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Time to Regulate Big Tobacco<date>Published: July 26, 2008</date><text>The House of Representatives is poised to vote next week on a pioneering bill that would give the Food and Drug Administration its first real power to regulate tobacco products, much as it now regulates food, drugs and medical devices.

David Kessler, the former food and drug commissioner who led the regulatory battle more than a decade ago, called it “as strong a tobacco bill as we have seen in our lifetimes.” The bill pending in the House would empower the F.D.A. to regulate both the content and marketing of tobacco products. The agency could not ban tobacco products outright or eliminate all nicotine from them, but it could reduce the levels of nicotine, eliminate other harmful ingredients and set product standards to protect the public’s health. It could also restrict advertising and promotion to the extent permitted by the First Amendment. The Bush administration has opposed the bill on several grounds  none of them compelling. Its core objection is that the bill would heap new responsibilities on the F.D.A. at a time when the agency is struggling to enhance food safety and improve oversight of imported drugs, devices and foods. Of course, the reason the agency is struggling is that the administration, true to its animus against regulation, has failed to provide adequate resources during most of its tenure. The solution is to provide enough money and people to perform all vital tasks, not to duck a new one. The administration further frets that user fees imposed on the tobacco industry won’t cover all costs of the regulatory effort, thus forcing the F.D.A. to cannibalize other programs to make up the difference. But the bill now clarifies that only the designated user fees and no other F.D.A. funds can be used to regulate tobacco. The administration also contends  as do some anti-tobacco activists  that F.D.A. oversight could leave the public with the misperception that tobacco products are safe, or at least safer, with regulation. But the bill prohibits tobacco companies from implying that they have F.D.A. approval, and the agency has ample ways to remind the public that tobacco is harmful. The bill has strong support from such organizations as The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. It is supported by Philip Morris, but opposed by most of the tobacco industry. It has strong bipartisan support in Congress. The legislation needs to be passed this year by veto-proof margins in both houses, lest the reform impulse dissipate next year as a new administration and new Congress grapple with a host of complicated foreign, military and domestic issues.

The report could further inflame a controversy over menthol in pending tobacco legislation. Skip to next paragraph The study by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health, released Wednesday, concludes that manufacturers have marketed brands to what it called a “vulnerable population” of adolescents and young adults by “manipulating sensory elements of cigarettes to promote initiation and dependence.” Young people, the study said, tolerate menthol cigarettes better than harsher nonmenthol cigarettes. In low-level menthol cigarettes, the menthol primarily masks harshness, making it easier to begin smoking. But as smokers become more accustomed to menthol, they prefer stronger menthol sensations, according to the study. “Tobacco companies researched how controlling menthol levels could increase brand sales among specific groups,” the study said. “They discovered that products with higher menthol levels and stronger perceived menthol sensations suited long-term smokers of menthol cigarettes, and milder brands with lower menthol levels appealed to younger smokers.” The study concludes that 44 percent of smokers age 12 to 17 prefer menthol cigarettes, and it urges regulation of the tobacco industry and menthol, in particular. Menthol cigarettes currently make up about 28 percent of the $70 billion cigarette industry in America. A spokesman for the company that owns Philip Morris, whose Marlboro menthol brands are among those cited in the study, denied Wednesday that it has adjusted menthol levels as a way to lure young smokers. But the study contends that Philip Morris used a two-pronged strategy to compete better in the menthol market, a segment of its business that had been lagging before 2000. The company introduced a low-level menthol brand, Marlboro Milds, to compete with cigarettes like Newport, which contains a low level of menthol. At the same time, the study concluded, Philip Morris raised the menthol level in its Marlboro Menthol brand by 25 percent to appeal to adult smokers. “Marlboro needed a lower-menthol product that would cater to young smokers’ sensory needs, as well as a higher-menthol cigarette for older smokers,” the study said. Since then, Philip Morris’s share of the menthol market has increased, and it is currently the second-largest seller of menthol cigarettes in the United States. A spokesman for Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris, challenged both the hypothesis and the facts contained in the study. “We disagree with the conclusions that menthol levels in our products were manipulated to gain market share among adolescents,” David M. Sylvia, the Altria spokesman, said Wednesday. “We do not do research among, nor design products for, nor market to those who are underage.” The leading menthol brand is Newport, made by Lorillard. A company spokesman, Michael W. Robinson, said Wednesday that the claim that Lorillard manipulated its products for specific markets was false. “Lorillard does not control levels of menthol to promote smoking among adolescents and young adults,” Mr. Robinson’s statement said. The study, published by The American Journal of Public Health, also found various changes in menthol levels in cigarettes since 2000, which the authors contend were designed to attract specific categories of smokers. They are Lorillard’s Newport and cigarettes manufactured by R. J. Reynolds: Salem Black Label, Salem Green Label, Camel Menthol, Kool and Kool Milds. Dr. Howard Koh, an author of the study, accused the tobacco industry of pursuing “a very sophisticated strategy to lure in youth with lower menthol levels and then lock in adult customers who become acclimated to menthol and give them the higher levels they want.” In a statement, a spokesman for R. J. Reynolds said the allegations were untrue. “It would appear this report is simply an effort to push support for federal regulation of the tobacco industry, not a scientific review of the menthol category,” David P. Howard, the Reynolds spokesman, said. A bill currently pending in Congress would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and remove cigarette additives, including menthol. But while the legislation would immediately ban many other flavorings, it specifically exempts menthol from such a ban. The issue is particularly controversial because menthol cigarettes are heavily favored by black smokers, who have high rates of smoking-related cancers. Dr. Koh, director of the division of public health practice at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that his team was not calling for the outright ban of menthol that some antismoking activists have demanded. “The view of our team is that the F.D.A. bill has the authority to regulate menthol and to do it in a scientifically sound fashion in a very, very complex area,” Dr. Koh said. He said the study, begun more than two years ago, was prompted by data showing that menthol sales had not declined along with other segments of the tobacco industry. “This is an area where the industry was clearly maintaining market share, if not increasing it among certain parts of the population,” Dr. Koh said, “so we wanted to dig deeper and explore exactly the mechanism.” More Articles in Business »A new Harvard study claims that the tobacco industry in recent years has manipulated menthol levels in cigarettes to hook youngsters and maintain loyalty among smoking adults.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Dennis Cook/Associated Press Mayola Williams, whose husband died of lung cancer, won her case in Oregon, but the Supreme Court will review the award. The justices have twice vacated the award against the cigarette maker Philip Morris, once in 2003 and again last year, and the Oregon court has twice reinstated it. On Monday, the justices announced that they would review the case for a third time. The scope of their review will be deliberately narrow. Philip Morris, a unit of the Altria Group, appealed the latest Oregon Supreme Court decision on two grounds. One was that the ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, nearly 100 to one, was so great as to be constitutionally impermissible. The second was that the Oregon court’s invocation of a state procedural law in its latest ruling against Philip Morris came too late in the day to be sustained and represented little more than an effort to evade the instruction the justices gave last year to reconsider the damages award. The justices denied review on the first question, which would have had broad application to all punitive damages cases. In earlier rulings, the Supreme Court has suggested that punitive damages should be no more than nine times the compensatory damages, and perhaps a good deal less than that, but there is evidently not a clear majority to convert the suggestion into a firm rule. Instead, they will hear Philip Morris’s appeal only on the second question, which applies to this convoluted case, now in its ninth postverdict year, and to no other. The justices, in other words, appeared less concerned with making law than with asserting their own authority over that of state courts on the issue of punitive damages. In its February 2007 ruling in Philip Morris USA v. Williams, the court overturned the award on the ground that the jurors might have been allowed to calculate the amount based on harm to other, unnamed smokers in addition to Jesse D. Williams, the man whose widow, Mayola Williams, brought the lawsuit. The 5-to-4 majority ordered the Oregon Supreme Court to reconsider the award and make sure it was not calculated based on harm to “nonparties.” The Oregon trial court that originally heard the case had rejected a proposed jury instruction from the cigarette maker that would have told the jurors “not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons, who may bring lawsuits of their own.” In its latest ruling reinstating the $79.5 million award, the Oregon Supreme Court said the trial court had been correct to reject the proposed instruction because it was flawed as a matter of state law by including too many unrelated issues. Philip Morris’s appeal, also called Philip Morris v. Williams but with a new docket number, 07-1216, told the justices that the state court had never raised this objection in any of the previous proceedings. “The Oregon Supreme Court’s defiance of this court’s directive should not be countenanced,” the appeal said. In other action on Monday, the court held unanimously that in a racketeering suit between one company and another alleging a violation of the federal mail fraud statute, the plaintiff need not show that it actually relied on the misleading statements. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the opinion in the case, Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indemnity Co., No. 07-210, which grew out of a dispute between bidders for delinquent properties in Cook County, Ill. As it did here, the Supreme Court has generally given a broad interpretation to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO.

But not at Virginia Commonwealth University, a public institution in Richmond, Va. That is largely because hardly any faculty members or students there know that there is something to debate  a contract with extremely restrictive terms that the university signed in 2006 to do research for Philip Morris USA, the nation’s largest tobacco company and a unit of Altria Group. The contract bars professors from publishing the results of their studies, or even talking about them, without Philip Morris’s permission. If “a third party,” including news organizations, asks about the agreement, university officials have to decline to comment and tell the company. Nearly all patent and other intellectual property rights go to the company, not the university or its professors. “There is restrictive language in here,” said Francis L. Macrina, Virginia Commonwealth’s vice president for research, who acknowledged that many of the provisions violated the university’s guidelines for industry-sponsored research. “In the end, it was language we thought we could agree to. It’s a balancing act.” But the contract, a copy of which The New York Times obtained under the Virginia Freedom of Information law, is highly unusual and raises questions about how far universities will go in search of scarce research dollars to enhance their standing. It also brings a new dimension to the already divisive debate on many campuses over whether it is appropriate for universities to accept tobacco money for research. Dr. Macrina would not specify how much money Philip Morris gave for the restricted research. Historically, the company has not been a major contributor to the university. Last year, it gave $1.3 million in research grants that included the restricted contract and a more traditional independent grant, Dr. Macrina said. Over all last year, Virginia Commonwealth, with nearly 32,000 students, received $227 million in research grants from government and private sources, a sum dwarfed by the amounts the nation’s largest research universities take in. For example, the University of Washington received $1 billion in grants last year, while Johns Hopkins got $1.4 billion in federal money alone. Philip Morris, based in Richmond, is a likely source for Virginia Commonwealth in its hunt for dollars from a finite number of corporations. Among tobacco companies, Philip Morris is the leader in investing in academic research. And for Virginia Commonwealth, expanding ties with its neighbor could produce other benefits like additional grants and support for other university functions. About a dozen researchers and research ethicists from other universities were astonished at the restrictions in the contract, when they were told about it. “When universities sign contracts with these covenants, they are basically giving up their ethos, compromising their values as a university,” said Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University who is an expert on corporate influence on medical research. “There should be no debate about having a sponsor with control over the publishing of results.” Stanton A. Glantz, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine who has lobbied for banning tobacco money on campuses, said, “University administrators who are desperate for money will basically do anything they have to for money.” Although Dr. Macrina would not discuss many details of the research, Philip Morris officials were less reticent. Rick Solana, the senior vice president for research and technology, said university scientists were studying how to identify early warning signs of pulmonary disease, and how to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus drained into rivers from processing tobacco leaves. Dr. Solana also said the contract represented a new focus on developing tobacco products with reduced risks, a shift in strategy in underwriting university research that requires more confidentiality to protect the corporation’s intellectual property rights. And he said Philip Morris had similar arrangements with other universities  although he declined to say how many or which ones. About 15 public health and medical schools no longer accept donations from the tobacco industry, and many major research universities continue to do so only if guaranteed independence to carry out the research and publish the results. The business school at the University of Texas at Austin decided in December to stop accepting tobacco money. The University of California system tightened its oversight of tobacco-financed research last fall, after rejecting a proposal for a ban. Virginia Commonwealth’s president, Eugene P. Trani, declined to be interviewed. But Dr. Macrina defended the contract, saying it struck a reasonable balance between the university’s need for openness and Philip Morris’s need for confidentiality, even though it violated Virginia Commonwealth’s own rules. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US »On campuses nationwide, professors and administrators have passionately debated whether their universities should accept money for research from tobacco companies.

About a dozen researchers and research ethicists from other universities were astonished at the restrictions in the contract, when they were told about it. “When universities sign contracts with these covenants, they are basically giving up their ethos, compromising their values as a university,” said Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University who is an expert on corporate influence on medical research. “There should be no debate about having a sponsor with control over the publishing of results.” Stanton A. Glantz, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine who has lobbied for banning tobacco money on campuses, said, “University administrators who are desperate for money will basically do anything they have to for money.” Although Dr. Macrina would not discuss many details of the research, Philip Morris officials were less reticent. Rick Solana, the senior vice president for research and technology, said university scientists were studying how to identify early warning signs of pulmonary disease, and how to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus drained into rivers from processing tobacco leaves. Dr. Solana also said the contract represented a new focus on developing tobacco products with reduced risks, a shift in strategy in underwriting university research that requires more confidentiality to protect the corporation’s intellectual property rights. And he said Philip Morris had similar arrangements with other universities  although he declined to say how many or which ones. About 15 public health and medical schools no longer accept donations from the tobacco industry, and many major research universities continue to do so only if guaranteed independence to carry out the research and publish the results. The business school at the University of Texas at Austin decided in December to stop accepting tobacco money. The University of California system tightened its oversight of tobacco-financed research last fall, after rejecting a proposal for a ban. Virginia Commonwealth’s president, Eugene P. Trani, declined to be interviewed. But Dr. Macrina defended the contract, saying it struck a reasonable balance between the university’s need for openness and Philip Morris’s need for confidentiality, even though it violated Virginia Commonwealth’s own rules. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/13/business/13menthol.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Cigarette Bill Treats Menthol With Leniency<date>Published: May 13, 2008</date><text>Some public health experts are questioning why menthol, the most widely used cigarette flavoring and the most popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers, is receiving special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show The Marketing of Menthol Related A Flavoring Seen as a Means of Marketing to Blacks (May 13, 2008) The legislation, which would give the Food and Drug Administration the power to oversee tobacco products, would try to reduce smoking’s allure to young people by banning most flavored cigarettes, including clove and cinnamon. But those new strictures would exempt menthol  even though menthol masks the harsh taste of cigarettes for beginners and may make it harder for the addicted to kick the smoking habit. For years, public health authorities have worried that menthol might be a factor in high cancer rates in African-Americans. The reason menthol is seen as politically off limits, despite those concerns, is that mentholated brands are so crucial to the American cigarette industry. They make up more than one-fourth of the $70 billion American cigarette market and are becoming increasingly important to the industry leader, Philip Morris USA, without whose lobbying support the legislation might have no chance of passage. “I would have been in favor of banning menthol,” said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who supports the bill. “But as a practical matter that simply wasn’t doable.” Even the head of the National African American Tobacco Prevention Network, a nonprofit group that has been adamantly against menthol, acknowledges that the ingredient needed to be off the bargaining table  for now  because he does not want to imperil the bill’s chances. “The bottom line is we want the legislation,” said William S. Robinson, the group’s executive director. “But we want to reserve the right to address this issue at some critical point because of the percentage of people of African descent who use mentholated products.” Supporters of the tobacco legislation, including the Senate bill’s sponsor, Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, say the bill addresses the potential health risks of menthol by giving the F.D.A. the authority to remove cigarette additives, including menthol, if they are proved harmful. Menthol is particularly controversial because public health authorities have worried about its health effects on African-Americans. Nearly 75 percent of black smokers use menthol brands, compared with only about one in four white smokers. That is why one former public health official says the legislation’s menthol exemption is a “cave-in to the industry,” an opinion shared by some other public health advocates. “I think we can say definitively that menthol induces smoking in the African-American community and subsequently serves as a direct link to African-American death and disease,” said the former official, Robert G. Robinson, who retired two years ago as an associate director in the office of smoking and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The current lead scientist on tobacco related issues for the C.D.C, Terry F. Pechacek, said the legislation’s exemption for menthol was an issue being discussed in the scientific community. "I would just say this is an area of clear scientific interest and it merits very careful attention." The legislation could soon be up for vote in both chambers of Congress, where it has broad support. It is by no means a sure bet  though not because of the menthol exemption. Despite the support of Mr. Kennedy and 56 co-sponsors in the Senate, the legislation faces some determined opposition from tobacco-state lawmakers who resist industry regulation. And the White House has said it opposes the legislation, arguing that F.D.A. regulation could create the false impression that tobacco is safe. The legislation is largely a result of negotiations during sessions in 2003 and 2004 between lawmakers, antismoking groups and Philip Morris  the only major American cigarette company that supports the effort to regulate the industry. “My recollection is that we were able to eliminate the use of flavored cigarettes, strawberry, mocha, and all this stuff that is clearly targeted at young kids and to start them smoking tobacco,” Mike DeWine, the former Ohio senator who helped arrange a series of negotiations between Philip Morris and an influential antismoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a recent telephone interview. “Where the compromise was made as I recall was on menthol,” Mr. DeWine said. While Philip Morris and other tobacco companies acknowledge the health hazards of smoking, they contend that menthol does nothing to worsen those risks. One of the government’s current top public health scientists on tobacco, however, says there are few definitive answers about the health impact of menthol cigarettes. Still, he points to several studies that suggest menthol smokers may be exposed to higher levels of dangerous compounds than nonmenthol smokers. “There are multiple lines of evidence, generally consistent, suggesting that there’s reason for concern,” said Dr. Pechacek, the associate science director of the office on smoking for the C.D.C. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »Some public health experts are questioning why menthol, the most widely used cigarette flavoring and the most popular cigarette choice of African-American smokers, is receiving special protection as Congress tries to regulate tobacco for the first time.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Altria Group Inc. U.S. Court of Appeals Decision (pdf) Plaintiffs’ lawyers wanted to represent millions of people across the country who had smoked light cigarettes. But the court, saying it was impossible to generalize about why smokers chose light cigarettes, ruled that the group could not be treated as a class. Instead, smokers wanting to sue over the issue would have to do so individually. There might be various reasons for a smoker to choose a light brand other than “the belief that lights were a healthier alternative,” the ruling said. Other possibilities are that a lights smoker “was unaware of that representation, preferred the taste of lights, or chose lights as an expression of personal style.” Even though the ruling had been generally expected, and tobacco company stocks were little affected by the decision, analysts still viewed it as positive for the industry. Several experts said the ruling, the latest in a string of industry victories in cases involving light cigarettes, relieved the tobacco industry of potentially billions in damages and could also deter other similar class-action lawsuits around the country. “It may be persuasive to judges around the country who might well be watching it,” said Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. The decision by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a ruling in September 2006 by a federal district judge, Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn, that certified the suit as a class action. Judge Weinstein’s ruling represented the first time that a so-called lights case received class-action certification in federal court. At the time, the ruling was viewed as potentially opening the door to a major legal threat against the industry, exposing cigarette companies to large damages for their marketing of light cigarettes. Yet, as a number of such lawsuits have been filed in state courts around the country, plaintiffs so far have had little success. One Illinois case, in which plaintiffs initially won a $10 billion judgment, was overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. More than a half-dozen such state cases are currently in legal limbo, awaiting a United States Supreme Court decision in a Maine case involving light cigarettes. The issue in those cases involves federal pre-emption, whether the fact that the Federal Trade Commission allowed marketing of cigarettes as light would bar legal action against tobacco companies on that count. Clifford E. Douglas, the executive director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network, said there was generally a high “win rate” in cases against the tobacco industry, but not when it came to class actions. “Some courts have been very sympathetic, but many have had problems with the individualized nature of smoking and smoking-related injuries,” Mr. Douglas said. Mr. Douglas, a lawyer who has been involved in litigation against the tobacco industry, said the ruling illustrates that the courts are a poor surrogate for government regulation when it comes to holding the industry accountable. “I think this underscores the need to combat the light cigarette scam in the public policy arena,” Mr. Douglas said, citing a bill in Congress that would give the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. The bill would ban the use of terms like light and low-tar in marketing such cigarettes, which contain the same tobacco as other cigarettes but have filters that allow more air to mix with the smoke, diluting it. Unlike most tobacco lawsuits, the Brooklyn federal case did not contend that smokers’ health was injured by the cigarettes. Instead it claimed that consumers had been subjected to an economic fraud since 1971, when Philip Morris began selling Marlboro Lights, the first light cigarette. The lawsuit claimed that if smokers had known that light cigarettes were no healthier than other cigarettes, the cigarettes would have been cheaper. But the appeals court ruled that even after disclosures by the National Cancer Institute in 2001 that light cigarettes were no healthier than others, smokers continued to smoke them. That included three of the six named plaintiffs in the case, the court said. “Given the lack of an appreciable drop in the demand or price of light cigarettes after the truth about lights was revealed,” the ruling said, “plaintiffs’ argument that defendants’ misrepresentation caused the market to shift and the price of lights to be inflated fails as a matter of law.” Theodore M. Grossman, the lawyer who argued the case in July on behalf of tobacco companies, said the ruling could have implications in other class-action cases across the country involving light cigarettes. “One of the central points of the opinion was that the reasons that people bought light cigarettes were highly individual and that this kind of case can’t be resolved in a class context,” said Mr. Grossman, a partner at Jones Day who represented the R. J. Reynolds unit of Reynolds American. The lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, Michael D. Hausfeld, said he was saddened by the ruling. “We have options and we have to evaluate them,” Mr. Hausfeld said. Among them are asking for a rehearing by the entire appeals court, appealing to the United States Supreme Court or pursuing the cases individually. The Supreme Court infrequently reviews cases involving questions of whether class actions should be allowed, however. While the ruling does not preclude individual lawsuits, the small compensation each person could collect under the theory of the case  which would be calculated based on economic losses from smoking light cigarettes, and damages  could make such lawsuits financially untenable for plaintiffs’ lawyers. “I can’t imagine that individual cases will go forward; they’re just too expensive,” said Mr. Tobias, who teaches product liability law. In a note to investors, a tobacco industry analyst at Goldman Sachs, Judy E. Hong, said that the ruling “should continue to increase investors’ confidence about the legal environment and allow the cigarette companies to have more balance-sheet flexibility.” Besides Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds, tobacco companies that market light cigarettes include the Lorillard Tobacco unit of the Loews Corporation, whose brands include Newport. Shares of the Altria Group, which owns Philip Morris USA, the marketer of Marlboro cigarettes in this country, closed down 7 cents, at $22.01, Thursday. Stock in Reynolds American, whose R. J. Reynolds Tobacco unit markets the Camel brand, was up 29 cents, closing at $60.

The legislation cleared by a House panel on Wednesday focused on regulatory authority, labeling and health and marketing claims. Related Reynolds Ads Say Tobacco Oversight Is Burden F.D.A. Doesnt Need (April 2, 2008) The bill is meant to severely curtail tobacco marketing, to emphasize health warnings on tobacco products, to ban many flavored cigarettes, and to prohibit labeling of cigarettes as “light” or “low tar.” Dozens of health groups have supported the bill as potentially life-saving. But despite broad support in both the House and the Senate, where a similar proposal cleared a committee in July, the legislation faces formidable obstacles. The Bush administration and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, have indicated their opposition. In a statement shortly after the vote, a White House spokeswoman, Emily A. Lawrimore, said the administration thought that the legislation would do more harm than good, creating a false impression that regulated tobacco products were safe. “The administration believes that tobacco is not a drug or device to be regulated by the F.D.A.,” Ms. Lawrimore said. A spokesman for Senator McConnell noted that he had said he would review the bill. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, has reportedly threatened to filibuster the legislation if it reaches a vote on the Senate floor. In a statement Wednesday, shortly after the House committee vote, Mr. Burr said he remained opposed to the legislation, in part, he said, because it would strain an already burdened agency. The bill is also running up against an abbreviated election-year legislative schedule. The House committee approved the bill 38 to 12, with much of the opposition from Republicans who argued that the F.D.A. was already overwhelmed and could not handle regulating another industry. That position has recently been articulated in an advertising campaign by Reynolds American, the tobacco company that sells Camel cigarettes and other brands. But Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who sponsored the bill, said such arguments were “clearly red herrings from those who are fundamentally opposed to regulating tobacco at all.” And Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and the Commerce Committee chairman, said he was separately working on legislation to “clean up this mess at Food and Drug, and we plan to do it with all vigor and enthusiasm.” The tobacco bill has been endorsed by the cigarette maker Philip Morris, and some people have criticized it as a compromise that does not go far enough. For example, it prohibits the F.D.A. from raising the legal age for buying cigarettes beyond the current level of 18. And while the bill prohibits the sale of candy-flavored cigarettes  which account for less than 1 percent of the market  it allows the continued sale of popular menthol cigarettes. One menthol brand, Newport, marketed by Lorillard Tobacco, is the nation’s second-leading cigarette, after the Philip Morris brand Marlboro. Lorillard has not yet taken a position on the legislation, a spokesman said. Representative Mike Ferguson, Republican of New Jersey, offered an amendment that would have prohibited menthol flavoring. “I think it’s inconsistent to say we want to protect kids from flavored cigarettes, ” Mr. Ferguson said, “but then we have a provision in the bill that allows menthol cigarettes.” Mr. Dingell acknowledged that the legislation was not ideal. “In a perfect world, we’d ban all cigarettes,” he said. “But the hard fact of the matter is that there are a lot of jobs depending on this. And more importantly, there are a lot of people out there who are addicted to this, and they’ve got to have their fix.” Antismoking groups have sought regulation of the tobacco industry for years. In 1995, a former F.D.A. commissioner, David A. Kessler, drafted regulations declaring nicotine a drug and cigarettes a drug delivery device subject to F.D.A. authority, but these were struck down by federal courts. The Senate approved a proposal in 2004, but the House has never voted on one. Within minutes of Wednesday’s action, statements supporting the committee’s vote were issued by supporters including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill; the American Academy of Pediatrics; and the American Cancer Society. Although the White House had expressed its opposition, it has not yet threatened to veto the legislation. In testimony last fall, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the current F.D.A. commissioner, indicated the Bush administration’s reluctance to embrace a new regulatory role, citing wide efforts already begun by both state and federal agencies to reduce tobacco use. The bill would create a center within the F.D.A specifically for tobacco regulation financed by industry fees projected to exceed $5 billion over the next 10 years. It would also require disclosure of the contents of tobacco-based products and set standards that would require removal or reduction of harmful ingredients; require that the findings of industry research be made public; prohibit companies from making health claims about tobacco products, and require larger and more effective warning labels.

Lorillard has not yet taken a position on the legislation, a spokesman said. Representative Mike Ferguson, Republican of New Jersey, offered an amendment that would have prohibited menthol flavoring. “I think it’s inconsistent to say we want to protect kids from flavored cigarettes, ” Mr. Ferguson said, “but then we have a provision in the bill that allows menthol cigarettes.” Mr. Dingell acknowledged that the legislation was not ideal. “In a perfect world, we’d ban all cigarettes,” he said. “But the hard fact of the matter is that there are a lot of jobs depending on this. And more importantly, there are a lot of people out there who are addicted to this, and they’ve got to have their fix.” Antismoking groups have sought regulation of the tobacco industry for years. In 1995, a former F.D.A. commissioner, David A. Kessler, drafted regulations declaring nicotine a drug and cigarettes a drug delivery device subject to F.D.A. authority, but these were struck down by federal courts. The Senate approved a proposal in 2004, but the House has never voted on one. Within minutes of Wednesday’s action, statements supporting the committee’s vote were issued by supporters including Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill; the American Academy of Pediatrics; and the American Cancer Society. Although the White House had expressed its opposition, it has not yet threatened to veto the legislation. In testimony last fall, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the current F.D.A. commissioner, indicated the Bush administration’s reluctance to embrace a new regulatory role, citing wide efforts already begun by both state and federal agencies to reduce tobacco use. The bill would create a center within the F.D.A specifically for tobacco regulation financed by industry fees projected to exceed $5 billion over the next 10 years. It would also require disclosure of the contents of tobacco-based products and set standards that would require removal or reduction of harmful ingredients; require that the findings of industry research be made public; prohibit companies from making health claims about tobacco products, and require larger and more effective warning labels.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16supreme-t.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Supreme Court Inc.<date>Correction: May 18, 2008Published: March 16, 2008</date><text>Correction Appended Skip to next paragraph Related Letters: Supreme Court Inc.

The headquarters of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, located across from Lafayette Park in Washington, is a limestone structure that looks almost as majestic as the Supreme Court. The similarity is no coincidence: both buildings were designed by the same architect, Cass Gilbert. Lately, however, the affinities between the court and the chamber, a lavishly financed business-advocacy organization, seem to be more than just architectural. The Supreme Court term that ended last June was, by all measures, exceptionally good for American business. The chamber’s litigation center filed briefs in 15 cases and its side won in 13 of them  the highest percentage of victories in the center’s 30-year history. The current term, which ends this summer, has also been shaping up nicely for business interests. I visited the chamber recently to talk with Robin Conrad, who heads the litigation effort, about her recent triumphs. Conrad, an appealing, soft-spoken woman, lives with her family on a horse farm in Maryland, where she rides with a fox-chasing club called the Howard County-Iron Bridge Hounds. Her office, playfully adorned by action figures of women like Xena the Warrior Princess and Hillary Rodham Clinton, has one of the most impressive views in Washington. “You can see the White House through the trees,” she said as we peered through a window overlooking the park. “In the old days, you could actually see people bathing in the fountain. Homeless people.” Conrad was in an understandably cheerful mood. Though the current Supreme Court has a well-earned reputation for divisiveness, it has been surprisingly united in cases affecting business interests. Of the 30 business cases last term, 22 were decided unanimously, or with only one or two dissenting votes. Conrad said she was especially pleased that several of the most important decisions were written by liberal justices, speaking for liberal and conservative colleagues alike. In opinions last term, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and David Souter each went out of his or her way to question the use of lawsuits to challenge corporate wrongdoing  a strategy championed by progressive groups like Public Citizen but routinely denounced by conservatives as “regulation by litigation.” Conrad reeled off some of her favorite moments: “Justice Ginsburg talked about how ‘private-securities fraud actions, if not adequately contained, can be employed abusively.’ Justice Breyer had a wonderful quote about how Congress was trying to ‘weed out unmeritorious securities lawsuits.’ Justice Souter talked about how the threat of litigation ‘will push cost-conscious defendants to settle.’ ” Examples like these point to an ideological sea change on the Supreme Court. A generation ago, progressive and consumer groups petitioning the court could count on favorable majority opinions written by justices who viewed big business with skepticism  or even outright prejudice. An economic populist like William O. Douglas, the former New Deal crusader who served on the court from 1939 to 1975, once unapologetically announced that he was “ready to bend the law in favor of the environment and against the corporations.” Today, however, there are no economic populists on the court, even on the liberal wing. And ever since John Roberts was appointed chief justice in 2005, the court has seemed only more receptive to business concerns. Forty percent of the cases the court heard last term involved business interests, up from around 30 percent in recent years. While the Rehnquist Court heard less than one antitrust decision a year, on average, between 1988 and 2003, the Roberts Court has heard seven in its first two terms  and all of them were decided in favor of the corporate defendants. Business cases at the Supreme Court typically receive less attention than cases concerning issues like affirmative action, abortion or the death penalty. The disputes tend to be harder to follow: the legal arguments are more technical, the underlying stories less emotional. But these cases  which include shareholder suits, antitrust challenges to corporate mergers, patent disputes and efforts to reduce punitive-damage awards and prevent product-liability suits  are no less important. They involve billions of dollars, have huge consequences for the economy and can have a greater effect on people’s daily lives than the often symbolic battles of the culture wars. In the current Supreme Court term, the justices have already blocked a liability suit against Medtronic, the manufacturer of a heart catheter, and rejected a type of shareholder suit that includes a claim against Enron. In the coming months, the court will decide whether to reduce the largest punitive-damage award in American history, which resulted from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. What should we make of the Supreme Court’s transformation? Throughout its history, the court has tended to issue opinions, in areas from free speech to gender equality, that reflect or consolidate a social consensus. With their pro-business jurisprudence, the justices may be capturing an emerging spirit of agreement among liberal and conservative elites about the value of free markets. Among the professional classes, many Democrats and Republicans, whatever their other disagreements, have come to share a relatively laissez-faire, technocratic vision of the economy and are suspicious of excessive regulation and reflexive efforts to vilify big business.

So the school decided two months ago to draw a line, and refuse all tobacco money for student groups, as well as for faculty research. “What it came down to for us was the ethical dimension,” said George W. Gau, dean of the Texas school, the McCombs School of Business. “The leadership of the school felt that in some sense it was tainted money, that it is money gotten from a product that is significantly harming people.” Across academia, universities and graduate schools are wrestling with whether to accept financing from tobacco companies for research or student activities. In the past few years, 15 public health and medical schools have turned away donations from the industry; McCombs’ move was unusual because of its longstanding ties to an array of corporations. But on some campuses, faculty who get tobacco money for research grants have led pitched battles over proposed bans. Last spring, because of such faculty opposition, Stanford University and regents of the University of California system rejected prohibitions on tobacco dollars. Many faculty members argued that the restrictions would infringe on academic freedom and lead to fights over money from other potentially controversial sources, like liquor, pharmaceutical or oil companies. They said that even if tobacco companies financed research, professors would guard their independence and not permit the companies to influence their results. “We take funding from corporations, from the Department of Defense, from many, many sources, but ultimately the responsibility for the science belongs to the faculty member who did the science,” said Robert C. Dynes, president of the University of California system. The California Board of Regents decided in September that rather than ban tobacco money, it would require research financed by tobacco companies to be approved by the chancellor on each campus. The origins of the movement to ban tobacco money are traced to Australia, where nearly 20 universities stopped accepting money from the industry during the 1990s, said Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco medical school. Dr. Glantz was among the prime proponents of a tobacco ban in the California university system. Universities also received a nudge from the American Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit group created as part of a $206 billion settlement in 1998 of a lawsuit filed by 46 states against the tobacco industry. The foundation, dedicated to reducing tobacco use, awards research and other grants to universities, but only if the unit of the university seeking financing does not accept tobacco money. The medical school at Emory University and the public health schools at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Ohio State, Louisiana State and the Universities of Arizona, Iowa and North Carolina have also banned tobacco money. Proponents of bans often argue that universities should stop accepting tobacco money not only because of the public health impact of smoking, but because of what they view as the industry’s misuse of scientific research to confuse consumers about the risks of smoking and second-hand smoke. “The argument for rejecting funding is that the tobacco industry has a 50-plus-year history of a corrupting influence on medical research,” said Dr. Michael J. Thun, the chief of epidemiological research at the American Cancer Society. Philip Morris says the money it donates for research is given with no strings attached. “When we make those grants, the control of the grant is by the researchers, and we ask them to publish their results and to make sure to make public that we funded it,” said Bill Phelps, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., the largest tobacco company in the United States. “We think that the research we’ve funded has contributed to the base of scientific knowledge.” He declined to disclose how much the company spends on research grants. Philip Morris is currently financing one research project at the University of Texas at Austin, a three-year, $455,000 effort to study how certain toxic compounds in cigarette smoke react with DNA, causing damage that can lead to cancer. Jennifer S. Brodbelt, a chemist who is a researcher on the study, said the company has had no role in the research. “We are all struggling to maintain our research programs,” Dr. Brodbelt said. “If we can find new sources to support meritorious research, I say let’s make the most of it.” Some of the nearly $150,000 that Philip Morris or its parent company, the Altria Group, gave to the McCombs school in recent years helped support two research centers. But most of the money went to student groups and activities, from the Hispanic Business Students Association to a conference on women in business leadership. Because Philip Morris recruits employees from the business school  an activity not affected by the ban  it wants to support student events and educational programs, said Mr. Phelps, the company spokesman. The company donates money for similar activities at several dozen colleges and universities, he said. But department chairmen and deans at the business school had become uncomfortable with the company’s role, and in particular its desire for more interaction with undergraduates. Some wondered whether giving the company more prominence on campus would suggest that the university was in some way endorsing it, said Dr. Gau, the dean. Paula C. Murray, associate dean for undergraduate programs at McCombs, was among those who pushed for the ban. “We know the product is deadly,” she said. “We know it causes cancer. And we know that the younger you start smoking, the more likely you will find it hard to quit. With two-thirds of our undergraduates under 21, to me it’s a no-brainer.” “Just because it’s green,” Ms. Murray added, “we don’t have to take it.” More Articles in Education »Officials at the University of Texas business school in Austin became uneasy when they realized that a reliable donor to student activities  the parent company of the tobacco maker Philip Morris  wanted a more prominent role in sponsoring events, and more interaction with students.

The justices added two new cases to their docket on drug and cigarette labeling requirements. Skip to next paragraph Times Topics: Supreme Court In each case, as in four others the court has already agreed to decide in the current term, the question is one of federal pre-emption. The cases offer variations of a common question: if a product meets federal standards, can the manufacturer be liable for damages under state law for injuries suffered by consumers? In the cigarette case, Altria Group Inc. v. Good, No. 07-562, the issue is whether state consumer-fraud laws can be used to sue cigarette makers for advertising a brand as containing low tar and nicotine. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, argues that any finding of liability is pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as well as by the fact that the low-tar and low-nicotine descriptions are based on the results of a test required by the Federal Trade Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, in a case brought under Maine’s law prohibiting deceptive trade practices, rejected Altria’s claim and reinstated a lawsuit brought by smokers who claimed that the packaging for Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights was deceptive. The plaintiffs argue that because smokers compensate for the lower nicotine by inhaling more deeply or smoking more cigarettes, any claimed health benefit from the brands is inherently fraudulent. In the drug labeling case, the plaintiff was a guitar player who suffered the career-ending amputation of her right arm after being injected in a hospital with an anti-nausea drug made by Wyeth. Gangrene and subsequent amputation was a risk from intravenous administration of the drug, Phenergan. The plaintiff, Diana Levine, argues that the federally approved label did not give doctors a specific enough warning about the risks of the method used to give her the drug. The state courts in Vermont allowed Ms. Levine to sue for damages under state law and upheld a jury verdict of more than $6 million. The manufacturer’s Supreme Court appeal, Wyeth v. Levine, No. 06-1249, argues that the lawsuit was pre-empted by the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the label. The Bush administration, which reversed a longstanding policy against pre-emption in drug cases, is supporting the appeal. In a brief filed this month in response to the Supreme Court’s request for its views, the administration said the agency’s approval of the Phenergan label “reflects F.D.A.’s expert judgment that the labeling strikes the appropriate balance.” The brief added: “Where, as here, F.D.A. was presented with information concerning the relevant risk, a jury’s imposition of liability based on a drug’s F.D.A.-approved labeling would interfere with F.D.A.’s expert judgment.” Nonetheless, the court’s decision to grant Wyeth’s appeal at this point was surprising. The administration urged the justices to defer action until they decide, later this term, another medicine-related pre-emption case that was argued last month. That case, Riegel v. Medtronic Inc., No. 06-179, presents a question under a separate statute, the Medical Device Amendments, which governs the F.D.A.’s premarket approval process for devices like the balloon catheter at issue in the case. There is considerable overlap between that process and the one for approving new drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is at issue in the new case. The court had also agreed to decide a third pre-emption case involving the F.D.A., concerning whether state law can be used to determine whether a manufacturer defrauded the agency in seeking approval for a drug application. That case, Warner-Lambert v. Kent, No. 06-1498, will be argued Feb. 25. The justices have not announced whether they will hear the new case in April or at the start of the new term in October. The proliferation of pre-emption cases on the court’s docket in part reflects the considerable turmoil in the lower courts over the complex issues involved. It also reflects a concerted effort by the business community to push for federal pre-emption as a shield against state courts. The United States Chamber of Commerce filed a vigorously worded brief in the cigarette case that the court accepted Friday, emphasizing for the justices the “jurisprudential gulf” that separates various lower court rulings on whether federally approved or required product labels should be given pre-emptive effect against state tort liability. Referring to the lower court’s ruling in the cigarette case, the chamber’s brief said that “if allowed to stand, the First Circuit’s approach would Balkanize cigarette labeling, advertising, and promotion into a state-by-state endeavor,” adding that “it is difficult to imagine a more powerful blow to the interest of nationwide uniformity and consistency.” The plaintiffs’ brief to the court emphasized the factual allegations of their case: that Philip Morris knew from its own research that based on actual smoking habits, smokers received the same tar and nicotine from “light” cigarettes as from regular brands, but that the company kept this from the F.T.C. More Articles in Business »WASHINGTON, Jan. 18  The Supreme Court’s already substantial investment in defining the boundary between federal regulation and state tort law grew even bigger on Friday. The justices added two new cases to their docket on drug and cigarette labeling requirements. Skip to next paragraph Times Topics: Supreme Court In each case, as in four others the court has already agreed to decide in the current term, the question is one of federal pre-emption. The cases offer variations of a common question: if a product meets federal standards, can the manufacturer be liable for damages under state law for injuries suffered by consumers? In the cigarette case, Altria Group Inc. v. Good, No. 07-562, the issue is whether state consumer-fraud laws can be used to sue cigarette makers for advertising a brand as containing low tar and nicotine. Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, argues that any finding of liability is pre-empted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act as well as by the fact that the low-tar and low-nicotine descriptions are based on the results of a test required by the Federal Trade Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in Boston, in a case brought under Maine’s law prohibiting deceptive trade practices, rejected Altria’s claim and reinstated a lawsuit brought by smokers who claimed that the packaging for Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights was deceptive. The plaintiffs argue that because smokers compensate for the lower nicotine by inhaling more deeply or smoking more cigarettes, any claimed health benefit from the brands is inherently fraudulent. In the drug labeling case, the plaintiff was a guitar player who suffered the career-ending amputation of her right arm after being injected in a hospital with an anti-nausea drug made by Wyeth. Gangrene and subsequent amputation was a risk from intravenous administration of the drug, Phenergan. The plaintiff, Diana Levine, argues that the federally approved label did not give doctors a specific enough warning about the risks of the method used to give her the drug. The state courts in Vermont allowed Ms. Levine to sue for damages under state law and upheld a jury verdict of more than $6 million. The manufacturer’s Supreme Court appeal, Wyeth v. Levine, No. 06-1249, argues that the lawsuit was pre-empted by the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the label. The Bush administration, which reversed a longstanding policy against pre-emption in drug cases, is supporting the appeal. In a brief filed this month in response to the Supreme Court’s request for its views, the administration said the agency’s approval of the Phenergan label “reflects F.D.A.’s expert judgment that the labeling strikes the appropriate balance.” The brief added: “Where, as here, F.D.A. was presented with information concerning the relevant risk, a jury’s imposition of liability based on a drug’s F.D.A.-approved labeling would interfere with F.D.A.’s expert judgment.” Nonetheless, the court’s decision to grant Wyeth’s appeal at this point was surprising. The administration urged the justices to defer action until they decide, later this term, another medicine-related pre-emption case that was argued last month. That case, Riegel v. Medtronic Inc., No. 06-179, presents a question under a separate statute, the Medical Device Amendments, which governs the F.D.A.’s premarket approval process for devices like the balloon catheter at issue in the case. There is considerable overlap between that process and the one for approving new drugs under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is at issue in the new case. The court had also agreed to decide a third pre-emption case involving the F.D.A., concerning whether state law can be used to determine whether a manufacturer defrauded the agency in seeking approval for a drug application. That case, Warner-Lambert v. Kent, No. 06-1498, will be argued Feb. 25. The justices have not announced whether they will hear the new case in April or at the start of the new term in October.

Reynolds Tobacco Company, a unit of Reynolds American, disclosed this week that it would run no ads in 2008 in consumer magazines and newspapers for cigarette brands like Camel, Winston and Pall Mall. Instead, Reynolds said it would concentrate its marketing in three areas that already make up the bulk of its marketing spending: stores, bars and nightclubs; Web sites; and direct mail. Print ads are estimated to account for less than 5 percent of the hundreds of millions of dollars that Reynolds spends each year on marketing. The company also spends substantially on price cuts to retailers and wholesalers and special offers to consumers known as bogos, for buy one, get one free. Reynolds is the second-largest tobacco company in the United States, behind the Philip Morris USA unit of the Altria Group. Philip Morris has not bought print ads for its cigarettes in the last three years, so the decision by Reynolds suggests that next year consumers are likely to read cigarette ads from only the third-largest tobacco company, the Carolina Group, which makes Lorillard brands like Newport.  Reynolds said its decision was not directly related to two recent disputes with antismoking activists and politicians centered on magazine ads for its best-selling cigarette brand, Camel. One dispute was focused on an elaborate foldout ad for Camel Filters that ran in the Nov. 15 issue of Rolling Stone, featuring a campaign about independent music. The other dispute involved ads for Camel No. 9, a new variety of the brand aimed at women, that are running in a lengthy list of magazines. The print media, particularly glossy weekly and monthly magazines, were once a marketing mainstay for Reynolds and other tobacco companies like Philip Morris USA, Lorillard, Brown &amp; Williamson and Liggett &amp; Myers. For decades, the pages of publications like Colliers, Life, Look, Newsweek, The Saturday Evening Post and Time were filled with ads telling smokers that more doctors smoke Camel than any other cigarette, that L.S.M.F.T. (for Lucky Strike Means Fine Tobacco), that smokers of Tareyton cigarettes would rather fight than switch, that Newport was alive with pleasure and that Chesterfield was best for you. But industry consolidation, the growing societal disdain for smoking and restrictions on the types of advertising that tobacco companies could buy  some imposed, some adopted voluntary  have drastically reduced spending for print advertisements. Philip Morris stopped running many types of cigarette ads in the print media in 2000, announcing that it would no longer advertise in magazines like Rolling Stone and Sports Illustrated because they had many readers who were under the legal smoking age. Philip Morris also decided in 2000 that it would no longer buy ads on the back covers of any magazines because of the visibility. In 2005 and 2006, Philip Morris ran no print ads of any kind for its cigarette brands, a spokesman in Richmond, Va., David Sylvia, said yesterday, and it does not appear that there will be any in 2007. The company continues to run print ads for its initiative aimed at preventing youth smoking, he added, but for business reasons it is not advertising its cigarette brands, like Marlboro, Merit and Virginia Slims, in print. The decision by Reynolds to shun consumer print publications was reported on Tuesday in The Winston-Salem Journal, in North Carolina. A company spokeswoman, Jan Smith, told the newspaper that the decision was conveyed in October to the media-buying ad agencies that work for Reynolds. The company executives decided to reallocate our marketing resources, Ms. Smith said yesterday in an interview, because we believe that will allow us to be very efficient and effective in how we go to market. For 2009 and subsequent years, Ms. Smith said, we will continue every year to evaluate what marketing programs are best for the business in the year ahead. The Federal Trade Commission compiles data about marketing spending by the nations tobacco companies, which are reported on a delayed basis. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »A CIGARETTE maker that once used print advertising to ask smokers to walk a mile for a popular brand is walking away from the medium, at least for next year.

The outcome is a testament, more than anything else, to the shamelessness of the nations big tobacco companies. They spent an obscene amount of money on deceptive television ads designed to protect their profits, even at the expense of poor children. The results should not be allowed to diminish national concern about insuring those youngsters. Tobacco firms led by Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds poured $12 million into defeating the initiative  about $3.33 for every Oregon resident, or $24 a vote. Thats about a dollar more per capita than the $60 million tobacco companies invested to defeat a similar California measure last year, according to The Associated Press. The health and civic groups fighting for health care for children were able to spend only a quarter of that. The purveyors of Marlboro and Camel cigarettes did not win by disputing the urgent health care needs the initiative was meant to address, or the benefits higher cigarette taxes would bring by deterring smoking. They sought to hide behind a benign-sounding front group called Oregonians Against the Blank Check and proceeded to barrage voters with unscrupulous TV ads and mailings. Among other things, they stoked doubts that the funds raised would actually be used for childrens health care, and they manufactured an overblown controversy over amending Oregons Constitution. The referendum said a lot about the power of money in any election, and not much about what the public thinks about the issue if given accurate and balanced information.

Since 1982 the Whitney Museum of American Art has had a branch in the Altria building at 120 Park Avenue, across from Grand Central Terminal. The corporation paid the operating expenses for the 900-square-foot gallery, which presents about four exhibitions a year, primarily work by living artists. We dont have an exact date that the branch is closing, said Adam D. Weinberg, director of the Whitney. Our assumption is we will run the program through the spring. And Altria will fund the branch for as long as they are in the building. But the Whitney is not looking for a new location to take the place of the Altria branch. It has been fabulous, but the branch museums are a thing of the past, Mr. Weinberg said. Theyve pretty much run their course. Altria was called Philip Morris Companies until 2003, and the corporations support of the Whitney stretches back to 1967, when it began a special-purchase fund for the museum. Since then it has given the Whitney nearly $5.5 million for acquisitions and has helped pay for exhibitions, including the Whitney Biennial. It has spent an estimated $12.5 million running the branch museum, according to officials at both the Whitney and Altria. Altria, which is relocating most of its operations to Richmond, Va., listed its Park Avenue building for sale only last week, said Lisa Gonzalez, a spokeswoman. We dont know how long that process will take, she added. The Whitney has had a number of branches over the years, all of which are now closed. It ran one at 55 Water Street from 1973 to 1983 and another at the Federal Reserve Plaza on Maiden Lane from 1988 to 1992. It teamed with corporate sponsors on a branch at the Equitable Center in Midtown from 1986 to 1992 and in the Champion International Corporation building in Stamford, Conn., from 1981 to 2001. In each case the branches closed because of changes in the corporations and loss of support. Mr. Weinberg said that for now the Whitney wants to direct all its energies to building an additional museum in the meatpacking district in Manhattan. It is in the midst of working out the final details with the city to buy 820 Washington Street and 555 West Street, adjacent abandoned shell structures near the entrance to the High Line, the former elevated railway line that the city is transforming into a park. Were hoping to break ground in 09 and open in 2012, Mr. Weinberg said. The combined properties will give the Whitney about 100,000 to 150,000 square feet of gallery space, more than three times the space in its current home. To help the public get used to seeing art in and around the meatpacking district, the Whitney is scouting locations for temporary exhibitions, performances and installations. The Whitney on the Road, Mr. Weinberg said, is a possible name for the effort. One idea is to show Actual Size: Munich Rotary, a 1970 work by Michael Heizer, which the museum has owned for 11 years but has never found the right space to show. Its the kind of wonderful thing we could do in advance of opening downtown, Mr. Weinberg said. The Heizer work is an enormous project: six projected photographic images, each 52 feet wide and 18 feet high, showing the interior of an 18-foot-deep hole that Mr. Heizer dug out of the earth in Munich in 1969. It was given to the Whitney by Virginia Dwan, a Manhattan dealer. Heizer thinks big, and its a challenge for a conventional museum to deal with, said Chrissie Iles, the Whitneys curator of contemporary art. So we are going to try to find a space where it would fit downtown. A SHOW IN FLUX Back at its Madison Avenue home, curators at the Whitney are preparing the second-floor galleries for a show of recent acquisitions that opens Wednesday. Called Two Years, it consists of works that have entered the collection since 2006, by artists including Bruce Nauman, Nancy Spero and Steven Parrino. This is really an opportunity to show some phenomenal work before the Biennial, said Donna De Salvo, the Whitneys chief curator. Among the highlights will be Green Horses, a 1988 video work by Mr. Nauman in which he appears on horseback in the desert plains of New Mexico. It is the first time the artist has appeared in his own work since the early 1970s, Ms. De Salvo said. Even though we had a lot of work by Nauman, we had no video installation. The exhibition also has a 1974 painting by Ms. Spero, Hours of the Night, which consists of 11 vertical panels with imagery and text. Its references are to the social and political issues of the early 1970s, particularly the Vietnam War. The show runs through Feb. 17, but will evolve over that period: Ms. De Salvo plans to rotate what is on display to show the entire range of the recent acquisitions. A FAIR REMAKES ITSELF The number of art fairs trying to cash in on the popularity of Art Basel Miami Beach just keeps growing. At last count 23 plan to set up shop around the magic Dec. 6-9 weekend. The latest is an established fair that has decided to undergo a remake. Art Miami, which has been held in January for 17 years, is moving its dates to coincide with Art Basel Miami Beach and has revised its list of dealers, 80 percent of whom will be new participants. Art Miami will now operate from a 100,000-square-foot tent in the Wynwood district, near the smaller art fairs Pulse and Scope and close to Photo Miami. The area is also the site of a number of private collections that open to the public on fair days. With about 100 galleries participating from 17 countries, including Taiwan and India, Art Miami is billing itself as more diverse than its competitors. We will have everything from cutting-edge to modern art and photography, said Ilana Vardy, its director. As long as we can get high-profile galleries, she added, the high-profile collectors will come. More Articles in Arts »As the Altria Group begins moving its headquarters out of New York and phasing out its charitable arts financing here, where does that leave the Whitney?

The Heizer work is an enormous project: six projected photographic images, each 52 feet wide and 18 feet high, showing the interior of an 18-foot-deep hole that Mr. Heizer dug out of the earth in Munich in 1969. It was given to the Whitney by Virginia Dwan, a Manhattan dealer. Heizer thinks big, and its a challenge for a conventional museum to deal with, said Chrissie Iles, the Whitneys curator of contemporary art. So we are going to try to find a space where it would fit downtown. A SHOW IN FLUX Back at its Madison Avenue home, curators at the Whitney are preparing the second-floor galleries for a show of recent acquisitions that opens Wednesday. Called Two Years, it consists of works that have entered the collection since 2006, by artists including Bruce Nauman, Nancy Spero and Steven Parrino. This is really an opportunity to show some phenomenal work before the Biennial, said Donna De Salvo, the Whitneys chief curator. Among the highlights will be Green Horses, a 1988 video work by Mr. Nauman in which he appears on horseback in the desert plains of New Mexico. It is the first time the artist has appeared in his own work since the early 1970s, Ms. De Salvo said. Even though we had a lot of work by Nauman, we had no video installation. The exhibition also has a 1974 painting by Ms. Spero, Hours of the Night, which consists of 11 vertical panels with imagery and text. Its references are to the social and political issues of the early 1970s, particularly the Vietnam War. The show runs through Feb. 17, but will evolve over that period: Ms. De Salvo plans to rotate what is on display to show the entire range of the recent acquisitions. A FAIR REMAKES ITSELF The number of art fairs trying to cash in on the popularity of Art Basel Miami Beach just keeps growing. At last count 23 plan to set up shop around the magic Dec. 6-9 weekend. The latest is an established fair that has decided to undergo a remake. Art Miami, which has been held in January for 17 years, is moving its dates to coincide with Art Basel Miami Beach and has revised its list of dealers, 80 percent of whom will be new participants. Art Miami will now operate from a 100,000-square-foot tent in the Wynwood district, near the smaller art fairs Pulse and Scope and close to Photo Miami. The area is also the site of a number of private collections that open to the public on fair days. With about 100 galleries participating from 17 countries, including Taiwan and India, Art Miami is billing itself as more diverse than its competitors. We will have everything from cutting-edge to modern art and photography, said Ilana Vardy, its director. As long as we can get high-profile galleries, she added, the high-profile collectors will come.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E1DD123FF93AA35753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=altriagroupinc">Corrections: For the Record<date>Published: October 9, 2007</date><text>Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the effect Altria's decision to move its corporate headquarters to Virginia would have on financing for arts programs in New York misstated the corporation's current holdings.

Its sponsorships included the 2006 Whitney Biennial. At first, some arts groups hesitated to take funds from a tobacco company. But most of them got over it, and now more than 200 organizations in New York, including many known for experimental work, receive a total of about $7 million every year from the company known for the last few years as the Altria Group. That money is about to go away as Altria prepares to move its headquarters out of New York because of a corporate reorganization of its tobacco business. The citys arts world is bracing for the money to run out. Arts groups as varied as the Urban Bush Women in Brooklyn and the Dance Theater Workshop in Manhattan are hustling to find other companies, hedge funds or real estate developers to replace Altrias grants. Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, said she was initially stunned when she learned that Altria would discontinue its funding, which included a $375,000 donation last year. The company has been the primary sponsor of the academys Next Wave Festival since its inception in 1983, and Ms. Hopkins and her staff are seeking new sponsors. They did it because they saw the vision. They got it, she said. Its hard to get money for the arts. Its even harder the more experimental and unusual the program. The separated companies will continue to make charitable contributions but are expected to spend most of their money in areas other than New York. Jennifer P. Goodale, a former actress who is Altrias vice president for contributions, said in an e-mail message: It is unlikely that Altria will be funding arts organizations in New York in the future because, as far as we know, there will be no Altria corporate contributions program, which is a result of the decentralization weve been working on over the past few years. In New York and elsewhere, it is not uncommon for corporate benefactors to come and go because of mergers, economic downturns or relocations. For instance, the Metropolitan Opera scrambled to find a new sponsor for its Saturday broadcasts after ChevronTexaco withdrew its financing in 2003. (Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2000, had sponsored the show for decades; Toll Brothers, the home builder, is now the sponsor.) The Metropolitan Museum of Art, meanwhile, was forced to raise its optional admission prices in the late 1990s after the Readers Digest Association cut its stock dividend during a slump. The museum was a beneficiary of a sizable chunk of stock. But few corporations have been as dependable in funding the arts over decades as Altria has. The company has been warning since 2005 that it would scale back its donations; the last checks to New York groups run through 2008. Several arts groups said they were not optimistic that another patron the size of Altria would emerge. Its going to be hard for many of us, said Patricia Cruz, executive director of the Harlem Stage, which received $125,000 last year from Altria. I hope people look at this as a vacuum to be filled rather than leading an exodus. Altria has consistently ranked among the top three corporate contributors to the arts in the city, while the other top spots rotated among companies that included Time Warner and American Express, said Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts and Business Council of New York. Nationally, Altria ranked 11th in corporate giving last year with about $200 million in cash and in-kind donations, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. Besides plowing millions into the arts across the country, Altria has been a major contributor to domestic violence shelters, hunger programs and disaster relief. In the last decade, the company and its subsidiaries donated $1.5 billion in cash and in-kind contributions to charity. The charitable work for which Altria, called the Philip Morris Companies until 2003, is best known is its contributions to the arts, particularly in New York. The company is credited with being an early pioneer in corporate giving, not just for the sums it donated but for the cleverness with which it did so, encouraging new and innovative works. David Parsons, co-founder and artistic director of Parsons Dance, said a donation from Philip Morris in 1985 gave his new dance company a much-needed shot in the arm. He has received annual donations from Altria since. Heres what it was  the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, Mr. Parsons said during a break in a recent rehearsal. It opens doors. Other funders see that, and they take a second look at you. Philip Morris made its first corporate donation in the mid-1950s to the United Negro College Fund. Its first donation to the arts was in 1958, when it offered the Philip Morris Festival of the Stars, a free outdoor concert in Louisville, Ky., where it operated a factory. In 1965, the company sponsored a traveling exhibition of modern art called Pop &amp; Op that featured 65 artists, including Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein. Two years later, it made its first contribution to the Whitney Museum of American Art, and a year after that to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Philip Morris began providing money to dance companies in the 1970s and aggressively funded new works beginning in 1983 with the New York City Ballet. Since then, it has paid for new works by troupes as varied as the Mark Morris Dance Group and Shen Wei Dance Arts. The company focused its dollars on visual arts and dance because several former chief executives, including Joseph F. Cullman III and George Weissman, were passionate about them. Both Mr. Cullman and Mr. Weissman served on the boards of directors of arts organizations, like many subsequent Philip Morris and Altria executives. 1 2 Next Page » Correction: October 9, 2007 Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the effect Altrias decision to move its corporate headquarters to Virginia would have on financing for arts programs in New York misstated the corporations current holdings.

Post a Comment Enlarge This Image Paul Hansen for The New York Times Snus is a moist, ground tobacco. Im really concerned about my health, said Mr. Froberg, a maître dhôtel, who tries to limit his smoking. This stuff is safer than cigarettes, its discreet, and its really good. Now this form of tobacco is coming to America, in the midst of an intensifying debate over how to define reduced risk tobacco products and how to market them. On Wednesday, a House committee is scheduled to hold hearings on whether the Food and Drug Administration should be given the power to regulate tobacco. Snus (rhymes with loose) is a moist ground tobacco that a user tucks between the cheek and the gum. Unlike chewing tobacco and moist smokeless tobacco  commonly known as dip  snus requires no spitting. Thanks partly to its popularity here, Sweden has the lowest smoking rates in Europe. It also has fewer incidences than its neighbors of smoking-related diseases, including lung and oral cancer. Snus is not without its dangers. It contains nicotine, which speeds the metabolism, and is as addictive as cigarettes. It has also been linked in a recent clinical trial to pancreatic cancer, though, unlike cigarettes, not to lung or mouth cancers. With the Sweden experience as a blueprint, the American tobacco industry is looking to snus as a potentially profitable, less dangerous alternative to cigarettes. Philip Morris USA and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco have begun test-marketing it around the country under their most famous names, Marlboro and Camel. But recalling the false promise of light and mild cigarettes, critics say smokeless tobacco is a Trojan horse, meant to enable companies to hold on to customers who might otherwise quit their tobacco habit outright. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever that smokers are able to switch to smokeless tobacco and remain switched, said Thomas Glynn, the director of cancer science and trends at the American Cancer Society. Still, Mr. Glynn also believes that if every smoker in the United States were to switch to smokeless tobacco, in the next decade we would see fewer cancers and less heart disease. The European Union banned the sale of snus in 1992, partly out of concern that it would be marketed to young people  a policy that almost derailed Swedens membership bid, until a waiver was granted. There are no such restrictions in the United States, where there is a long tradition of smokeless tobacco and a growing market for it. Moreover, advocates say, snus is less harmful than American dip, which is fermented rather than pasteurized, and can cause mouth cancer. I think its a potentially huge market, said Lennart Freeman, president of the North America division for Swedish Match, which dominates the market here, selling some 250 million slim cans of snus a year. The company has begun to sell snus in tobacco shops in New York, Chicago and other cities. Given the negative perception of tobacco and the restrictions on advertising, though, company officials said it would take time to educate Americans about snuss advantages over other tobacco products. In Sweden, snus has existed for some 200 years, enjoying a revival in popularity over the last 20 years. There is little dispute that it has had an impact on smoking habits, at least among Swedish men. In 1976, 43 percent of men here smoked regularly; by 2005, only 14 percent did. During that period, the percentage of men using snus jumped to 22 percent, from 9 percent. But not everyone who takes up snus is a smoker. And not every smoker stops when they use it. A few continue to smoke daily, while others, like Mr. Froberg, smoke now and then. An estimated 5 percent of Swedish men have quit smoking altogether in favor of snus. If you have a product that works well as a smoking-cessation product, then why not use it? asked Dr. Lars E. Rutqvist, the vice president for scientific affairs at Swedish Match. Societies should adopt all measures that are effective in combating smoking-related diseases. Dr. Rutqvist, an oncologist who used to think snus was disgusting, has become one of its most ardent advocates. He argues snus can serve as a less risky alternative for chronically addicted smokers and as a way for less addicted smokers to wean themselves. Those claims  not to mention his recent decision to take a job at a tobacco company  have put Dr. Rutqvist at odds with colleagues in the Swedish medical establishment. Doctors here are deeply divided about the proper role of snus, with some arguing that its risks should not be discounted. 1 2 Next Page » Mark Landler reported from Stockholm and Gothenburg, Sweden, and Andrew Martin from New York.

The justices, without comment, left intact yesterday the Florida Supreme Court’s conclusion that the jury verdict from 1999 would apply to future lawsuits. The jury found that cigarette makers withheld information about smoking risks and put unreasonably dangerous products on the market. The Philip Morris USA unit of the Altria Group and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco unit of Reynolds American face dozens of lawsuits in Florida that could use the verdict as a starting point. Smokers and their family members have until January to file additional suits. “We’re expecting in the tens of thousands to be filed by the deadline,” said Edward L. Sweda Jr., a senior lawyer for the Tobacco Products Liability Project at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston. The cigarette makers contended in an appeal filed in Washington that the lower court’s ruling “promises to serve as a catalyst” for those lawsuits. The appeal stems from a case that at one point threatened the tobacco industry with a $145 billion punitive damage award. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that a state appeals court was correct to overturn the award and that the case could not go forward as a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 700,000 people. At the same time, the state court said many of the jury findings would apply to individual cases. At the Supreme Court, the cigarette makers said those findings were so generalized that their use in future cases would violate the Constitution’s due process clause. Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds filed the appeal along with Brown &amp; Williamson Holdings, the Lorillard Tobacco Company unit of the Loews Corporation and the Liggett Group unit of the Vector Group. R. J.

At the same time, the state court said many of the jury findings would apply to individual cases. At the Supreme Court, the cigarette makers said those findings were so generalized that their use in future cases would violate the Constitution’s due process clause. Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds filed the appeal along with Brown &amp; Williamson Holdings, the Lorillard Tobacco Company unit of the Loews Corporation and the Liggett Group unit of the Vector Group. R. J. Reynolds acquired Brown &amp; Williamson’s United States operations in 2004.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/business/worldbusiness/30altria.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Altria Plans to Spin Off Overseas Unit<date>Published: August 30, 2007</date><text>The Altria Group plans to spin off Philip Morris International, the overseas maker of Marlboros and other cigarette brands, in a move intended to give it more freedom to pursue sales growth in emerging markets. The plans, announced yesterday, would leave Altria with its much smaller domestic tobacco business, which still is the biggest in the United States. The spinoff would clear the international tobacco business from the legal and regulatory constraints facing its domestic counterpart, Philip Morris USA. The companys board announced it would confirm its decision and give the exact timing of the spinoff at its board meeting on Jan. 30. The company plans to close its New York City headquarters as part of the plans, helping save at least $250 million a year in overhead, Altrias chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said in a conference call. Altrias offices and some jobs will move to Richmond, Va., where Philip Morris USA is based. Philip Morris International will maintain a small office in New York. About 400 of 600 current New York employees will lose their jobs, Mr. Camilleri said. Mr. Camilleri will become chief executive of Philip Morris International once the spinoff is completed. Michael E. Szymanczyk, the current chief executive of Philip Morris USA, will succeed Mr. Camilleri at Altria. The proposal is subject to approval by the Internal Revenue Service and the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said. A spinoff of Philip Morris International would be the latest step in a revamping started in March when Altria spun off its majority stake in Kraft Foods. Altria also owns the Philip Morris Capital Corporation, a finance company that is being wound down, and a 29 percent stake in SABMiller, based in London, which brews Miller Lite beer. Under a spinoff, Altria shareholders would get shares in a stand-alone Philip Morris International. Sales at Philip Morris International, based in Lausanne, Switzerland, are more than double those at the United States unit, with 2006 revenue of $48.26 billion, compared with Philip Morris USAs $18.47 billion. Last year, Philip Morris International sold 831 billion cigarettes, making it the worlds largest nongovernment tobacco company by volume. It holds 15.4 percent of the global market.

Skip to next paragraph The New York Times The board of the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International, is meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to spin off the international arm of its cigarette business as part of a restructuring plan to increase shareholder value, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. The American business has hindered the stock price because of fears of more litigation, threats of government intervention and declining cigarette sales in the United States, analysts said. Altria officials declined to comment about the potential spinoff of Philip Morris International. But several Wall Street analysts who cover the company said they believed it was inevitable. This is something that has been in the works for years, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup. To me, its a done deal. By splitting the two companies, Philip Morris International could expand more aggressively abroad, either through innovation or acquisition. Philip Morris USA, meanwhile, would focus on expanding into other tobacco products  like the recent introduction of Marlboro smokeless tobacco  and making its own acquisitions, probably other tobacco companies. It allows P.M.I. to become much more free to pursue growth opportunities, Ms. Herzog said. The Altria Group would probably remain as a holding company for Philip Morris USA and the companys 29 percent stake in SABMiller, the beer company, she said. Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said spinning off the international business would allow shareholders finally to benefit from the companys robust balance sheet. For instance, he said the company has not repurchased Altria stock in about four years because it was holding back money for such things as litigation risk and legal constraints. Longer term, it will provide more financial flexibility, he said of the spinoff. The demand for cigarettes in the United States is in a gradual decline of about 1 or 2 percent a year. Philip Morris USA controls 51 percent of the American cigarette market and generates $18 billion in net revenue. To compensate for the declining smoking market, the company is trying to extend its brand names to new products. For instance, it is now testing a Marlboro smokeless tobacco product, and it also is testing Marlboro snus, which are tobacco packets placed between the cheek and gum that do not generate spit like smokeless tobacco. Snus are geared more toward smokers than aficionados of chewing tobacco. As part of an effort to ramp up its innovation pipeline, Philip Morris USA plans to unveil a $350 million research center in Richmond, Va., that will focus, in part, in developing reduced harm tobacco products. In my opinion, technology will play an incredible role in this industry, particularly reduced risk, Ms. Herzog said. Outside the United States, the demand for cigarettes is relatively flat. Still, Philip Morris International has much more room for growth because it has only about 15 percent of the international market. Philip Morris International generated $48 billion in net revenue last year. Philip Morris Companies changed its name to the Altria Group in January 2003, a name derived from the Latin word altus, which means high. The company said the name was intended to convey the notion of reaching ever higher and was meant to differentiate the parent company from Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International and to reflect the fact that the company had evolved beyond tobacco. Some critics say the name was changed to escape the stigma of selling cigarettes. Regardless, Altrias chairman and chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, has said for several years that he wants to restructure the company as soon as the litigation environment surrounding tobacco settles down.

Skip to next paragraph Related Earnings Report The spinoff of Kraft Foods has pressured earnings at the company, which also reduced its full-year earnings forecast. Altria, the parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, is facing a shrinking American market for cigarettes and has been increasing its international presence, while also looking to introduce other tobacco products in the United States. The company announced yesterday an agreement to acquire an additional 30 percent stake in its Mexican tobacco business from its joint venture partner, Grupo Carso, for $1.1 billion, bringing Altrias total stake to 80 percent.

Altria posted second-quarter profit of $2.22 billion, or $1.05 a share, compared with $2.71 billion, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier. Altria said in June that it would close its cigarette plant in Cabarrus, N.C., by the end of 2010, consolidating American production at its plant in Richmond, Va., and moving some production for non-American markets to Europe. Results include a charge of $318 million related to the planned plant closing. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.15 a share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.13, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts expect Altria to announce plans to spin off Philip Morris International some time this year, and they also expect the company to undertake a large share repurchase.

United Technologies is a case in point. Fully 60 percent of its total sales are either made in the U.S.A. and exported, or made and sold offshore. It exports Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and Sikorsky helicopters, mostly from Connecticut. And its Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioning subsidiaries have carved out leading positions in emerging markets like China, where the two divisions assemble most of their products. Aided by declines in the dollar, those foreign sales are bolstering the parent company's bottom line, which grew 18 percent last year. The price of its stock, one of the 30 in the Dow Jones industrials, reached a record high on Friday of $72.88. ''There's a lot of tension and drum-banging over job losses,'' says James E. Geisler, vice president for finance at United Technologies, which is based in Hartford but has become a global company. In 2006, only 72,500 of the company's 215,000 employees were in the United States. The remainder are based abroad. ''The fact is, companies that are growing are better employers and some of those employees are in the United States,'' Mr. Geisler said. The United Technologies story is part of a broad structural shift in how and where many American companies are making their money. The trend has been in the making for decades, and by now it clearly carries major economic implications, as well as significant investment opportunities. The trend accentuates the divide between workers who benefit from globalization and those who don't, sometimes within the same company. Financial analysts at United Technologies in Hartford overseeing Carrier's sales in India and Pratt engineers designing jet engines in Connecticut for export to Europe certainly benefit; but people who worked in Syracuse in the company's air-conditioning plant, now defunct, do not. Another divide that seems to be widening is between those Americans whose investments capture international growth opportunities and those whose portfolios don't. In short, the economic divisions created by globalization are becoming ever sharper. On the financial side, increasing globalization of American corporate profits may mean, for example, that United States stock markets can retain their lofty elevations even if domestic growth continues to prove tepid -- because leading companies are earning so much abroad. Companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index that break out their international earnings reported at the end of 2006 that they racked up 45.2 percent of their sales through offshore sales and exports. That is up from 32.2 percent in 2001. ''The long-term trend is for more international,'' says Alec Young, chief international equity strategist at S.&amp; P. Many top multinationals have crossed the 50 percent threshold, as General Electric says it will do this year. Part of the explanation for the rising percentages is that the world is where the growth is. ''In Japan, we're seeing some of the strongest economic growth since World War II,'' Mr. Young said. ''And we're seeing upside growth surprises in Europe.'' Emerging markets from India to Brazil also are enjoying big economic gains. ''Real consumerism is breaking out'' in those markets, Mr. Young said. The charge offshore seems certain to continue because chief executives want to invest where they expect growth to occur. The 10 companies with the largest foreign sales in 2006 were some of the biggest names in American business: Exxon Mobil, Ford Motor, General Motors, General Electric, Hewlett-Packard, the Altria Group, ConocoPhillips, I.B.M., the American International Group and Procter &amp; Gamble, according to S.&amp; P. Those figures include only the sales of their offshore subsidiaries, not goods or services exported from the United States. ''Corporate profit growth is going to do better than it would have done if these companies had ignored the opportunities elsewhere,'' says Nigel Gault, an economist at Global Insight, an economic consulting group in Lexington, Mass.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E00E1D71F3FF934A15755C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=altriagroupinc">World Business Briefing: Europe; Altria to Expand Cigarette Output in Europe<date>Published: June 27, 2007</date><text>The Altria Group, the cigarette maker, will close a North Carolina factory and increase European production to save $335 million a year by 2011.

The company, which is based in New York, may be preparing to spin off its international unit, analysts and investors said. Factories in Europe will take over production of Marlboros and other cigarettes bound for Japan and the Middle East, which are currently being made in North Carolina. All of Altria's United States output will be shifted to Richmond, Va. Closing the North Carolina facility, which employs 2,500, will cost about 10 cents a share in the second quarter, Altria said.

Snus (rhymes with loose) is a moist, spit-free variant on traditional chew and dip tobaccos. It comes in a small pouch similar to a tea bag that users most often place inside the upper lip. Snus is widely used in Scandinavia, where numerous studies have shown that it offers smokers an alternative way to get the nicotine and taste of cigarettes with less risk of cancer. Opponents of tobacco use have been divided on whether to encourage smokers to switch to snus because they believe that quitting tobacco altogether is the safest course of action. Philip Morris said the Marlboro snus line would be made at a factory it reopened recently in York County, Va. That factory was brought online as part of a strategy to expand the companys smokeless products and to develop tobacco-related products, a company spokesman, Brendan McCormick, said. Sales of smokeless products have increased at a 6 percent annual rate over the last five years. Philip Morris has been test-marketing two versions of a snus product in Indianapolis under the name Tobaka, with less than stellar results, industry analysts said. One analyst, Christopher Growe at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said last month that most retailers he surveyed in Indianapolis had stopped selling Tobaka. But Philip Morris said last night that it was learning from the test and would continue it. In moving to attach the name of the companys best-selling cigarette brand to snus, Philip Morris, a division of Altria, is following the lead of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, which put its Camel brand name on a snus product it is test-marketing in Austin, Tex., and Portland, Ore., and selling over the Internet. This is a very positive signal to current smokers, said Brad K. Rodu, a professor of medicine at the University of Louisville who has long been an advocate of smokeless tobacco products as the best way to reduce the health impact of tobacco. Professor Rodu, whose research program is sponsored by smokeless tobacco companies, said studies had shown that snus cut the cancer risks of smoking by as much as 98 percent. The most recent research, published in The Lancet, the medical journal published in Britain, reported an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer among Swedish snus users compared with Swedes who used no tobacco. But the combined rate of lung, oral and pancreatic cancer was still far lower than that of Swedish smokers, Professor Rodu said.

Devitre, Altria’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts. A spinoff of Philip Morris International would be the much-anticipated second step of a corporate revamping that began with Altria’s spinoff of Kraft Foods at the end of March. Altria said that profit from continuing operations was $1.03 a share, excluding special items, up from 98 cents a year earlier, but below the average Wall Street estimate of $1.06 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income, which includes Kraft, fell 21 percent, to $2.75 billion, or $1.30 a share. Altria had a gain of 30 cents a share from a reversal of tax reserves after an Internal Revenue Service review of tax returns for the years 1996-99. First-quarter net revenue rose 8.2 percent, to $17.56 billion. Excluding collected excise taxes that are included in the net revenue figure, sales were $9.04 billion. Analysts had forecast $9.17 billion. The Philip Morris International unit benefited from price increases in some markets and also from the weaker dollar, which increases the dollar value of sales overseas. The international unit shipped 213.3 billion cigarettes in the quarter, up 1.5 percent, as an acquisition and gains in Italy, Argentina and other markets outweighed declines in Russia and Japan. International profit rose 9.5 percent, to $2.2 billion.

It could be an astute diagnosis of a malady spreading through boardrooms and financial markets. Research shows that mergers are often poorly timed, with the volume of deals reaching a crest just ahead of peaks in the stock market. And there is little evidence that they improve the fortunes of shareholders  except those of the investment banks that instigate the transactions. The value of global mergers and acquisitions totaled $1.2 trillion in the first quarter, according to the research firm Dealogic. That is the highest amount ever and 23 percent more than the comparable figure for the 2006 quarter. American deals accounted for $442 billion, down a bit from the fourth quarter and a shade below the record set in the first quarter of 2000, when the technology boom began to go spectacularly bust. The feverish activity could help the stock market  for a while. Because cycles in mergers and acquisitions tend to lead the market averages, every transaction may be buying a bit more time for the bulls, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup Investment Research. But what’s in it for merger participants themselves? The fact that the pace of corporate coupling increases after asset prices have soared might make you wonder. So might the de-merger mania that is occurring alongside the wave of takeovers; some companies created through mega-mergers are effectively undoing those transactions or thinking seriously about it. Altria recently cut loose Kraft, which it acquired in the 1980s in the largest corporate combination until then, and DaimlerChrysler is thought to be eager to dispose of its American half, even if it means accepting far less than the $36 billion it paid for Chrysler in 1998. The present run of mergers is fueled by very low yields on junk debt, which can make the numbers work out when they otherwise would not. As long as the financing cost is less than the anticipated cash flow from the combined corporate entity, a merger may seem reasonable. How the businesses will fit together and make their way in the marketplace is almost beside the point. Mergers often fail to produce expected benefits because the assumptions used to justify the transactions are too optimistic and the sale prices prove too high, said Alan Brown, head of investment at Schroder Investment Management in London. “All the evidence points to most deals not being good for the investor in the acquiring company, at least in the short to medium term,” Mr. Brown said. Data compiled by Thomson Financial confirms Mr. Brown’s observation. Share prices of 14 of the 20 companies executing the largest mergers last year fell in the 90 days after the transactions were announced. Of the 15 deals that had a 180-day history since announcement, stocks of 8 of the acquirers had declined. When deciding whether to invest in a company involved in a big deal, the critical factors are the reasons for undertaking the transaction and the price, Mr. Brown said. “One has to look for a really compelling logic for the deal and then that the price is reasonable,” he advised. “Too many deals founder not on the logic but on the price that the seller has managed to extract.” Mergers that work best often involve two similar businesses that are joined to try to achieve economies of scale and added commercial clout, like Exxon and Mobil, Nationsbank and Bank of America, and Procter &amp; Gamble and Gillette.

For Mr. Levkovich, the value of a merger depends on the deal makers more than the deal. If a company’s executives do a good job adding value for shareholders generally, chances are the transactions they arrange will do the same.

Imperial, which makes Lambert and Butler and Embassy cigarettes, offered 11.5 billion euros ($15.3 billion) for Altadis on Thursday, beginning a possible bidding war in the consolidating tobacco industry. Altadis, known for its Gauloises brand, rejected the Imperial offer and is said to consider 53 euros a share  the price Japan Tobacco paid for the British tobacco firm Gallaher Group  an adequate value. Weve seen the Altadis announcement.

Imperials informal approach on Altadis was considered a potentially hostile bid by members of Altadiss board, Spanish press reported on Sunday. Hostile bids are difficult to execute in the tightly regulated sector and have not been tried recently. Shares in Imperial Tobacco rose strongly on Friday after its approach set off speculation that the United States giant Altria, which makes Marlboro, might make a bid for Imperial Tobacco, or team up with Altadis to do so. Analysts said that British American Tobacco also might make a higher offer for Altadis; the Imperial approach represented a roughly 3 percent premium over Altadiss market value at the close on Friday. Alternatively, Altadis might turn the tables and make a bid for Imperial, some industry analysts said. Altadis said on Saturday that it was reviewing its options after its board unanimously rejected the Imperial bid on the ground that it did not reflect the strategic value of the company.

Skip to next paragraph Top, The Oregonian, via Associated Press; Dennis Cook/Associated Press Mayola Williams won a suit against Philip Morris after her husband, Jesse Williams, top, died of cancer. Multimedia Graphic The Opinion Related Text: Supreme Court Ruling (pdf) Multimedia Back Story With The Timess Daniel L. Niemi Although of limited scope, the 5 to 4 decision was a victory for the cigarette industry and for other corporate defendants whose products or behavior have caused widespread injury and who are thus likely to face skeptical or hostile juries. The court was tightly focused on a question of procedural fairness: the need, in the majority’s view, to make sure that juries do not punish defendants for harm to others who are not parties to the lawsuit, or who even may have brought their own lawsuits previously and lost. “The due process clause prohibits a state’s inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. The court thus steered clear of the issue that most animates the debate over punitive damages: whether a punitive damage award that is much greater than the compensatory damages awarded by the jury can be considered unconstitutionally excessive. In this case, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was nearly 100 to one, but the court did not address the issue despite Philip Morris having raised it. What happens next in this lawsuit may provide an early indication of the practical significance of the court’s ruling, as far as it went. The case now goes back to the Oregon Supreme Court, which has options ranging from reinstating the award to ordering a new trial. The original trial of the suit, brought by Mayola Williams, whose husband, Jesse, died of lung cancer after smoking two packs of Marlboros a day for 45 years, took place in 1999. Mrs. Williams’s lawyer asked the jury to “think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been.” The trial judge rejected a request by Philip Morris for an instruction warning the jury that “you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not require any particular wording in the form of a jury instruction. But Justice Breyer said that state judicial systems had a constitutional obligation to avoid “an unreasonable and unnecessary risk” that a jury would calculate the punitive damages based on harm to those not before the court. The issue is complicated because, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the “reprehensibility” of a defendant’s conduct is a factor that a jury is explicitly directed to consider in setting a punitive damages award. Justice Breyer acknowledged that harm to others can serve as a measure of reprehensibility, and that jurors will necessarily consider it. That was appropriate, he said, as long as courts “provide some form of protection” against jurors seeking “to punish the defendant for having caused injury to others.” Sheila L. Birnbaum, a punitive damages specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York, said the court was requiring jurors to “unring the bell” in a way that might prove difficult. “It’s very hard for jurors to disregard something they have heard,” she said. Ms. Birnbaum, who successfully argued the most recent punitive damages case heard by the court before this one, on behalf of the State Farm insurance company in 2003, added that the decision was nonetheless “a step in the right direction” for corporate defendants because it would require trial judges and appellate courts to be attentive to the guidance that jurors receive. Justice Breyer’s majority opinion, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1256, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. It is typical for the court’s punitive damages rulings to cut across the usual ideological lines. In fact, the only real surprise was the vote by Justice Stevens, who had previously voted with the court’s majority to support limits on punitive damages. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens said he was “firmly convinced” that those earlier decisions were correct. But he said that “in my view the Oregon Supreme Court faithfully applied the reasoning in those opinions to the egregious facts disclosed by this record.” He said that “no procedural error even arguably justifying reversal occurred at the trial in this case.” The court’s two new members, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, succeeded justices who supported limits on punitive damages, as they themselves did on Tuesday. But the narrowness of the court’s opinion and its avoidance of the excessiveness issue raised the question of whether, beneath the surface stability, the court’s polarity may have shifted. In the State Farm case that Ms. Birnbaum argued four years ago, the court overturned a punitive damage award that was 145 times greater than the compensatory award. “Few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio” would meet the test of due process, Justice Kennedy wrote then for a 6-to-3 majority, a strong statement that made the court’s failure on Tuesday to address the 97 to one ratio in the Philip Morris case all the more curious. (The Oregon jury awarded Mrs. Williams $821,000 in compensatory damages.) To hold that a damage award is unconstitutionally excessive requires the court to accept the argument that the due process clause contains a substantive component as well as a procedural one. It is on this basis that Justices Scalia and Thomas, who do not accept the modern doctrine of “substantive due process,” have dissented from the leading punitive damages decisions. It is not implausible that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito might share that view. Whether they do might become apparent if the Oregon Supreme Court reinstates the punitive damages verdict and Philip Morris comes back before the justices with a new appeal based on excessiveness. The dissenters tweaked the majority for what they characterized as judicial activism and refusal to give state courts proper respect. “I would accord more respectful treatment to the proceedings and disposition of state courts that sought diligently to adhere to our changing, less than crystalline precedent,” Justice Ginsburg said in an opinion that Justices Scalia and Thomas also signed. In a prepared statement, William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel of Philip Morris, a unit of Altria, said the decision would give the company “an opportunity to fully and fairly defend itself in this and other cases.” Market analysts generally viewed the decision as positive for industry. “Despite a more narrow opinion than we had hoped for, we view the ruling as a positive as it effectively limits the size of punitive damages in future cases,” said Christopher R. Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, in a note to investors. In recent months, investors have pushed Altria’s stock to record highs, in part because they believe the litigation environment against tobacco companies has significantly improved. On Tuesday, Altria’s stock closed at $85.95, down 25 cents. Andrew Martin contributed reporting. More Articles in Washington »WASHINGTON, Feb. 20  The Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned an Oregon jury’s award of $79.5 million in punitive damages against Philip Morris on the ground that jurors might have improperly calculated the figure to punish the cigarette maker for the harm it caused to smokers other than the man whose widow brought the case. Skip to next paragraph Top, The Oregonian, via Associated Press; Dennis Cook/Associated Press Mayola Williams won a suit against Philip Morris after her husband, Jesse Williams, top, died of cancer. Multimedia Graphic The Opinion Related Text: Supreme Court Ruling (pdf) Multimedia Back Story With The Timess Daniel L. Niemi Although of limited scope, the 5 to 4 decision was a victory for the cigarette industry and for other corporate defendants whose products or behavior have caused widespread injury and who are thus likely to face skeptical or hostile juries. The court was tightly focused on a question of procedural fairness: the need, in the majority’s view, to make sure that juries do not punish defendants for harm to others who are not parties to the lawsuit, or who even may have brought their own lawsuits previously and lost. “The due process clause prohibits a state’s inflicting punishment for harm caused strangers to the litigation,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in the majority opinion. The court thus steered clear of the issue that most animates the debate over punitive damages: whether a punitive damage award that is much greater than the compensatory damages awarded by the jury can be considered unconstitutionally excessive. In this case, the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages was nearly 100 to one, but the court did not address the issue despite Philip Morris having raised it. What happens next in this lawsuit may provide an early indication of the practical significance of the court’s ruling, as far as it went. The case now goes back to the Oregon Supreme Court, which has options ranging from reinstating the award to ordering a new trial. The original trial of the suit, brought by Mayola Williams, whose husband, Jesse, died of lung cancer after smoking two packs of Marlboros a day for 45 years, took place in 1999. Mrs. Williams’s lawyer asked the jury to “think about how many other Jesse Williams in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been.” The trial judge rejected a request by Philip Morris for an instruction warning the jury that “you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons.” The Supreme Court on Tuesday did not require any particular wording in the form of a jury instruction. But Justice Breyer said that state judicial systems had a constitutional obligation to avoid “an unreasonable and unnecessary risk” that a jury would calculate the punitive damages based on harm to those not before the court. The issue is complicated because, under the Supreme Court’s precedents, the “reprehensibility” of a defendant’s conduct is a factor that a jury is explicitly directed to consider in setting a punitive damages award. Justice Breyer acknowledged that harm to others can serve as a measure of reprehensibility, and that jurors will necessarily consider it. That was appropriate, he said, as long as courts “provide some form of protection” against jurors seeking “to punish the defendant for having caused injury to others.” Sheila L. Birnbaum, a punitive damages specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom in New York, said the court was requiring jurors to “unring the bell” in a way that might prove difficult. “It’s very hard for jurors to disregard something they have heard,” she said. Ms. Birnbaum, who successfully argued the most recent punitive damages case heard by the court before this one, on behalf of the State Farm insurance company in 2003, added that the decision was nonetheless “a step in the right direction” for corporate defendants because it would require trial judges and appellate courts to be attentive to the guidance that jurors receive. Justice Breyer’s majority opinion, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1256, was joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter and Samuel A. Alito Jr. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.

It stretches the Constitutions guarantee of due process in a way that will make it easier for companies that act reprehensibly to sidestep serious punishments. It also provides unsettling new evidence that the court is more concerned about  and more willing to protect  the powerful than the powerless. An Oregon jury awarded Mayola Williams, the widow of a cigarette smoker, about $821,000 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Ms. Williams argued that Philip Morris had spent 40 years denying the connection between smoking and cancer, even though it knew cigarettes were deadly. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award, saying that Philip Morriss actions had been extraordinarily reprehensible. By keeping Oregonians smoking longer than they otherwise would have, the court said, the companys actions would, naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death. By a 5-to-4 vote that did not follow the usual ideological lines, the court ruled that the award was improper because it punished Philip Morris for harm done to people who were not part of the lawsuit. There is nothing unusual, or wrong, about courts considering the broader impact of a wrongdoers misdeeds. As Justice John Paul Stevens noted in dissent, A murderer who kills his victim by throwing a bomb that injures dozens of bystanders should be punished more severely than one who harms no one other than his intended victim. The fact that Philip Morris hurt so many other smokers along with Jesse Williams is surely relevant to its punishment. The court in recent years has become increasingly activist when it comes to defending the rights of corporations by striking down punitive damage awards. And yesterdays ruling continues that trend. It expands the notion of due process. And it overturns the decisions of a jury and a state supreme court. Unfortunately, the court has been far less activist when ordinary people seek protection or challenge their punishments. The ruling stands in particular contrast with the courts 2003 decision that the Eighth Amendments ban on cruel and unusual punishments did not bar California, under its three strikes law, from sentencing a man to 50 years in prison for stealing $153.53 worth of videotapes. Yesterdays decision is another disturbing sign that  as the current court reads the Constitution  powerful parties have more rights than regular people.

The Altria Group, the company formerly known as Philip Morris, is among the bill’s biggest supporters. Altria’s support has created a split among American tobacco companies who once walked in lock step while disputing claims that cigarettes are addictive, opposing regulation and new taxes, and in fighting off lawsuits. Altria officials maintain that regulation is inevitable and that clear standards would help as the market shifts toward new products like smokeless tobacco and reduced-risk cigarettes. “At some point, this is going to happen,” said Steven C. Parrish, Altria’s senior vice president for corporate affairs. “It would set some clear rules for all the companies to play by.” But the bill’s opponents say that Altria, which makes the world’s most popular cigarette, Marlboro, has more mercenary motives, namely locking up its 51 percent market share of the cigarette business. Because the bill could limit tobacco marketing, Altria’s competitors question how they will be able to woo new customers. “We just don’t feel that it gives us the ability to effectively compete for the business of adult tobacco consumers,” said David Howard, a spokesman for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which makes Camel cigarettes. The bill is being sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts; Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas; Representative Thomas M. Davis III, Republican of Virginia; and Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. Its supporters say that this time there is a good chance of passage, in part because it is supported by the Democratic leadership in Congress and has some bipartisan support. As for concerns that the bill would limit competition, Mr. Waxman said the bill would not eliminate tobacco ads but would focus on prohibiting advertisements that were aimed at children. “I find that a bit disingenuous,” he said of the tobacco companies’ concerns. The federal government has exerted some regulation over cigarettes for some time, for instance banning cigarette advertising from television and other electronic media and requiring health labels on cigarette packages. But the current bill would create more rigorous rules and enforcement than ever before. Mr. Waxman and his co-sponsors argue that regulation by the Food and Drug Administration is necessary because smoking remains the No. 1 cause of preventable death in the United States. “The tobacco industry currently spends over $15 billion a year to promote its products,” Mr. Kennedy said at a news conference. “Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking.” The F.D.A. originally tried to regulate tobacco in the mid-1990s. But the industry challenged the F.D.A.’s authority, and the Supreme Court ruled in 2000 that such regulation required Congressional approval. Several attempts since then have failed. The bill that was introduced yesterday would give the F.D.A. authority to regulate the sale and distribution of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco so they are not marketed to children. It would also regulate marketing to prevent misleading claims related to health. It would also give the F.D.A. authority over the sale of cigarettes to minors, which is currently prohibited by state laws but not always enforced, and it provides for stronger warning labels on tobacco products, with more explicit details of the medical consequences. In addition, the F.D.A. could order a reduction in the amount of nicotine in cigarettes and require companies to submit scientific evidence to the agency if their products claim to be less harmful than regular cigarettes. The bill would also increase the F.D.A.’s tobacco budget. “It will eliminate the many currently unsubstantiated claims, like light and low tar,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Several Wall Street analysts said the big losers could be smaller tobacco companies that offer bargain cigarettes. They might have to raise prices to meet the new standards. Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities, said the bill would be “great” for Altria and its American unit, Philip Morris USA. “It’s kind of like you have the game in hand and fall on the ball,” he said. David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said tobacco regulation could also help Altria and its competitors when they inevitably wind up back in court. “This isn’t a force field against liability but it would make a jury less inclined going forward to punish the industry and award punitive damages,” Mr. Adelman said.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Tobaccos Road Back The number of American smokers usually drops about 1 or 2 percent a year. Government agencies keep adding cigarette taxes and outlawing smoking in restaurants, workplaces and even on public sidewalks. And tobacco companies continue to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements, money that is used in part to produce antismoking ads. For all the industrys apparent troubles, however, the future of cigarettes appears to be brighter than ever. That at least is the message investors are sending as the Altria Group  the company once known as Philip Morris and the maker of the worlds most popular cigarette, Marlboro  prepares to split itself by spinning off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and become, once again, primarily a tobacco company. Today, Louis C. Camilleri, the chief executive of Altria, is expected to set a timetable for completing the spinoff. It is a move that Wall Street is responding to with the equivalent of a standing ovation, but it is not because Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest food company, after Nestlé, will finally shed the taint of tobacco. Investors are glad that Altria will finally be rid of Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies, Velveeta and Tang. Since October, when the company announced its plan for the move, its shares have risen 10 percent. Something that is forgotten in all of this is people like to smoke, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who noted that United States tobacco stocks have beaten the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index in each of the last six years. Its enjoyable and theres not an alternative product. He added: If frozen dinners get too expensive, people will try something else. Thats not true with cigarettes  you are not up at night worried about that product that is going to make cigarettes obsolete. In the five and a half years since Altria sold 280 million shares of Kraft at $31 each in an initial public offering, the stock has remained relatively unchanged, closing yesterday at $34.83. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock. By contrast, shares of Altria have nearly doubled during that period, moving from $47 to yesterdays price of $87.54. It is a remarkable turnabout, considering that in late 2001, Philip Morris announced its plan to change its name to the Altria Group (drawn from the Latin word altus, meaning high, to suggest high performance). At the time, executives said the name change was intended to reduce the damage to the companys reputation that cigarettes were causing, reflected in the long-depressed share price at the time. Now, it is Kraft that is seen by many investors as a hindrance to the company. Why is Wall Street so infatuated with cigarettes? Cigarettes have certain advantages over other consumer products, not the least of which is that they are addictive. They are inexpensive to make, require almost no innovation, there is a global market for them, and cigarette makers can raise prices without seeing much of a drop in business. On top of all that, a recent string of court decisions has convinced investors that the worst of the litigation against tobacco companies is over. That, in turn, has allowed Altria to move forward with a revamping that begins with cutting Kraft loose and will ultimately allow Altria to use the huge amounts of cash generated by cigarettes to buy back stock or acquire other tobacco companies, particularly overseas. You take away Kraft out of Altria and you are left with a balance sheet that is extremely strong, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager at the Vice Fund, a mutual fund that invests in tobacco, gambling, alcohol and military contractors. Altria is the funds biggest holding. Its just a cash cow. The free cash flow on this business is just tremendous. The future prospects are particularly attractive in developing countries, where smoking has not yet declined as it has in more developed parts of the world like the United States and Europe. In China, for instance, the Philip Morris International unit of Altria signed a deal in 2005 that allows it to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes to the countrys 350 million smokers. There are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. But even in the United States, with 45 million smokers, the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria continues to generate sizable profits by raising prices. It also hopes eventually to lure consumers with new tobacco products, including a small tea-bag-like pouch that is smoke-free, spit-free and tucks into the cheek. It says it is also working on developing cigarettes that are less harmful. The exciting part for me, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup, is that tobacco use today will evolve. Its unlikely that there will ever be a 100 percent safe cigarette, but we feel that a reduced-risk cigarette is on the horizon. But some health advocates say that the diminished social acceptability of cigarettes will hurt the long-term prospects of companies like Altria. The industry knows that its days of successfully selling their product in this country are limited, said Dr. David A. Kessler, who called for regulating the tobacco industry as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s and is now dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. They may be finding favor on Wall Street, but theyre not finding favor in the public arena, he added. There are fewer and fewer places that you can go and smoke in public. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »There are plenty of reasons cigarettes would seem to be a terrible business. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Tobaccos Road Back The number of American smokers usually drops about 1 or 2 percent a year. Government agencies keep adding cigarette taxes and outlawing smoking in restaurants, workplaces and even on public sidewalks. And tobacco companies continue to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements, money that is used in part to produce antismoking ads. For all the industrys apparent troubles, however, the future of cigarettes appears to be brighter than ever. That at least is the message investors are sending as the Altria Group  the company once known as Philip Morris and the maker of the worlds most popular cigarette, Marlboro  prepares to split itself by spinning off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and become, once again, primarily a tobacco company. Today, Louis C. Camilleri, the chief executive of Altria, is expected to set a timetable for completing the spinoff. It is a move that Wall Street is responding to with the equivalent of a standing ovation, but it is not because Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest food company, after Nestlé, will finally shed the taint of tobacco. Investors are glad that Altria will finally be rid of Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies, Velveeta and Tang. Since October, when the company announced its plan for the move, its shares have risen 10 percent. Something that is forgotten in all of this is people like to smoke, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who noted that United States tobacco stocks have beaten the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index in each of the last six years. Its enjoyable and theres not an alternative product. He added: If frozen dinners get too expensive, people will try something else. Thats not true with cigarettes  you are not up at night worried about that product that is going to make cigarettes obsolete. In the five and a half years since Altria sold 280 million shares of Kraft at $31 each in an initial public offering, the stock has remained relatively unchanged, closing yesterday at $34.83. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock. By contrast, shares of Altria have nearly doubled during that period, moving from $47 to yesterdays price of $87.54. It is a remarkable turnabout, considering that in late 2001, Philip Morris announced its plan to change its name to the Altria Group (drawn from the Latin word altus, meaning high, to suggest high performance). At the time, executives said the name change was intended to reduce the damage to the companys reputation that cigarettes were causing, reflected in the long-depressed share price at the time. Now, it is Kraft that is seen by many investors as a hindrance to the company. Why is Wall Street so infatuated with cigarettes? Cigarettes have certain advantages over other consumer products, not the least of which is that they are addictive. They are inexpensive to make, require almost no innovation, there is a global market for them, and cigarette makers can raise prices without seeing much of a drop in business. On top of all that, a recent string of court decisions has convinced investors that the worst of the litigation against tobacco companies is over. That, in turn, has allowed Altria to move forward with a revamping that begins with cutting Kraft loose and will ultimately allow Altria to use the huge amounts of cash generated by cigarettes to buy back stock or acquire other tobacco companies, particularly overseas. You take away Kraft out of Altria and you are left with a balance sheet that is extremely strong, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager at the Vice Fund, a mutual fund that invests in tobacco, gambling, alcohol and military contractors. Altria is the funds biggest holding. Its just a cash cow. The free cash flow on this business is just tremendous. The future prospects are particularly attractive in developing countries, where smoking has not yet declined as it has in more developed parts of the world like the United States and Europe. In China, for instance, the Philip Morris International unit of Altria signed a deal in 2005 that allows it to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes to the countrys 350 million smokers. There are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. But even in the United States, with 45 million smokers, the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria continues to generate sizable profits by raising prices.

Anti-smoking groups have seized on the report as evidence that the Food and Drug Administration must begin regulating tobacco products. A steady and significant increase in nicotine in cigarettes over the past eight years or so certainly seems worrisome. It sounds as though companies like Philip Morris, which makes Marlboros, are secretly and deceptively increasing the nicotine in their cigarettes and, apparently, lying about it (since they deny the assertions of the report), all in an effort to increase the addictive potential of their cigarettes and harm the publics health. There are, however, a number of problems here. First, though I dont dispute the reports assertion that overall nicotine yields in cigarettes have increased, this does not appear to be the case for Marlboro, the leading cigarette brand that commands over 40 percent of the market. Using the data on nicotine yields of Marlboro cigarettes provided by Philip Morris to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for 1997 through 2006, I conducted my own analysis of the trends in Marlboro nicotine yields. The average nicotine yield of 16 Marlboro brands consistently reported for the entire time period was 1.81 milligrams in 1997; in 2006, it was also 1.81 milligrams. Thus, the average nicotine yield of these cigarettes in 2006 was exactly the same as in 1997, nine years earlier. Second, an increase in nicotine yields does not necessarily mean an increase in the harm to smokers. It is well documented that smokers compensate for changes in nicotine levels to get a relatively constant nicotine dose. This is why light cigarettes are not safer products. The nicotine levels in each cigarette may be lower, but smokers simply smoke more of them, negating the potential benefits of reduced nicotine levels. Indeed, smoking many light cigarettes is every bit as dangerous, if not more so, because of the increased exposure to other pollutants in cigarettes, than smoking fewer regular cigarettes. Similarly, if nicotine yields increase, smokers might be expected to compensate by smoking slightly less. This could actually have a marginally positive health benefit if it reduces overall cigarette consumption. Third, tobacco companies are not necessarily doing anything wrong if they are, in fact, increasing nicotine yields. The paradox of light cigarettes demonstrates that reducing nicotine yields is actually the last thing we would want  it would, again, result only in people smoking more, and thus increasing tar delivery and the resulting carcinogenic health effects. The nicotine in cigarettes is indeed a public health problem. But anti-smoking groups have drawn the wrong conclusion from the Harvard report: the problem isnt whether or not nicotine levels are increasing; its that this deadly, addictive product is available in the first place. For the past two years, public health groups  led by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids  have lobbied for passage of legislation that would grant the F.D.A. the authority to regulate tobacco products; shockingly, this bill, which Senator Edward Kennedy is preparing to re-introduce in the next few weeks, would expressly preclude the F.D.A. from simply removing nicotine from cigarettes. It remains unclear why public health groups would support such a provision, though presumably its their attempt to appease Philip Morris, whose support is deemed necessary to get the proposed legislation through Congress. Its not enough to regulate the varying degrees of nicotine in cigarettes. Ultimately, theres only one way to deal with the addictive effects of nicotine, especially on children: grant the F.D.A. the authority to get nicotine out of cigarettes altogether. Anti-smoking groups shouldnt settle for anything less. Michael Siegel is a professor of social and behavioral sciences at Boston University.

We understand the skepticism regarding how a tobacco company can be serious about preventing youth from smoking, but our business is grounded in competing for the largest share of the adult tobacco market. As a business and as parents, we don't want kids to smoke, and when society feels that we behave otherwise, it actually harms our business. Youth smoking prevention is a complex problem whose solution requires a comprehensive approach. Our program is based on positive youth development and is guided by parenting and child development experts on our Parent Advisory Board. While we have serious concerns with the design and conclusions of the study cited in your editorial, the study does highlight the need for continued understanding of how parent-directed youth smoking prevention advertising affects youth. We intend to pursue this issue and to engage with relevant experts to identify opportunities to improve all youth smoking prevention efforts, especially our own.

Don't Smoke'' fails to have the desired effect on a teenager when it comes from a parent who smokes. Unfortunately, this message is equally ineffective when it comes from a nonsmoking parent. Telling ''parents, as role models, to stop smoking themselves'' might improve their health, but it won't deter their kids from smoking because teenagers' role models are not their parents. Think about it: Do teenagers imitate their parents' choices in clothing, hairstyle, music or reading material? As the behavioral geneticist David Rowe observed some years ago, ''Socially, learning to smoke is primarily a peer group process.'' The chief contribution made by parents is genetic. Genes play as important a role in addiction to nicotine as they do in alcoholism. Judith Rich Harris Middletown, N.J., Nov 27, 2006 The writer is the author of two books on parental and peer influences on children and adolescents. To the Editor: I have never smoked cigarettes in my life, and at 54, I am unlikely to start anytime soon. But I believe that one thing that has never changed in all these years is this: It is ''cool'' to smoke when you are a teenager. I see teenagers smoking all the time. They know the perils of smoking. They hear it in school, from parents, and from countless ads. (The same can be said of under-age drinking.) But unfortunately, the perception for too many teenagers is that it is cool to stand in a parking lot, cruise around or hang out with friends and have a butt in hand. There is nothing in the world that teenagers want more than to be cool. Just running more ads will never change that. And I'm glad that my teenager has more sense and self-esteem. Paul Bilsky Manchester Center, Vt. Nov. 27, 2006 To the Editor: I am ashamed to admit that in the late 1980's, I wrote sales promotions aimed at youth for Philip Morris. While cigarettes in cartons were purchased mainly by women, boys tended to buy individual packs of a brand. So we went after those kids with offers geared to their interests. Perhaps Philip Morris has come a long way, baby. Or not.

The justices, without comment, left intact an Illinois Supreme Court decision that threw out the case against Philip Morris, which is a division of the Altria Group and is the nation’s largest cigarette maker. Antismoking activists had hoped the verdict would be the first in a series of awards around the country against the industry over light cigarettes. “It’s clearly the end of lights litigation in Illinois,” said David Adelman, a Morgan Stanley analyst who has an overweight rating on Altria. Altria shares fell 33 cents, to $83.42, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In overturning the award last year, the Illinois Supreme Court said smokers could not invoke a state consumer protection law because the Federal Trade Commission had endorsed the “light” and “low tar” descriptions in settlements with other cigarette makers. Like many states, Illinois bars claims over actions specifically authorized by a government agency. Supreme Court intervention might have complicated plans by Altria, which is based in New York, to spin off its Kraft Foods unit. On Nov. 16, Altria’s chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said the company was ready to split off the food company, pointing to what he said was a waning risk of costly tobacco-related awards. The tobacco industry is still defending a separate nationwide class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on behalf of light cigarette smokers. That suit, which invokes federal racketeering law, also raises questions about the legal force of the F.T.C. settlements. Arguments in Major Antitrust Case WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (AP)  The Supreme Court pressed both sides Monday in a case that turns on the question of how much evidence plaintiffs must provide to litigate a private antitrust-conspiracy suit. Some experts consider the case, Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, which stems from the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as the most important antitrust case to reach the Supreme Court in 20 years. The class-action suit was filed in 2003 on behalf of United States consumers of local telephone and Internet service, claiming that incumbent local telephone companies, or Baby Bells, illegally conspired to prevent competition by excluding new local phone companies from their territories and agreeing not to compete against each other. The original seven incumbent local phone companies have been reduced to four through mergers and acquisitions: Verizon Communications, the BellSouth Corporation, Qwest Communications and AT&amp;T. A federal district court dismissed the case, saying plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to show that a conspiracy would most likely be proved at trial. That decision was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled in October 2005 that a plaintiff must submit only a “short and plain statement of the claim” to survive a motion to dismiss. The case is being closely watched by numerous companies, who contend that a low standard would allow “meritless” and “abusive” cases to go forward. But the plaintiffs argue that a higher standard could make it too difficult for individuals to bring valid antitrust cases.

Its Web site brims with information on the dangers of smoking, and it has mounted a campaign of television spots that urge parents, oh so earnestly, to warn their children against smoking. That follows an earlier $100 million campaign warning young people to “Think. Don’t Smoke,” analogous to the “just say no” admonitions against drugs. All this seems to fly against the economic interests of the company, which presumably depends on a continuing crop of new smokers to replace those who drop out or die from their habit. But in practice, it turns out, these industry-run campaigns are notably ineffective and possibly even a sham. New research shows that the ads aimed at youths had no discernible effect in discouraging smoking and that the ads currently aimed at parents may be counterproductive. That disturbing insight comes from a study just published in The American Journal of Public Health by respected academic researchers who were supported by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Using sophisticated analytical techniques, the researchers concluded that the ads aimed directly at young people had no beneficial effect, while those aimed at parents were actually harmful to young people apt to see them, especially older teenagers. The greater the teenagers’ potential exposure to the ads, the stronger their intention to smoke and the greater their likelihood of having smoked in the past 30 days. Just why the costly advertising campaigns produce no health benefits is a rich subject for exploration. The ads are fuzzy-warm, which could actually generate favorable feelings for the tobacco industry and, by extension, its products. And their theme  that adults should tell young people not to smoke mostly because they are young people  is exactly the sort of message that would make many teenagers feel like lighting up. (Trial testimony has made it clear that the goal of Philip Morris’s youth smoking prevention programs is to delay smoking until adulthood, not to discourage it for a lifetime.) The most exhaustive judicial analysis of the industry’s tactics, by Judge Gladys Kessler of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, concluded that the youth smoking prevention programs were not really designed to effectively prevent youth smoking but rather to head off a government crackdown. They are minimally financed compared with the vast sums spent on cigarette marketing and promotion; they are understaffed and run by people with no expertise; and they ignore the strategies that have proved effective in preventing adolescent smoking. The television ads, for example, do not stress the deadly and addictive impacts of smoking, an emphasis that has been shown to work in other antitobacco campaigns. Philip Morris says it has spent more than $1 billion on its youth smoking prevention programs since 1998 and that it devised its current advertising campaign on the advice of experts who deem parental influence extremely important. But the company has done only the skimpiest research on how the campaign is working. It cites June 2006 data indicating that 37 percent of parents with children age 10 to 17 were both aware of its ads and spoke to their children about not smoking. How the children reacted has not been explored. And somehow the company forgot to tell the parents, as role models, to stop smoking themselves. Philip Morris, the industry’s biggest and most influential company, is renowned for its marketing savvy. If it really wanted to prevent youth smoking  and cut off new recruits to its death-dealing products  it could surely mount a more effective campaign to do so.

Philip Morris says it has spent more than $1 billion on its youth smoking prevention programs since 1998 and that it devised its current advertising campaign on the advice of experts who deem parental influence extremely important. But the company has done only the skimpiest research on how the campaign is working. It cites June 2006 data indicating that 37 percent of parents with children age 10 to 17 were both aware of its ads and spoke to their children about not smoking. How the children reacted has not been explored. And somehow the company forgot to tell the parents, as role models, to stop smoking themselves. Philip Morris, the industry’s biggest and most influential company, is renowned for its marketing savvy. If it really wanted to prevent youth smoking  and cut off new recruits to its death-dealing products  it could surely mount a more effective campaign to do so.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/27/business/media/27formula.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Formula One Racing Severs Many Tobacco Ties<date>Published: November 27, 2006</date><text>LONDON, Nov. 26  Even though the Formula One auto racing circuit is on an annual break, its sponsorship machine has been busy. Last month in Brazil, at the last race of the season, AT&amp;T announced a multiyear deal to become lead sponsor of the Williams team, the highest-profile involvement in Formula One for the American telecommunications company. Days earlier, the Dutch bank ING Group detailed a broad sponsorship of the Renault team, the first involvement in the sport for ING. The bank said it would also sponsor the first race of the season, in Melbourne, Australia. Last week, Grupo Santander, a Spanish bank, announced a five-year deal to support the McLaren Mercedes team, joining Mutua Madrileña, a Spanish insurer, on the McLaren roster. Now executives at these and other brands, as well as the racing teams they support, are scrambling to put together marketing strategies for the next season, which begins in March. The flurry of activity comes as Formula One draws ever closer to ending its long-term relationship with tobacco companies. With regulators in Europe and elsewhere moving to close some of the last loopholes that permitted cigarette companies to sponsor auto racing, the hundreds of millions of dollars that these brands used to lavish on Formula One are dwindling. As of next season, two tobacco brands that have long been high-profile Formula One sponsors will be out of the circuit. Mild Seven, owned by Japan Tobacco, has ended its relationship with the Renault team, while a deal between British American Tobaccos Lucky Strike brand and the Honda team has also expired. Other cigarette brands, like West and Benson &amp; Hedges, previously bowed out. Tobacco brands had been willing to pay a premium for these sponsorships because Formula One was one of the last marketing options left for the industry. With that money now disappearing, some teams feared a financing crisis. Instead, analysts say, as racing executives prepare to gather next week in Monaco for a conference on the commercial side of the sport, the sponsorship market looks surprisingly healthy. The departure of the tobacco brands may actually have helped to attract a new kind of marketer, analysts say. The recent agreements are not the first involving banks and telecommunication firms, but the ING and AT&amp;T deals give these brands so-called title sponsorships at some of the most prominent teams  positions that in the past were typically held by tobacco brands. For the financial services community, this is an opportunity to get involved in one of the only sports available that actually reaches a truly global audience, said Nanne Bos, a spokesman for ING. Global television audiences for the races typically are rivaled by only a few other annual sporting events, including the Champions League soccer final and the Super Bowl in America, said Kevin Alavy, a London-based analyst at Initiative, a media-buying agency. Jean-François Caubet, a spokesman for Renault, acknowledged that the deal with ING was slightly less lucrative than the Mild Seven sponsorship, though he declined to provide numbers. But he said the new arrangement would be more valuable for Renault, adding that the French carmaker planned to step up its promotional spending for the Formula One team. The problem we had with a tobacco company is that it was difficult to build a global communications strategy around it, Mr. Caubet said, noting that in the past, Renault had to block out the Mild Seven logo on much of the promotional material. One prominent team, Ferrari, will continue to accept tobacco money next season, even as it faces racing without the driver Michael Schumacher, who retired last month. Philip Morriss Marlboro brand plans to support the team financially through 2011 under a deal signed last year. At races in Europe and most other Formula One sites, Ferrari will be barred from displaying the Marlboro logo. We still believe its appropriate for us to be involved, said Tommaso Di Giovanni, a Philip Morris spokesman, adding that the company would try to develop innovative ways to convey the sponsorship to consumers. More Articles in Business »LONDON, Nov. 26  Even though the Formula One auto racing circuit is on an annual break, its sponsorship machine has been busy.

The court made a good start when it laid down guidelines on when punitive damages are excessive. But eventually, it went too far. Today, it hears arguments in a case that offers a perfect opportunity to pull back to a more reasonable position. The case involves Philip Morriss challenge to damages awarded to the widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer. An Oregon jury awarded Jesse Williamss widow, Mayola Williams, more than $821,000 in actual damages, and $79.5 million in punitive damages. Mrs. Williams said Philip Morris had engaged in 40 years of publicity to undercut concerns about cigarettes, even though it knew for most or all of that time that smoking was deadly. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages award. The court said the conduct that Philip Morris was charged with would have kept many Oregonians smoking past the point when they would otherwise have quit. It said the companys deceit thus would, naturally and inevitably, lead to significant injury or death. The Supreme Court has already indicated that at some point punitive damages become so large that they violate due process. But it has done a poor job of identifying that point. Originally, it laid down some reasonable factors for lower courts to consider, including how reprehensible they considered the defendants conduct. But in 2003, the court put forth the dubious proposition that punitive damages should generally be in a single digit ratio to actual damages  so with actual damages of, say, $100,000, punitive damages should be under $1 million. Constitutional principles can seldom be boiled down to a formula, and it is difficult to see why the court should rein in juries so tightly. The purpose of punitive damages is, the Supreme Court has noted, punishing unlawful conduct and deterring its repetition. In cases of extremely bad conduct, particularly when a defendant is large and willful, a bigger award may be necessary. In this case, $79.5 million does not strike us as unreasonable. Nor do we see any basis for holding that this jury verdict, affirmed in a thoughtful decision by Oregons highest court, is a denial of Philip Morriss due process rights. A final problem with the Supreme Courts rule of thumb on punitive damages is that it has been far less restrictive when it comes to punishing people. In 2003, the court held that California did not violate the ban on cruel and unusual punishment when it sentenced a man under its three-strikes law to 50 years for a theft of $153.53 worth of videotapes. That is a far more disproportionate punishment than Philip Morris got, for far less offensive conduct.

During a conference call with analysts, Altrias chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said that the board had carefully weighed the risks and rewards of a sell off and had decided to proceed. The precise timing of the sale is to be announced at the companys January board meeting. Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International. I think todays announcement clearly shows to the world that the board is comfortable with the entire litigation environment and is therefore prepared to move forward, Mr. Camilleri said. The announcement is an about-face for Altria, which said in September that a divestiture of its Kraft shares would be put off indefinitely, after a federal judge ruled that smokers of light cigarettes could pursue fraud claims as a class-action suit. The significance is the board is moving away from their very traditional stance and being a little more aggressive, said Christopher Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. In doing so, the board signaled to investors that they would not have to wait much longer to benefit from the value created by spinning off Kraft, he said. Mr. Growe said a spinoff could happen as soon as this spring, but he added that the boards announcement was vague enough for it to put off the move at its January meeting. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock, and its planned divestiture is part of a larger restructuring of the company. Bonnie Herzog, a Citigroup analyst, called the announcement very positive news. It is clear that the boards priority is to break up the company and now the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the breakup has finally diminished, she wrote in a research note. Altria shares rose $2.28, or 2.9 percent, to close at $82.10 after the announcement. Mr. Camilleri said the decision would be timed to coincide with the release of a strategic plan by Krafts chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, to spur the companys profits. Ms. Rosenfeld, who was named chief executive in June, is expected to release her strategy in February. In allowing the class-action suit in September, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn found substantial evidence that manufacturers knew that light cigarettes were at least as dangerous as regular cigarettes, though they were often promoted as a safer alternative. Many analysts, however, believe the class-action status will be overturned on appeal. In addition, yesterday, Altria posted a third-quarter profit of about $2.88 billion, or $1.36 a share, compared with $2.88 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 3.7 percent to $25.9 billion, from a year earlier.

Go to Election Guide More Politics News During the first term under the leadership of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., the justices were able to find common ground with some regularity by agreeing not to decide much. By the time the term ended in late June, the extent to which the members of the newly configured court were prepared to confront either precedent or one another remained unclear. Chances are high that the new term, which begins on Monday, will be different. The cases that the court has agreed to decide  38 so far  offer few off-ramps, requiring instead that the justices proceed to rulings that will define the new court in both substance and style. Less than six weeks from now, for example, the court will hear the Bush administrations defense of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. While there are some secondary issues, there is no escaping the fact that at the end of the day, the Supreme Court will have to declare whether the federal statute is constitutional. In doing so, it will have to grapple with the meaning of a 5-to-4 decision that struck down a similar state law six years ago. The administration will argue that if the federal statute cannot coexist with that precedent, the court should overrule the earlier case. Two cases on whether public school systems can take race into account in maintaining balance in individual schools do not confront the courts precedents quite as directly. But coming only three years after a sharply divided court permitted the continued use of race in university admissions, the decisions in these cases will provide the first clear indication of where the center now lies on questions of race and public policy after the retirement of Justice Sandra Day OConnor. Justice OConnor held the balance of power on such questions for years, and wrote the opinion three years ago in the case from the University of Michigan Law School. The business community is watching several cases closely, particularly an appeal of a $79.5 million award of punitive damages against the cigarette maker Philip Morris, upheld by the Oregon Supreme Court on behalf of the family of a smoker who died of lung cancer. Of all the areas of Supreme Court doctrine most likely to be affected by the courts change in membership, punitive damages ranks high on the list. It is also something of a wild card, because the question of whether the constitutional guarantee of due process places any substantive limits on the award of punitive damages by state courts has divided the court in a way that follows no ideological pattern, and the inclinations of the new justices are unknown. The consistent dissenters from the courts effort to curb punitive damages have been Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice OConnor were in the majority in seeking to limit punitive damages. If their successors, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., agree with the dissenters, the courts shift could be abruptly and bitterly disappointing to those encouraged by the courts halting but increasingly assertive steps in setting boundaries on punitive damages. The new chief justice has made some notable administrative choices since the last term ended. As his administrative assistant, he hired Jeffrey P. Minear, a senior lawyer in the office of the solicitor general and a longtime familiar figure at the court. The title of administrative assistant understates the role its holder plays in the day-to-day management of the court. Previous administrative assistants have come from a variety of backgrounds; Chief Justice Rehnquists last assistant, Sally M. Rider, had held several top-level positions as a government lawyer. But none has ever been the chief justices professional peer, as Mr. Minear clearly is. His 56 Supreme Court arguments, in fact, surpass Chief Justice Robertss 39. Both men are the same age, 51. In another development, the court has revised its practice of waiting two or three weeks to post argument transcripts on its Web site. Beginning on Tuesday (in observance of Yom Kippur, the court has scheduled no arguments on Monday), the court will post transcripts on the day of argument at www.supremecourtus.gov. While the court continues to resist television coverage of its sessions, the change is a step toward public access that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. These are some of the leading issues for the new term: Abortion Rights Two federal appeals courts, in St. Louis and San Francisco, declared the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act of 2003 unconstitutional, basing their rulings on the Supreme Courts decision in Stenberg v. Carhart, which struck down Nebraskas similar law six years ago. The new cases, Gonzales v. Carhart, No. 05-380, and Gonzales v. Planned Parenthood, No. 05-1382, are the Bush administrations appeals of those rulings. The statute outlaws a surgical procedure that doctors use to perform abortions after about 12 weeks of pregnancy. In its decision six years ago, the Supreme Court held by a vote of 5 to 4 that the law had to take into account medical judgments that the procedure was sometimes necessary for a pregnant womans health. Congress responded by enacting a federal law without a health exception, declaring that the procedure was never necessary to protect a pregnant womans health. Among other issues, the new cases therefore present the issue of the respective roles of Congress and the court in defining the scope of constitutional rights, an issue on which Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a dissenter in the case six years ago, has been particularly protective of the courts role. Racial Quotas in Schools Federal appeals courts upheld student assignment plans in Louisville, Ky. (Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education, No. 05-915) and Seattle (Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, No. 05-908). Both cities have long struggled to achieve integration, and now seek to maintain it by taking race into account in limiting students choices of which schools to attend. While many justices are wary of this divvying us up by race, as Chief Justice Roberts phrased it in a voting rights case last term, the same justices also tend to support local education policies. The National School Boards Association is filing a brief supporting the school systems, while the Bush administration is arguing that the assignment plans are unconstitutional. Punitive Damages Limits The court has laid down various markers for curbing the discretion of state court systems to award punitive damages. In Philip Morris USA v. William, No. 05-1296, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the $79.5 million award, nearly 100 times the compensatory damages a jury had awarded the smokers widow. This is far greater than the 10-to-1 ratio that the courts most recent decision, State Farm v. Campbell in 2003, suggested as the outer limit of due process. On the other hand, earlier cases concerned economic rather than physical injuries. The courts new membership aside, this case is sufficiently distinctive in several ways so as to make the outcome unpredictable. Air Pollution Regulation Two cases present interpretive issues under the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 05-1120, 16 states and other parties are challenging the Bush administrations view that Congress has not authorized federal regulation of motor vehicle emissions that contribute to global warming. The question in Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corporation, No. 05-848, is what the law requires of utility companies seeking to modernize aging power plants.

The National School Boards Association is filing a brief supporting the school systems, while the Bush administration is arguing that the assignment plans are unconstitutional. Punitive Damages Limits The court has laid down various markers for curbing the discretion of state court systems to award punitive damages. In Philip Morris USA v. William, No. 05-1296, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the $79.5 million award, nearly 100 times the compensatory damages a jury had awarded the smokers widow. This is far greater than the 10-to-1 ratio that the courts most recent decision, State Farm v. Campbell in 2003, suggested as the outer limit of due process. On the other hand, earlier cases concerned economic rather than physical injuries. The courts new membership aside, this case is sufficiently distinctive in several ways so as to make the outcome unpredictable. Air Pollution Regulation Two cases present interpretive issues under the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, No. 05-1120, 16 states and other parties are challenging the Bush administrations view that Congress has not authorized federal regulation of motor vehicle emissions that contribute to global warming. The question in Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corporation, No. 05-848, is what the law requires of utility companies seeking to modernize aging power plants.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/business/31altria.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Altria Raises Dividend Less Than Expected<date>Published: August 31, 2006</date><text>The Altria Group, the cigarette and food producer, raised its quarterly dividend yesterday by 6 cents, or 7.5 percent, to 86 cents a share, less than some analysts had expected.

Skip to next paragraph Small BusinessGo to Special Section » That company, Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest packaged-food company, after Nestlé, was not invited because its parent owns a tobacco company, a type of business the W.H.O. refuses to deal with. That snub was just one of the many reasons Kraft Foods has been itching to be independent of its parent, Altria Group, and be free of what many Kraft employees refer to as the tobacco taint. Altria also owns Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International, which make Marlboro and many other brands of cigarettes. Todays meeting of Altrias board may bring Kraft  which sells food carrying the Maxwell House, Nabisco and Oscar Mayer labels, among others  one step closer to its goal. With the last major legal challenge over marketing practices by the tobacco industry having cleared two weeks ago, Altrias 11-member board is likely to discuss the timing of a much-anticipated and imminent corporate overhaul. But Altrias board is not expected to announce a Kraft spinoff after the meeting. Wall Street analysts who follow Altria say they expect the company, which has been planning an overhaul since 2004, to take its time in making a final decision on the timing of what would be one of the largest tax-free corporate spinoffs. This board is highly conservative and they will exercise caution in every way you can imagine, said Christine Farkas, a tobacco analyst at Merrill Lynch. Altria declined to comment on the board meeting and the timing of an overhaul. One possible concern for Altrias board is the risk that tobacco plaintiffs lawyers may try to get an injunction blocking a spinoff of Kraft, arguing that a disposition of the food companys assets would represent a fraudulent conveyance. Lawyers could argue that since there may be financial judgments against Altria, the company does not have the authority to divest itself of Krafts assets. Altria is expected to spin off its 88 percent stake in Kraft by giving its shareholders 1.46 billion Kraft shares; stockholders would receive 0.70 share of Kraft for each share of Altria that they own. David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Altria wanted to be careful not to look as if it was quickly claiming victory after a federal judge declined to hold it and other tobacco companies liable for $10 billion in a Department of Justice racketeering case. The board needs to show that they have done a very complete and thorough analysis of all the legal issues and that theyve exercised sound judgment in this restructuring, not that it was quick action the moment after the Department of Justice lawsuit was resolved, Mr. Adelman said. Altria and other tobacco companies still face plenty of litigation, though none of it is considered a major threat. One suit that will be closely watched, however, is the Barbara Schwab case from 2004, part of a class of suits arguing that tobacco companies practiced deceptive marketing for light cigarettes. A hearing on whether the case will be certified as a class action is scheduled for Sept. 13 in United States District Court in Brooklyn. Some analysts eager to see Kraft spun off said they did not believe that the Schwab case, even if certified, would hold up the companys reorganization. Investors in both Kraft and Altria say they favor a spinoff because they believe that each company will be stronger in the long run without the other. Investors say that Kraft, which has performed poorly in the last four years, has dragged down the value of the tobacco side of the business. Ms. Farkas at Merrill Lynch estimates Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International are trading at a multiple of 9 times 2007 earnings, versus Reynolds American, which is trading at 9.7 times earnings, and British American Tobacco, at 10.3 times earnings. Internationally, Philip Morris is expanding its business, and in the United States, where smoking is declining, the company has managed to achieve revenue and earnings gains through price increases. At Kraft, it is expected that a disbursement of shares to Altria stockholders will result in a temporary decline in Krafts stock price, as a significant portion of Altria shareholders sell their new Kraft shares because they do not want to own shares in a food company. Longer term, however, many investors say an independent Kraft will be better able to manage its business. Theres a huge advantage that, as the top management of Kraft, youre not reporting to anyone else, said David Driscoll, a food analyst at Citigroup. Last month, Kraft replaced Roger K. Deromedi as chief executive and brought in Irene B. Rosenfeld from PepsiCo to run the company. Every executive of every company in America wants to be independent, said Mr. Adelman of Morgan Stanley. No one likes being second fiddle, and I certainly think Irene Rosenfeld wants to be the chairwoman of a large independent company. Altrias chairman and chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, now serves as Krafts chairman. An independent Kraft would also be free to make large stock-based acquisitions, something it cannot do now because Altria needs to maintain at least an 80 percent stake in Kraft to be able to engineer a tax-free spinoff.

New Politics Blog News, updates and insights on the midterm elections, the race for 2008 and everything in-between. Go to Election Guide More Politics News Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images When John Ashcroft was attorney general, he urged a settlement in the tobacco suit. The deception, Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court for the District of Columbia said, resulted in an immeasurable amount of human suffering. But in her ruling here in a racketeering suit brought by the Justice Department against the industry, Judge Kessler also had good news for the leading tobacco companies. Judge Kessler ordered the companies to stop labeling cigarettes as low tar or light or natural or with other deceptive brand descriptors which implicitly or explicitly convey to the smoker and potential smoker that they are less hazardous to health than full-flavor cigarettes. She rejected a government proposal that the industry be forced to underwrite a multibillion-dollar program to help smokers quit and to educate young people about the hazards of tobacco. Judge Kessler said that under a recent appeals court ruling she had no power to impose such large financial damages. The judge said she regretted not being able to punish the companies further. Her ruling said they were shown in a nine-month trial to have marketed and sold their lethal product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus on their financial success and without regard for the human tragedy or social costs that success exacted. Her 1,742-page decision amounted to a detailed history of the efforts of the industry  and, notably, its lawyers  over almost 50 years to confuse the public about a danger that was evident to the health professions. Cigarette makers, the judge said, profit from selling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a staggering number of deaths per year, an immeasurable amount of human suffering and economic loss and a profound burden our national health care system. Although the failure to impose tougher penalties disappointed antitobacco groups, the decision could force tobacco companies to overhaul some ways of doing business, especially in marketing and advertising cigarettes and other tobacco products. Judge Kessler also ordered the companies to begin an advertising campaign in newspapers and on television networks on the adverse health effects of smoking. The remedies apply to Batco; Brown &amp; Williamson; Lorillard; Philip Morris and its parent, Altria; and R. J. Reynolds, part of Reynolds American. Another defendant, Liggett, was excluded. The judge said it did not have a reasonable likelihood of future violations. The Justice Department, which brought the case in 1999 in the Clinton administration and had seemed less eager to pursue it under President Bush, said in a statement it was disappointed that the court did not impose all of the penalties the department had recommended. But the department said that it was hopeful that the remedies that were imposed by the court have a significant, positive impact on the health of the American people. In a statement on Thursday night, William S. Ohlemeyer, an Altria vice president and lawyer, said the companies believed that many parts of the decision were not supported by the law or the evidence presented at trial, and appear to be constitutionally impermissible or infringe on Congress sole right to provide for the regulation of tobacco products. Wall Street analysts hailed the case as a big victory for the companies. Theres nothing in this ruling that is going to hurt the profitability of the businesses, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Adelman said the ruling threw into question the fate of major brands like Marlboro Lights and Camel Lights. Sales of light brands constitute more than 50 percent of the cigarette market in the United States, according to Mr. Adelman. Analysts also said they believed that the companies had strong legal grounds for a successful appeal. The likelihood that the light issue ends here is low, said Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. I think this will get appealed to D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and there may even be issues here for the Supreme Court. William V. Corr, executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an antismoking group linked to the government suit, said he had hoped for tougher penalties. But Mr. Corr said he was pleased that that the judge had identified the tobacco companies as a rogue industry that was guilty of 50 years of lying to the American people. Mr. Adelman said he did not think that the companies would be damaged by the finding that they were deceptive. This industry is not a bunch of Boy Scouts, he said. Its an industry that was not well regarded by the public, anyway. So I dont think there are significant public relations or legal ramifications from the decision. The decision was issued after American stock markets had closed. In early after-hours trading, the stocks of Altria, Reynolds American and other tobacco makers rose. Among the companies named in the suit, Altria, the countrys largest maker of cigarettes, stands to gain the most, as the ruling clears the way for a much anticipated spinoff of its Kraft Foods unit. The Associated Press reported that a spokesman for Reynolds, Mark Smith, said executives were gratified that the court did not award unjustified and extraordinarily expensive monetary penalties. Mr. Smith said Reynolds was disappointed by other parts of the ruling, which its lawyers will analyze before suggesting action. Representatives at Brown &amp; Williamson did not return calls. Before the ruling, tobacco companies had won a string of victories in cases involving the dangers of smoking. Last month, the Florida Supreme Court upheld a decision to toss out a $145 billion judgment in a class-action suit. In December, the Illinois Supreme Court threw out a similar $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris. Cigarette makers have argued that it was unfair for the federal government to seek additional penalties in light of their $246 billion settlement in 1998 with state governments. The federal case dates from 1999, when President Bill Clinton promised in his State of the Union address to unleash the Justice Department to bring a civil racketeering suit against tobacco manufacturers. The suit filed that year was one of the governments largest in the scope of charges and the resources devoted to it, accusing cigarette makers of decades of fraud, deceptive advertising and dangerous marketing. But the election of Mr. Bush, a major recipient of campaign donations from the industry, brought a re-examination of the case. John Ashcroft, the new attorney general, called the suit weak and pushed for an out-of-court settlement. Career prosecutors working on the case protested a Justice Department decision last year to scale back its request for the companies to finance the national stop-smoking campaign, to $10 billion from $130 billion. The department said it was forced to reduce the amount because of an appeals court decision last year that blocked the department from trying to seize ill-gotten profits from the tobacco industrys past practices. At the time, Judge Kessler said the appeals court decision was a body blow to the governments case. Melanie Warner contributed reporting from Boulder, Colo., for this article.

Altria, which is a majority owner of Kraft Foods, said net profit increased 1.6 percent on strong growth in international tobacco and food sales. Altria also raised its full-year guidance. ''We are confident in the long-term growth potential of the international business,'' the chief financial officer, Dinyar S. Devitre, said. He projects volume growth overseas of 4 percent to 5 percent, and excluding acquisitions, growth of 1 percent this year. The company said net income grew to $2.71 billion, or $1.29 a share, from $2.67 billion, or $1.28 a share, in the second quarter a year ago. Revenue climbed 4 percent, to $25.77 billion, from $24.78 billion last year. Excluding certain tax and revamping costs, the company reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.41 a share, up almost 7 percent from $1.32 a share in last year's second quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial on average expected second-quarter earnings of $1.37 a share, on $17.8 billion in revenue. The company raised its full-year guidance to $5.40 to $5.50 a share from $5.25 to $5.35 a share. Wall Street projects full-year earnings to be $5.30 a share. Shares of Altria rose to $80.40, a 52-week high, before settling at $80.05, up 56 cents. The stock has been trading higher since July 6, when the Florida Supreme Court decertified a class-action lawsuit. The verdict reversed the largest punitive award in United States history, in which a jury awarded plaintiffs $145 billion, and helped clear the way for the company to break itself into either two or three parts. A spinoff of the Kraft unit is expected to happen first, although not until a civil racketeering case with the Justice Department is resolved. The company has been experiencing declining cigarette consumption in the United States, as health concerns and a growing number of smoking bans drive down demand by nearly 2 percent a year.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/business/07tobacco.html?ref=altriagroupinc">Big Award on Tobacco Is Rejected by Court<date>Published: July 7, 2006</date><text>Tobacco companies in the United States won a major legal victory yesterday when the Florida Supreme Court upheld a decision to toss out a $145 billion judgment against them. Skip to next paragraph Related Text of the Opinion (pdf) The ruling, in what is one of the last remaining personal injury class-action cases against tobacco companies, is a crushing blow to plaintiffs' lawyers, who have pushed for large class-action cases with the potential for multibillion-dollar verdicts. The six-judge Florida court stated that smokers' cases "are highly individualized" and "do not lend themselves to class-action treatment." Investors applauded the decision, which sharply reduces the possibility of large, bank-breaking awards in tobacco cases. Shares of the two largest companies named in the suit, Altria Group, the parent of Phillip Morris, and Reynolds American, which owns R. J. Reynolds, were up sharply. Altria closed up $4.43, or 6 percent, at $77.76, and Reynolds American closed up $4.59, or 4 percent, at $118.95. The ruling is perhaps most important for Altria, which is preparing to spin off its Kraft Foods unit. The company has said that the long-running lawsuit, originally led by a Miami Beach pediatrician, Howard A. Engle, who has emphysema, was one of the major litigation hurdles the company needed to clear before it could restructure. Dawn Schneider, an Altria spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on when a breakup would take place. Altria consists of Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris International and Kraft Foods, which is 86 percent owned by Altria. Yesterday's ruling follows another industry-friendly outcome in a large case in Illinois. In December, the Supreme Court of Illinois threw out a $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris USA in a class-action consumer fraud suit that had accused the company of deceiving smokers by marketing its "light" cigarettes as having lower levels of tar and nicotine. Despite these two victories, analysts say Altria will probably hold off announcing details of a restructuring until after there is a ruling on a civil racketeering case filed by the Department of Justice against Philip Morris and several other large cigarette makers. The government, which originally filed its case in 1999 during the Clinton administration, seeks damages of $14 billion over 10 years as well as fines if youth smoking rates do not decline and government monitoring of company research and development. A nine-month trial concluded a little more than a year ago and tobacco companies say they are expecting a ruling from Judge Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court in the District of Columbia within the next few months. Among investors, hopes are high for another tobacco-friendly outcome in the Department of Justice case. Tobacco companies have already won several victories in the case, including a ruling in February 2005 that the government cannot seek financial penalties from tobacco companies for previous wrongdoing, only for future infractions. In response, the Justice Department cut its financial demands from $280 billion to the current $14 billion. "The D.O.J. case has already been emasculated," said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. "It can't be ignored, but it isn't something that's going to prevent an Altria breakup." In a research note, a Citigroup analyst, David Driscoll, said a Kraft spin-off could take place two months after the Justice Department case was resolved. Altria is eager to restructure because it believes it would have greater value as two or three separate units. While sales and earnings at Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International have been on an upswing, Kraft's business has stagnated in recent years and may be dragging down the value of the tobacco business. Altria's price-to- earnings ratio trails that of Reynolds American, though Philip Morris is the global and domestic market leader in cigarette sales. Some analysts say an Altria breakup could be good for Kraft, the country's largest maker of packaged food. Mr. Adelman of Morgan Stanley said an independent Kraft could use its stock to make large acquisitions and to help retain and attract talented managers. In June, the directors of Kraft Foods ousted the chief executive, Roger K. Deromedi, and the company has recently experienced a number of high-level departures. But it is unclear if a Kraft spinoff would bolster the food company's sluggish stock price. Mr. Driscoll of Citigroup said a Kraft spinoff could drive down Kraft's stock, because Altria shareholders who receive Kraft shares in the deal may sell some of them. Though it is now much less probable there will be a class-action verdict that could bankrupt a tobacco company, yesterday's decision in the Engle case could open the door to a lot of small cases being filed in Florida by individual smokers. While the Florida court struck down the $145 billion award, it has upheld two individual damage awards to Florida cancer patients: $2.9 million to Mary Farnan and $4 million to the estate of Angie Della Vecchia, who died in 1999. The court also supported a part of the jury's original verdict in the Engle case that found that smoking causes a variety of diseases and that tobacco companies concealed information and acted negligently. The ruling means any new case filed in Florida can start with those claims already proved. "This is going to open up a whole new chapter of cases in Florida where you could see a large number of smaller verdicts," said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an antitobacco group. Both Altria and R. J. Reynolds say they will probably appeal those portions of the court's ruling. Charles Blixt, general counsel for R. J. Reynolds, said that even if many of these individual cases do come forward, they do not represent a significant financial threat to tobacco companies. "There's always been the potential for large numbers of individual lawsuits being filed," he said. "I think it's proven that we can defend successfully against those kinds of cases." Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting for this article. More Articles in Business »Tobacco companies in the United States won a major legal victory yesterday when the Florida Supreme Court upheld a decision to toss out a $145 billion judgment against them. Skip to next paragraph Related Text of the Opinion (pdf) The ruling, in what is one of the last remaining personal injury class-action cases against tobacco companies, is a crushing blow to plaintiffs' lawyers, who have pushed for large class-action cases with the potential for multibillion-dollar verdicts. The six-judge Florida court stated that smokers' cases "are highly individualized" and "do not lend themselves to class-action treatment." Investors applauded the decision, which sharply reduces the possibility of large, bank-breaking awards in tobacco cases. Shares of the two largest companies named in the suit, Altria Group, the parent of Phillip Morris, and Reynolds American, which owns R. J. Reynolds, were up sharply. Altria closed up $4.43, or 6 percent, at $77.76, and Reynolds American closed up $4.59, or 4 percent, at $118.95. The ruling is perhaps most important for Altria, which is preparing to spin off its Kraft Foods unit. The company has said that the long-running lawsuit, originally led by a Miami Beach pediatrician, Howard A. Engle, who has emphysema, was one of the major litigation hurdles the company needed to clear before it could restructure. Dawn Schneider, an Altria spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on when a breakup would take place. Altria consists of Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris International and Kraft Foods, which is 86 percent owned by Altria. Yesterday's ruling follows another industry-friendly outcome in a large case in Illinois. In December, the Supreme Court of Illinois threw out a $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris USA in a class-action consumer fraud suit that had accused the company of deceiving smokers by marketing its "light" cigarettes as having lower levels of tar and nicotine. Despite these two victories, analysts say Altria will probably hold off announcing details of a restructuring until after there is a ruling on a civil racketeering case filed by the Department of Justice against Philip Morris and several other large cigarette makers. The government, which originally filed its case in 1999 during the Clinton administration, seeks damages of $14 billion over 10 years as well as fines if youth smoking rates do not decline and government monitoring of company research and development.

Even as tobacco companies claim to be fighting the battle against youth smoking, their methods ooze with reverse psychology. By warning adolescents not to smoke until they are older, cigarette corporations are in effect telling young people that smoking is an exclusively adult activity, off limits to children. I'm sure that message isn't intended to tempt teenagers, already craving to assert their independence, into lighting up. Jason Liebowitz Rockville, Md. If a cigarette manufacturer acknowledges the harm of its product, stops targeting the teenage demographic and spends money trying to help people to quit, is it fair to blame the company? There's nothing wrong with being suspicious of Altria's and Steve Parrish's motives, but at least this devil that we do know is trying, as opposed to those reckless new companies that would leap at the chance to usurp Philip Morris USA. A.C. Riccio New York Steve Parrish is probably correct when he says that ''if Philip Morris USA were to shut down tomorrow, it would not reduce the consumption of cigarettes at all.'' It's also correct that young kids can purchase dangerous narcotics on the street, whether I sell them to them or not. Still, I'm not going to do it. Robert Carlton Upland, Calif.

Parrish, whose title is senior vice president for corporate affairs, is a highly paid executive at Altria Group, a New York-based holding company that is the 10th-most-profitable corporation in America. If the name of the company doesn't strike you as terribly familiar, that's because a few years ago the company changed its name. It used to be called Philip Morris, a name that still attaches to two of its holdings, Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International. (Altria also owns Kraft Foods.) So, yes, let's stipulate right up front: Steve Parrish represents the country's leading tobacco company, whose best-known brand, Marlboro, is so dominant it accounts for 4 out of every 10 cigarettes smoked in the United States. Last year, Philip Morris USA alone made $4.6 billion in profits. What was it that Warren Buffett once said? "You make a product for a penny, you sell it for a dollar and you sell it to addicts." They most certainly don't make widgets. Skip to next paragraph Andrew Bettles for The New York Times Readers’ Opinions Forum: Tobacco Regulation Should tobacco be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration? Complete Coverage Times Topics: Smoking &amp; Tobacco Let's stipulate a few other things. First, despite everything  the universal knowledge about the dangers of tobacco, the warnings on cigarette packaging, the antismoking public-service ads  lots of people still smoke, and one of every two long-term smokers will die from the habit. In all, more than 400,000 smokers in the U.S. will succumb this year to heart disease, lung cancer, emphysema or other diseases because they smoked. Although the trend has gone steadily downward over the past two decades, some 20 percent of the adult population smokes  that's about 48 million people. John Seffrin, C.E.O. of the American Cancer Society, calls tobacco-related diseases "the single-most-preventable cause of death in the world." Who can disagree? You'll no doubt recall that in the mid-1990's, there was a huge public outcry about the behavior of the tobacco industry, and efforts were made to bring the cigarette companies to heel. State attorneys general sued the big tobacco companies, and private class-action suits were mounted; Congress held hearings excoriating Big Tobacco, while Dr. David Kessler, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration at the time, tried to claim regulatory authority over the industry; whistle-blowers leaked damning documents to the press. It was a moment when the cigarette companies were exceedingly vulnerable, and serious reform could have been imposed by the federal government. But that didn't happen. A reform effort failed in Congress, and 46 states and the industry wound up settling their litigation with something called the M.S.A.  the Master Settlement Agreement  which imposed marketing and advertising restrictions on cigarettes, financed an antismoking ad campaign and transferred a staggering sum of money ($206 billion over 25 years) from the big tobacco companies to the state governments. (Four states settled separately for an additional $40 billion.) And then the body politic moved on. So, a final stipulation: Cigarettes aren't going away. Nobody is about to ban tobacco, nor is anybody about to put the cigarette companies out of business, much as they might like to. These days, although Philip Morris USA loses the occasional lawsuit, the litigation threat that once seemed so onerous has become quite manageable. And though the M.S.A. has done some very good things  it's the reason you no longer see cigarette billboards  it has both limits and unintended consequences. For one, it has resulted in the rise of about 100 small cigarette companies  with names like Liberty Brands and Virginia Brands  that now undercut the big boys on price. And it has given the states a rooting interest in the continued prosperity of the tobacco companies, because they now depend on M.S.A. money to balance their budgets. All the while, cigarettes remain exactly what they've always been: the most dangerous unregulated legal product in the country. When you talk to Steve Parrish about all of this, though, he doesn't use the language tobacco executives once used. He doesn't talk about "individual choice," nor does he pretend that cigarettes aren't addictive. On the contrary: "Cigarettes are addictive and cause the disease and death of hundreds of thousands of people every year," he said in one of our conversations. "When you set tobacco on fire and inhale it into your lungs, bad things happen." In another conversation, he said, "If fewer people died from smoking, that would be good for Altria's shareholders." He says that it is important to keep kids from starting to smoke and freely concedes that tobacco can never be viewed as just another product because it is so deadly. It can be quite startling the first time you hear him say these things. Most amazing of all, Parrish says that tobacco needs to be regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. The industry has long fought such efforts; it waged legal war, for instance, against Kessler's claim of jurisdiction, finally winning in the Supreme Court, which ruled that only Congress could give the F.D.A. the authority Kessler had sought. Yet since 2000, thanks in large measure to Parrish, Philip Morris USA has been calling for the regulation of cigarettes. Two years ago, Altria made a serious, sustained effort to have such a law enacted, which was strongly backed by the country's leading anti-tobacco lobby, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, as well as all the other big public-health groups, and fiercely opposed by the rest of the industry, including archrival Reynolds American. Although the measure twice passed the Senate, it died in a conference committee. Among anti-tobacco advocates, Parrish's words are treated with varying degrees of skepticism. "Parrish is different from other tobacco executives in many ways," says Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. "He is exceptionally bright and skillful. He has been the catalyst for Philip Morris taking a number of positions that surprise public-health advocates and that on their surface are consistent with what public-health advocates have long supported. But having said that, the jury is still out on what he really intends." Myers was quick to add, "One can look at the history here and wonder whether what Philip Morris is doing today is nothing more than a sophisticated version of what they've always done." Paul Billings, of the American Lung Association, says: "I think Philip Morris is aggressively trying to demonstrate it is changing, but its words don't match its deeds. In Marlboro, they still have the No. 1 brand for kids. I think they are just as despicable as the other tobacco companies." 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10Next Page » Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

The amount was 97 times greater than the compensatory damages that an Oregon jury awarded in the case to the widow of a smoker who died of lung cancer. As in earlier punitive damages cases, the question for the justices is whether the award was so disproportionate to the injury as to violate the constitutional guarantee of due process. The Supreme Court has been closely divided in these cases, and with two new justices, the court may have decided that the time was right for a fresh look. When the justices take up the case in their next term, they will hardly be writing on a clean slate. In an important victory for corporate defendants, the court three years ago overturned an award of $145 million in punitive damages against the State Farm insurance company and set out some guidelines. In the State Farm case, a Utah jury had assessed compensatory damages of $1 million, meaning that there was a 145:1 ratio of punitive damages to compensatory. Finding the punitive award "neither reasonable nor proportionate to the wrong committed," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority that "few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio between punitive and compensatory damages, to a significant degree, will satisfy due process." The vote in that case was 6 to 3; two members of the majority, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, are no longer on the court. Not only for that reason, the outcome in the new case, Philip Morris USA v. Williams, No. 05-1296, is far from certain. Punitive damages decisions have not followed the court's typical liberal-conservative ideological alignments. Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were the dissenters last time, with Justice Ginsburg complaining that the majority was "boldly out of order" to invade the province of state legislatures and state courts in placing limits on punitive damages. Further, the court's major punitive damages rulings have come in cases in which the injury that led to the lawsuit was economic rather than physical. The State Farm case began as a suit over the insurance company's initial refusal to settle a claim for a policyholder. Another important precedent, a 1996 decision that overturned a $2 million punitive damage award against the BMW automobile company, began as a complaint that cars were being sold as new without informing buyers that the paint had been touched up. In his opinion in the State Farm case, Justice Kennedy noted that the case involved "no physical injuries." While he did not elaborate, the suggestion was that other considerations might apply had the harm to the plaintiffs consisted of more than "only minor economic injuries." The plaintiff in the new case, Mayola Williams, was married to a man who began smoking while serving in the United States Army in Korea in 1950 and who went on to smoke three packs of Marlboro cigarettes a day for decades. In 1996, lung cancer was diagnosed in the man, Jesse Williams, and he died the next year. Mrs. Williams's lawsuit asserted that the maker of Marlboro, Philip Morris, which with its various brands accounts for about half the cigarette sales in the United States, had perpetrated a 50-year fraud to conceal the health effects of smoking. Her lawyer asked the jury to consider "how many other Jesse Williamses in the last 40 years in the state of Oregon there have been." The company's Supreme Court appeal argues that it violates due process to punish a defendant "for the effects of its conduct on nonparties," that is, on other smokers whose cases were not before the jury. Rejecting that argument in its opinion in February of this year, the Oregon Supreme Court said that Philip Morris "engaged in a massive, continuous, near half-century scheme to defraud the plaintiff and many others" by concealing the truth and inducing its customers to keep smoking. The state court called the company's conduct "extraordinarily reprehensible, by any measure of which we are aware." The Supreme Court's precedents have referred to "reprehensibility" as a factor to consider in evaluating a punitive damages award. In this case, Philip Morris argues in its appeal, the Oregon court improperly permitted its conclusion on reprehensibility to "override the constitutional requirement that punitive damages be reasonably related to the plaintiff's harm." The company's appeal was supported by briefs filed by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Product Liability Advisory Council, a coalition of 133 manufacturers. The case will be argued in November or December.

Altria earned $3.48 billion, or $1.65 a share, in the quarter, up from $2.6 billion, or $1.25 a share, in the period a year ago. The recent results include a benefit of 46 cents a share from a reversal of tax reserves after an Internal Revenue Service review of the company's returns from 1996 to 1999, along with several other items. Excluding all items, Altria earned $1.28 a share, matching the estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Without the items, the chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said the businesses still delivered operating results that met management's expectations. Philip Morris USA, its domestic tobacco operation, based in Richmond, led them all with the strong performance of the leading Marlboro brand, he said. On Wednesday, Kraft reported a 41 increase in first-quarter earnings, mainly because of its piece of the favorable tax audit. Its net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 61 cents a share, from $713 million, or 42 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Altria owns 87.6 percent of Kraft. Altria's revenue increased 3 percent, to $24.36 billion, in the quarter from $23.62 billion in the year-earlier period, led by a 4.3 percent increase in domestic tobacco sales. Philip Morris USA delivered the best operating results, posting a 7.5 percent increase in operating income as it benefited from lower promotional allowance rates and higher reported volume. The company's shipment volume was up 1.2 percent, to 43.3 billion units  but was essentially flat when adjusted for the additional shipping day in the quarter when compared with a year ago. In the United States, the tobacco unit increased its retail share to 50.4 percent in the quarter, up from 50 percent in the year-earlier period as Marlboro continued to gain a bigger chunk of the market. The food divisions' operating income was down  North American food by 1.5 percent and international food by 44 percent. Shares rose $1.08, to close at $70.04.

The dispute arises out of a binding determination by an independent consultant made public on Tuesday that the $246 billion Master Settlement Agreement of 1998, which ended lawsuits against the companies over the health care costs of smoking, was a "significant factor" in the companies' loss of market share. From 1997 to 2003, smoking in the United States fell by 21 percent. The 1998 agreement, which included major restrictions on cigarette marketing, listed three conditions that would reduce the amount companies had to pay. The consultants agreed that the first two had been met: the companies' market share fell more than 2 percent, and the settlement agreement played a major role in the decline. But the companies are arguing that the states did not "diligently enforce" statutes that require companies not participating in the agreement to create escrow accounts to cover losses in any future litigation that might involve them, the third condition to win a reduction. The smaller companies generally sell discount cigarettes. The big companies say they are entitled to a reduction of $1.2 billion of the $6.5 billion they are scheduled to pay as the next installment of the settlement, which is due the states on April 17. "We believe the states have diligently enforced their statutes," said Tom Miller, the Iowa attorney general and co-chairman of the National Association of Attorneys General tobacco committee. "We are negotiating with the companies to make sure they pay the full amount," Mr. Miller said. A spokeswoman for Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco company, said the company would have no comment on the negotiations.

While most tobacco-related lawsuits have sought billions of dollars in punitive damages, this suit, filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, asks that Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and a unit of Altria, be required to pay for low-dose CT scan tests, a new method for identifying potentially cancerous lesions in the lungs. The suit, which seeks class-action status, would include smokers in New York State who are 50 or over, have been smoking at least a pack of Marlboros a day for 20 years and have not been diagnosed with lung cancer. Jerome H. Block, a lawyer at Levy Philips &amp; Konigsberg in New York who filed the suit, said it was intended to save lives by getting smokers tested early. "Hopefully, this suit will change things so that we will be dealing with lung cancers that are caught when they can be treated," Mr. Block said. "Today, most detection happens when cancer is already advanced." Mr. Block said he did not have a specific number of people who could be included in the suit, but he estimated that it could be in the tens of thousands. Two previous attempts to hold cigarette companies liable for medical monitoring have failed. A Louisiana jury in 2003 and a West Virginia jury in 2004 rejected plaintiffs' requests for medical monitoring, including low-dose CT scans. Since those cases were decided, Mr. Block said, the use of low-dose CT scans for lung cancer detection has become more established. The tests, which can be done on existing CAT scan machines using radiation doses that are 70 percent less than standard levels, do not conclusively detect lung cancer. Patients who test positive for lesions could undergo a PET (positron emission tomography) scan or a biopsy. If those procedures, which are typically covered by insurance, indicate the presence of cancer, a patient would then likely undergo surgery. Robert Smith, director of Cancer Screening at the American Cancer Society, said that the CT scan was very effective in the early detection of lung cancer and that a major trial was under way to determine how effective it might be in reducing deaths from lung cancer. Dr. Steven Markowitz, a professor for environmental sciences and director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College, said that most lung cancer was detected only after patients started to experience an intense shortness of breath or coughed up blood. "At that point their doctor will do a chest X-ray and see a mass that's quite large," said Dr. Markowitz, who has been using low-dose CT scans to detect cancers in nuclear energy workers for the Energy Department. According to the American Cancer Society, lung cancer, once detected, kills 85 percent of those afflicted within five years. The lawsuit seeks to have Philip Morris pay for low-dose CT scans by proving that the design of Marlboro cigarettes was defective and could be made safer. Mr. Block said the case would use the testimony of former Philip Morris employees given during other tobacco cases, including the continuing Justice Department suit. New York law requires that manufacturers make products that are reasonably safe. He said he wanted Philip Morris to set up a fund to pay for annual tests, which cost about $500 each, because most insurance plans do not cover them. Philip Morris said it had no comment because it had not seen the complaint. The latest suit comes amid a brightening litigation picture for Philip Morris. In December, the Supreme Court of Illinois threw out a $10 billion judgment in a class-action suit that had accused the company of deceiving smokers by marketing its "light" cigarettes as having lower levels of tar and nicotine. The decision averted what would have been a major financial blow to Philip Morris and gave investors reason to believe that the company's litigation problems were starting to ease. The company is still awaiting a decision from the Florida Supreme Court in the long-running class-action suit. In 2003, an appeals court overturned a record $145 billion damage award; the Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on whether that rejection was appropriate.

Skip to next paragraph Karen Bleier/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images The court ruled that the use of "light" and "low tar" for cigarettes was authorized by the Federal Trade Commission. The Supreme Court of Illinois threw out a $10 billion judgment against Philip Morris USA in a class-action suit that had accused the company of deceiving smokers by marketing its "light" cigarettes as having lower levels of tar and nicotine. In a 4-to-2 decision, the court ruled that the use of "light" and "low tar" for cigarettes was authorized by the Federal Trade Commission and that Philip Morris could not be held liable for such marketing. The decision paves the way for an expected restructuring of Philip Morris's parent company, Altria, and a spinoff of its Kraft Foods division. Louis C. Camilleri, Altria's chief executive, has said the company is likely to pursue a restructuring once major litigation hurdles have been cleared. An analyst, David Adelman of Morgan Stanley, said, "I think this is one of the most important decisions in the history of tobacco litigation." Philip Morris still faces two other significant legal challenges, but analysts say the Price case in Illinois - the lead plaintiff is Sharon Price - had been the most formidable, primarily because of its $10 billion award. "This was the big risk to the company, both psychologically and financially," said Marc Greenberg, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. Mr. Greenberg said that if Philip Morris was able to win a favorable ruling in the long-running Engle case in Florida, he thought the company could go through with a spinoff of Kraft by the middle of next year. Altria had no comment on the decision other than to say it was "gratified" by the outcome. Altria owns 85 percent of Kraft's shares. The ruling adds to an increasingly favorable litigation outlook for Philip Morris and is likely to cripple a whole class of cases. While new tobacco suits are being filed every month, many have been dismissed. This year, more than 135 suits naming Philip Morris have been tossed out by courts. In a presentation to investors in early November, Mr. Camilleri reported that there had been a "significant decline" in Philip Morris's outstanding case count. Altria investors are eager to see a Kraft spinoff because they believe that the three parts - the domestic and international tobacco businesses and Kraft - are worth more separately than as a whole. Analysts say a spinoff of Kraft, the nation's largest packaged food company, would allow Altria to make other acquisitions. Lately Kraft's earnings have sagged, and the company's management is looking for ways to both minimize exposure to fluctuating commodity prices and to sell healthier products. Already, Altria has laid the groundwork for a spinoff. Departments like information technology and trademark management have been decentralized, and at least 100 corporate positions have been transferred to the operating companies. But Altria is still not in the clear. The company is awaiting a decision in a Department of Justice suit as well as the class-action case in Florida, where the state Supreme Court is reviewing a $145 billion award that was overturned on appeal. A decision is expected within a few months. Philip Morris also faces 25 other potential class actions claiming that the marketing of "light" cigarettes deceived people into believing they are healthier, although those cases are not now perceived as a threat. Plaintiff lawyers characterized the ruling yesterday as one based on narrow legal grounds relating to government regulation. They point out that a lower Illinois court found in 2003 that Philip Morris's Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes were not healthier than regular cigarettes and, in fact, were more toxic. That ruling was overturned yesterday. "It's a terrible, sad day for consumers in Illinois," said Jeffrey S. Cooper, whose law firm, SimmonsCooper, is based in East Alton, Ill., and represents individuals with personal injury claims against tobacco companies.

But the Stock Is Still Up.<date>Published: August 14, 2005</date><text>WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - On and on they go, mammoth lawsuits against the nation's biggest tobacco companies. Just two weeks ago, Philip Morris USA and five other cigarette makers were sued in a federal court in Boston by a group seeking to recover $60 billion for the government in Medicare benefits for smoking-related diseases. Lawyers for the group, the United Seniors Association, said the law also allowed the court to award an additional $60 billion to the plaintiff. The lawsuit is just the latest in more than 50 years of legal challenges to the tobacco industry. Hundreds of other cases are still pending in this country and abroad, including some that have been grinding on for years, like the federal government's effort to claim $280 billion in a racketeering case. As the nation's largest cigarette maker with half the domestic market, Philip Morris, alone, is currently a defendant in 454 cases; it spent $933 million in legal costs from 2002 to 2004, with lawyers billing $850 an hour and, in rare cases, up to $1,000. Are company officials concerned about the Boston case? Are they concerned about any case? To some extent, yes, they say. But this is an industry that long ago accepted litigation as a routine cost of business. "Obviously, we take the litigation very seriously," said Steven C. Parrish, a senior vice president of the Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris. Mr. Parrish added, "We believe we have the appropriate strategies and resources to successfully manage the litigation." Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris has a modest staff that oversees the company's litigation and retains leading law firms and specific lawyers on a case-by-case basis. For the trial in the government lawsuit, which ended in June after nine months, much of the courtroom work was handled by two lawyers representing Philip Morris - Dan K. Webb of Winston &amp; Strawn in Chicago and Theodore V. Wells Jr. of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison in New York - along with David M. Bernick of Kirkland &amp; Ellis in Chicago, who represented the Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco company. Mr. Webb is a former United States attorney in Illinois who has represented Microsoft, General Electric and the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Wells has defended civil and white-collar criminal defendants, including former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey and the financier Michael Milken. Mr. Bernick, who has defended chemical and asbestos companies, specializes in complex corporate cases and has been retained by Philip Morris for a class-action tobacco case in New York. With such legal power, the tobacco companies have enjoyed a reasonable measure of success in court. Since 1998, when the major tobacco companies settled lawsuits with the states for $246 billion over health care costs related to smoking, domestic cases involving Philip Morris as a defendant, alone or with other companies, have ended with 27 verdicts in favor of the defendants and 16 in favor of the plaintiffs, with potential combined awards of $948 million. But the company has appealed 13 of those cases. Of the remaining three, Philip Morris paid plaintiffs in two, for a total of $20.3 million. The other case was dismissed. Over the same period, Philip Morris's leading competitor, Reynolds American, which merged last year with Brown &amp; Williamson and now has 30 percent of the domestic market, has been a defendant in 50 cases and has paid once, for $5 million. In the same years, the stock prices of Philip Morris and Reynolds American have more than doubled. "Tobacco companies have an excellent, excellent track record in litigation," said Christine Farkas, an equities analyst for Merrill Lynch who follows the industry. "Is it disruptive to business? Yes. But if they lose at trial, they typically win on appeal." The biggest lawsuit facing the industry is the government's racketeering case, which now hinges on a federal judge's ruling on liability and the Supreme Court's decision on whether to consider an appeal to sustain a request for $280 billion in damages that a lower court denied. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Washington &gt;WASHINGTON, Aug. 13 - On and on they go, mammoth lawsuits against the nation's biggest tobacco companies.

In their view, growth stocks are due for a turnaround, one that recent share price movement suggests may have already begun. Skip to next paragraph Bargain Buys? When asked to name stocks offering good value, fund managers typically point to companies that are being successfully overhauled after a period of poor management, or those doing business in sectors undergoing significant change. Sometimes, they mention long-dormant industries involved in heavy manufacturing or commodity production that they believe are starting to catch a break as the economy recovers. While some value-conscious investors still talk about dogs that are about to have their day, it has become stylish to seek value among what are commonly regarded as growth stocks. These may be in surging industries where earnings are thought to have only one direction to travel - like the Googles of the world - and in sectors where growth is far more modest but also more reliable. Investors are usually willing to pay premiums for stocks with earnings that are virtually certain to grow no matter the economic backdrop. But fund managers, including some who specialize in growth stocks and others who don't, say that growth is priced more appealingly than value. "Where's the better bang for the bucks nowadays?" asked Peggy Adams, a portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services. Her answer is large-capitalization growth stocks. The usual repositories of value are providing less bang and more whimper, she said. "Value stocks tilted toward cyclical growth stories or else financial services companies, which over time have benefited from the low-interest-rate environment, are carrying higher valuations" than growth companies for each dollar of earnings they are likely to produce, Ms. Adams said. Robert E. Turner, chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners, said he expected investors to resume paying a premium for growth once they realized how hard it was to come by. "We're beginning to see a strong bias to reallocating back to growth," Mr. Turner said. Growth has underperformed value since 2000, he said, although growth started at a point from which "there was a long way to fall." "Who would sell growth who didn't sell it in the last five years?" Mr. Turner asked. Henry McVey, a Morgan Stanley strategist, is not inclined to sell growth. He said in a note to clients that he expected "a new generation of stable-growth names to shine," although the ones he favors tend to be part of the older generation: General Electric, Pfizer, PepsiCo and Altria, the conglomerate that owns brands like Philip Morris and Kraft. They are throwbacks in another way: unlike the tech stocks of the late 1990's that could not spare a penny to pay dividends, the growth stocks that Mr. McVey thinks will attract investor interest offer generous yields. He notes that growth has outpaced value for the last few months, and he contends that if the Federal Reserve skips an interest rate increase in August, as he expects, this harbinger of a more controlled, subdued economy will bring more investors into stable-growth stocks. Ms. Adams at Massachusetts Financial Services finds no need to wait. Much of her money is already in stable-growth sectors, although she emphasizes that she looks at stocks one at a time. To drive home the point, she mentioned Johnson &amp; Johnson as a particular favorite for its mix of businesses, including prescription drugs, medical devices and mass-market health care products. But she was not in favor of its beleaguered rival, Merck. Shares of many leading companies in the technology sector have rebounded strongly from the lows of two years ago. But tech remains so cheap, some fund managers say, that investors are attracted not only for the growth potential but also for the valuations. Rick Drake, manager of the ABN Amro Growth fund, described one of his tech holdings, Oracle, as pretty cheap - a result, he said, of concern about the company's acquisition of PeopleSoft. Mr. Drake says he expects Oracle's earnings to increase by 23 percent over the next 12 months. Another tech stock that he favors partly for its valuation is Cisco Systems, which he says should benefit from demand for more telecommunications infrastructure fed by broadband Internet use, iPods, cellphones and other gadgets. He also likes a pair of biotech companies, Gilead and Amgen. Revenue at Amgen has tripled in the last five years, Mr. Drake noted, but its stock price is more or less the same. Mr. Turner is so confident of tech's prospects that he called it his favorite sector. One reason is its growth potential. "Companies are awash with free cash flow and there is huge demand for digital and wireless devices" from which many tech companies will benefit, he said. Amid the encouraging backdrop, Mr. Turner said, many big names are trading at multiples barely higher than that of the broad market. Intel, Texas Instruments and Microsoft all have P/E ratios of 18 to 21, based on analysts' estimates of 2006 earnings, he said. "I'm not a permanent bull on the tech sector," Mr. Turner said, "but it has been out of favor for a long time, and this is a year when it could do pretty well." Not everyone is finding value in tech stocks. Robert A. Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert fund, also looks for stocks that are out of favor, but he prefers idiosyncratic recovery stories - companies that have had better days and may find them again. Two examples he cited are Pier 1 Imports and the Tribune Company. Pier 1, the home furnishings retailer, "is looking for ways to improve its merchandising," Mr. Olstein said. "Its stores are too crowded," he added, "and it has been selling the wrong merchandise." That is why its stock has stumbled, he said. "But they have a lot of cash and no debt," he added, and "because the stock is so cheap, a lot of the risk is taken out" of owning it. The stock of the Tribune Company, Mr. Olstein said, has been "under siege because of falling circulation," an affliction affecting many newspapers. But there is more to Tribune than The Los Angeles Times, Newsday and The Chicago Tribune, he said. For example, the company is an owner - along with Time Warner - of the WB television network. "Tribune has viable, free cash flow with a lot of viable assets," Mr. Olstein said. At a price of $35.08 on Friday, he said, the stock was too cheap. "Basically, this company is worth in the mid-$40's to $50," he said. "If you own it when a catalyst occurs, you get a fully valued stock. We like buying bad news we think is only temporary." Jonathan Golub, a strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds, is reluctant to hop on the growth bandwagon. He responded to the arguments of Mr. Turner and Ms. Adams by pointing out that after valuation discrepancies close, the previously overpriced assets - in this case, growth stocks - often keep sinking until they trade at significantly more attractive valuations. "Growth looks a little bit cheaper historically, but it's nowhere near cheap," he said. "Things tend to go to extremes. People just think you can't have something outperforming for more than five years in a row." More Articles in Business &gt;HERE'S a tip for followers of investment fashion: Growth is the new value.
