(AP) — Kraft Foods said Wednesday its third-quarter profit rose 22 percent as higher prices helped offset increased costs.The company reported a profit of $922 million, or 52 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $754 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. After adjusting for integration costs related to its acquisition of Cadbury, the company earned 58 cents a share, versus 47 cents a share in the previous period. Kraft’s revenue rose nearly 12 percent, to $13.23 billion from $11.86 billion. The results beat analysts’ expectations for a profit of 55 cents a share on revenue of $12.8 billion. Kraft also raised its full-year outlook. It now expects to earn $2.27 a share, in line with analysts’ expectations and up from its previous forecast of $2.25 a share. Revenue is expected to increase 6 percent, up from its earlier forecast of a 5 percent increase. The food industry is facing several challenges, including higher costs for ingredients and limited spending by consumers in developed markets like the United States. Kraft and other companies have been able to offset some of those pressures by raising prices and expanding in emerging markets like China, where demand is increasing. “Our investments in marketing and new products continue to drive high quality growth and solid market shares.  And we’ve accomplished this despite having taken significant price increases to offset record-high input costs,” Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive, said in a statement. Kraft is splitting its business into two publicly traded companies. One will focus on international snack brands like Trident gum and Cadbury chocolates while the other will concentrate on its North American grocery business, which includes Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer meats. The company expects the split to be complete before the end of next year. The company released its results after the markets closed and in after-hours trading, its shares rose 36 cents, to $35.NORTHFIELD, Ill.

A new park called Planters Grove, which opened on Monday in a public housing development in the East Village, has an unmistakably peanut-inspired design, an effect created by the studied placement of poles amid beds of sage, rosemary and thyme. In an offbeat act of corporate philanthropy, and self-promotion, Planters, the snack nut brand owned by Kraft Foods, developed and paid for the new park at the Lillian Wald Houses, a 16-building complex on Avenue D. At the unveiling, Mr. Peanut was there, with his signature top hat and monocle (looking pretty good for his age: 95). So was the company’s Nutmobile, a peanut-shape vehicle powered by biodiesel, with solar panels on top. But if visitors were feeling queasy about a gift from America’s largest packaged-food marketer, they were not letting on. Indeed, the branding could have been stronger. In a similar park Planters opened in New Orleans this year, a statue of Mr. Peanut is permanently affixed to a peanut-shape bench. Elected officials and Wald residents hailed the park as an example of the kind of public-private partnerships that can benefit low-income neighborhoods. The Wald Houses, named for the social reformer Lillian D. Wald, previously lacked accessible green space across its 16 acres, which stretch from East Sixth to East Houston Streets. Although Planters Grove is not an official city park, members of the wider community may use it, a New York City Housing Authority spokeswoman said. “What we are saying here today is that government itself cannot do everything that needs to be done to improve our communities,” said Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, whose Congressional district includes the Wald Houses. After posing with Mr. Peanut, Margarita López, a board member and the environmental coordinator of the Housing Authority, conceded that she might not have welcomed a park from another snack food brand. (And she rejected the idea of a Mr. Peanut statue as being too blatantly commercial.) But she is a big believer in nuts. “They’re very healthy,” she said. “They give you pure protein. It’s healthier than a piece of bread, which is pure sugar.” The park project also offered an educational opportunity to some New Yorkers. Planters worked with Green City Force, an AmeriCorps program based in Brooklyn that recruits 18- to 24-year-old residents of public housing for intensive training and service opportunities in clean-energy fields. Maurice Davis, who lives in the nearby Rutgers Houses, helped haul away 80 cubic yards of bricks and other debris that were buried under the park site, remnants of the old slum-clearance projects that tore down tenements to make way for subsidized housing. He also planted dozens of shrubs and herbs. “I felt I had no direction and no potential before,” he said. “But I’ve learned about the environment and working with a team.” Planters enlisted a prominent landscape architect, Ken Smith, for its three Planters Groves, the third of which opened in Washington earlier this year. Mr. Smith, whose résumé includes the roof garden at the Museum of Modern Art, put a rainwater garden under a boardwalk in the new park, which will reduce runoff and irrigate the plantings. He also filled the park with several kinds of edible herbs. Residents were urged to pick them and incorporate them into their cooking. “There’s a real issue of access to healthy foods, so the ability to have plants that people can actually use is very important,” Mr. Smith said. The herbs had another payoff. “The Housing Authority wanted us to avoid plants that attract rats,” he said. “Rats don’t like pungent herbs.”New York City parks come in idiosyncratic shapes and sizes these days, like the High Line, a narrow ribbon of green that unfurls above 10th Avenue, and the future Freshkills Park, with its four monumental mounds.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/business/media/a-minty-chewing-gum-is-named-for-shaun-white.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">A Minty Chewing Gum Is Named for a Snowboarder<date>Published: September 18, 2011</date><text>WHEN celebrities attach their names to products, it generally is for fashion-related items like fragrances or clothing lines that don’t come cheap. But the price for a new product that Shaun White, the gold medalist snowboarder, has licensed: $1.49.Whitemint, a new flavor of chewing gum by Stride, the Kraft Foods brand, is named for the athlete and features his likeness on the package. White, who appeared briefly in a commercial for a Stride line called 2.0 that was first shown in June, stars in a new commercial for Whitemint scheduled to begin on Monday. Other celebrities have appeared in advertisements for gum in recent years, including sisters Serena and Venus Williams for Doublemint (a Wm. Wrigley Jr. brand), and Marlon Wayans for Dentyne (a Kraft brand). But gum varieties being named for celebrities is a rarity, with one notable instance being a Bubblicious flavor named for LeBron James, LeBron’s Lightning Lemonade, introduced in 2005 and discontinued in 2007.  Gum marketing usually focuses on claims like freshening breath or whitening teeth. “What the category has been to date has really been about the promotion of functional benefits and attributes of the product,” said Maurice Herrera, senior director of United States gum brands for Kraft. While celebrity-licensing deals are more common in “lifestyle-oriented categories,” in the case of White and Stride, some consumers may derive “emotional benefits” from chewing gum affiliated with the popular athlete, Mr. Herrera said. “We as a portfolio are looking at how we can establish a greater level of relevance and make our brands more relatable,” Mr. Herrera said. While the brand is generally aimed at consumers ages 18 to 34, Whitemint aspires to appeal to the younger end of that spectrum, from 18 to 24 — and may appeal to even younger chewers. “A lot of 10- to 12-year-olds hold Shaun in high esteem,” Mr. Herrera said. Bloomberg Businessweek ranked White, 25, who also competes professionally as a skateboarder, the second most powerful athlete of 2011, with quarterback Peyton Manning in the top spot. White “combines dominance on the slopes with a friendly face and personality,” said Businessweek. “All this adds up to instant marketability.” White currently licenses a clothing line for Target, a sunglasses and goggles line for Oakley, a gear line for Burton Snowboards, and two video games — Shaun White Snowboarding and Shaun White Skateboarding — for Ubisoft. Doug Shabelman, president of Burns Entertainment, a celebrity and entertainment marketing firm, said White has managed to be a pitchman without sullying himself. “He has remained really true to his persona and has maintained a level of hipness and youthfulness,” Mr. Shabelman said. “He’s still relevant and is not seen as someone who has made it and sold out.” While the brand did not disclose any financial details, White is estimated to earn at least $2 million annually for each endorsement deal. Stride spent $30.4 million on advertising in 2010, according to Kantar Media, a division of WPP. The brand could certainly use the surge it is hoping White will bring. Sales for Stride dropped 27.2 percent, to $151.5 million, in the 52 weeks that ended Aug. 7, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, whose totals do not include Wal-Mart. Over the period, the brand’s share of the sugarless gum category dropped 2.4 percent, to a 6.7 percent share.  Asked what they find lacking in gum, the top response from consumers is that the flavor should be longer lasting, with 57 percent saying so, far more than wish for better tasting flavors (11 percent), stronger flavor (9 percent), or a wider range of flavors (8 percent), according to Mintel, a market research firm. Since its introduction in 2006, Stride has marketed itself as “the ridiculously long lasting gum.” Advertising campaigns from JWT, New York, part of WPP, have featured a team of misguided Stride marketers who, frustrated that they cannot sell more gum because each piece lasts so long, track down consumers and physically force them to spit out their gum. In a 2008 commercial, for example, a chewer crossing the street while talking on his cellphone is suddenly butted by a ram and coughs up his gum, whereupon a Stride van screeches to a halt and marketers dash out to retrieve the wad. The ram has since become a brand mascot, sometimes appearing only in a cameo role. In the new commercial for Whitemint, for example, the ram stands idly in a conference room where the marketing team and White are gathered. “New Stride Whitemint is a hit, but it lasts too long,” says a manager leading the meeting, as he chews it himself. “How do we get people to chew another piece?” “I got this one,” says White, gesturing for an abominable snowman wearing a headband and earphones to enter the room. The creature slugs the manager in the stomach, forcing him to spit out his gum, and a voiceover warns, “Spit it out. Or Yeti will find you.” Poking fun at marketers appeals to younger consumers, said Matt McKay, a creative director at JWT. “The younger audience that we’re talking too is very savvy about marketing” and the overall advertising approach, Mr. McKay said of the commercial featuring White. “It gives a nod to the consumer who knows what marketing is and the tactics that marketers and ad agencies go through, and who is not easily fooled by marketing.”WHEN celebrities attach their names to products, it generally is for fashion-related items like fragrances or clothing lines that don’t come cheap.

Lee with the precise diction and syntax of a Shakespearean actor, as he ladles the Velveeta cheese sauce included with the product into the pan. The spot closes with screen text that says: “Wield the skillet. Forge the family dinner.” The commercial, which was first shown on Monday, is by Wieden &amp; Kennedy, Portland, Ore., and is part of a broader campaign that includes online advertising and social network marketing. In another spot, expected to first broadcast in mid-September but already uploaded to YouTube, a woman is pressing buttons on her microwave when the blacksmith grabs her wrist. “Reject these cold technological contraptions,” he says. “Would you want the shoes of your horse forged in a microwave? Your stove: Use it!” Adam Grablick, the brand manager for the Velveeta convenient meals division, said the new ads, and the Cheesy Skillets line itself, would resonate with consumers who wanted simplicity but had misgivings about meals that were too simple. “Our consumer doesn’t want to be slaving away in the kitchen, but she may not feel great about just pulling something out of the freezer and putting it in the microwave,” Mr. Grablick said. “She wants the meal to be hands-on, and for the meal to come from her hands and her heart.” Velveeta, which declined to disclose the cost of the new campaign, spent $7.6 million on advertising for all its products in 2010, up from $4.2 million in 2009, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.  Velveeta, the pasteurized process cheese product brand, was purchased by Kraft — then the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation — in 1928, according to the company. Citing Nielsen data, Kraft reports that 40 million American households, or about 34 percent of all households, have purchased a Velveeta product within the last year. The brand first ventured into shelf-stable meals — the industry term for foods that normally would require refrigeration but have been processed to be safely stored at room temperature — with its introduction of Velveeta Shells &amp; Cheese in 1978. The shelf-stable meal market — which along with pasta-and-cheese products includes kits for pizza, tacos and sloppy Joes — grew about 9 percent, to $2.1 billion, from 2005 to 2010, according to the market research firm Mintel. The firm attributes the growth to more consumers eating at home because of the economic downturn. A hurdle for future growth could be that 39 percent of those who do not like shelf-stable meals blame the taste, according to Mintel. “The biggest barrier in the category is taste, and we know the taste that consumers are looking for is around great-tasting cheese, and that we can win with consumers around Velveeta,” said Mr. Grablick, the brand manager. While Kraft’s recipes Web site serves the primary purpose of increasing the usage of Kraft brands, it also has proven useful to the company as a barometer for consumer taste preferences. The four varieties in the Cheesy Skillets line — chicken and broccoli, ultimate cheeseburger mac, nacho supreme and zesty barbecue chicken — were modeled after online recipes that had drawn numerous clicks, comments and high ratings, according to Mr. Grablick. In about 35 reviews of the chicken and broccoli flavor on Amazon.com solicited through its Vine program, where the online retailer provides yet-to-be-released products to some of its frequent reviewers, the Cheesy Skillets line averaged four out of a possible five stars. Reviewers generally lauded the taste, but many were dubious about the packet of dehydrated “broccoli florets” that amounted to less than three tablespoons and were described by one reviewer, Julie A. Dawson, as resembling “dehydrated grass clippings.” The products, which became widely available in supermarkets this month, have a suggested retail price of $2.39, which does not include, of course, the price of the pound of chicken breast or ground beef required.  On the Cheesy Skillets Facebook page, the blacksmith announces in an introductory video, “I see you have found me on the book of face.” Later, he displays an iron version of the social network’s “like” icon that he has forged, and says, “Clicketh the button now.” The approach is reminiscent of another character-driven campaign introduced by Wieden &amp; Kennedy last year for Old Spice, the Procter &amp; Gamble brand, in which the actor Isaiah Mustafa plays Old Spice Man in a series of television commercials and Web videos that have garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube. “There is a knowing wink with both of these characters,” said Kenneth Smith, an account director with Wieden &amp; Kennedy, referring to the Old Spice Man and the blacksmith. But while the dominant trait of the Old Spice Man, who appears shirtless and begins commercials with, “Hello, ladies,” is his sex appeal, that is not what the agency was aiming for with the blacksmith. “What we didn’t want was sexual tension between the moms and blacksmith, so we were not looking for a lothario-type guy here,” Mr. Smith said. “This is genuinely a guy who you feel like wants to help you and is very sincere in that, so sincere that he almost feels a little awkward.”IN a commercial for Velveeta Cheesy Skillets, a new line of just-add-meat pasta dinner kits by Kraft, a casually dressed woman in a suburban home says, “Let’s go, kids,” opens the front door and gasps.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/05/business/sec-could-use-more-clout-not-less.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">S.E.C. Could Use More Clout, Not Less<date>Published: August 4, 2011</date><text>At least one lawmaker seems to want the Securities and Exchange Commission to become irrelevant. The regulator has had its problems. But a Republican bid to reshape it seems meant to hinder, not help. There’s room for improvement, but with its duties growing, the watchdog needs more staff, more money and a buffer against Congress.Many of the S.E.C.’s wounds are self-inflicted. It missed chances to nab Bernard Madoff, whiffed at the subprime mortgage time bomb, caught staff members viewing pornography on the job and had to back out of a wasteful $557 million office lease. But a Boston Consulting Group study found that the agency was also about 400 employees short and hampered by onerous rules. Increased responsibilities may aggravate the problems. The S.E.C. just announced further delays in drafting rules to carry out last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which expands the regulator’s area of responsibility. And a federal court recently ordered the agency to do even more analysis of the costs and benefits of such regulations. Congress has already responded with parsimony. Instead of increasing the S.E.C.’s 2012 budget to the requested $1.4 billion, lawmakers held it to this year’s $1.19 billion, saying they were committed to reducing costs. But the S.E.C. is financed by the fees it collects from regulated companies. It passes the excess to the Treasury. Now Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, seems to want to hold the S.E.C. back further. His bill would demote the watchdog’s investor advocate and strengthen a new ombudsman for regulated businesses. It would also weaken the regulator’s clout by dispersing staff throughout divisions that have historically sympathized with Wall Street. A genuine bid to fix the S.E.C. would try to excise the bits that don’t work. But the S.E.C.’s greatest flaw may be Congress’s tight control over its revenue. Greater financial independence and perhaps a chairman serving longer than the current five-year term would be steps toward an agency capable of fighting for what’s needed, rather than just what’s politically possible. Kraft’s Breakup With Americans sufficiently snacked out, Kraft Foods appears to be turning its attention to hungrier parts of the world. The Oreos-to-Cheez Whiz conglomerate plans to split into a growth-challenged American grocery business with $16 billion in sales and an oddly named "global snacking platform" that’s twice as large. Though the deal partly contradicts the scale argument for last year’s takeover of Cadbury, it’s a sensible move. Still, the about-face on the part of Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive, is surprising so soon after paying $20 billion for Cadbury over the objections of Warren Buffett, a shareholder. That’s especially true given that Kraft’s stock market performance since the January 2010 deal — a 15 percent increase — has arguably vindicated the move. But the stock market offers other clues as to why splitting Kraft up makes sense. Two peers whose shares have gained more are Sara Lee and Hershey: both are up nearly 60 percent in the last 18 months. Sara Lee investors have welcomed its breakup, while Hershey is narrowly focused on confectionery. Ms. Rosenfeld is looking for both kinds of appreciation from investors. In a year or so, Kraft shareholders will get shares in two companies. The smaller one will have old-school brands like Oscar Mayer meats and Philadelphia cream cheese. That business should generate sufficient cash to pay off a disproportionate share of Kraft’s debt and send dividends to shareholders. The other one, a sandwich of Cadbury candy and Nabisco cookies, will have $32 billion in sales, mostly from abroad. The precise financial contours of the two groups won’t be clear for some time. But Kraft’s second-quarter results hinted at the split’s rationale. Developing markets posted organic sales growth of 13.5 percent, powered by higher volumes. North America’s 4 percent increase came purely from higher prices. Of course, Kraft is the same business it was a day ago. But breaking it into pieces to suit different tastes stands a good chance of enticing investors to pay more for it.

C. Penney and Levi Strauss — that spent more than 11.8 percent on the Hispanic market, which at the time corresponded to the portion of Hispanics in the population. This year, Kraft says it will triple spending on Hispanic marketing over last year. Kraft declined to provide figures, but confirmed that the percentage of overall spending would be in the double digits. Kool-Aid, in a first for any Kraft brand, has allocated the majority of its 2011 marketing budget to reach Hispanics. Television commercials that began running this week on networks including Univision and Telemundo feature families drinking the beverage at festive occasions.  In one spot, at a backyard pool party, Kool-Aid Man, the brand mascot, jumps off the diving board as the slogan “Donde está la diversión, está Kool-Aid” (“Where there’s fun, there’s Kool-Aid”) appears on the screen. The commercials are by Ogilvy Rojo, part of Ogilvy &amp; Mather, a WPP agency. The family settings in the spots grew out of consumer research indicating that Latina mothers like to “organize sessions for bonding, like eating dinner together or going to the park,” said Sivonne Davis, Kool-Aid senior brand manager. Depictions of family get-togethers appeal to Latino parents “who are really worried about how fast-paced the American way of life is today, and that kids could be growing up too fast and being pulled away from home,” said Ms. Davis. Other aspects of the campaign actually facilitate family gatherings. For 10 weeks starting June 5, Kool-Aid will sponsor a new family-friendly movie night, Cine en Casa, to be shown on Telemundo. And, in a collaboration with Univision Radio, beginning July 23, Kool-Aid will sponsor outdoor screenings of Spanish-language movies in public parks in Los Angeles, Chicago, San Antonio, Dallas and Houston. While Kool-Aid historically has developed commercials for the general market, then translated them into Spanish, in this case it may reverse the process. “Typically we took a general market spot and translated it to the Hispanic market, but these are launching among Hispanic consumers and we’re testing to see if they could then be used for the general market as well,” Ms. Davis said. Almost 20 percent of Kool-Aid drinkers are Hispanic, while slightly more than 20 percent are African-American, according to the brand. Sales are split about evenly between powdered mixes and ready-to-drink versions. Hispanic adults are second only to African-Americans in consumption of fruit drinks, with 40 percent drinking powdered drinks (compared with 46 percent of blacks and 32 percent of whites) and 45 percent drinking prepared versions (compared with 46 percent of blacks and 27 percent of whites), according to Mintel, a market research firm. Kool-Aid is forgoing television advertising for the general market for the rest of the year, focusing instead on in-store marketing and digital and print advertising. Kool-Aid spent none of its total of $14.3 million in advertising on Hispanic media in 2008. In 2009, it spent $3.4 million of its total ad spending of $17.9 million on Hispanic media, and last year, it spent $2.8 million of $23.7 million, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP. Both the economic downturn and the Hispanic population surge are prompting brands to rethink their strategies, said Alain Groenendaal, chief executive of Wing, a unit of the Grey Group, owned by WPP, that focuses on Latino marketing. “As the economy has not been so strong, brands have been digging into their numbers more to see where growth is going to come from,” he said. “Most of the growth from one census to the next has been in nonwhites, and if brands are spending the same amount of money on a smaller and smaller group, they’re getting worse and worse R.O.I.,” said Mr. Groenendaal, referring to the return on investment from advertising. A major initiative to court Hispanics encompasses 10 Kraft brands, including Kraft Singles, Oreo, Ritz and Trident gum.  Christine Montenegro McGrath, senior director of the Latino Center of Excellence at Kraft, a team formed two years ago to develop marketing strategies, said efforts to broaden the appeal of Kraft Singles had already paid off. When it conducted focus groups a couple of years ago, Kraft learned Latinos were choosing cheaper brands, but were willing to pay more for the cheese when they realized it was made with real milk, unlike some cheaper brands. In a promotion with Univision that began in 2009 on Dec. 28, Día de los Santos Inocentes, the Hispanic equivalent of April Fool’s Day, the brand fabricated news stories that appeared on Univision.com, including one involving the women who were then Miss Universe, from Venezuela, and her runner-up, from the Dominican Republic. The ruse, by Lopez Negrete Communications, led online readers to a Kraft Singles Web site with the message, “Don’t be fooled” (or “Descubre la verdad,” which translates literally as “Discover the truth”), which also was the theme of Kraft Singles TV spots and in-store events aimed at Hispanics. The campaign resulted in a 12 percent increase in sales of Singles to Hispanics in 2010, according to Ms. McGrath, who said it was part of a concerted effort for the company to reach Hispanics. After starting a Spanish Web site, ComidaKraft.com, in 2001, and a cooking magazine, Comida y Familia, in 2003, “we kind of lost our way in being that consistent across the board,” she said. “Now we’re changing the trajectory of Kraft’s business presence in the Latino market.”IN a 2010 report by the Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies that rated the top 500 American advertisers, Kraft Foods earned the rating of “follower.” Had Kraft, which had spent 3.8 percent of its ad budget on Hispanic media in 2009, spent just 3.6 percent, it would have been rated a “laggard.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/16/former-hershey-chief-joins-friedman-fleischer-lowe/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Former Hershey Chief Joins Friedman Fleischer &amp; Lowe<date>May 16, 2011, 8:41 am</date><text>The Hershey CompanyRichard H.

But if you find yourself there, a new digital advertising campaign for Halls aims to convince you — with the aid of real-time pollen-count forecasts — that you should buy its cough drops. Part of the Halls campaign will include using video screens at gas station pumps, where consumers will see an ad for cough drops followed by the day’s pollen count. Lori Mazuro, the senior associate brand manager for Halls, says the company is hoping that consumers who see the ad will want to buy the cough drops at a nearby convenience store. The campaign will focus on cherry, honey-lemon and Mentho-Lyptus flavored cough drops. “We want to solidify our positioning within the allergy space,” she said. Halls worked with Outcast Media, which has PumpTop TV screens at gas stations in cities around the country, including Philadelphia, Atlanta and Austin, Tex. The screens are connected to a network that will take pollen count information from AccuWeather.com. Halls, owned by Kraft Foods, is the first brand to use AccuWeather on one of the screens, but Nathan Gill, the chief revenue officer for Outcast, said the company hoped to use weather-based services in the future to better focus on affluent 18- to 49-year-olds, a coveted demographic, with other relevant ads. The technology also allows brands to customize messages with temperature and precipitation levels. “I think this really is the next evolution of location-based services,” Mr. Gill said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/business/media/21adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">SnackWell’s Nudges the Portion Pack Up a Few Calories<date>Published: April 20, 2011</date><text>WHEN introduced in 1992, SnackWell’s, the Nabisco line of nonfat and low-fat snacks, sold so well that there were shortages, and early television commercials featured a frazzled grocer trying to restock the products as women pushing carts stampeded toward him.In 1995, sales reached about $490 million, and the brand topped both the cookie and cracker categories — but then SnackWell’s got an object lesson in how the cookie crumbles. Competing brands, which had dabbled mostly in sugar-free products to attract dieters, introduced their own successful fat-reduced temptations, and SnackWell’s sales plummeted. Revenue for SnackWell’s was $32.3 million in the 52 weeks that ended March 20, a drop of 8.6 percent from the previous year, according to SymphonyIRI Group, whose totals do not include Wal-Mart. Advertising for the brand, which totaled an estimated $60 million in 1998, ceased after 2005 as parent company Kraft aggressively marketed its 2004 introduction of another craze for dieters: the 100-calorie pack. Now, in what Kraft marketers are calling a reintroduction of SnackWell’s, the brand has new products, and a new advertising campaign aimed at weight-conscious women. The first print ad in the campaign features a closely cropped photograph of a pair of stiletto-heeled black leather boots with the new slogan for the brand, “Be bad. Snack well.” The ad, by McGarryBowen, New York, a unit of Dentsu, introduces Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn, and a new approach for the brand: portion control.  “Deliciously indulgent, perfectly portioned,” says the new ad, which is scheduled to begin appearing Friday in magazines, including People, Cosmopolitan and Glamour. “At 130 calories, they let you be bad, and still be good.” SnackWell’s will continue to sell in two older varieties, Devil’s Food Cookie Cakes and Crème Sandwich Cookies, in standard packaging. But in a new twist on premeasured portions, the brand is nibbling past the common 100-calorie limit. Another popcorn snack with white chocolate is also packaged in 130-calorie portions and two other varieties, Fudge Crème Brownie Bites and Rich Vanilla Crème Brownie Bites, contain 150 calories in a portion. “There is a group of women out there who struggle with temptation and want responsible alternatives that allow them to really enjoy sweets, but with an off switch because they have a difficult time stopping,” said Steve Siegal, a senior brand manager for SnackWell’s, who added that sometimes the cutoff should exceed 100 calories. “When it comes to portion control, consumers really want satiating products, and at the end of the day they don’t want to feel deprived,” Mr. Siegal said. “They will have a few more calories if it satisfies their sweet craving.” Women are far more interested in snacks and drinks sold in portion-controlled packages, with 19 percent of women saying they buy such products, compared with 8 percent of men, according Mintel, a market research firm. But prepackaged portions are often too small, in the opinion of 25 percent of men and 20 percent of women. Brian Wansink, who wrote “Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,” said in a telephone interview that in his research, when experiment subjects were presented with 100-calorie packs, about 70 percent were satisfied with just one, while the remainder helped themselves to seconds or thirds. In another experiment by Dr. Wansink, who directs the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab, participants who had eaten at around noon were gathered for snacks of either chocolate or cheese and crackers between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. With no inkling that their intake was being monitored, “most people stopped between the 170- to 190-calorie mark,” said Dr. Wansink. Applying that to SnackWell’s 130- to 150-calorie portions, “that might present a happy medium” because it is midway between 100 calories and what seems to be a natural point of satiation, he said.  But SnackWell’s two popcorn snacks that combine sweet and salty flavors could undermine “sensory-specific satiety,” the term for the feeling of having had enough of a certain flavor, he said. “Sensory-specific satiety causes you to get bored if you just eat potato chips, but if you take a break from potato chips and then eat chocolate, you want more potato chips again,” said Dr. Wansink. Sweet-and-salty snacks “are very tasty, but I could see this combination of flavors triggering a gigantic craving for more than just 130 calories of it,” he said. Four varieties that had been sold under the Nabisco 100 Calorie Packs label — Petites Fudge, Petites Mint Fudge, Fudge Drizzled Chocolate Chip Cookies and Fudge Drizzled Double Chocolate Chip Cookies — will now instead be sold under the SnackWell’s label (still in 100-calorie portions.) All of the new SnackWell’s products have a suggested retail price of $3.19 for a box of five servings. The brand declined to reveal what it will spend on the new campaign, except that it’s “a significant investment in the millions of dollars,” Mr. Siegal said. As for why Kraft elected to introduce the products and approach under a brand it had not advertised in five years, rather than a new one, Mr. Siegel said that 85 percent of consumers still report being familiar with SnackWell’s. “A lot of snacking companies would die to have 85 percent brand recognition for a brand that has stood for better-for-you indulgent snacking,” Mr. Siegal said. “It’s been a long time since the brand was out there in a big way, but this really is all about a new attitude and edge for the brand.”WHEN introduced in 1992, SnackWell’s, the Nabisco line of nonfat and low-fat snacks, sold so well that there were shortages, and early television commercials featured a frazzled grocer trying to restock the products as women pushing carts stampeded toward him.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/business/media/13adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Kraft Rescuing ‘Ghost’ Food Brands From Obscurity<date>Published: April 12, 2011</date><text>What does Kraft Foods have in common with Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis? They are all ghostbusters.But rather than fighting outbreaks of unruly ectoplasm, Kraft, the largest American packaged-foods marketer, is on a mission to keep its myriad products from becoming ghost brands — once-prominent pantry staples that fade into obscurity through a lack of consumer interest brought on by a lack of advertising support. It is common during economic downturns for marketers to see if any brands they own can be renewed or revived because it can cost less to bring ghost brands back to life than develop new ones. This is also a propitious time for Kraft to assess its product lineup because consumers who are still watching their spending are eating at home more often, making them more receptive to pitches for packaged foods.  If ghost brands cannot be reclaimed, marketers usually have to give up the ghost, selling or discontinuing them to concentrate on larger, livelier holdings. For instance, Kraft stopped making its Postum grain beverage, which dated to 1895, and sold off products like Log Cabin syrups. To forestall that fate for other brands, Kraft executives are initiating a project called Operation Spark, meant to help consumers reconnect with products that are not part of what Kraft calls its roster of “power brands,” which includes behemoths like Planters, Oreo, Ritz and Trident. The brands the executives hope to keep from the ghostly ranks include the Athenos line of Greek-style dips, spreads and yogurt; dairy products that are sold in the East under the Breakstone’s name and in the West as Knudsen; and Stove Top stuffing. Those brands are getting new campaigns and other promotional support, including television commercials for Breakstone’s and Knudsen that began on Monday. The brands also all have new agencies. Kraft spent only $331,000 last year to advertise Breakstone’s and Knudsen, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, which tracks ad spending in major media, compared with $10.2 million in 2009. Stove Top, too, had a ghostly presence last year, Kantar reported, as spending totaled just $65,000, compared with $2.7 million in 2009. For those smaller brands, “we want to find ways to be entrepreneurial,” said Dana Anderson, senior vice president for marketing strategy and communications at the Kraft headquarters in Northfield, Ill. “We’ve been changing the conversation with our consumers because the marketing landscape has changed so much,” she added. A central element of Operation Spark is to pair the smaller brands with creative agencies that have outstanding reputations for effective, rule-breaking advertising — and have not previously worked for Kraft. “We all know there was much more we could be doing creatively,” said Howard Friedman, senior vice president of marketing for cheese and dairy products, based in the Kraft office in Glenview, Ill. “It’s part of liberating our smaller brands,” he added. So Athenos was assigned to Droga5 in New York, known for campaigns for the Tap Project, a Unicef water charity, and Reb’l Fleur by Rihanna, a Parlux Fragrances perfume. Droga5 created a campaign for Athenos infused with offbeat humor, featuring a salty yiayia, or Greek grandmother, who dislikes just about everything except, of course, Athenos. Breakstone’s, Knudsen and Stove Top were assigned to the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., perhaps best known for its ads for Geico. “It’s an open door,” said Noël Talluto, senior brand manager for Breakstone’s, “an opportunity to bring some fresh thinking to the brand.” “One thing we did differently was that we as a brand team came in open-minded and remained open-minded through the entire process,” she added, “allowing the creative juices to flow.”  The campaign from Martin, which is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, presents the Breakstone’s and Knudsen dairy products as “the food your other food loves.” For example, in commercials cartons of sour cream serenade potatoes with “Keep on Loving You” by REO Speedwagon. “What voice do we want this brand to have?” asked Ty Harper, vice president and senior art director at Martin. “It should be fun, because it’s fun food; you can’t tell me anything bad that has sour cream in it.” Rob Robb, vice president and account director at Martin, said: “Kraft gave us a lot of creative freedom. We were not tied to the more rigid work that’s associated with packaged goods.” For Stove Top, Martin has brought out that brand’s most extensive campaign since 2007, when, according to Kantar, Kraft spent $9.5 million to advertise Stove Top in major media. The campaign, which includes digital and outdoor ads, social media, coupons and promotions in stores, presents Stove Top as “the un-potato,” an alternative to the usual side dishes. (Shades of the vintage campaign that proclaimed 7Up as “the uncola.”) Martin has also been named the creative agency for other smaller Kraft brands like Cool Whip and Polly-O cheese. Kraft is turning over some bigger brands to agencies with which it had not worked before, among them Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky, part of MDC Partners, which is creating campaigns for Jell-O and Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. “We are in the early stages of transformation,” Ms. Anderson said. “We’re going to learn, and even if we fall and skin our knees, we’ll get back up and stay committed.”What does Kraft Foods have in common with Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Bill Murray and Harold Ramis?

So in commercials for Philadelphia cream cheese over the last few decades, bagels have played a starring role as a platform for the spread.In the 1980s, actors spread cream cheese on bagels accompanied by the lyric “Start spreading the news” (from “New York, New York”), and for much of the last decade, angels ate bagels in Philadelphia commercials, which closed with the tag line, “A little taste of heaven.” But when it comes to Philadelphia cream cheese marketing these days, the bagel is, for the most part, toast. Philadelphia, a Kraft brand, last year set about to promote the cream cheese as a versatile recipe ingredient — not just for cheesecake, but rather for all courses and meals. The brand is scheduled to announce on Monday the second season of “Real Women of Philadelphia,” an online-only series hosted by Paula Deen, the cook, author and TV host, where contestants submit videos of themselves incorporating Philadelphia products into recipes. For eight consecutive weeks beginning this week, contestants will compete in a weekly category like appetizers or entrees, with the brand selecting two finalists for each theme. Finally, in June, the 16 finalists will be flown to Savannah, Ga., where Ms. Deen lives, for a live cook-off, with four final winners receiving $25,000 and a six-month contract to star in new cooking videos on the site.  In its first season, the series, which is handled by Digitas and EQAL, drew more than 5,000 video submissions, with more than 40,000 people registering on the Web site, a prerequisite for submitting videos and interacting on chat boards. Women who cook are most likely to find recipes on Web sites, followed by cookbooks and televised cooking shows, according to Mintel, a market research firm. (While some men participate on the recipe video site, representatives of the brand say it directs its marketing, as the series name makes clear, to women.) Ms. Deen’s Web site, PaulaDeen.com, which hosts the contest site, drew 299,000 unique visitors in February, according to comScore. The most popular food site, AllRecipes.com, had 17.3 million unique visitors, followed by FoodNetwork.com, with 14.2 million. “We had to figure out how to stop talking at our consumers and to have a conversation with them,” said Adam Butler, a brand manager for Philadelphia, who said the effort helped spur revenues for the brand, which had been flat for several years but in 2010 were up 5.6 percent over the year before. “We could have gone down the road of just developing a bunch of recipes ourselves, but the idea instead was to launch a community,” Mr. Butler said. New ads, by the Chicago office of McGarryBowen, part of Dentsu, show bagels only in a montage of uses, if at all, focusing instead on food preparation, like one featuring a couple preparing a romantic dinner who stir cream cheese into a tomato sauce. Philadelphia spent $28.9 million on advertising in 2010, up from $20.3 million in 2009 and $8 million in 2008, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.  Bricks of cream cheese are claimed by Kraft and others to be an invention by William Lawrence, a dairy owner from Chester, N.Y., who in 1880 began distributing it in foil packets under the label Philadelphia, a brand eventually bought by Kraft in 1928. (There is no geographic connection to Philadelphia; the dairyman chose the name because the city was associated with high-quality food at the time, according to Kraft.) In the United States cream cheese market, Philadelphia dominates with a market share of more than 60 percent, followed by private label brands, with about 25 percent, according to Euromonitor International, a market data firm. Reinforcing efforts to be more of a cooking brand, Philadelphia recently introduced Cooking Creme, a refrigerated product with a consistency like sour cream that combines milk and cheese ingredients and makes cream sauces simpler to prepare. An online-only video, “Cooking With Emeril Lagasse’s Attorney,” features Mark S. Stein, who has represented the celebrity chef for two decades. In the video, by Escape Pod, Mr. Stein, seated in a law office, confesses he wishes he were a famous television chef, then tears away his suit to reveal a chef’s coat underneath, opens a door and trots onto the kitchen set of a television studio. In front of a cheering audience, Mr. Stein uses the new product to make a simplified version of Chicken Florentine. Uploaded to YouTube in February, the video has been viewed more than a million times, while another, “Cooking With a Guy Who Looks a Bit Like Emeril Lagasse,” has more than 115,000 views. The humor is meant to underscore the primary selling point for the product, which in the words of Mr. Butler, the brand manager, answers the question: “How do you get a chef-inspired, creamy, rich texture on a weeknight in less than 30 minutes?” In a March 12 promotion with yet another celebrity chef, Todd English, the brand hosted concurrent house parties at more than 10,000 homes, each with about 16 guests and samples of both the new Cooking Creme product and a line of cookware by Mr. English. Through Skype, Mr. English interacted with participants, while simultaneously hosting his cooking show live on HSN. “Our brand proponents were way out ahead of everyone else,” Jill Baskin, senior director of advertising for the cheese and dairy division at Kraft, said of the consumers who have participated in the house parties and online. “What we discovered is that for many of them we needed to sort of give them permission to make these things — and to go beyond bagels and cream cheese.”IN the 1980s, when the bagel began its ascent from a specialty item served primarily in delis to a staple in chains like Bruegger’s, and eventually even in McDonald’s, it was an auspicious time to be in the cream cheese business.

Kraft sued Starbucks in December to prevent it from terminating their deal before they could resolve the dispute in arbitration. Judge Cathy Seibel of United States District Court in New York rejected Kraft’s contention in January that it would be irreparably harmed if Starbucks were allowed to end the agreement. The appeal was heard before the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan. “The Second Circuit did not rule on the fundamental issue of whether Starbucks can exit our contract without paying the fair market value, plus a premium,” Marc Firestone, Kraft’s general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. “That question will be decided in arbitration.” “We are pleased that the court of appeals has confirmed the district court’s ruling,” Alan Hilowitz, a spokesman for Starbucks, said in an e-mailed statement.

(AP) — Kraft Foods said Thursday that its profit fell 24 percent in the fourth quarter because of costs related to its acquisition of the British confectioner Cadbury.The company also warned of rising costs for ingredients and lowered its forecast for profit growth this year. Kraft reported its results after the market close and its shares fell 2 percent to $30.48 in after-hours trading. They closed the regular session at $31.11. The company, based in Northfield, Ill., said it earned $540 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $710 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding costs for integrating Cadbury and other special items, the company earned 46 cents a share, down from 47 cents last year, but matching analysts’ expectations. Kraft acquired Cadbury a year ago for $19.5 billion. The company’s revenue rose 30 percent to $13.77 billion, with higher sales around the globe, largely because of the addition of Cadbury. Analysts expected $13.48 billion, according to data from FactSet. Kraft lowered its full-year forecast because of weakness in consumer confidence and rising commodity costs.

Kraft said it would appeal the decision. The company filed the lawsuit last month seeking a preliminary injunction to keep Starbucks from bolting. The ruling, by Judge Cathy Seibel of the United States District Court in White Plains, did not affect a separate private arbitration process between the two companies that is aimed at reaching a financial settlement over the breakup. Starbucks had offered to pay $750 million to end the arrangement, but Kraft is seeking a much higher amount. Kraft began distributing Starbucks packaged coffee in 1998. Kraft said in court papers that sales equaled $500 million a year. The move by Starbucks is part of a broader strategy to focus more attention on sales through retail outlets beyond its ubiquitous coffee shops.

(There is no geographic connection to Philadelphia; the dairyman chose the name because the city was associated with high-quality food at the time, according to Kraft.) In the United States cream cheese market, Philadelphia dominates with a market share of more than 60 percent, followed by private label brands, with about 25 percent, according to Euromonitor International, a market data firm. Reinforcing efforts to be more of a cooking brand, Philadelphia recently introduced Cooking Creme, a refrigerated product with a consistency like sour cream that combines milk and cheese ingredients and makes cream sauces simpler to prepare. An online-only video, “Cooking With Emeril Lagasse’s Attorney,” features Mark S. Stein, who has represented the celebrity chef for two decades. In the video, by Escape Pod, Mr. Stein, seated in a law office, confesses he wishes he were a famous television chef, then tears away his suit to reveal a chef’s coat underneath, opens a door and trots onto the kitchen set of a television studio. In front of a cheering audience, Mr. Stein uses the new product to make a simplified version of Chicken Florentine. Uploaded to YouTube in February, the video has been viewed more than a million times, while another, “Cooking With a Guy Who Looks a Bit Like Emeril Lagasse,” has more than 115,000 views. The humor is meant to underscore the primary selling point for the product, which in the words of Mr. Butler, the brand manager, answers the question: “How do you get a chef-inspired, creamy, rich texture on a weeknight in less than 30 minutes?” In a March 12 promotion with yet another celebrity chef, Todd English, the brand hosted concurrent house parties at more than 10,000 homes, each with about 16 guests and samples of both the new Cooking Creme product and a line of cookware by Mr. English. Through Skype, Mr. English interacted with participants, while simultaneously hosting his cooking show live on HSN. “Our brand proponents were way out ahead of everyone else,” Jill Baskin, senior director of advertising for the cheese and dairy division at Kraft, said of the consumers who have participated in the house parties and online. “What we discovered is that for many of them we needed to sort of give them permission to make these things — and to go beyond bagels and cream cheese.”IN the 1980s, when the bagel began its ascent from a specialty item served primarily in delis to a staple in chains like Bruegger’s, and eventually even in McDonald’s, it was an auspicious time to be in the cream cheese business. So in commercials for Philadelphia cream cheese over the last few decades, bagels have played a starring role as a platform for the spread.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/26/business/26starbucks.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Appeals Court Supports Starbucks in Kraft Dispute<date>Published: February 25, 2011</date><text>Kraft Foods lost on Friday an appeals court ruling that upholds a decision allowing the Starbucks Corporation to end a deal under which Kraft distributes Starbucks coffee to grocery stores.“We conclude that Kraft has failed to show that it faces an actual and imminent risk of injury that cannot be compensated by money damages,” the appeals judges said in their ruling, which came several hours after they heard arguments from both sides at a hearing in Manhattan. Kraft sued Starbucks in December to prevent it from terminating their deal before they could resolve the dispute in arbitration. Judge Cathy Seibel of United States District Court in New York rejected Kraft’s contention in January that it would be irreparably harmed if Starbucks were allowed to end the agreement. The appeal was heard before the United States Court of Appeals in Manhattan. “The Second Circuit did not rule on the fundamental issue of whether Starbucks can exit our contract without paying the fair market value, plus a premium,” Marc Firestone, Kraft’s general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. “That question will be decided in arbitration.” “We are pleased that the court of appeals has confirmed the district court’s ruling,” Alan Hilowitz, a spokesman for Starbucks, said in an e-mailed statement.

Kraft reported its results after the market close and its shares fell 2 percent to $30.48 in after-hours trading. They closed the regular session at $31.11. The company, based in Northfield, Ill., said it earned $540 million, or 31 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $710 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding costs for integrating Cadbury and other special items, the company earned 46 cents a share, down from 47 cents last year, but matching analysts’ expectations. Kraft acquired Cadbury a year ago for $19.5 billion. The company’s revenue rose 30 percent to $13.77 billion, with higher sales around the globe, largely because of the addition of Cadbury. Analysts expected $13.48 billion, according to data from FactSet. Kraft lowered its full-year forecast because of weakness in consumer confidence and rising commodity costs.

Kraft said it would appeal the decision. The company filed the lawsuit last month seeking a preliminary injunction to keep Starbucks from bolting. The ruling, by Judge Cathy Seibel of the United States District Court in White Plains, did not affect a separate private arbitration process between the two companies that is aimed at reaching a financial settlement over the breakup. Starbucks had offered to pay $750 million to end the arrangement, but Kraft is seeking a much higher amount. Kraft began distributing Starbucks packaged coffee in 1998. Kraft said in court papers that sales equaled $500 million a year. The move by Starbucks is part of a broader strategy to focus more attention on sales through retail outlets beyond its ubiquitous coffee shops. It already had success last year with sales of its new VIA instant coffee, which was not sold through Kraft.A federal judge on Friday sided with Starbucks in its messy divorce from Kraft Foods, refusing to block Starbucks from breaking a longstanding supermarket distribution deal with Kraft.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/business/media/05adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Wheat Thins: Call Them Snacks, Not Crackers<date>Published: January 4, 2011</date><text>LIKE ready-made pie crusts, crackers are marketed not just on their merits but also on what consumers put on them, so packages often show crackers topped with artfully arranged cheese, diced vegetables and dip.Typical of the approach was when Andy Griffith, a pitchman for Ritz crackers in television commercials in the 1970s, declared, “Everything tastes better when it sits on a Ritz.” But now Wheat Thins, from the Nabisco division of Kraft Foods, is recasting itself not as a platform for cheddar or onion dip, but rather a stand-alone snack. “When consumers talk about snacks, they look at Wheat Thins in the same basket as other snacks like pretzels, potato chips and popcorn,” said Jim Low, marketing director for the wheat cracker division at Kraft. “Wheat Thins is one of the least topped crackers in the cracker category — so we realized we needed to act more like a snack.” The most avid consumers of salty snacks are young adults 18 to 24, who have them 5.3 times a week, compared with an overall adult average of 4.8 times, according to Mintel, the market research firm. Marketing for the brand over the last year has sought younger consumers by focusing on social networking, while highlighting an attribute often used to sell chips: crunchiness. In a television campaign introduced in June 2010, consumers who have mentioned Wheat Thins on either Twitter or Facebook are paid a surprise visit by a film crew traveling in a van that says, “The Crunch Is Calling.” The first ad, by the Escape Pod of Chicago, featured Tabitha Hancock, who lives in Los Angeles and had written on her Facebook page that because she was “outta wheat thins,” her “life is officially over!” Ms. Hancock got a knock on her front door by the crew, led by the actor Brian Palatucci, who interviewed her while a forklift lowered a pallet of Wheat Thins in her driveway. Other spots surprise consumers who had posted about using Wheat Thins as picks to play air guitar or wondering if noise-canceling headphones can effectively block the sound of Wheat Thins being chewed.  Norm Bilow, managing director of the Escape Pod, said that initially the agency was just researching Twitter mentions of Wheat Thins for background. “They were fun comments, and someone said, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could go to all of their houses?’ ” Mr. Bilow said. “And that sort of became the idea.” The ads, called Twitterventions, have garnered about a million views on YouTube, but some viewers have doubted their authenticity. In October, Derek Tzeo, who lives in Portland, Ore., wrote in a Twitter message that the commercials were “uber fake.” In a new commercial scheduled to premiere Wednesday, during the People’s Choice Awards on CBS, the Wheat Thins film crew surprises Mr. Tzeo on a street with a pallet of Wheat Thins. Through an integration deal with the People’s Choice Awards, Wheat Thins is sponsoring the Viral Video Star category, and in a taped segment during the live broadcast, the Wheat Thins crew surprises the winner at home with the award. Wheat Thins spent $14.2 million on advertising in 2008 and $14.3 million in 2009, and in the first three quarters of 2010 surpassed both years, at $16.2 million, according to Kantar Media. The brand declined to reveal total ad spending for 2010, but did confirm that its advertising budget called for spending at the same levels in 2011. This is not the first time snacking has been emphasized by Wheat Thins. Television commercials in the 1980s featured a jingle with the lyrics, “Wheat Thins — something like a cracker, but more like a snack,” while Sandy Duncan, who pitched the product in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, tended to eat them straight from the box and declare they were “snackable.” But in those earlier efforts, Mr. Low, of Kraft, suggested, Wheat Thins protested too much by evoking crackers, something marketing for a true snack would have no cause to do. Today the word “crackers” is verboten, and the brand is replacing the term “snack crackers” on the front of packages with “snacks,” a change that will be completed across the line in 2011. If Wheat Thins are becoming more like snacks, the reverse may be equally true. Mintel reports that “among the hottest trends in new salty snack products,” are varieties that are baked, not fried, and that contain whole grains — both attributes of Wheat Thins since they were introduced in 1947.  These days, in serving suggestion photos, Wheat Thins always go topless, and accompaniments like cheese or grapes are not even shown nearby. (For cracker traditionalists, and contrary to the general direction of the brand, in 2009 it introduced Wheat Thins Flatbread crackers, which are long and rectangular and whose packages show cheeses and vegetables on them.) To raise its visibility with the young and the snack-prone, the brand gave away more than five million samples in 2010 at such youth-oriented events as college football and basketball games, and at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, which is held annually in Tennessee. Growth, much like Wheat Thins themselves, had been flat over the last few years, but the brand has had month-over-month increases in both revenue and market share for each of the last six months, according to Symphony/IRI Group, whose data does not include Wal-Mart. Wheat Thins total revenue for the 52 weeks that ended Nov. 28 reached $346.6 million, according to Symphony/IRI. The brand recently introduced Wheat Thins Crunch Stix, which are shaped like pretzel sticks and sold in a beveled box that is wider at the top than bottom, to accommodate a reaching hand. But Wheat Thins Stix raise an existential question: If they are not thin, are they really Wheat Thins? “I don’t think people are doctrinaire about the literalness of what the name means,” Mr. Low of Kraft said. “It’s a brand called Wheat Thins that stands for great snacking.”LIKE ready-made pie crusts, crackers are marketed not just on their merits but also on what consumers put on them, so packages often show crackers topped with artfully arranged cheese, diced vegetables and dip.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E1D61438F937A35752C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=kraftfoodsinc">India Looking Into Taxes In Kraft Deal for Cadbury<date>Published: January 4, 2011</date><text>6:32 p.m. | Updated NEW DELHI - Indian officials are investigating whether Kraft Foods evaded taxes in its $19 billion takeover of Cadbury last year. India's ministry of finance is examining Kraft's tax liabilities related to the takeover, on the heels of a public interest lawsuit filed last year in the Delhi High Court. In the suit, a Delhi-based lawyer asserted that Kraft had ''completely and illegally avoided'' tax liabilities related to the sale of shares and capital assets in India, which had caused ''substantial loss to the Indian economy.'' In a Dec. 22 letter referring to the public interest suit, which was shown to The New York Times by the law firm that filed the suit, a finance ministry official wrote ''action has been initiated in the matter under the Income Tax laws.'' Salil Mishra, an under secretary of finance who wrote the letter, said Monday that he could not comment on the issue. Access to India's fast-growing economy, as well as other emerging markets, was a crucial reason Kraft Foods struck a deal for Cadbury, analysts and Kraft executives said as the deal was forged. Cadbury has a distribution network of 1.2 million outlets in India, and was the country's largest confectionary company before the takeover, with more than double the market share of its closest competitor. A Kraft spokesman in India said Monday evening that the company was not aware of any litigation or investigation related to tax matters and the Cadbury deal, and had not been contacted by the Indian government on the matter. Gaurang Kanth, the lawyer in New Delhi who filed the public interest suit against Kraft, said he could not estimate what Kraft's total tax bill should be in India, but said that it would be sizable. Mr. Kanth said he filed the suit because companies were ''building in the Indian market and selling in the Indian market, without any sales proceeds coming back to India.'' ''If you are getting something from India,'' Mr. Kanth added, ''you should be paying back in to India.'' The Indian government has a multitrillion-rupee budget deficit, he noted. Public interest lawsuits in India are often used to protect the rights of the poor and working class. It is the second multibillion-dollar deal between international companies to run into tax issues here. The telecommunications company Vodafone is still appealing Indian court rulings last year that it is liable for about $2 billion in capital gains taxes on its $11 billion acquisition in 2007 of a controlling stake in one of India's largest cellphone companies. Vodafone has argued that there is no legal precedent for asking an acquiring company to pay capital gains taxes. But tax experts in India say that the Vodafone case has little in common with Kraft's buyout of Cadbury. Vodafone's takeover in India and the Kraft-Cadbury deal are ''not comparable at all,'' said Dinesh Kanabar, deputy chief executive and chairman, tax at KPMG in India. ''In Kraft's case, there was a sale overseas of Cadbury, which was a global transaction, and India was just one small portion of the deal,'' Mr. Kanabar said. Indian tax authorities are unlikely to weigh in on an international transaction where only a fraction of the assets changing hands are Indian. The public interest suit itself relies on India's long-standing income tax laws to make its case. According to the suit, ''The brands, good will, franchise, market share, customer lists, relationship and the value of market, etc., are capital assets'' and any accruals from the transfer of these assets is taxable under Section 4 of the 1961 Income Tax Act. Kraft is ''under an obligation to deduct the income tax while making the said payment towards the acquisition,'' the suit argues. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/media/28adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Companies Promote Health and Brands With Playgrounds<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>MARKETERS like Kraft Foods, MetLife, CVS and Dr Pepper/Snapple Group are steering millions in charitable dollars to a new and somewhat unlikely project — building neighborhood playgrounds for children.The companies are embracing the playground as an opportunity to make their names better known — and better liked — locally and to encourage employees to volunteer in their communities. As the first lady, Michelle Obama, highlights child obesity and urges regular exercise, providing play spaces is a winning cause for the food and beverage companies, which are under fire for high calorie snacks and drinks. Dr Pepper/Snapple Group pledged $15 million this month to build or fix 2,000 playgrounds over the next three years. “A fit and active lifestyle is one of our philanthropic goals,” said Tina Barry, senior vice president for corporate affairs at the company’s headquarters in Plano, Tex. “Playgrounds align with that.” In October, Kraft Foods made playground-building a centerpiece of its annual company “Delicious Difference Week.” About 1,300 employees, including the chief executive Irene Rosenfeld, built 13 playgrounds, including one in Washington Park on the South Side of Chicago, at a total cost of more than $1.4 million. Kraft, too, counts healthful lifestyles, along with ending hunger, as a top philanthropic priority. “It’s huge — getting children excited about play,” said Nicole Robinson, the vice president of the company’s charitable arm, the Kraft Foods Foundation. Kraft and other companies that provide money for playground construction say they have not studied whether their contributions increase public awareness of their brand. Corporate-financed playgrounds typically bear a plaque with the company’s name and receive a flurry of local news coverage. Kraft’s playground projects are “a huge boost to the company’s reputation, and add to its credibility,” Ms. Robinson says. • Foresters, the life insurance provider, also has opted for playgrounds, recently pledging $1.5 million to build 20 in the United States, where the company, which is based in Canada, has most of its clients. “It’s a good fit for us,” said George Mohacsi, its president and chief executive. “And we get more bang for the buck when we build a playground, we put in something that people can use daily for a decade or more.” A. Dennis White, president and chief executive of MetLife Foundation, said his company regularly finances playgrounds to promote physical fitness. The company has donated $850,000 in the last three years for 400 play spaces in the United States and Mexico. “It’s something that can be built in a day, and we like the visibility it gets in the local community,” Mr. White said. Once upon a time, playgrounds were largely the province of schools or municipalities, but with plummeting local tax revenues, they are ripe for corporate support. This dovetails with a recent study that found companies are allocating their charitable giving — whether it is goods, services or cash — more toward community needs instead of grand goals such as alleviating world hunger. Basic needs were the only categories in which corporate cash contributions increased last year, according to the Committee Encouraging Corporate Philanthropy’s annual corporate giving report, which used information from 171 major companies, including 61 of the Fortune 100. Companies financing playgrounds often work in partnership with Kaboom, a nonprofit group based in Washington, which recently drew praise from Mrs. Obama. It has a comprehensive plan to include the community and company volunteers in designing, building and maintaining play spaces. Kaboom has nearly 300 corporate partners, including Home Depot and Kimberly Clark. Darell Hammond, its chief executive, said companies need to spend $75,000 to $500,000 to create a public playground, depending on whether the floor is rubberized. Companies are drawn to the idea because “playgrounds bring the community together,” Mr. Hammond said. “It’s almost a new town square.” Other companies work with nonprofit organizations like Shane’s Inspiration or Boundless Playgrounds, to create play areas that are accessible to disabled children. This fall, CVS worked with the Pepsi Refresh Project to give $70,000 to construct the playground proposal from the public that had won the most votes on the project’s Web site. A Fort Wayne, Ind., playground proposal was selected and will be built in 2011, said Eileen Howard Dunn, senior vice president for community relations for CVS Caremark. CVS, based in Woonsocket, R.I., has spent $3 million in recent years to finance 65 playgrounds around the country, and has pledged to build 10 more next year as part of its $25 million “All Kids Can” initiative to help disabled children. With charitable cash in shorter supply, companies are encouraging employees to volunteer. The corporate philanthropy committee report found that in the last three years, 20 percent more companies offer paid time during the workday for employees to volunteer. • Companies devoting resources to building playgrounds, which typically are in areas that are home to a concentration of their employees, say that worker engagement and satisfaction are important considerations in choosing the playground option. “Employees who participate feel a sense of community whether they participate for the one day or for the six months of planning,” Ms. Robinson, of Kraft, said. “And any company really receives a halo.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/business/26corner.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Robert A. Eckert on Building the Culture at Mattel<date>Published: December 25, 2010</date><text>This interview with Robert A. Eckert, chairman and chief executive of Mattel, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Tell me about some early influences for you. What about your parents? A. My father was a single-practitioner dentist in suburban Chicago, and a World War II veteran. My mother started out working for him, and then she looked after the kids full-time. Q. How did they influence the way you lead today? A. My parents were both very positive people, and never complained about anything. My father died a couple years ago at age 91. When we knew the end was near, I’d go see him all the time. And he’d want to know: “Bobby, how’s it going? Enough about me. Tell me about you.” He was interested in other people. And my wife has always said about him and me that we are “other directed.” Being other directed has always worked for me. Q. What were some other early lessons? A. Kraft Foods was my first company out of school. I was a 21-year-old trained M.B.A. type, and I’m going to work for this fellow who’s in his 50s and worked his way up the ladder a lot differently than I was going to work my way up the ladder. And I showed him a lot of respect. I never walked in with an attitude of, “I’m an M.B.A., I’m Bob, let me tell you what to do.” And he taught me so much about the company. He’d worked there for decades, and he was open and willing to share a lot with me, and I would take that in. I also met the old-timers for breakfast every morning in the cafeteria. I’d listen to their stories and engage with them, and they allowed me to be a part of their little club. I learned a lot about the company and how it worked and how they worked. Q. What can you tell me about your approach to leadership now? A. Trust is an important thing. The way we run the company is, I have a lot of confidence in you, I have a lot of trust in you, we’re transparent — we share where we are and where we’re going and what’s going on. And that openness has always worked well for me. I come with a positive attitude that you come to work and you want to do the best job you can. That’s why you’re here. You could work some other place, you could do some other thing, but you work here. I want to help you succeed. I’ve worked for one or two people in my career or seen one or two where it’s the opposite. They think you’re here to mess up, and it’s their job to prevent you from messing up. That’s not very motivating to good people. Q. What kind of feedback have you received over the years about the way you manage? A. I’m not a quick trigger. If my bias is, if you’re here to do a good job and you’re a good person, then I’m here to help you. I spend an awful lot of energy, if you’re underperforming, trying to help you figure out how to perform better, when others might more quickly say we’ve got to move on. And being slow with the trigger hasn’t been productive for me. I recognize it. It’s still a flaw. Sometimes people really do turn it around and perform better, but it doesn’t always work out that way. And with the benefit of hindsight after letting someone go, you say, I should have done that last year. Q. Let’s talk about hiring. If you were interviewing me, how would that conversation go? A. There are two things I look for. First, I’ll find out from you, if you’ve reached a certain level in business, whether you and I have a common acquaintance. It may take me a while to find out who it is, but I’m going to know a couple of people who you know. So before you’re hired, I’m going to call those people, and I’m going to hear them talk to me about you. That works well for me. The second thing I do is look for values. I’ll take you back to when I was hired at Kraft in 1977. I met with Keith Ridgway, who was the C.E.O., and we’re having a chat. We’re chatting about how he was a World War II pilot, and that my father was in World War II, too, and we’re chatting about things that I found terribly irrelevant. I wasn’t convinced he had read my résumé. I worked hard and got good grades, but he didn’t seem that interested in that. I walked out of that interview and I didn’t feel good about it. It was just weird. Then fast-forward 15 years, the kids are sitting on the couch, and I’m asking them about their families, and how they grew up, and who’s important in their life and how did they decide to do this and that. I’m looking for fit, personality, values. Is this the kind of person we want around here? Will they work well? And I don’t really care how many places you worked at or what grades you got or who your favorite teacher was or what your favorite class was. It’s about what kind of people they are. Q. And what are you listening for?</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/business/07coffee.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Starbucks and Kraft Escalate Battle Over Marketing Pact<date>Published: December 6, 2010</date><text>A billion-dollar brouhaha between Starbucks and Kraft over supermarket coffee sales is turning into the venti latte of corporate divorces — with a double shot of espresso and extra foam.On Monday, Kraft took the fight to court, asking a federal judge in Manhattan to stop Starbucks from breaking the 12-year partnership under which Kraft distributes Starbucks’ packaged coffees, including whole beans and ground coffee, to grocery stores and other retailers. The war of words has been escalating for days, as the two sides traded charges and countercharges. Kraft claims that Starbucks unilaterally decided to end their agreement, and Starbucks says that Kraft failed to aggressively promote its brands, which include Seattle’s Best Coffee, in stores. The bitterness has also spilled into the fast-growing market for single-serve coffee machines, with Kraft accusing Starbucks of undermining sales of its Tassimo coffee system ahead of the peak holiday season. Starbucks offered Kraft $750 million in August to terminate the partnership, according to the court filing, but Kraft declined. Under the contract, Starbucks can walk away if it pays Kraft fair market value for the business, plus a premium of as much as 35 percent, Kraft said in its legal papers. Analysts have estimated that fair market value alone could be well over $1 billion. Robert Moskow, a senior analyst for Credit Suisse, said a breakup was inevitable — the only question was how big the settlement would be. “Kraft knows the thing is over,” he said. “They’re going to go to arbitration and try to get as much value out of it as they can, and the way to do that is to get your lawyers out there and say Starbucks violated the agreement.” Kraft, maker of the well-known Maxwell House brand of coffee, is the largest food manufacturer in the country, with $48 billion in annual revenue. The Starbucks deal involves about $128 million in yearly profits split evenly between the partners, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse. As a result, Mr. Moskow said, executives at Kraft were not likely to lose much sleep over the loss of the deal. But supermarket sales are an important area for expansion for Starbucks, whose once-exponential growth in signature coffeehouses has slowed in recent years . The company has already had unexpected success this year with its new instant coffee line, VIA. Starbucks said it managed its own relationships with retailers for VIA sales, in coordination with a national distributor, Acosta. The company now wants to use those relationships to peddle ground coffee and beans directly, cutting out Kraft as a middleman. At an investor conference in New York City last week, the chief executive of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, said the company would aggressively look to push sales of its products in grocery stores, including whole beans, ground coffee and VIA. He said the company was confident it could get out of the deal. In a news release on Monday, Starbucks dismissed the Kraft court filing as a delay tactic. “Starbucks has repeatedly said that we have terminated our agreement with Kraft and we continue to look forward to assuming full responsibility for the sales and distribution of our packaged coffee products,” the company said. Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, said it planned to take over distribution of its supermarket packaged coffee sales March 1. Kraft said in a statement that Starbucks was “proceeding with flagrant indifference to the terms of the contract.” It asked the court to stop Starbucks from taking steps to terminate the agreement on its own and to bar Starbucks from communicating with retailers about a change in the coffee distribution deal. The supermarket sales deal between Kraft and Starbucks began in 1998, when Kraft says Starbucks was selling its coffee in just 4,000 food stores in 12 states, with annual sales of about $50 million. Now, Kraft says, sales have grown to about $500 million a year, and Starbucks packaged coffee is found in 40,000 stores in all 50 states and Canada. Starbucks had total revenue of $10.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended Oct. 3. According to the court filing, Starbucks approached Kraft in August about ending the partnership and made the $750 million offer to buy out Kraft’s rights in the coffee distribution deal and a group of related but smaller business ventures between the two companies. Kraft said the offer was far below fair market value and declined. Then in early October, Starbucks sent a letter to Kraft saying that the food giant had breached the agreement. Starbucks said that Kraft had done a poor job of marketing Starbucks products and had failed to share important information. It also said that Kraft’s Yuban coffee was unfairly competing with Starbucks in the “superpremium” range of the market. Kraft responded with a letter in early November defending its efforts on behalf of Starbucks, pointing to the strong growth in sales during the agreement. On Nov. 4, Starbucks announced publicly that it planned to end its deal with Kraft, and the war of words began. Last week, Kraft said it would go to arbitration, but Starbucks continued to say it wanted to terminate the partnership. The dispute extends to Kraft’s Tassimo single-serve coffeemakers, which use special coffee and tea discs exclusive to the machines. Tassimo competes with similar systems sold by Keurig, Senseo and other companies. As part of the dispute between the companies, Starbucks has said it will stop supplying coffee and tea discs for the Tassimo machines. Kraft said in its legal filing that Tassimo was the only single-serve machine that offered Starbucks-branded inserts and that the relationship bolstered sales. Kraft added that a major retailer had balked at stocking the machines this holiday season after hearing that Starbucks might not supply the coffee. Kraft accused Starbucks of preparing to produce its own machine to compete with Tassimo. Bill Patterson, a senior market analyst at Mintel International Group, a market research firm, said that it would make sense for Starbucks to try to expand its reach in the single-serve market. “When you buy a machine you’re locked into a system,” he said. “It’s a fantastic market to have.” Kraft also lamented in its court filing that losing Starbucks could reduce its influence with supermarkets over what goes in the coffee aisle. Without Starbucks, Kraft could lose its position as a “category captain” with several chains — a term that refers to a manufacturer or distributor chosen by a retailer to give advice on how to display and promote a category of products. “It’s high-stakes poker here, and there’s a lot financially that is going to be hanging in the balance,” said Jim Hertel, a managing partner of Willard Bishop, a food retail consultant in Chicago.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE2D8143CF933A05752C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=kraftfoodsinc">DEALBOOK ONLINE; FOOD FIGHT<date>Published: November 30, 2010</date><text>Starbucks and Kraft Foods are locked in a takeover battle. Only nobody is calling it that yet. On Monday morning, Kraft sought to pursue a case against Starbucks over its rights to sell prepackaged coffee and other branded goods under the Starbucks name as part of a pact that the two companies reached in 1998. But what this fight is really about, according to people involved in it behind the scenes, is an effort by Starbucks to buy back its consumer business from Kraft. Under the terms of their joint venture, Starbucks has the right to seek to acquire the business based on a ''market'' rate and sufficient premium. In recent months, Starbucks has begun sending threatening letters to Kraft claiming that it had breached certain provisions of their partnership agreement. These claims, however, don't square with previous public comments by the coffee giant about how well the partnership had worked. It now appears more likely that Starbucks is trying to use the new claims as negotiating leverage to buy back the prepackaged food business at a lower price. With Starbucks planning its investor day on Wednesday, it is clear that both sides are ramping up the fight. For Starbucks, reclaiming the rights to its prepackaged business could be a crucial part of its growth strategy, especially as it becomes clear that growth at its stores is stagnating. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/08/business/media/08adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Mr. Peanut’s New Look? Planters Went Old School<date>Published: November 7, 2010</date><text>ON Madison Avenue, there are talking dogs, talking horses, even talking margarine tubs, not to mention talking brand characters like the E*Trade babies and the Keebler elves. But Mr. Peanut, the dapper Planters mascot since 1916, has never spoken — until now.Mr. Peanut is getting a voice as part of efforts by the Planters parent, Kraft Foods, to revitalize the character, and the brand, for contemporary consumers. The voice is being supplied by the actor Robert Downey Jr. in an animated commercial that is to be introduced on Tuesday. In another sign of how keen Kraft is to update Mr. Peanut, the commercial is to be previewed on the character’s Facebook page (facebook.com/mrpeanut) before it runs on TV and in movie theaters. The humorous commercial will also unveil a new look for Mr. Peanut, meant to give him a more authentic appearance by evoking designs of the character that date to the 1930s and 1940s. He is now brown, rather than yellow, and sports — appropriately for a spokes-character — a gray flannel suit.  The makeover is indicative of efforts by marketers to revive classic ad mascots, slogans and jingles to appeal to present-day shoppers. Among those believing in the truism that nostalgia is a powerful sales tool during tough times are Brut, Cotton Inc., General Mills, McDonald’s and Pepsi-Cola. But nostalgia is not what it used to be, particularly when it comes to younger consumers, so the goal is to be perceived not as old-fashioned — fusty and out of date — but rather as old-school — from an earlier era and worthy of respect. The Mintel International Group, a research company, calls that concept “new retro” and lists it among a dozen trends that will shape the marketing of consumer packaged goods in 2011. “One thing we learned is that while people love Mr. Peanut, they weren’t connecting with him beyond the nostalgia,” said Jason Levine, senior director for marketing at Planters at the East Hanover, N.J., office of Kraft. “Having him able to speak is bringing him to life as a personality,” he added, “and people can engage with him more.” Mr. Levine hastened to reassure fans that “he’s still Mr. Peanut, with the top hat and monocle and cane.” “We’re taking him back to his roots,” he said. To that end, the commercial takes place in Mr. Peanut’s house, located under a peanut vine, and depicts the character’s holiday party, where the guests include nature’s creatures like a mole, a turtle, a butterfly and a grasshopper. “At Planters, we know how to throw a remarkable holiday party,” Mr. Peanut says. “Just serve classy snacks and be a gracious host, no matter who shows up.” The guests gasp as a nutcracker enters the room. “Hey, sorry about last week,” he says. “I don’t know what got into me.” Mr. Peanut replies, “Yeah, well, forgive and forget, kind of,” as he turns to reveal a bandage covering cracks in his shell. The spot is part of a campaign, with a budget estimated at $30 million to $35 million, that carries the theme “Naturally remarkable.” The campaign includes print, digital and retail ads as well as a cause-related marketing element by which Planters will help an organization named the Corps Network with conservation projects in cities nationwide. The campaign is the first work for Planters from the New York office of Being, a spin-off from TBWA Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Kraft shifted the Planters creative account in April to TBWA from DraftFCB, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and TBWA formed Being to avoid conflicts with another client, the confectioner Mars. Mr. Peanut “has always had a wit and a charm, even though he hasn’t talked,” said Kris Wixom, a creative director at Being. “To have the character entertain, and deliver messages, is a real opportunity.” However, his wife, Alisa Sengel Wixom, also a creative director at Being, acknowledged the risk in changing Mr. Peanut. “What are you going to do, put a baseball cap on him?” she asked. “He is who he is, and people respect his genuineness.” Mr. Downey was chosen to speak for Mr. Peanut, Mr. Wixom said, because of his “everyman suaveness,” adding that the actor has “a voice that could wear the top hat, monocle and cane and still feel contemporary and cool.” Planters is the second campaign to which Mr. Downey is lending his voice. He is also the announcer in commercials for Nissan North America, part of Nissan Motor, that are created by the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, another unit of TBWA. Mr. Downey’s double duty is a coincidence, said Jeremy Miller, a spokesman for TBWA, adding that “neither team working on Nissan or Planters knew he was being reached out to by the other.”  In addition to getting a voice, Mr. Peanut has a new sidekick, much like the Jolly Green Giant has Little Green Sprout. Mr. Peanut’s buddy is named Benson, and to make sure that snackers understand the pecking order between them, Benson is shorter than Mr. Peanut — one nut in his shell rather than two. “Benson is quite enamored of Mr. Peanut,” Mr. Levine said, but they are, as the saying goes, just friends. Benson does not live in Mr. Peanut’s house, Mr. Wixom said. Agencies on the campaign include Digitas, part of the Publicis Groupe, for digital ads; MediaVest, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group unit of Publicis, for media strategy and planning; Momentum, part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of Interpublic, for events and in-store marketing; and Edelman, for public relations. The Being team developed the creative approach for the character with Laika, an animation studio, and the directing team of Mark Gustafson and Ringan Ledwidge. Kraft spent $16.9 million to advertise Planters in major media in the first half of the year, the Kantar Media unit of WPP reported, up 68.2 percent from $10 million spent in the period a year earlier.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/post-cadbury-kraft-misses-revenue-target/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Despite Cadbury Bump, Kraft Misses Revenue Target<date>November 5, 2010, 4:30 am</date><text>Kraft Foods reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, after price increases taken to offset rising ingredient costs hurt sales, Reuters reports. Kraft, the maker of Maxwell House coffee, Velveeta cheese and Cadbury chocolate, also may lose a sizable business selling packaged Starbucks coffee. Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee company, said Thursday that it intended to end their 12-year-old deal to have more control over its distribution. In the fiscal third quarter, Kraft’s net revenue rose 26 percent to $11.86 billion, mostly because of the $18.4 billion purchase of Britain’s Cadbury, which added Cadbury chocolate, Trident gum and Halls lozenges to its portfolio.

But the Potash Corporation’s battle against BHP Billiton’s hostile takeover bears a striking resemblance to the one that the British candy maker Cadbury unsuccessfully waged a year ago against Kraft Foods. The similarities include a lack of competing bids, lots of political posturing and restless shareholders. Potash shareholders may want to consider how the Cadbury situation played out. Similar to BHP, Kraft took its first offer for Cadbury directly to shareholders. Cadbury rejected the bid and speculators lifted the shares above the price on the table. The usual defensive dance then began, with Cadbury arguing its performance warranted a higher valuation, while at the same time searching for rival bidders. Potash has followed the Cadbury script. It rejected BHP, started highlighting its merits (including robust results last week) and sent bankers roaming the earth for competing bids. Cadbury failed to drum up sufficient interest from Hershey or Ferrero. Now, Potash seems to have exhausted its white knight chances. The defense now rests on politics. Saskatchewan, the province that once owned Potash, has urged Ottawa to reject the offer under the Investment Canada Act, which requires that foreign investments are a “net benefit” to the nation. That has set off the horse trading. To win Canada’s support, BHP has promised not to use losses from a potash project it is developing to reduce its tax bill and to limit its target’s net debt to help protect provincial finances. Kraft, too, made promises, including at least one that it reneged upon, to appease British politicians worried about Cadbury jobs. Canada may block BHP this week, though politics aside, it’s hard to see on what basis. That would leave the decision to Potash shareholders. Cadbury is once again instructive here. Kraft’s first bid came at a 31 percent premium. In the end, Kraft offered 50 percent more than the company was worth before it tipped its hand. BHP’s first offer represented a 16 percent premium. To match Kraft’s increase from first to final offer implies a BHP sweetener to around $155 a share, or some 5 percent above the current price. The difficulty of justifying that to its own shareholders may be the best bet Saskatchewan residents can rely on for a BHP Achilles’ heel. Less Return at Banks Shareholders in investment banks are still getting a raw deal. True, it may appear that traders and advisers on both sides of the Atlantic are sharing the pain with their owners as revenues fall. After all, compensation is generally lower this year. But it’s not just slower markets that are depressing earnings: banks have bolstered their capital, too. That means investors are putting more money to work for less return. Take Goldman Sachs. The firm made 14 percent less revenue in the first nine months of the year. But it has also trimmed four percentage points off its ratio of compensation to revenue. So employee costs are down an impressive-sounding 22 percent. Goldman’s shareholders, though, arguably suffered more: return on common equity fell by a third, to 13.2 percent, excluding a couple of one-time charges, in part because the bank increased its capital base by 28 percent. The split looks more balanced at JPMorgan’s investment bank. While the pay ratio edged up slightly, overall pay fell 15.5 percent, a couple of percentage points more than the drop in revenue, but similar to the return on equity dip. But the unit was operating with just over a fifth more capital than last year, meaning shareholders are shouldering more of the burden. Credit Suisse’s equity base has hardly budged since last year. So on the face of it, investors should be applauding its decision to slash pay by a fifth. But compensation jumped more than a tenth, to 49 percent of revenue, while return on equity, though a decent 19.7 percent, was half last year’s showing. Some banks might appear to have the formula right. Morgan Stanley’s compensation ratio jumped just over 12 percent so far this year but revenues improved almost four times as fast. With capital increasing by just under a third, that might look like an acceptable trade-off. But the firm’s return on equity of just over 11 percent is not great for shareholders. While much is changing on Wall Street, not least regulation, one thing still remains constant: employees, not owners, usually come first. </text></article><article index="15" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/funds-cut-net-long-positions-on-coffee/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Funds Cut Net-Long Positions on Coffee<date>September 13, 2010, 8:05 am</date><text>The red-hot coffee market may be cooling down soon as hedge funds pull back on bets that bean prices will go higher, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

Kraft, which bought the British confectioner Cadbury in February for $19.5 billion, had more shares outstanding in this year’s second quarter. Excluding one-time items, Kraft earned 60 cents a share in the period, better than the 52 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Its revenue rose 25.3 percent, to $12.3 billion from $9.8 billion, with much of the gain from Cadbury’s chocolates and candies. Consumer product sales have fallen in developed markets like North America because shoppers are skimping on name brands to save money in the weak economy. Kraft, based in Northfield, Ill., said that trend was still affecting its business. The company now expects its full-year organic net revenue to grow 3 to 4 percent, down from an earlier forecast of at least 4 percent. The company maintained its forecast for 2010 operating earnings of at least $2 a share. Kraft said its North American results were hurt by aggressive discounts and promotions by competitors in cheese, salad dressings and crackers. Revenue in North America, its biggest segment, rose 6.3 percent to $6.16 billion, although the amount of products it sold fell 2 percent. Key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon, Philadelphia cream cheese, Kool-Aid and Capri Sun posted gains. But the company sold 11.8 percent less cheese in the quarter and 3.5 percent less snacks. In Europe, Kraft’s revenue rose 34.1 percent, to $2.79 billion, the bulk of that coming from Cadbury. It sold 7.9 percent more products, but price cuts hurt its profit there. Higher sales of chocolate and cheese helped offset lower prices. Weaker markets were Spain and Greece, while France and Britain had solid growth. Developing-markets revenue rose 73.4 percent, again mostly from Cadbury, with total revenue reaching $3.3 billion. Volume rose 8.7 percent, with strong performance from Latin America and China, Australia and the Philippines. The Cadbury acquisition enabled Kraft to expand into new categories and new countries. The company now expects savings of at least $750 million from the deal, more than its earlier estimate of $675 million. But it expects to spend more integrating Cadbury’s operations, some $1.5 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $1.3 billion.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/cadbury-deal-prompts-review-of-takeover-rules/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Cadbury Deal Prompts Review of Takeover Rules<date>June 2, 2010, 6:03 am</date><text>Reverberations from Kraft’s controversial $19 billion takeover of Cadbury continued in Britain this week as the country’s Takeover Panel said it planned to begin a review of its takeover rules, The Telegraph reported. The move comes after the panel took the unusual step last week of publicly criticizing Kraft Foods for failing to meet the standards of its code. Public outcry over the closing of a factory run by the British confectionery maker after it was bought in January by the American food giant has put takeover rules on the political agenda. The furor has now led the Takeover Panel to invite proposals on how the rules should change, instead of first publishing its own, The Telegraph said. The newspaper reported: The issues the review will look at include the “50 percent plus one” minimum voting requirement for takeovers to go ahead; whether voting rights should be withheld from shares bought during an offer period; whether the 1 percent disclosure threshold for dealings and positions in target companies should be reduced; and whether inducement fees and other deal protection arrangements should be restricted.

While the panel’s statement does not impose a fine on Kraft, it vindicates the many Britons disappointed to see a domestic brand taken over by a foreign rival, and angered at job losses as the unemployment rate hits highs not seen since the mid-1990s. Kraft responded to the panel’s criticism by saying it regretted that “it was not feasible to keep Somerdale open, as we’d originally believed possible. Even though we never made a promise or a commitment to keep the facility open, we recognize that our ‘statement of belief’ created uncertainty among Somerdale employees.” When Kraft first announced its aim to acquire Cadbury last September, Irene Rosenfeld said in the company statement: “Our current plans contemplate that the U.K. would be a net beneficiary in terms of jobs. For example, we believe we would be in a position to continue to operate the Somerdale facility, which is currently planned to be closed, and to invest in Bournville, thereby preserving U.K. manufacturing jobs.” On the night of Jan. 18, however, Kraft learned from Cadbury how advanced the process of closing the Somerdale plant was, and that it would be difficult to keep the site open, the panel said. “Kraft was told on that night that the phased closure of Somerdale was well advanced, that money had been committed, and that both equipment and people had been, or were in the process of being, moved out,” the panel said. Weeks later, Kraft announced that it would not reverse Cadbury’s decision on Somerdale. The plant, whose closing was first announced in 2007, employed about 400 people. The panel said Wednesday that “Kraft should not have made the statements in the form in which it did in circumstances where it did not know the details of Cadbury’s phased closure of Somerdale and its investment in plant and machinery to make products for the U.K. in its new facilities in Poland.” The panel concluded that while Kraft may initially have held the genuine belief that it could keep the plant running, based on the information it had, the American company did not have reasonable grounds for that belief. British takeover code says that statements made “during the course of an offer must be prepared with the highest standards of care and accuracy and the information given must be adequately and fairly presented.” The panel also made a point that Kraft’s financial adviser, Lazard, had fallen short in its duties, saying that “financial advisers have a responsibility to ensure that their client and its directors are aware of their responsibilities under the code and will comply with them.” Lazard “failed to discharge fully its responsibilities,” the panel said, but added that “the primary responsibility in respect of the Somerdale statements lay with Kraft.” The panel is not imposing a fine on Kraft, but its conclusions are not without consequences. Peter Kiernan, the managing director at Lazard involved in the Kraft bid who was set to take charge of the takeover panel, has decided to withdraw his name, the agency said Wednesday in a separate statement. Philip Remnant will continue to lead the panel, it said. Kraft said it had decided not to appeal the panel’s public reprimand. “We believe it’s best for everyone to put this matter behind us,” the company said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Kraft Hopes to Encourage Adults to Revert to a Childhood Favorite<date>Published: May 26, 2010</date><text>KRAFT FOODS wants grown-ups to get the blues in the night, and in the afternoon and at snack time, too.The “blues” in this instance are the familiar blue boxes of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner, a product that Kraft has long sold to adults as a meal to make for children. In a new campaign — the first work on the brand from a new creative agency — Kraft tells adults that its macaroni and cheese has, to quote ads for Kellogg’s Frosted Flakes, the taste adults have grown to love. To underline that message, the macaroni campaign carries the playful theme, “You know you love it,” and continues in that vein with lines like “The most fun you can have with your stove on,” “Outgrow outgrowing it,” “Imported from your childhood” and “Parents need warm cheesy hugs.” The campaign will sell the entire Kraft Macaroni and Cheese line, which in addition to the classic blue boxes includes varieties like Deluxe, Easy Mac and Homestyle. The campaign began on Wednesday with a commercial during the ninth-season finale of “American Idol.” There will also be other television commercials; print ads; billboards; ads online; a Web site, youknowyouloveit.com; a presence in social media like Facebook and Twitter; and even “noodle art” — replicas of macaroni noodles, 20 feet long and 9 feet high — placed in and around landmarks like Fisherman’s Wharf and Wrigley Field. Kraft executives say they intend to spend more than $50 million this year to promote the macaroni products, an increase of more than 30 percent from last year. Most of the spending last year was devoted to ads that peddled the product to recession-weary consumers as a good value. For example, the headline of a magazine ad declared: “Small price. Big cheese-eating grin.”  Kraft is changing pitches as the economy seems to be improving. But consumers are still dining more at home than they did two or three years ago, offering an opportunity for giant purveyors of consumer packaged goods to reintroduce shoppers to pantry staples. Kraft joins mainstay marketers like Campbell, ConAgra, General Mills, Heinz, Hershey, Hormel, Kellogg and Smucker in increasing ad spending, bringing out new products and restaging old favorites. Macaroni and cheese joins a lengthening list of Kraft products to benefit from new campaigns, among them Bull’s-Eye barbecue sauce, Chips Ahoy, Oscar Mayer, Miracle Whip and Philadelphia cream cheese. “There’s no big project corporate-wide that says we must reinvent all these businesses,” said Chris Miles, director of advertising for the grocery business at Kraft in Northfield, Ill., but he says there is a goal of “raising the bar on creativity, taking more risks, be more arresting and engaging, maybe test a little bit less.” “We’re realizing a lot of our brands have the right to play in a more emotional space than the rational territory we’ve mined in the past,” Mr. Miles said. In other words, fewer descriptions of how macaroni and cheese costs “about a dollar a box,” as one recent ad says, and more efforts to sell it as a fun food for adults who could use some fun in their lives. “We’re excited about finding avenues of growth to tap into the full potential of the brand,” said Alberto Huerta, senior marketing director for the meals business at Kraft. “Kids love us, but adults love us, too,” he added, “and there’s a lot of business to be had there.” In the first commercial, a son suggests that his father had “put me in time out” during dinner so the father could “scarf down” macaroni from the child’s plate. “Have you had enough?” the son, speaking like a grown-up, asks his father accusingly. In another spot, a daughter gripes as her mother eats off her plate as if the child were not noticing the theft. “The crime wave continues,” the daughter says in an adult voice. The creative agency for the campaign is the Boulder, Colo., office of Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky, the MDC Partners agency known for rule-breaking work for marketers like Burger King and Microsoft. Crispin Porter won the macaroni assignment in March from the longtime creative incumbent, DraftFCB in Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.  The assignment from Kraft was “to make the brand more of a family food,” said Rob Reilly, partner and chief creative officer at Crispin Porter, reflecting that although “it’s a favorite of kids, it’s not kid food.” But “the amazing job Kraft did marketing it to kids” meant that “adults felt they couldn’t eat it without feeling they were eating kid food,” Mr. Reilly said. So the campaign will borrow a page from the Frosted Flakes playbook and use humor to “unleash a little bit of permission,” he added, and let adults “say they love it.” “Sometimes, you’ve just got to enable it,” Mr. Reilly said, “and advertising is a great enabler.” The other agencies on the campaign are the Chicago office of Landor Associates, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam Brands division of WPP, for new packaging; the Chicago offices of two Publicis Groupe agencies, Digitas and Mediavest, for digital and media planning and buying; and Hunter Public Relations in New York.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/u-k-lawmakers-assail-kraft-for-cynical-ploy/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">British Lawmakers Accuse Kraft of 'Cynical Ploy'<date>April 6, 2010, 6:34 am</date><text>A bipartisan committee of British lawmakers published a report Tuesday in which it criticized Kraft Foods for, among other things, its decision to close the Cadbury plant in Somerdale after promising during the takeover battle to keep it open. Peter Luff, a Conservative M.P. and head of the business select committee, told DealBook that, before the deal was done, Kraft had only given a “partial account” of what it planned to do with Cadbury. “Everything flows from the way Kraft handled the Somerdale plant,” Mr. Luff said, adding that concerns were growing about Cadbury’s research and development facilities in Reading and Bourneville. The committee report asserts that “Kraft acted both irresponsibly and unwisely in making its original statement that it believed that it could keep the Somerdale factory open. By doing so, Kraft has left itself open to the charge that either it was incompetent in its approach to the Somerdale factory or that it used a ‘cynical ploy’ to improve its public image during its takeover of Cadbury.” While Kraft, a company known for centralizing operations, controls the fate of Cadbury and its various units, the British lawmakers hope to convince the U.S. company that it would do well to preserve Cadbury’s integrity, and Kraft’s image in Britain, by not shuttering plants. If the fallout from the Cadbury deal spreads, it may change how business is done in Britain. “The government and the Takeover Panel are considering a review of the rules and legislation governing takeovers in the U.K.,” the committee said. In light of the controversy that has followed the Cadbury deal, the Takeover Panel announced in February a consultation on certain aspects of the code, “to take account of changing market circumstances and practices.” Unlike the Financial Services Authority, the British securities regulator, the Takeover Panel does not have power to fine, but it can criticize a company involved in a takeover, either publicly or privately. “They tend to be taken fairly seriously,” said a source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not allowed to comment on such sanctions. While all aspects of the British takeover code are expected to be followed in a deal, Kraft’s actions on the Somerdale plant concern one aspect in particular. Rule 24.1, which covers the information the acquiring company must provide, says the firm must address “its intentions with regard to the continued employment of the employees and management of the offeree company and of its subsidiaries, including any material change in the conditions of employment.” –Chris V.

But that may be about to change. As birth rates and the consumer market shrink at home, food companies in Japan are increasing the pace of their overseas expansions and trying to improve promotion of their brands. Analysts say that increasing sales abroad is crucial for manufacturers. To do so, the companies are combining, undertaking joint ventures, cutting production costs and creating strategies for new markets. “The domestic market is shrinking, deflation is cutting into sales and the sense of crisis is looming stronger and stronger,” said Arihiro Muroya, a senior economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo, an organization affiliated with the leading Japanese agricultural lender, Norinchukin Bank. The sector’s strategy has been twofold. First, Japanese companies have been infiltrating the health food and condiment categories overseas with soy-based products like tofu in countries where few domestic companies can compete. Second, Japanese producers capitalize on cute Asian-themed characters like koalas and pandas and apply technology to make amusingly shaped treats to attract snack-happy consumers. The Japanese confectioner Ezaki Glico, for example, makes a chocolate-dipped stick-shaped cookie that is sold in Europe, through a joint venture with Kraft Foods, as the Mikado, and elsewhere as Pocky. Mikio Kusama, head of the global business division at Ezaki Glico, said that Mikado sales brought in 15 billion yen ($159 million) a year and that Mikado sales in Europe were growing about 10 percent year. Yakult Honsha, which says its Sofyl yogurts and Yakult fermented-milk drinks contain bacteria that aid digestion, now draws 25.7 percent of its 293 billion yen in annual revenue from overseas units, thanks to 38,000 “Yakult women” who sell the products door to door in Asia and Latin America. The company says it sells 6.5 billion units of Yakult and Sofyl a year outside Japan. “We want our product to be available virtually everywhere, like Coca-Cola, and make a contribution to the health of people around the world,” said Hiroshi Narita, director for the international department at Yakult Honsha. Ajinomoto, a leading Japanese food company, with about 1.2 trillion yen in annual revenue, has increased its overseas sales ratio to 31.8 percent, from 22.8 percent, in eight years. The company’s flagship product, the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate, sells widely in Asia, Latin America and Africa, with overseas sales leaping 80 percent in the last decade, the company said. By contrast, overall company sales in Japan show “a totally different story, growing just a few percentage points every year,” the chief executive, Masatoshi Ito, said. “The home market is a mature one, where we focus on rich, high-value-added goods.” In terms of expansion, Japan’s Asian neighbors offer the biggest opportunities. Countries like Thailand already embrace a Japanese food subculture, and in China, growing numbers of upwardly mobile workers are increasingly inclined to purchase prepared foods and snacks. The international survey firm Euromonitor says that the Lotte Group, a company in Tokyo that sells products in more than 70 countries, is the leading Asian-owned confectioner, with a 10.3 percent market share. The company, maker of Koala’s March — chocolate-filled koala-shaped cookies — ranks fourth in terms of sales among global companies in the Asian sector excluding Japan — ahead of Nestlé but behind Mars, Perfetti Van Melle and Cadbury. Despite quality concerns raised by the recent recalls by Toyota Motor, a scandal caused by the sale of expired dairy products and eggs at Fujiya confectionery in 2007 and the Snow Brand food-poisoning fiasco in 2000, Japanese food manufacturers express pride in the country’s technological expertise. Mr. Muroya, of the Norinchukin Institute, said that safety issues raised in the past had not erased the reputation for reliability that Japanese food companies had nurtured with customers in Asia and Latin America. “Just take the packaging technology,” he said. “The quality of printing, like pictures and letters, and the sealing technology are hard to match.” Ichiro Nakamura, spokesman for Lotte in Japan, said that the 400 versions of Koala’s March cookies — some smile and some cry, some hold musical instruments and some play sports — are much more challenging to manufacture than people might think. “We have a special technology that puffs up the koala-shaped cookies so there is hollow space inside where soft chocolate can be injected later,” Mr. Nakamura said. “And unless you have the right technology, the cookies are going to break easily when packed into boxes.” Mr. Kusama, of Ezaki Glico, is also proud of its Mikado-producing capabilities. “Big Western manufacturers go for mass production and low-cost efficiency,” he said. “I suppose the things we make are too costly and time-consuming for them.” In fact, the sales and marketing strengths of Western food companies far outweigh those of the Japanese. Kraft, for example, has gross sales of $50 billion a year, nearly 10 times as much as Lotte, which grossed about $5 billion in sales in its 2008 financial year. (Lotte has a South Korean affiliate with equal revenue, however.) Analysts and management consultants said that the struggle of the Japanese food companies to keep up with their Western rivals in overseas territories sounded familiar: Japanese companies that have higher-quality products are still sometimes hampered by weak marketing and brand strategies. Yoshizumi Nakano, a senior consultant at Funai Consulting in Tokyo, said that multinational consumer product companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola could attract talented personnel to their local sales networks, and that that translated into sizable local market share. “They employ the most talented people locally, pay them well and involve them dynamically in building local strategies,” he said. “For the Japanese firms, on the other hand, their overseas expansion is often just an extension of their home operation,” Mr. Nakano said. The local head is usually Japanese, he added, and is the only connection to the headquarters back home. Other local staff members, he said, often have little direct understanding of the company’s overall strategic direction. Kentaro Mori, managing director in Tokyo for the Boston Consulting Group, said: “Japanese firms may say, ‘We have superior products.’ That alone won’t do. You need sales and personnel who understand the trends of the local market, developers who will take the local taste into account and marketers who can explain the product to the locals on their terms.” “You need the whole package in order to win,” he said.</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/business/media/29adnewsletter2.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Q&amp;A With Stuart Elliott<date>Published: March 28, 2010</date><text>Q: (Reader)I always enjoy your advertising columns but never thought I’d find the answer to the mystery of “What is a Cert?” I laughed when I read your commentary in the article on Feb. 26 about the Four A’s conference. Many years ago, we received a roll of Certs is the mail, as did my neighbors, I suppose. What is this stuff someone is spending money to promote? I thought. Is it candy? A medicine tablet? A cure for hiccups? It landed in the wastebasket, but lingers in my memory as a supreme example of stupid advertisers throwing away money to lure customers to buy a mystery product. My husband, an academic type, thinks almost all advertising is worthless, so we have arguments on the subject now and then. Sometimes I actually see a clever commercial, but the Certs incident reinforces his view. Recently, another mystery product turned up: RedPlum. It is headlined in the coupon advertising section of a weekly paper. Is it a new beverage? Reformulated jam? A juicy chick-lit novel? I’ll never know. A: (Stuart Elliott) Dear reader, if you keep reading, you’ll know. RedPlum appears as the headline of the coupon ad section because it is the name of the section. Valassis Communications, which distributes cents-off coupons and other value offers for marketers, introduced the RedPlum name in December 2007. The brand appears in newspapers, online, in the mail, in stores and in circulars delivered to homes and apartments. Valassis has recently started advertising RedPlum directly to consumers in magazine ads that suggest visiting redplum.com to find “offers on groceries, fashion, dining out and more.” I’m thinking that if the Internet had been around when you received your Certs in the mail, you could have looked it up online and found out more about it. Certs, which was brought out in 1956, is still around, by the way, and became part of Kraft Foods when Kraft recently acquired Cadbury, whose Cadbury Adams unit sells Certs. Q: (Two Readers) This is in reference to the question last week about a commercial for cat food that was directed at cats. Your reader did not remember the brand, and even wondered whether there was actually such a commercial or if it was some Madison Avenue version of an urban legend. The commercial was for Whiskas cat food and can be watched on YouTube. The spot, which ran in Britain, was written about in Newsweek in February 1999. A: (Stuart Elliott) Thanks, dear readers, for tracking that down.</text></article><article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/business/08adnewsletter1.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">This Brand Doesn’t Mind Being in the Soup<date>Published: March 8, 2010</date><text>The world was treated to a terrific game when the United States and Canadian hockey teams played each other at the Winter Olympics. But Canadians and Americans can cooperate, too, as demonstrated by a campaign for a venerable brand.The campaign, from the Nabisco division of Kraft Foods, promotes the ability of Premium saltine crackers to liven up a prosaic bowl of soup. The campaign began last fall in Canada and arrived in this country last month, with some changes. For instance, the gold medals in the ads had to be replaced with silver ones. (Just kidding, American hockey fans.) Actually, the major modification was a switch in songs in the television commercial that is the centerpiece of the campaign, replacing a Canadian rock tune with one better known to Americans. The campaign originated with a Canadian agency that works for Kraft, Sharpe Blackmore Euro RSCG in Toronto, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas. It was adapted for the United States by the Euro RSCG office in New York. The commercial represents the first time that Premium has been advertised on television to American consumers since 1986. In Canada, where Kraft sells its crackers and cookies under the Christie name, Premium Plus, as the brand is called in that country, had returned to TV in February 2008 after a hiatus of almost 20 years, the Canadian trade publication Marketing reported. Whichever country the cracker is crumbled in, the campaign is indicative of how marketers of consumer packaged goods are paying additional attention to their vintage brands. Those efforts have accelerated since the Great Recession began in late 2007, as consumers started trying to save money by eating out less and at home more. Many of those consumers are turning to familiar products to stay within their newly narrowed budgets, among them Betty Crocker cake mixes, Campbell’s soups, Del Monte vegetables, Heinz ketchup, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Hormel chili, Jif peanut butter, Kellogg’s cereals and Swanson frozen dinners. Kraft Foods is emblematic of the trend, as the company brings out new campaigns for its older products, redesigns their packages and freshens them up with line extensions and new flavors. There have been numerous changes in the agency assignments for those brands, too, as Kraft shuffles creative accounts. In addition to Premium, Kraft brands that are being readied again for their close-ups include Jell-O, Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Kraft Philadelphia cream cheese, Kraft Singles, Oscar Mayer, Planters snacks and Nabisco products like Oreo, Ritz and Wheat Thins. And this week, another Nabisco product, Triscuit, will introduce a campaign by Euro RSCG New York that encourages consumers to consider home farming. “When you plant a seed, you grow a movement,” the headline of a print advertisement asserts. A section of the Triscuit Web site is being devoted to information about home farming and an organization, Urban Farming. There will be grants for sustainability programs through Future Farmers of America. And four million Triscuit packages will include cards of basil and dill seeds, which can be planted at home for herb gardens. One reason mainstay brands are faring well in the weak economy is “their very strong connection with consumers built around trust and heritage,” says Scott Christensen, Premium brand manager at the Nabisco division of Kraft Foods in East Hanover, N.J. “This idea of reliability, a product that’s comforting and nurturing,” is strong during tumultuous times, he adds. “Consumers are returning to products and brands they know and trust.” In the last couple of years, there has been a “resurgence” of Premium, Mr. Christensen says, which is the market-share leader in the saltine-cracker category, based “on the budget-friendly idea.” “As the economy as receded, people value our offering more,” he adds, citing a “positive growth trend, in the low to mid single digit” percentages, for the saltine category in general and Premium in particular. “That’s pretty significant,” Mr. Christensen says, “since saltines is a mature category.” Indeed. The product dates to the early 1800s, when it was called soda crackers, and Premium -- which has the majority of the saltine market in the United States, according to Mr. Christensen — was introduced in 1876. Other major saltine brands include Sunshine Krispy, Keebler Zesta and Keebler Export Sodas, all sold by the Kellogg Company. There are also myriad saltines sold under private-label and store-brand names. Research determined that there was “a prime opportunity,” Mr. Christensen says, “to strengthen the connection with consumers around the idea of Premium saltines and soup.” “It works on multiple levels,” he explains: “There’s the budget-friendly component. It’s a familiar occasion for consumers. And it’s very comforting.”</text></article><article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/business/25tomatoes.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Bribes Let Tomato Vendor Sell Tainted Food<date>Published: February 24, 2010</date><text>Robert Watson, a top ingredient buyer for Kraft Foods, needed $20,000 to pay his taxes. So he called a broker for a California tomato processor that for years had been paying him bribes to get its products into Kraft’s plants. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Illustration by The New York Times Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Safeway Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » The check would soon be in the mail, the broker promised. “We’ll have to deduct it out of your commissions as we move forward,” he said, using a euphemism for bribes. Days later, federal agents descended on Kraft’s offices near Chicago and confronted Mr. Watson. He admitted his role in a bribery scheme that has laid bare a startling vein of corruption in the food industry. And because the scheme also involved millions of pounds of tomato products with high levels of mold or other defects, the case has raised serious questions about how well food manufacturers safeguard the quality of their ingredients. Over the last 14 months, Mr. Watson and three other purchasing managers, at Frito-Lay, Safeway and B&amp;G Foods, have pleaded guilty to taking bribes. Five people connected to one of the nation’s largest tomato processors, SK Foods, have also admitted taking part in the scheme. Now, federal prosecutors in California have taken aim at the owner of SK Foods, who they say spearheaded the far-reaching plot. The man, Frederick Scott Salyer, was arrested at Kennedy Airport in New York City on Feb. 4 after getting off a flight from Switzerland. He was indicted last week on racketeering, fraud and obstruction of justice charges. The scheme, as laid out by federal prosecutors, has two parts. Officials say that Mr. Salyer and others at SK Foods greased the palms of a handful of corporate buyers in exchange for lucrative contracts and confidential information on bids submitted by competitors. This most likely drove up ingredient prices for the big food companies. In addition, prosecutors say that for years, SK Foods shipped its customers millions of pounds of bulk tomato paste and puree that fell short of basic quality standards  with falsified documentation to mask the problems. Often that meant mold counts so high the sale should have been prohibited under federal law; at other times it involved breaching specifications in the sales contracts, such as acidity levels or the age of the product. The scope of the tainted shipments was much broader than the bribery scheme, touching more than 55 companies. In some cases, companies detected problems and sent the products back  but in many cases, according to prosecutors, they did not, and the tainted ingredients wound up in food sold to consumers. Prosecutors said that no one was sickened by the mold-tainted products and that they were not a health risk. Benjamin B. Wagner, the United States attorney in Sacramento, whose office has led the investigation, said he was also looking at allegations of collusion and price fixing involving SK Foods and other tomato processors. “If you have a couple of people who are willing to bend the rules and they set that tone from the top, that can spread very quickly in that company and in that niche of the industry, and that’s what happened here,” Mr. Wagner said. Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Mr. Salyer, said his client had done nothing wrong. “The allegations against Mr. Salyer are unsupported except by individuals who have pled guilty and who are seeking a personal benefit in the sentencing process,” Mr. Segal said. Randy W. Worobo, an associate professor of food microbiology at Cornell University, said companies should learn from the SK Foods case that they must do a better job of monitoring their ingredients. “There’s been a lot of hype about inferior-quality products being made in China and then sold to the U.S. consumer,” Mr. Worobo said. “This is exactly the same thing, but it’s based in the U.S.” Prosecutors say that Mr. Salyer ran the fraud along with Randall Rahal, a New Jersey businessman who acted as a broker for SK Foods, negotiating deals with many of the firm’s largest customers. It was Mr. Rahal who made the contacts with the four buyers who took bribes. He was caught on a wiretap in April 2008, promising to help Mr. Watson with his tax payment, according to court papers. In another conversation, reported by a witness, Mr. Rahal explained the art of ascertaining whether a person would be susceptible to bribery. According to court papers, Mr. Rahal recounted how he would drop a $100 bill on the floor, then bend to pick it up, saying: “You must have dropped this. Is it yours?” If the person said yes, Mr. Rahal considered him receptive. Mr. Rahal pleaded guilty to racketeering, price fixing and money laundering charges in December 2008 and has been cooperating with investigators. His lawyer, Christopher D. Adams of New Jersey, did not respond to requests for comment. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 25, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.Robert Watson, a top ingredient buyer for Kraft Foods, needed $20,000 to pay his taxes.

Wagner, the United States attorney in Sacramento, whose office has led the investigation, said he was also looking at allegations of collusion and price fixing involving SK Foods and other tomato processors. “If you have a couple of people who are willing to bend the rules and they set that tone from the top, that can spread very quickly in that company and in that niche of the industry, and that’s what happened here,” Mr. Wagner said. Malcolm Segal, a lawyer for Mr. Salyer, said his client had done nothing wrong. “The allegations against Mr. Salyer are unsupported except by individuals who have pled guilty and who are seeking a personal benefit in the sentencing process,” Mr. Segal said. Randy W. Worobo, an associate professor of food microbiology at Cornell University, said companies should learn from the SK Foods case that they must do a better job of monitoring their ingredients. “There’s been a lot of hype about inferior-quality products being made in China and then sold to the U.S. consumer,” Mr. Worobo said. “This is exactly the same thing, but it’s based in the U.S.” Prosecutors say that Mr. Salyer ran the fraud along with Randall Rahal, a New Jersey businessman who acted as a broker for SK Foods, negotiating deals with many of the firm’s largest customers. It was Mr. Rahal who made the contacts with the four buyers who took bribes. He was caught on a wiretap in April 2008, promising to help Mr. Watson with his tax payment, according to court papers. In another conversation, reported by a witness, Mr. Rahal explained the art of ascertaining whether a person would be susceptible to bribery. According to court papers, Mr. Rahal recounted how he would drop a $100 bill on the floor, then bend to pick it up, saying: “You must have dropped this. Is it yours?” If the person said yes, Mr. Rahal considered him receptive. Mr. Rahal pleaded guilty to racketeering, price fixing and money laundering charges in December 2008 and has been cooperating with investigators. His lawyer, Christopher D. Adams of New Jersey, did not respond to requests for comment. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/06/u-k-lawmakers-assail-kraft-for-cynical-ploy/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">British Lawmakers Accuse Kraft of 'Cynical Ploy'<date>April 6, 2010, 6:34 am</date><text>A bipartisan committee of British lawmakers published a report Tuesday in which it criticized Kraft Foods for, among other things, its decision to close the Cadbury plant in Somerdale after promising during the takeover battle to keep it open. Peter Luff, a Conservative M.P. and head of the business select committee, told DealBook that, before the deal was done, Kraft had only given a “partial account” of what it planned to do with Cadbury. “Everything flows from the way Kraft handled the Somerdale plant,” Mr. Luff said, adding that concerns were growing about Cadbury’s research and development facilities in Reading and Bourneville. The committee report asserts that “Kraft acted both irresponsibly and unwisely in making its original statement that it believed that it could keep the Somerdale factory open. By doing so, Kraft has left itself open to the charge that either it was incompetent in its approach to the Somerdale factory or that it used a ‘cynical ploy’ to improve its public image during its takeover of Cadbury.” While Kraft, a company known for centralizing operations, controls the fate of Cadbury and its various units, the British lawmakers hope to convince the U.S. company that it would do well to preserve Cadbury’s integrity, and Kraft’s image in Britain, by not shuttering plants. If the fallout from the Cadbury deal spreads, it may change how business is done in Britain. “The government and the Takeover Panel are considering a review of the rules and legislation governing takeovers in the U.K.,” the committee said. In light of the controversy that has followed the Cadbury deal, the Takeover Panel announced in February a consultation on certain aspects of the code, “to take account of changing market circumstances and practices.” Unlike the Financial Services Authority, the British securities regulator, the Takeover Panel does not have power to fine, but it can criticize a company involved in a takeover, either publicly or privately. “They tend to be taken fairly seriously,” said a source familiar with the matter, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not allowed to comment on such sanctions. While all aspects of the British takeover code are expected to be followed in a deal, Kraft’s actions on the Somerdale plant concern one aspect in particular. Rule 24.1, which covers the information the acquiring company must provide, says the firm must address “its intentions with regard to the continued employment of the employees and management of the offeree company and of its subsidiaries, including any material change in the conditions of employment.” –Chris V.

But that may be about to change. As birth rates and the consumer market shrink at home, food companies in Japan are increasing the pace of their overseas expansions and trying to improve promotion of their brands. Analysts say that increasing sales abroad is crucial for manufacturers. To do so, the companies are combining, undertaking joint ventures, cutting production costs and creating strategies for new markets. “The domestic market is shrinking, deflation is cutting into sales and the sense of crisis is looming stronger and stronger,” said Arihiro Muroya, a senior economist at Norinchukin Research Institute in Tokyo, an organization affiliated with the leading Japanese agricultural lender, Norinchukin Bank. The sector’s strategy has been twofold. First, Japanese companies have been infiltrating the health food and condiment categories overseas with soy-based products like tofu in countries where few domestic companies can compete. Second, Japanese producers capitalize on cute Asian-themed characters like koalas and pandas and apply technology to make amusingly shaped treats to attract snack-happy consumers. The Japanese confectioner Ezaki Glico, for example, makes a chocolate-dipped stick-shaped cookie that is sold in Europe, through a joint venture with Kraft Foods, as the Mikado, and elsewhere as Pocky. Mikio Kusama, head of the global business division at Ezaki Glico, said that Mikado sales brought in 15 billion yen ($159 million) a year and that Mikado sales in Europe were growing about 10 percent year. Yakult Honsha, which says its Sofyl yogurts and Yakult fermented-milk drinks contain bacteria that aid digestion, now draws 25.7 percent of its 293 billion yen in annual revenue from overseas units, thanks to 38,000 “Yakult women” who sell the products door to door in Asia and Latin America. The company says it sells 6.5 billion units of Yakult and Sofyl a year outside Japan. “We want our product to be available virtually everywhere, like Coca-Cola, and make a contribution to the health of people around the world,” said Hiroshi Narita, director for the international department at Yakult Honsha. Ajinomoto, a leading Japanese food company, with about 1.2 trillion yen in annual revenue, has increased its overseas sales ratio to 31.8 percent, from 22.8 percent, in eight years. The company’s flagship product, the flavor enhancer monosodium glutamate, sells widely in Asia, Latin America and Africa, with overseas sales leaping 80 percent in the last decade, the company said. By contrast, overall company sales in Japan show “a totally different story, growing just a few percentage points every year,” the chief executive, Masatoshi Ito, said. “The home market is a mature one, where we focus on rich, high-value-added goods.” In terms of expansion, Japan’s Asian neighbors offer the biggest opportunities. Countries like Thailand already embrace a Japanese food subculture, and in China, growing numbers of upwardly mobile workers are increasingly inclined to purchase prepared foods and snacks. The international survey firm Euromonitor says that the Lotte Group, a company in Tokyo that sells products in more than 70 countries, is the leading Asian-owned confectioner, with a 10.3 percent market share. The company, maker of Koala’s March — chocolate-filled koala-shaped cookies — ranks fourth in terms of sales among global companies in the Asian sector excluding Japan — ahead of Nestlé but behind Mars, Perfetti Van Melle and Cadbury. Despite quality concerns raised by the recent recalls by Toyota Motor, a scandal caused by the sale of expired dairy products and eggs at Fujiya confectionery in 2007 and the Snow Brand food-poisoning fiasco in 2000, Japanese food manufacturers express pride in the country’s technological expertise. Mr. Muroya, of the Norinchukin Institute, said that safety issues raised in the past had not erased the reputation for reliability that Japanese food companies had nurtured with customers in Asia and Latin America. “Just take the packaging technology,” he said. “The quality of printing, like pictures and letters, and the sealing technology are hard to match.” Ichiro Nakamura, spokesman for Lotte in Japan, said that the 400 versions of Koala’s March cookies — some smile and some cry, some hold musical instruments and some play sports — are much more challenging to manufacture than people might think. “We have a special technology that puffs up the koala-shaped cookies so there is hollow space inside where soft chocolate can be injected later,” Mr. Nakamura said. “And unless you have the right technology, the cookies are going to break easily when packed into boxes.” Mr. Kusama, of Ezaki Glico, is also proud of its Mikado-producing capabilities. “Big Western manufacturers go for mass production and low-cost efficiency,” he said. “I suppose the things we make are too costly and time-consuming for them.” In fact, the sales and marketing strengths of Western food companies far outweigh those of the Japanese. Kraft, for example, has gross sales of $50 billion a year, nearly 10 times as much as Lotte, which grossed about $5 billion in sales in its 2008 financial year. (Lotte has a South Korean affiliate with equal revenue, however.) Analysts and management consultants said that the struggle of the Japanese food companies to keep up with their Western rivals in overseas territories sounded familiar: Japanese companies that have higher-quality products are still sometimes hampered by weak marketing and brand strategies. Yoshizumi Nakano, a senior consultant at Funai Consulting in Tokyo, said that multinational consumer product companies like Procter &amp; Gamble and Coca-Cola could attract talented personnel to their local sales networks, and that that translated into sizable local market share. “They employ the most talented people locally, pay them well and involve them dynamically in building local strategies,” he said. “For the Japanese firms, on the other hand, their overseas expansion is often just an extension of their home operation,” Mr. Nakano said. The local head is usually Japanese, he added, and is the only connection to the headquarters back home. Other local staff members, he said, often have little direct understanding of the company’s overall strategic direction. Kentaro Mori, managing director in Tokyo for the Boston Consulting Group, said: “Japanese firms may say, ‘We have superior products.’ That alone won’t do. You need sales and personnel who understand the trends of the local market, developers who will take the local taste into account and marketers who can explain the product to the locals on their terms.” “You need the whole package in order to win,” he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/business/media/29adnewsletter2.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Q&amp;A With Stuart Elliott<date>Published: March 28, 2010</date><text>Q: (Reader)I always enjoy your advertising columns but never thought I’d find the answer to the mystery of “What is a Cert?” I laughed when I read your commentary in the article on Feb. 26 about the Four A’s conference. Many years ago, we received a roll of Certs is the mail, as did my neighbors, I suppose. What is this stuff someone is spending money to promote? I thought. Is it candy? A medicine tablet? A cure for hiccups? It landed in the wastebasket, but lingers in my memory as a supreme example of stupid advertisers throwing away money to lure customers to buy a mystery product. My husband, an academic type, thinks almost all advertising is worthless, so we have arguments on the subject now and then. Sometimes I actually see a clever commercial, but the Certs incident reinforces his view. Recently, another mystery product turned up: RedPlum. It is headlined in the coupon advertising section of a weekly paper. Is it a new beverage? Reformulated jam? A juicy chick-lit novel? I’ll never know. A: (Stuart Elliott) Dear reader, if you keep reading, you’ll know. RedPlum appears as the headline of the coupon ad section because it is the name of the section. Valassis Communications, which distributes cents-off coupons and other value offers for marketers, introduced the RedPlum name in December 2007. The brand appears in newspapers, online, in the mail, in stores and in circulars delivered to homes and apartments. Valassis has recently started advertising RedPlum directly to consumers in magazine ads that suggest visiting redplum.com to find “offers on groceries, fashion, dining out and more.” I’m thinking that if the Internet had been around when you received your Certs in the mail, you could have looked it up online and found out more about it. Certs, which was brought out in 1956, is still around, by the way, and became part of Kraft Foods when Kraft recently acquired Cadbury, whose Cadbury Adams unit sells Certs. Q: (Two Readers) This is in reference to the question last week about a commercial for cat food that was directed at cats. Your reader did not remember the brand, and even wondered whether there was actually such a commercial or if it was some Madison Avenue version of an urban legend. The commercial was for Whiskas cat food and can be watched on YouTube. The spot, which ran in Britain, was written about in Newsweek in February 1999. A: (Stuart Elliott) Thanks, dear readers, for tracking that down.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/08/business/08adnewsletter1.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">This Brand Doesn’t Mind Being in the Soup<date>Published: March 8, 2010</date><text>The world was treated to a terrific game when the United States and Canadian hockey teams played each other at the Winter Olympics. But Canadians and Americans can cooperate, too, as demonstrated by a campaign for a venerable brand.The campaign, from the Nabisco division of Kraft Foods, promotes the ability of Premium saltine crackers to liven up a prosaic bowl of soup. The campaign began last fall in Canada and arrived in this country last month, with some changes. For instance, the gold medals in the ads had to be replaced with silver ones. (Just kidding, American hockey fans.) Actually, the major modification was a switch in songs in the television commercial that is the centerpiece of the campaign, replacing a Canadian rock tune with one better known to Americans. The campaign originated with a Canadian agency that works for Kraft, Sharpe Blackmore Euro RSCG in Toronto, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas. It was adapted for the United States by the Euro RSCG office in New York. The commercial represents the first time that Premium has been advertised on television to American consumers since 1986. In Canada, where Kraft sells its crackers and cookies under the Christie name, Premium Plus, as the brand is called in that country, had returned to TV in February 2008 after a hiatus of almost 20 years, the Canadian trade publication Marketing reported. Whichever country the cracker is crumbled in, the campaign is indicative of how marketers of consumer packaged goods are paying additional attention to their vintage brands. Those efforts have accelerated since the Great Recession began in late 2007, as consumers started trying to save money by eating out less and at home more. Many of those consumers are turning to familiar products to stay within their newly narrowed budgets, among them Betty Crocker cake mixes, Campbell’s soups, Del Monte vegetables, Heinz ketchup, Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Hormel chili, Jif peanut butter, Kellogg’s cereals and Swanson frozen dinners. Kraft Foods is emblematic of the trend, as the company brings out new campaigns for its older products, redesigns their packages and freshens them up with line extensions and new flavors. There have been numerous changes in the agency assignments for those brands, too, as Kraft shuffles creative accounts. In addition to Premium, Kraft brands that are being readied again for their close-ups include Jell-O, Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Kraft Philadelphia cream cheese, Kraft Singles, Oscar Mayer, Planters snacks and Nabisco products like Oreo, Ritz and Wheat Thins. And this week, another Nabisco product, Triscuit, will introduce a campaign by Euro RSCG New York that encourages consumers to consider home farming. “When you plant a seed, you grow a movement,” the headline of a print advertisement asserts. A section of the Triscuit Web site is being devoted to information about home farming and an organization, Urban Farming. There will be grants for sustainability programs through Future Farmers of America. And four million Triscuit packages will include cards of basil and dill seeds, which can be planted at home for herb gardens. One reason mainstay brands are faring well in the weak economy is “their very strong connection with consumers built around trust and heritage,” says Scott Christensen, Premium brand manager at the Nabisco division of Kraft Foods in East Hanover, N.J. “This idea of reliability, a product that’s comforting and nurturing,” is strong during tumultuous times, he adds. “Consumers are returning to products and brands they know and trust.” In the last couple of years, there has been a “resurgence” of Premium, Mr. Christensen says, which is the market-share leader in the saltine-cracker category, based “on the budget-friendly idea.” “As the economy as receded, people value our offering more,” he adds, citing a “positive growth trend, in the low to mid single digit” percentages, for the saltine category in general and Premium in particular. “That’s pretty significant,” Mr. Christensen says, “since saltines is a mature category.” Indeed. The product dates to the early 1800s, when it was called soda crackers, and Premium -- which has the majority of the saltine market in the United States, according to Mr. Christensen — was introduced in 1876. Other major saltine brands include Sunshine Krispy, Keebler Zesta and Keebler Export Sodas, all sold by the Kellogg Company. There are also myriad saltines sold under private-label and store-brand names. Research determined that there was “a prime opportunity,” Mr. Christensen says, “to strengthen the connection with consumers around the idea of Premium saltines and soup.” “It works on multiple levels,” he explains: “There’s the budget-friendly component. It’s a familiar occasion for consumers. And it’s very comforting.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/25/business/25tomatoes.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Bribes Let Tomato Vendor Sell Tainted Food<date>Published: February 24, 2010</date><text>Robert Watson, a top ingredient buyer for Kraft Foods, needed $20,000 to pay his taxes. So he called a broker for a California tomato processor that for years had been paying him bribes to get its products into Kraft’s plants.

Days later, federal agents descended on Kraft’s offices near Chicago and confronted Mr. Watson. He admitted his role in a bribery scheme that has laid bare a startling vein of corruption in the food industry. And because the scheme also involved millions of pounds of tomato products with high levels of mold or other defects, the case has raised serious questions about how well food manufacturers safeguard the quality of their ingredients. Over the last 14 months, Mr. Watson and three other purchasing managers, at Frito-Lay, Safeway and B&amp;G Foods, have pleaded guilty to taking bribes. Five people connected to one of the nation’s largest tomato processors, SK Foods, have also admitted taking part in the scheme. Now, federal prosecutors in California have taken aim at the owner of SK Foods, who they say spearheaded the far-reaching plot. The man, Frederick Scott Salyer, was arrested at Kennedy Airport in New York City on Feb. 4 after getting off a flight from Switzerland. He was indicted last week on racketeering, fraud and obstruction of justice charges. The scheme, as laid out by federal prosecutors, has two parts. Officials say that Mr. Salyer and others at SK Foods greased the palms of a handful of corporate buyers in exchange for lucrative contracts and confidential information on bids submitted by competitors. This most likely drove up ingredient prices for the big food companies. In addition, prosecutors say that for years, SK Foods shipped its customers millions of pounds of bulk tomato paste and puree that fell short of basic quality standards  with falsified documentation to mask the problems. Often that meant mold counts so high the sale should have been prohibited under federal law; at other times it involved breaching specifications in the sales contracts, such as acidity levels or the age of the product. The scope of the tainted shipments was much broader than the bribery scheme, touching more than 55 companies. In some cases, companies detected problems and sent the products back  but in many cases, according to prosecutors, they did not, and the tainted ingredients wound up in food sold to consumers. Prosecutors said that no one was sickened by the mold-tainted products and that they were not a health risk. Benjamin B.

Yet debt investors handed over $9.5 billion to the food conglomerate on one of the gummiest days in the markets for ages. Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief, shouldn’t take this confidence, however, as a robust validation of her acquisition strategy. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Carl Court/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Dresdner Bank once owned Giacometti's “Walking Man I,” sold at auction Wednesday in London for a record price. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Dresdner Bank AG Go to your Portfolio » Shares of the maker of Cheez Whiz and other products are stuck at around $28  down from this year’s high but modestly better than the $27 or so during Kraft’s dogged courtship of Cadbury. That’s not surprising given the public lashing that Warren E. Buffett, the company’s top shareholder, gave Kraft over the price paid for Cadbury. But bond investors may be in a different boat, as evidenced by the alacrity with which they snapped up Kraft’s bonds while global markets were in free fall. Though Kraft had to pay up to get the huge deal done, the fundraising goes a long way to paying off the $11.2 billion that banks lent the company to bridge the deal. This, however, had more to do with particularities in the bond market than a ringing endorsement of a marriage of the seller of Velveeta cheese with the maker of Dairy Milk chocolate. First, Kraft hadn’t tapped the market in more than a year, so investors hankering for household names like Kraft were hungry. Second, investors around the world are looking for stable places to put their money amid growing concerns that more recent optimism in financial markets may have been misplaced. There are few sectors more defensive in tougher times, or when inflation spikes, than food. Finally, the debt travails of countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal, coupled with soaring budget deficits in the developed world, are encouraging some investors to put their money with quality companies rather than troubled nations. Overseas investors, particularly from Asia, were keen to get a piece of the deal, bankers said. This demand, of course, could change if worries about the global economy deepen. Then, money could be rerouted back to the traditional safe harbors like Treasuries. But Kraft, with its Cadbury deal financed, won’t have to worry about that. Nonwalking Assets Dresdner Bank learned a thing or two about men walking over the years. The bank tried to buy its way into the City of London and Wall Street by acquiring investment banks. Shortly thereafter, bankers at both firms walked out the door. But where Dresdner failed in commerce it appears, belatedly, to have triumphed in art. The sale of a bronze entitled “Walking Man I” by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti fetched £65 million ($104.3 million), on Wednesday night in London, a record for a work of art at auction. Dresdner bought the piece in 1990 for a price that is said to have been in the single-digit millions. The result compares favorably with other shopping excursions undertaken over the years by Dresdner, which last year was sold by the German insurer Allianz to Commerzbank. The first of these big splashes was its 1995 acquisition of Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank founded in 1786. Dresdner paid $1.5 billion for the firm, which at the time held a strong position in British stock brokerage and mergers and acquisitions. That position eroded as rainmakers decamped. Dresdner did add some foreign exchange and fixed income trading businesses, which it still maintains. But the British brokerage and M.&amp; A. arms were eventually closed. Some 20 years after picking up the Giacometti, which was originally intended to appear in Chase Manhattan’s downtown Manhattan lobby, Dresdner went shopping in New York.

Yet debt investors handed over $9.5 billion to the food conglomerate on one of the gummiest days in the markets for ages. Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief, shouldn’t take this confidence, however, as a robust validation of her acquisition strategy. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Carl Court/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Dresdner Bank once owned Giacometti's “Walking Man I,” sold at auction Wednesday in London for a record price. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Dresdner Bank AG Go to your Portfolio » Shares of the maker of Cheez Whiz and other products are stuck at around $28  down from this year’s high but modestly better than the $27 or so during Kraft’s dogged courtship of Cadbury. That’s not surprising given the public lashing that Warren E. Buffett, the company’s top shareholder, gave Kraft over the price paid for Cadbury. But bond investors may be in a different boat, as evidenced by the alacrity with which they snapped up Kraft’s bonds while global markets were in free fall. Though Kraft had to pay up to get the huge deal done, the fundraising goes a long way to paying off the $11.2 billion that banks lent the company to bridge the deal. This, however, had more to do with particularities in the bond market than a ringing endorsement of a marriage of the seller of Velveeta cheese with the maker of Dairy Milk chocolate. First, Kraft hadn’t tapped the market in more than a year, so investors hankering for household names like Kraft were hungry. Second, investors around the world are looking for stable places to put their money amid growing concerns that more recent optimism in financial markets may have been misplaced. There are few sectors more defensive in tougher times, or when inflation spikes, than food. Finally, the debt travails of countries like Greece, Spain and Portugal, coupled with soaring budget deficits in the developed world, are encouraging some investors to put their money with quality companies rather than troubled nations. Overseas investors, particularly from Asia, were keen to get a piece of the deal, bankers said. This demand, of course, could change if worries about the global economy deepen. Then, money could be rerouted back to the traditional safe harbors like Treasuries. But Kraft, with its Cadbury deal financed, won’t have to worry about that. Nonwalking Assets Dresdner Bank learned a thing or two about men walking over the years. The bank tried to buy its way into the City of London and Wall Street by acquiring investment banks. Shortly thereafter, bankers at both firms walked out the door. But where Dresdner failed in commerce it appears, belatedly, to have triumphed in art. The sale of a bronze entitled “Walking Man I” by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti fetched £65 million ($104.3 million), on Wednesday night in London, a record for a work of art at auction. Dresdner bought the piece in 1990 for a price that is said to have been in the single-digit millions. The result compares favorably with other shopping excursions undertaken over the years by Dresdner, which last year was sold by the German insurer Allianz to Commerzbank. The first of these big splashes was its 1995 acquisition of Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank founded in 1786. Dresdner paid $1.5 billion for the firm, which at the time held a strong position in British stock brokerage and mergers and acquisitions. That position eroded as rainmakers decamped. Dresdner did add some foreign exchange and fixed income trading businesses, which it still maintains. But the British brokerage and M.&amp; A. arms were eventually closed. Some 20 years after picking up the Giacometti, which was originally intended to appear in Chase Manhattan’s downtown Manhattan lobby, Dresdner went shopping in New York. In 2000 it paid $1.4 billion for Wasserstein Perella, the advisory boutique set up by Bruce Wasserstein, and added in another $200 million to retain its talent. Mr. Wasserstein and his team left within a year. Add up the cost of these deals, and adjust for inflation, and it seems that Dresdner splashed out around $4 billion for assets that arguably are worth a few pennies on the dollar now. Had the bank invested more in assets incapable of walking out, it might have more to show for it.

Kraft said in a press release that as of Tuesday morning, its tender offer for Cadbury shares was accepted by 71.73 percent of the target company’s shareholders, following the recommendation of Cadbury’s board. Shareholders had until 1 p.m. U.T.C. Tuesday to tender their shares, although Kraft said that it would keep the offer open for the time being. Once the tender offer’s acceptance rate hits 75 percent, Kraft said it would apply to delist Cadbury from the London Stock Exchange. Later on Tuesday, Kraft’s chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, is scheduled to meet with Britain’s business secretary, Peter Mandelson, to discuss how to preserve as many British jobs as possible. “The government will be looking for reassurance from Kraft as to the commitments they have made to the work force and the U.K. operations,” a spokesman for Mr. Mandelson told Reuters. Last month, Kraft struck a deal for Cadbury, winning the British confectioner over after an often-heated battle. Cadbury’s management derided Kraft as a low-growth giant and sought to rally British politicians and unions to help block the American food giant’s bid. But Kraft agreed to sweeten its proposal, offering Cadbury shareholders 500 pence cash and 0.1874 new Kraft shares for each share of the British confectioner. To Kraft, winning Cadbury would help bolster its growth prospects, especially in developing countries from Brazil to India. “Together we have impressive global reach and an unrivaled portfolio of iconic brands, with tremendous growth potential,” Ms. Rosenfeld said in a statement. “This combined company has a phenomenal future, and I firmly believe it will deliver outstanding returns to our shareholders.” Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/opinion/25mon4.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Big Food<date>Published: January 24, 2010</date><text>As huge corporations merge and get even huger, we find ourselves yearning for some old-fashioned competition, and maybe a little diversity.

The announcement again raises questions of how the 106-year-old American chocolate giant will expand beyond its home market. Analysts have said that a merger with Cadbury would have helped Hershey expand into developing markets like India and Russia. Under British takeover law, Hershey had until Monday to declare its intentions for Cadbury. Shares in Hershey rose 1 percent, to $36.58, in early morning trading Friday. Hershey had twice before sought unsuccessfully to merge with Cadbury, whose products it distributes in the United States. Before Tuesday’s deal with Kraft, Cadbury’s management had suggested that it would prefer a deal with a fellow confectioner, rather than a low-growth food conglomerate. A bid for Cadbury would have posed some risks for Hershey, mostly financial: the American company has only a fraction of Kraft’s market value, making it harder to pay the sort of price Cadbury had been seeking. Still, Hershey had been working with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to raise more than $10 billion in debt financing, according to people briefed on the matter. Its controlling shareholder, a charitable trust that oversees a school for underprivileged children, had retained Byron D. Trott, a former Goldman Sachs banker long known as the longtime adviser to Warren E. Buffett, to raise money as well, these people said. Among the company’s considerations was holding onto its investment-grade credit rating, as well as preventing an over-dilution of its shareholders, especially the Hershey Trust. Yet proponents of the deal within the company and the board argued that losing out to Kraft would relegate Hershey to a domestic niche. Representatives for Cadbury had held back-channel talks with Hershey, offering some guidance on what would constitute an acceptable bid, people briefed on the matter said, in an effort to stoke a competitive auction. Hershey had also briefly held talks with Ferrero, the Italian maker of Nutella, over a potential joint bid. Hershey may have at least scored a small victory by helping to prod a higher Kraft bid, one that earned the disapproval of the bigger company’s most notable shareholder: Mr. Buffett. – Michael J. de la Merced Go to Hershey Press Release »</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/21views.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Why Bankers Tend to Hoard<date>Published: January 21, 2010</date><text>The big gap between short- and long-term interest rates should mean fat lending profits for American banks. But some, like Wells Fargo, are wary of rising interest rates. Higher rates overall might encourage them to lend, but simultaneously could reduce their capacity to do so. It’s a tricky problem. Skip to next paragraph James Estrin/The New York Times John G. Stumpf, head of Wells Fargo, believes banks are wise to hold back. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Berkshire Hathaway Inc Go to your Portfolio » When long-term interest rates are substantially higher than short-term rates  a situation known as a steep yield curve  banks should be able to profit by borrowing cheaply in the short term and lending for longer periods at higher rates. But this time around, the net interest margins at American banks are not tracking the steepness of the yield curve as they generally have in the past, according to FBR Research. That’s partly because banks do not seem to be lending as much as they have the capacity for. Demand for loans is hardly healthy: economic weakness means a dearth of interested and creditworthy borrowers. But as John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, noted during the bank’s earnings call on Wednesday, banks also have reasons to hold back. First, accumulating cash and highly liquid securities protects them from the volatility of credit markets and prepares them for stricter liquidity requirements expected from regulators. Second, although the yield curve is steep, interest rates are low  near zero over the short term. Many banks currently have to pay more than that for deposits, so they do not get the benefit of the interest rate gap even when they do lend. And Mr. Stumpf and other bank chiefs worry that if they make loans now, rising short-term rates over the loans’ life will eat away their profits. As a result, FBR believes that many banks will not really have the motivation to lend more aggressively until the Federal Reserve starts raising short-term rates. The trouble is, higher interest rates over all tend to cause the value of credit assets to fall. That in turn would generate fresh losses for banks, depleting their capital and reducing their capacity to lend. It’s a conundrum for the banks as well as for the Fed as it tries to set monetary policy. Defying the Oracle Irene Rosenfeld is clearly feeling lucky. Ms. Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft Foods, raised her price to secure Cadbury’s agreement to a takeover. But in reducing the stock component, she also removed a chance of Warren E. Buffett voting against the deal. Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which is Kraft’s biggest shareholder, had already expressed concern about the deal as Ms. Rosenfeld was lining it up. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett, an investing legend, told CNBC that he was doubtful about the transaction this week and would vote against it if he could. But he can’t. Ms. Rosenfeld increased Kraft’s bid for Cadbury to 850 pence a share (about $13.92), to total some $19 billion. By adding to the cash component, she reduced the stock Kraft needed to issue to 18 percent of what was already outstanding. That neatly ducked under the 20 percent threshold that would have required shareholder approval under New York Stock Exchange rules. Reducing the stock component does nod to one of Mr. Buffett’s objections, namely that Kraft’s stock is undervalued and therefore would be an expensive acquisition currency. And other influential shareholders support the deal, including William A. Ackman of the activist hedge fund Pershing Square. But it’s gutsy to go against a big shareholder, especially one with Mr. Buffett’s aura. Sure, it appears to be a disagreement primarily about price rather than overall strategy; Mr. Buffett says he will not sell his shares and still speaks highly of Ms. Rosenfeld. Even so, it leaves her especially exposed to the slightest mishap as the deal unfolds. Kraft’s chief must be aware of this. And it looks as if she has a margin of safety. The stated expectations for cost savings, for instance, have barely changed since the initial hostile bid. With Cadbury now on board, it should be possible to cut more than the mooted 7 percent or so of sales. If Kraft shares do strengthen sustainably, Ms. Rosenfeld will no doubt gladly debate Mr. Buffett about whether they did so because of, or in spite of, the Cadbury deal. Ms. Rosenfeld’s alternative  defending a deal done against her biggest shareholder’s judgment with nothing in Kraft’s share price to show for it  would be a much less attractive proposition.

Kraft Foods' sweetened offer for Cadbury followed four months of drooling over the British chocolatier that must have seemed like four years for Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft's chief executive. But the delay had its benefits. Though the company will have to raise more money to pay for the final deal, that's become easier and cheaper since Kraft made its bid. Kraft's offer, now accepted by Cadbury's board, promises a cash component of 500 pence ($8.19) for each Cadbury share, a 66 percent increase over the cash part of the lower and more stock-heavy proposal made in September. Kraft's sale of its pizza business to Nestlé this month will raise about 60 pence of that. Given Kraft's modest cash holdings, the rest will have to come mostly from debt, possibly some $10 billion of it. In November, Kraft received commitments for £5.5 billion ($9 billion) from a cluster of banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and HSBC. That is still available and, along with a separate revolving facility, gives Kraft the borrowing capacity it needs. The downside is that the offer is for bridge financing that has to be replaced within a year. Happily for Ms. Rosenfeld, the delay in snagging Cadbury has allowed conditions in the investment-grade corporate bond market to improve. Now, Kraft should be able to refinance the bridge loans more cheaply than it could have hoped back in September. The average risk premium on better-rated corporate debt has dropped to 1.65 percentage points over Treasury yields, from 2.32 percentage points in early September, according to Barclays Capital. Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday that it expected Kraft to retain its investment-grade rating, even though the company's total debt load would rise to more than four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to CreditSights. That's good for Ms. Rosenfeld: The investment-grade markets are generally deeper and more accommodating than junk bond markets. Still, while the passage of time may have paid off for Ms. Rosenfeld in reaching a deal, less patience is called for in refinancing Kraft's bank debt. With the global economy still fragile, the strong credit revival could easily melt away. As soon as Kraft is confident of getting its hands on its British chocolate box, a trip to the bond markets is due. The O'Brien Bailout Conan O'Brien and his production team are expected to receive about $40 million to leave NBC, the media unit of General Electric, itself among the largest recipients of taxpayer help. While it would be a stretch to compare the late-night talk show host to a Goldman Sachs or Citigroup banker, Mr. O'Brien is arguably only a few steps removed. Though the conglomerate was not a recipient of direct equity aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, G.E. availed itself of another bailout facility, the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Participants in that program were able to issue debt with a government guarantee, receiving explicit taxpayer backing in the event of default. G.E. was just one of 88 companies with outstanding debt backed by Uncle Sam as of Oct. 31, but its $60 billion of issuance accounted for nearly a fifth of the total. Unlike some of the banks that received direct equity injections from the government, G.E. can argue it does not deserve the same scrutiny over compensation that has bedeviled financial companies including Citigroup, Goldman and the American International Group. But without the F.D.I.C.'s largess, the group's financial arm, GE Capital, would have struggled to support its $650 billion balance sheet. That could have forced its parent to liquidate assets, starting with NBC. In a truly worst case, G.E. might have even had to seek protection from its creditors. Had G.E. been forced to dump NBC in a fire sale, new owners could have demanded changes to contracts like Mr. O'Brien's. That's not the same as a Citi banker fighting for a bonus after a government rescue. But it's only a few steps removed. So a bit of thanks to taxpayers from Mr. O'Brien might be in order.

Buffett fired an unusual shot across Kraft‘s bow: a public statement warning the American food giant not to overpay in its pursuit of Cadbury, and a threat to reject the company’s plans to issue up to 370 million new shares as part of the deal. At the time, analysts and investors weren’t quite sure where the Oracle of Omaha stood. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett made his feelings clear. “I’ve got a lot of doubts about the deal,” he told CNBC’s Becky Quick. As before, Mr. Buffett’s concern remains the use of Kraft stock to pay for the now $19 billion deal. Even though Kraft has raised the level of cash and lowered the amount of stock it will use for the transaction, Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chief, said that he still considers the company’s shares undervalued. Issuing new shares at their current price to him is a loss of value. Kraft said that it had structured the acquisition so that it would no longer need shareholder approval to issue the necessary new stock. That’s a good thing, because Mr. Buffett said that if given the chance, he would vote down the proposal. He also criticized Kraft’s deal to sell its North American frozen pizza business to Nestle for $3.7 billion, a sale that raised additional cash for its Cadbury bid. To Mr. Buffett, that transaction, too, carried too low a price. Still, he refused to personally criticized Kraft’s chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld. “She’s a decent person,” he said, adding that he has cordial relations with her.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/surprise-hershey-said-to-bow-out-of-cadbury-bid/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Hershey Said to Bow Out of Cadbury Bid<date>January 22, 2010, 4:30 am</date><text>If takeovers were novels, this would be the denouement.

Before Tuesday’s deal with Kraft, Cadbury’s management had suggested that it would prefer a deal with a fellow confectioner, rather than a low-growth food conglomerate. A bid for Cadbury would have posed some risks for Hershey, mostly financial: the American company has only a fraction of Kraft’s market value, making it harder to pay the sort of price Cadbury had been seeking. Still, Hershey had been working with JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to raise more than $10 billion in debt financing, according to people briefed on the matter. Its controlling shareholder, a charitable trust that oversees a school for underprivileged children, had retained Byron D. Trott, a former Goldman Sachs banker long known as the longtime adviser to Warren E. Buffett, to raise money as well, these people said. Among the company’s considerations was holding onto its investment-grade credit rating, as well as preventing an over-dilution of its shareholders, especially the Hershey Trust. Yet proponents of the deal within the company and the board argued that losing out to Kraft would relegate Hershey to a domestic niche. Representatives for Cadbury had held back-channel talks with Hershey, offering some guidance on what would constitute an acceptable bid, people briefed on the matter said, in an effort to stoke a competitive auction. Hershey had also briefly held talks with Ferrero, the Italian maker of Nutella, over a potential joint bid. Hershey may have at least scored a small victory by helping to prod a higher Kraft bid, one that earned the disapproval of the bigger company’s most notable shareholder: Mr. Buffett. – Michael J. de la Merced Go to Hershey Press Release »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/21views.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Why Bankers Tend to Hoard<date>Published: January 21, 2010</date><text>The big gap between short- and long-term interest rates should mean fat lending profits for American banks.

But this time around, the net interest margins at American banks are not tracking the steepness of the yield curve as they generally have in the past, according to FBR Research. That’s partly because banks do not seem to be lending as much as they have the capacity for. Demand for loans is hardly healthy: economic weakness means a dearth of interested and creditworthy borrowers. But as John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s chief executive, noted during the bank’s earnings call on Wednesday, banks also have reasons to hold back. First, accumulating cash and highly liquid securities protects them from the volatility of credit markets and prepares them for stricter liquidity requirements expected from regulators. Second, although the yield curve is steep, interest rates are low  near zero over the short term. Many banks currently have to pay more than that for deposits, so they do not get the benefit of the interest rate gap even when they do lend. And Mr. Stumpf and other bank chiefs worry that if they make loans now, rising short-term rates over the loans’ life will eat away their profits. As a result, FBR believes that many banks will not really have the motivation to lend more aggressively until the Federal Reserve starts raising short-term rates. The trouble is, higher interest rates over all tend to cause the value of credit assets to fall. That in turn would generate fresh losses for banks, depleting their capital and reducing their capacity to lend. It’s a conundrum for the banks as well as for the Fed as it tries to set monetary policy. Defying the Oracle Irene Rosenfeld is clearly feeling lucky. Ms. Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft Foods, raised her price to secure Cadbury’s agreement to a takeover. But in reducing the stock component, she also removed a chance of Warren E. Buffett voting against the deal. Mr. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, which is Kraft’s biggest shareholder, had already expressed concern about the deal as Ms. Rosenfeld was lining it up. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett, an investing legend, told CNBC that he was doubtful about the transaction this week and would vote against it if he could. But he can’t. Ms. Rosenfeld increased Kraft’s bid for Cadbury to 850 pence a share (about $13.92), to total some $19 billion. By adding to the cash component, she reduced the stock Kraft needed to issue to 18 percent of what was already outstanding. That neatly ducked under the 20 percent threshold that would have required shareholder approval under New York Stock Exchange rules. Reducing the stock component does nod to one of Mr. Buffett’s objections, namely that Kraft’s stock is undervalued and therefore would be an expensive acquisition currency. And other influential shareholders support the deal, including William A. Ackman of the activist hedge fund Pershing Square. But it’s gutsy to go against a big shareholder, especially one with Mr. Buffett’s aura. Sure, it appears to be a disagreement primarily about price rather than overall strategy; Mr. Buffett says he will not sell his shares and still speaks highly of Ms. Rosenfeld. Even so, it leaves her especially exposed to the slightest mishap as the deal unfolds. Kraft’s chief must be aware of this. And it looks as if she has a margin of safety. The stated expectations for cost savings, for instance, have barely changed since the initial hostile bid. With Cadbury now on board, it should be possible to cut more than the mooted 7 percent or so of sales. If Kraft shares do strengthen sustainably, Ms. Rosenfeld will no doubt gladly debate Mr. Buffett about whether they did so because of, or in spite of, the Cadbury deal. Ms. Rosenfeld’s alternative  defending a deal done against her biggest shareholder’s judgment with nothing in Kraft’s share price to show for it  would be a much less attractive proposition.

Kraft Foods' sweetened offer for Cadbury followed four months of drooling over the British chocolatier that must have seemed like four years for Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft's chief executive. But the delay had its benefits. Though the company will have to raise more money to pay for the final deal, that's become easier and cheaper since Kraft made its bid. Kraft's offer, now accepted by Cadbury's board, promises a cash component of 500 pence ($8.19) for each Cadbury share, a 66 percent increase over the cash part of the lower and more stock-heavy proposal made in September. Kraft's sale of its pizza business to Nestlé this month will raise about 60 pence of that. Given Kraft's modest cash holdings, the rest will have to come mostly from debt, possibly some $10 billion of it. In November, Kraft received commitments for £5.5 billion ($9 billion) from a cluster of banks including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and HSBC. That is still available and, along with a separate revolving facility, gives Kraft the borrowing capacity it needs. The downside is that the offer is for bridge financing that has to be replaced within a year. Happily for Ms. Rosenfeld, the delay in snagging Cadbury has allowed conditions in the investment-grade corporate bond market to improve. Now, Kraft should be able to refinance the bridge loans more cheaply than it could have hoped back in September. The average risk premium on better-rated corporate debt has dropped to 1.65 percentage points over Treasury yields, from 2.32 percentage points in early September, according to Barclays Capital. Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service said on Tuesday that it expected Kraft to retain its investment-grade rating, even though the company's total debt load would rise to more than four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to CreditSights. That's good for Ms. Rosenfeld: The investment-grade markets are generally deeper and more accommodating than junk bond markets. Still, while the passage of time may have paid off for Ms. Rosenfeld in reaching a deal, less patience is called for in refinancing Kraft's bank debt. With the global economy still fragile, the strong credit revival could easily melt away. As soon as Kraft is confident of getting its hands on its British chocolate box, a trip to the bond markets is due. The O'Brien Bailout Conan O'Brien and his production team are expected to receive about $40 million to leave NBC, the media unit of General Electric, itself among the largest recipients of taxpayer help. While it would be a stretch to compare the late-night talk show host to a Goldman Sachs or Citigroup banker, Mr. O'Brien is arguably only a few steps removed. Though the conglomerate was not a recipient of direct equity aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, G.E. availed itself of another bailout facility, the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Participants in that program were able to issue debt with a government guarantee, receiving explicit taxpayer backing in the event of default. G.E. was just one of 88 companies with outstanding debt backed by Uncle Sam as of Oct. 31, but its $60 billion of issuance accounted for nearly a fifth of the total. Unlike some of the banks that received direct equity injections from the government, G.E. can argue it does not deserve the same scrutiny over compensation that has bedeviled financial companies including Citigroup, Goldman and the American International Group. But without the F.D.I.C.'s largess, the group's financial arm, GE Capital, would have struggled to support its $650 billion balance sheet. That could have forced its parent to liquidate assets, starting with NBC. In a truly worst case, G.E. might have even had to seek protection from its creditors. Had G.E. been forced to dump NBC in a fire sale, new owners could have demanded changes to contracts like Mr. O'Brien's. That's not the same as a Citi banker fighting for a bonus after a government rescue. But it's only a few steps removed. So a bit of thanks to taxpayers from Mr. O'Brien might be in order.

Buffett fired an unusual shot across Kraft‘s bow: a public statement warning the American food giant not to overpay in its pursuit of Cadbury, and a threat to reject the company’s plans to issue up to 370 million new shares as part of the deal. At the time, analysts and investors weren’t quite sure where the Oracle of Omaha stood. On Wednesday, Mr. Buffett made his feelings clear. “I’ve got a lot of doubts about the deal,” he told CNBC’s Becky Quick. As before, Mr. Buffett’s concern remains the use of Kraft stock to pay for the now $19 billion deal. Even though Kraft has raised the level of cash and lowered the amount of stock it will use for the transaction, Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chief, said that he still considers the company’s shares undervalued. Issuing new shares at their current price to him is a loss of value. Kraft said that it had structured the acquisition so that it would no longer need shareholder approval to issue the necessary new stock. That’s a good thing, because Mr. Buffett said that if given the chance, he would vote down the proposal. He also criticized Kraft’s deal to sell its North American frozen pizza business to Nestle for $3.7 billion, a sale that raised additional cash for its Cadbury bid. To Mr. Buffett, that transaction, too, carried too low a price. Still, he refused to personally criticized Kraft’s chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld. “She’s a decent person,” he said, adding that he has cordial relations with her.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/fitch-cuts-credit-ratings-of-kraft-and-cadbury/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Fitch Cuts Credit Ratings of Kraft and Cadbury<date>January 20, 2010, 7:15 am</date><text>Kraft Foods and Cadbury saw their credit ratings cut to the lowest investment grade on Wednesday after Kraft won the backing of Cadbury’s board for its $19.6 billion takeover bid, Reuters reported.

Citing the merger of Glaxo Wellcome with SmithKline Beecham as an example, the newspaper said that most such deals failed to deliver in terms of share price or any other measure. “Most mega mergers are more the result of executive boredom, delusions of grandeur and the siren call of fee hungry investment bankers than compelling industrial logic,” The Telegraph said. Still, the paper said, at least the Kraft takeover of Cadbury was allowed to happen, highlighting a British openness to foreign investment that not all European countries can boast.

Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chairwoman and chief executive, said in a statement. Cadbury for its part will benefit from the supply chain of a larger company, said Jon Cox, a food and beverage analyst at Kepler Capital Management in Zurich. But the prospect of a takeover of Cadbury, the 186-year-old British company, especially by an American multinational like Kraft, sent shudders throughout Britain and prompted a wave of public protests. The Mail on Sunday, one of the biggest-selling British newspapers, ran a “Keep Cadbury British” campaign. “It’s sad to see another British company bought up by a multinational,” Mr. Cox said, “but that’s finance.” Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Tuesday that his government was “determined that the levels of investment that take place in Cadbury in the United Kingdom are maintained,” and that “at a time when people are worried about their jobs, that jobs in Cadbury can be secure.” During a conference call Tuesday, Kraft executives reiterated that the company would keep a strong presence in Britain and would be a “net importer” of jobs in the country. The move will also continue the consolidation that has dominated the food business over the last decade. While mergers involving food companies dipped somewhat last year  preliminary data from the Food Institute, a trade organization, showed 58 acquisitions in 2009, versus 130 in 2008  analysts expect deal-making to pick up again as companies seek greater scale and presence in developing countries. “We’re in the middle of a little wave of deal activity,” Greg Pearlman, the head of the food and consumer group at BMO Capital Markets, said. “Will they all be as big and global and transforming as this? No. But I do think there’s some pent-up demand for strategic acquisitions.” That may present challenges for companies like Hershey that lack an international presence to pursue global competitors. Hershey, based in Pennsylvania, had been readying a potential bid for Cadbury, according to people briefed on the matter. Yet with Cadbury’s board recommending the new Kraft bid, a counteroffer from Hershey seems unlikely. The agreement between Kraft and Cadbury came together over the weekend, after weeks of sometimes blistering volleys. Cadbury in particular fought fiercely. Its chairman, Roger Carr, derided Kraft as showing “contempt” for the well-known brand and dismissed its hostile bidder as a low-growth conglomerate. On Tuesday, Mr. Carr softened his language, saying in a joint statement that the new offer “represents good value for Cadbury shareholders.” “For Cadbury shareholders, it’s the best possible deal, given they were dealt a bum hand, because there were no counterbidders,” Mr. Cox said. “The clear winner is Kraft.” Kraft’s original, unsolicited offer, made in September, was worth about $16.7 billion. The new offer is about a 5 percent premium over Cadbury’s closing share price of 807.5 pence on Monday and a 14 percent improvement over Kraft’s first offer in September. Under the terms, Kraft will pay 500 pence in cash and offer 0.1874 new Kraft shares for each share of Cadbury. That amounts to a payment of 840 pence ($13.80) for each Cadbury share. Additionally, Cadbury will pay out a special dividend of 10 pence a share. Tuesday was the last day Kraft could raise its offer under British takeover rules. Cadbury shareholders have until 1 p.m. London time on Feb. 2 to decide whether to accept it. While the terms of the offer are final, Kraft reserved the right to raise its bid if a rival offer were made. William Neuman contributed reporting.

Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Kraft is expected to pay about 840 pence ($13.70) in cash and stock, and let Cadbury shareholders keep a final dividend worth 12 pence a share. That takes Kraft’s offer to about 850 pence ($13.86). Kraft is also expected to raise the cash component to around 500 pence, more than half the consideration. That would be a 50 percent premium to Cadbury’s pre-bid share price, but it’s not hard for Kraft to justify. The market rise during the course of the battle accounts for 12 percent. Upgrades to sleepy analysts’ estimates provide perhaps another 10 percent, implying a reasonable 28 percent premium for control. Alternatively, put Cadbury’s forward earnings on a multiple of 15.5 times  a justifiable premium to the market given Cadbury’s double-digit compound earnings growth ahead  and it’s worth 682 pence on its own. With Cadbury’s help, Kraft should be able to lift the cost savings to 7.5 percent of Cadbury’s annual £6 billion in sales. That would imply synergies with a present value of more than £3 billion. On this math, Kraft might have justified a bid close to 900 pence a share. The re-jiggering of the cash and shares mix means Kraft can lower the amount of stock it puts into the offer, pleasing a big shareholder, Warren E. Buffett. As for Cadbury, it has delivered value for shareholders in an increasingly vulnerable situation. With hedge funds holding 20 percent and many American investors happy to take Kraft paper, Cadbury’s independence was threatened. Cadbury flirted with a bid from Hershey, which surely helped scare Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive, into raising her offer. Peter Mandelson, the British politician who appealed to shareholders not to sell on the cheap, also lent a hand. It looks as if Ms. Rosenfeld will get her deal. At some points during the battle it looked as if the Cadbury endeavor might sink her career. Now, as long as she can hold to her promises, she will look like the conquering hero of Candyland. Funds Lose Allure Giant private equity funds won’t be back for a while. New research shows many investors have lost interest in multibillion-dollar funds. That will make it tougher for big buyout shops like Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to raise money in the amounts they have become accustomed to. Some may even have to relearn smaller-scale methods of investing. The best-regarded firms can still raise plenty of money. BC Partners, a private equity fund based in Europe, is aiming to start a 6 billion euro fund. And Blackstone has gathered about $9 billion for its next fund. But firms may not be able to harvest as much money as they have in the past. Even if Blackstone’s total rises further, it will probably raise only about half the $21.7 billion that the firm raised in 2007 for a fund. Most big buyout firms will have to set their sights lower still. According to a recent survey by the data provider Preqin, 37 percent of buyout investors who had previously invested in large funds said that they would now avoid funds with more than $4.5 billion. Just 5 percent of investors said they would avoid small and midmarket funds. Investors are shying away from giant funds partly because, with less accommodating debt markets, the big deals these funds need are tough to pull off. For some of the same reasons, private equity managers are having trouble exiting larger investments profitably. Partly as a result, large funds are posting lower returns than midmarket funds, according to Preqin. That gives investors another reason to look elsewhere. Even if they can still raise billions, most private equity firms will have to revert to preboom types of deals. Rather than undertaking giant leveraged buyouts of public companies, the more typical investment used to be buying smaller private businesses and units from public companies. Going back to that kind of business may require more work by the buyout barons for deals with smaller fees and potential rewards. That means that as their funds shrink, big firms could find their profits  and payouts to their people  deflating, too.

With Cadbury’s help, Kraft should be able to lift the cost savings to 7.5 percent of Cadbury’s annual £6 billion in sales. That would imply synergies with a present value of more than £3 billion. On this math, Kraft might have justified a bid close to 900 pence a share. The re-jiggering of the cash and shares mix means Kraft can lower the amount of stock it puts into the offer, pleasing a big shareholder, Warren E. Buffett. As for Cadbury, it has delivered value for shareholders in an increasingly vulnerable situation. With hedge funds holding 20 percent and many American investors happy to take Kraft paper, Cadbury’s independence was threatened. Cadbury flirted with a bid from Hershey, which surely helped scare Irene Rosenfeld, Kraft’s chief executive, into raising her offer. Peter Mandelson, the British politician who appealed to shareholders not to sell on the cheap, also lent a hand. It looks as if Ms. Rosenfeld will get her deal. At some points during the battle it looked as if the Cadbury endeavor might sink her career. Now, as long as she can hold to her promises, she will look like the conquering hero of Candyland. Funds Lose Allure Giant private equity funds won’t be back for a while. New research shows many investors have lost interest in multibillion-dollar funds. That will make it tougher for big buyout shops like Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to raise money in the amounts they have become accustomed to. Some may even have to relearn smaller-scale methods of investing. The best-regarded firms can still raise plenty of money. BC Partners, a private equity fund based in Europe, is aiming to start a 6 billion euro fund. And Blackstone has gathered about $9 billion for its next fund. But firms may not be able to harvest as much money as they have in the past. Even if Blackstone’s total rises further, it will probably raise only about half the $21.7 billion that the firm raised in 2007 for a fund. Most big buyout firms will have to set their sights lower still. According to a recent survey by the data provider Preqin, 37 percent of buyout investors who had previously invested in large funds said that they would now avoid funds with more than $4.5 billion. Just 5 percent of investors said they would avoid small and midmarket funds. Investors are shying away from giant funds partly because, with less accommodating debt markets, the big deals these funds need are tough to pull off. For some of the same reasons, private equity managers are having trouble exiting larger investments profitably. Partly as a result, large funds are posting lower returns than midmarket funds, according to Preqin. That gives investors another reason to look elsewhere. Even if they can still raise billions, most private equity firms will have to revert to preboom types of deals. Rather than undertaking giant leveraged buyouts of public companies, the more typical investment used to be buying smaller private businesses and units from public companies. Going back to that kind of business may require more work by the buyout barons for deals with smaller fees and potential rewards. That means that as their funds shrink, big firms could find their profits  and payouts to their people  deflating, too.

Skip to next paragraph Mike Cassese/Reuters Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Go to your Portfolio » Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News Todd Stitzer, chief executive of Cadbury of Britain. Barring any last-minute complications  these people cautioned that the talks could still fall apart  the deal would create a global food giant that would unite Kraft and its Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers with Cadbury and its Trident gum and Dairy Milk chocolates. Together, the two companies would have more than $50 billion in revenue and a big presence in markets globally. Over the last decade, food companies have sought to gain scale by combining with each other, most recently with Mars buying the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 2008 for $23 billion. The tentative deal for Cadbury would end a four-month battle for control of the British candy maker, one in which Cadbury executives accused Kraft of showing “contempt” with an undervalued offer. Under the terms of the proposal, Kraft will pay 840 pence ($13.70) for each Cadbury share, while Cadbury will pay out a special dividend of 10 pence a share. The offer is about a 5 percent premium over Cadbury’s closing share price of 807.5 pence on Monday. The majority of the increase was in the cash component, which was raised to £5 a Cadbury share, from £3, a person briefed on the matter said. The agreement is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday, this person said, which is the last day Kraft can raise its offer under British takeover rules. Spokesmen for Cadbury and Kraft declined to comment on Monday. The deal will draw to a close an often acrimonious takeover battle between the two food companies, one that began with Kraft making public an unsolicited $16.7 billion bid for Cadbury in early September. The Cadbury management quickly derided the offer as too low and dismissed the prospect of being absorbed into what it called a slow-growing food conglomerate. Most of Cadbury’s major shareholders resisted Kraft’s original offer, with just 1.5 percent having accepted by an earlier January deadline. Many are likely to be swayed by a recommendation from Cadbury’s board now that Kraft has addressed a common complaint by raising the cash portion of its bid. A takeover of the 186-year-old Cadbury, especially by an American giant like Kraft, will most likely send shudders throughout Britain. Politicians and unions have pointed to both a loss of jobs  the Unite labor union has estimated that as many as 30,000 jobs could be lost  and of national pride. Cadbury has argued repeatedly that it would prefer to remain independent, pointing to faster-than-expected success in its turnaround program. But its executives have acknowledged that Kraft’s bid put the company in play and they would consider any offer made at the right price. From the beginning, speculation mounted among investors that another bidder could step in, forcing Kraft to raise its original offer. Representatives for Cadbury have held talks with Hershey, the American company that Cadbury had viewed as a preferable merger partner, according to people briefed on the matter. For Hershey, buying Cadbury would prevent it from being relegated to a mostly domestic company. Hershey moved closer to making a bid in recent days, lining up more than $10 billion in financing, these people said. Hershey had been waiting for Kraft to unveil its final offer on Tuesday before it made its final decision on a bid, but analysts have said that Hershey would most likely be unable to top the much larger Kraft in a bidding war. Other potential suitors, including Nestlé of Switzerland and Ferrero of Italy, dropped out. Despite Kraft’s strong desire to gain control of Cadbury, its chief executive, Irene Rosenfeld, vowed to keep the company disciplined in its bidding and to maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Still, Kraft began raising its original offer earlier this month, increasing the cash portion of its bid after selling its North American frozen pizza business to Nestlé for $3.7 billion. Ms. Rosenfeld met with Cadbury shareholders in London last week to solicit their opinions. Others have sounded notes of caution. Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway is Kraft’s largest shareholder, delivered an unusually public admonishment, warning Kraft to avoid overdiluting its shareholders by issuing too many new shares. William A. Ackman, who runs the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management and has been amassing a big position in Kraft, echoed concerns about shareholder dilution, though he said he supported the company’s takeover effort.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image One of the brand’s cheerful print ads includes the overall campaign’s tagline, “It doesn’t get better than this.” After more than 125 years in existence, the brand is spending more than $50 million on its first campaign to extend across all of its meaty products: bacon, hot dogs, premade sandwiches, bologna and sliced packaged meats. The brand wanted to emphasize its name beyond just a few well-known products, said Sean Marks, director for marketing at Oscar Mayer, a division of Kraft Foods. “In the past it’s always stood for Oscar Mayer bologna and hot dogs, but we have a number of other large businesses now, so it’s really bringing them together,” he said. Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh sliced meat, for instance, was one of the only products within Kraft’s line to get a special accolade in Kraft’s third-quarter earnings statement, after it delivered double-digit growth. But while Oscar Mayer’s bologna once had a first name, and children wished they were an Oscar Mayer wiener, the brand is taking a different approach with this campaign. Its new agency, McGarryBowen, was awarded the Oscar Mayer account in May. (The agency, a unit of Dentsu Holdings, has won several Kraft accounts lately, including Maxwell House, Lunchables, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Miracle Whip and Kraft singles.) Timothy Scott, managing partner for McGarryBowen, said he wanted to refresh the brand and get away from the product-specific ads. “There was an opportunity for the brand to get back to that sort of joy and exuberance that I think the brand has used throughout the years,” Mr. Scott said. “It also offered the opportunity, in our minds, to take the entire product portfolio, and was there a way to align it under one idea when they hadn’t done it in forever?” Although the jingles are strongly associated with Oscar Mayer, Mr. Scott said he insisted on avoiding anything too reminiscent of the old spots in music for the new ads. “What we did not want to do was write jingles. We intentionally stayed away from having them sing about individual products  we didn’t want people singing about hot dogs or bologna, we wanted to capture the spirit of the brand,” Mr. Scott said. “I think those jingles, they’ll still live on in different places and in different touchpoints, but oftentimes certain jingles can hearken back to yesteryear.” McGarryBowen asked several musicians to compose songs, and settled on one from Joy Williams, a Nashville-based songwriter who has written for the “American Idol” contestants Mandisa and David Archuleta. She wrote what ended up being the tag line for the whole campaign, “It doesn’t get better than this.” It sounds like a pop song one might hear on a light-FM station, wedged between Natasha Bedingfield and Ingrid Michaelson: “I’ve got everything I want right here right now, sun keeps shining like it won’t ever go down, oh it’s pure bliss, my world is brighter,” and so on into the sunshine. The television commercials are scheduled to begin running during the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday. They show cheerful scenes from suburban life: a little girl giggling and pulling apart bologna in the backseat of a sport utility vehicle as her mother looks on affectionately; a working mother pulling toys out of her brown-bag lunch, then an Oscar Mayer premade sandwich, and calling her son to thank him for packing it; parents waking up their sleepy teenager with the smell of frying bacon. “I think the importance of all of these was to tell little stories, and little stories that you just happened upon,” Mr. Scott said. “None of the work is people staring at the camera delivering lines.” Asked whether the little stories weren’t too broad  the commercials and tag line could almost as easily be selling cameras or light bulbs as processed meats  Mr. Marks said they were connected directly to his products. “I do think they’re really connected to food  some of your most enjoyable moments in some ways are either over meals,” he said, or “captured over food.” The company’s print ads are similarly cheerful: a young couple eats from either end of a hot dog, “Lady and the Tramp” style, and sun-dappled men and women snack on the meats in their neatly appointed homes and yards. Those begin running in late January issues of magazines like Us Weekly and People, then in women’s magazines like Redbook and Good Housekeeping. The company is also running an online effort at GoodMoodMission.com, where it asks visitors to answer Oscar Mayer-oriented questions  like filling in the blank on “It doesn’t get better than ...” In return for people answering such questions, Oscar Mayer will donate food to Feeding America, which Kraft has supported for some time. On Tuesday, Oscar Mayer will have a front-page presence on Yahoo, and run branded content on MSN sites, pointing visitors toward GoodMoodMission. And as for the Oscar Mayer wiener jingle, well, it’ll still be around, being broadcast from the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, among other places, while the bologna with a first name is still featured in promotions for that product. “Those are iconic jingles,” Mr. Scott said, “but in a case like this, where you need an overarching idea, I think a jingle might have been limiting.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 15, 2010, on page B2 of the New York edition.OSCAR MAYER, which has two of the most famous advertising jingles, is pushing them to the side as it introduces its biggest campaign to date.

Writing in The Financial Times, Mr. Mandelson said investors who pursue a short-term interest, motivated by a quick return, could find themselves running contrary to Britain’s business interests. Mr. Mandelson will meet a group of institutional investors on Thursday to discuss their role in foreign takeovers of British businesses. Top of the agenda is expected to be U.S. food maker Kraft‘s hostile $17 billion (10.4 billion pound) takeover bid for confectioner Cadbury, Reuters reported. Institutional investors will be led by Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments, one of Cadbury’s biggest investors. In the commentary, Mr. Mandelson, seen by many as the effective deputy prime minister, repeated recent comments that investors needed to take a longer view on mergers to create sustainable company growth. “Directors should expect to run the gantlet of public and shareholder criticism if they have done their homework poorly, plan to load companies with heavy debt, are motivated chiefly by the desire to strip assets or simply want to make a quick profit off the share price with little respect for the work force or local interests,” he wrote. The Unite trade union said nearly 30,000 jobs were at risk if the debt-laden Kraft wins Cadbury, and urged Cadbury investors to put the wider public interest ahead of price. The government faces an election by June and is keen to keep a lid on unemployment, which has recently leveled off at just short of 2.5 million, or 7.9 percent. Mr. Mandelson said he wanted to ask if London could set a new standard for high-quality, long-term engagement between investors and company directors. “The challenge is to find the right balance between the benefits of trading and the benefits of long-term ownership. Long-termism cannot mean complacency,” he wrote. “If we are serious about a strong record of company creation and sustainable company growth in Britain, especially in advanced manufacturing and other industries, we need investors willing to take the long view even while they hold management to account,” Mr. Mandelson said. He said it had been “an open secret” during the past two decades that through poor valuation or aggressive cost-cutting, too many mergers failed to create additional long-term value in the merged company. “For this reason, companies making acquisitions should set out an objective analysis of the potential gains and be entirely open about their intentions for the workforce, while shareholders on both sides have to be genuinely critical,” he wrote.

Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Markets yelped on Tuesday after the central bank raised the minimum ratio of capital to loans at banks by half a percentage point. But that amounts to little more than scooping water out of the sea. Some 1 trillion renminbi ($146 billion) of government bills mature in the next two weeks. If they are not rolled over, three times more money would flow into the system than the capital reserve increase would remove. Then there are foreign speculative flows  an estimated 378 billion renminbi in the fourth quarter of 2009. The reserve increase is not enough to calm the banks’ lending frenzy. They disbursed 600 billion renminbi of loans during the first week of 2010 alone, according to local media, more than in the whole of December. Furthermore, the capital ratio in the banking system in aggregate is already two percentage points above what is strictly required, so the new targets won’t necessarily have any effect on lending. Asset price inflation is already running wild in the real estate and stock markets, and another new government policy might make the problem worse. The State Council has approved the introduction of margin trading this year, so qualified investors will be able to use up to eight times leverage to buy stocks. The planned introduction of limited short-selling at the same time is unlikely to be enough to compensate. Even the central bank is not expecting much from the reserve increase. An official said the monetary policy stance is still reasonably accommodative and described the move as an attempt to fine-tune flexibly. Tinkering may be better than watching idly, but more substantial  and politically risky  moves will be required to get the financial beast under control. Holding Kraft’s Line Kraft Foods should not budge  at least not much. Its reluctant British takeover target, Cadbury, has disclosed some impressive, if unsurprising, results and high expectations. But unless talk of interest from Hershey turns into a concrete counterbid, there’s little to persuade Kraft to pay more right now. Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft, has her reputation on the line. Cadbury’s chairman, Roger Carr, is not giving any signals about whether a raised bid  to Cadbury’s market price of 789.50 pence, or even to 800 pence  would bring Cadbury to the negotiating table. Indeed, Cadbury is still citing other industry acquisitions with valuations that imply Kraft needs to pay something closer to 900 pence. On top of that, the math for a Kraft sweetener does not add up. The current offer already surpasses the present value of the deal’s cost savings. Even if Kraft found a few more costs to cut, it still could not go more than a few pennies higher than its offer of 762 pence. Then there’s Warren E. Buffett. He owns 10 percent of Kraft and has made it clear that he does not want the company using too many shares to pay for Cadbury. His letter on the topic even appeared to suggest that he thought Kraft was already offering a full price. That restricts Ms. Rosenfeld’s options. Many Cadbury investors may be expecting a bit more, but they know that if Kraft backs off, Cadbury will get cheaper. Add 15 percent for market gains and performance to Cadbury’s share price before Ms. Rosenfeld showed up, and the stock would only be at around 650 pence, well below Kraft’s offer. There is still a good chance a majority of Cadbury investors will not tender their shares this time around. That would leave Ms. Rosenfeld fighting to save face. But like the Comcast boss, Brian L. Roberts, when he failed to acquire Disney with a hostile takeover, she would be able to say that she had exercised financial prudence. If that is the worst outcome for Ms. Rosenfeld, there is no reason to sweeten her offer now. Regardless of whether a Hershey bid surfaces, she will have another chance at Cadbury down the road if her current bid fails.

He owns 10 percent of Kraft and has made it clear that he does not want the company using too many shares to pay for Cadbury. His letter on the topic even appeared to suggest that he thought Kraft was already offering a full price. That restricts Ms. Rosenfeld’s options. Many Cadbury investors may be expecting a bit more, but they know that if Kraft backs off, Cadbury will get cheaper. Add 15 percent for market gains and performance to Cadbury’s share price before Ms. Rosenfeld showed up, and the stock would only be at around 650 pence, well below Kraft’s offer. There is still a good chance a majority of Cadbury investors will not tender their shares this time around. That would leave Ms. Rosenfeld fighting to save face. But like the Comcast boss, Brian L. Roberts, when he failed to acquire Disney with a hostile takeover, she would be able to say that she had exercised financial prudence. If that is the worst outcome for Ms. Rosenfeld, there is no reason to sweeten her offer now. Regardless of whether a Hershey bid surfaces, she will have another chance at Cadbury down the road if her current bid fails.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Nestle SA Berkshire Hathaway Inc Go to your Portfolio » But Kraft’s largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway, urged the company to be cautious. By selling its North American pizza unit to Nestlé for $3.7 billion in cash, Kraft raised money to increase the cash portion of its Cadbury offer, though it did not raise its overall price. Kraft also took out a potential rival in Nestlé, which said it had no plans to pursue an offer. Analysts and investors have wondered for weeks whether Nestlé was preparing to make a bid, speculation that grew on Monday after Nestlé, based in Switzerland, said it would sell its remaining stake in the eye care company Alcon for $28.1 billion. Instead, it chose to bolster its presence in the North American frozen-pizza business, acquiring brands like DiGiorno and Tombstone in the United States, Delissio in Canada and the California Pizza Kitchen trademark. Yet an unexpected wrinkle also arose when Berkshire, the conglomerate controlled by Warren E. Buffett, said in a statement that it opposed Kraft’s plan to issue up to 370 million new shares to support its Cadbury offer. Berkshire, which holds a 9.4 percent stake in Kraft, said it was worried that the company might spend too much and dilute its shareholders. It pointed to Kraft’s $3.6 billion stock buyback  at $33 a share  as proof that issuing too much new stock at today’s prices would be wasteful. “The share-issuance proposal, if enacted, will give Kraft a blank check allowing it to change its offer to Cadbury  in any way it wishes  from the transaction presented to shareholders in the proxy statement,” Berkshire said. The company added that it would change its mind if Kraft’s final bid, due Jan. 19, did not harm its investors. Kraft shareholders will vote on the new shares proposal on Feb. 1. While Cadbury has said that it would prefer independence than absorption into a low-growth food conglomerate, the company has also said that it would consider bids that were high enough. Analysts estimated £8, or $12.80, a share as a starting point. Cadbury’s chairman, Roger Carr, derided Kraft’s offer, saying its talk of discipline was “simply a smokescreen to justify an attempt to steal from the Cadbury shareholders.” But Kraft is under pressure from investors not to dilute their holdings too greatly, limiting the amount of stock it can issue. Mr. Buffett said last year that he believed Kraft’s original offer was a “pretty full” price. At the same time, Kraft has vowed to maintain an investment-grade rating. By selling its North American pizza business, Kraft plans to offer an additional 60 pence a share in cash to Cadbury shareholders. Kraft had begun talks with Nestlé over the pizza business before it bid for Cadbury, according to a person briefed on the matter. Jon Cox, a food and beverage analyst at Kepler Capital Markets based in Zurich, said he did not believe Berkshire’s opposition would sink the deal. “It has a negative impact, but I still think the shareholders will approve the deal,” he said, adding that Kraft would be buying Cadbury relatively cheaply, compared with similar recent deals. With Nestlé bowing out, Kraft’s remaining potential rivals are Hershey and Ferrero, the Italian chocolate maker, neither of which has yet presented a competing proposal.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image One of the brand’s cheerful print ads includes the overall campaign’s tagline, “It doesn’t get better than this.” After more than 125 years in existence, the brand is spending more than $50 million on its first campaign to extend across all of its meaty products: bacon, hot dogs, premade sandwiches, bologna and sliced packaged meats. The brand wanted to emphasize its name beyond just a few well-known products, said Sean Marks, director for marketing at Oscar Mayer, a division of Kraft Foods. “In the past it’s always stood for Oscar Mayer bologna and hot dogs, but we have a number of other large businesses now, so it’s really bringing them together,” he said. Oscar Mayer Deli Fresh sliced meat, for instance, was one of the only products within Kraft’s line to get a special accolade in Kraft’s third-quarter earnings statement, after it delivered double-digit growth. But while Oscar Mayer’s bologna once had a first name, and children wished they were an Oscar Mayer wiener, the brand is taking a different approach with this campaign. Its new agency, McGarryBowen, was awarded the Oscar Mayer account in May. (The agency, a unit of Dentsu Holdings, has won several Kraft accounts lately, including Maxwell House, Lunchables, Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Miracle Whip and Kraft singles.) Timothy Scott, managing partner for McGarryBowen, said he wanted to refresh the brand and get away from the product-specific ads. “There was an opportunity for the brand to get back to that sort of joy and exuberance that I think the brand has used throughout the years,” Mr. Scott said. “It also offered the opportunity, in our minds, to take the entire product portfolio, and was there a way to align it under one idea when they hadn’t done it in forever?” Although the jingles are strongly associated with Oscar Mayer, Mr. Scott said he insisted on avoiding anything too reminiscent of the old spots in music for the new ads. “What we did not want to do was write jingles. We intentionally stayed away from having them sing about individual products  we didn’t want people singing about hot dogs or bologna, we wanted to capture the spirit of the brand,” Mr. Scott said. “I think those jingles, they’ll still live on in different places and in different touchpoints, but oftentimes certain jingles can hearken back to yesteryear.” McGarryBowen asked several musicians to compose songs, and settled on one from Joy Williams, a Nashville-based songwriter who has written for the “American Idol” contestants Mandisa and David Archuleta. She wrote what ended up being the tag line for the whole campaign, “It doesn’t get better than this.” It sounds like a pop song one might hear on a light-FM station, wedged between Natasha Bedingfield and Ingrid Michaelson: “I’ve got everything I want right here right now, sun keeps shining like it won’t ever go down, oh it’s pure bliss, my world is brighter,” and so on into the sunshine. The television commercials are scheduled to begin running during the Golden Globes ceremony on Sunday. They show cheerful scenes from suburban life: a little girl giggling and pulling apart bologna in the backseat of a sport utility vehicle as her mother looks on affectionately; a working mother pulling toys out of her brown-bag lunch, then an Oscar Mayer premade sandwich, and calling her son to thank him for packing it; parents waking up their sleepy teenager with the smell of frying bacon. “I think the importance of all of these was to tell little stories, and little stories that you just happened upon,” Mr. Scott said. “None of the work is people staring at the camera delivering lines.” Asked whether the little stories weren’t too broad  the commercials and tag line could almost as easily be selling cameras or light bulbs as processed meats  Mr. Marks said they were connected directly to his products. “I do think they’re really connected to food  some of your most enjoyable moments in some ways are either over meals,” he said, or “captured over food.” The company’s print ads are similarly cheerful: a young couple eats from either end of a hot dog, “Lady and the Tramp” style, and sun-dappled men and women snack on the meats in their neatly appointed homes and yards. Those begin running in late January issues of magazines like Us Weekly and People, then in women’s magazines like Redbook and Good Housekeeping. The company is also running an online effort at GoodMoodMission.com, where it asks visitors to answer Oscar Mayer-oriented questions  like filling in the blank on “It doesn’t get better than ...” In return for people answering such questions, Oscar Mayer will donate food to Feeding America, which Kraft has supported for some time. On Tuesday, Oscar Mayer will have a front-page presence on Yahoo, and run branded content on MSN sites, pointing visitors toward GoodMoodMission. And as for the Oscar Mayer wiener jingle, well, it’ll still be around, being broadcast from the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, among other places, while the bologna with a first name is still featured in promotions for that product. “Those are iconic jingles,” Mr. Scott said, “but in a case like this, where you need an overarching idea, I think a jingle might have been limiting.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 15, 2010, on page B2 of the New York edition.OSCAR MAYER, which has two of the most famous advertising jingles, is pushing them to the side as it introduces its biggest campaign to date.

Writing in The Financial Times, Mr. Mandelson said investors who pursue a short-term interest, motivated by a quick return, could find themselves running contrary to Britain’s business interests. Mr. Mandelson will meet a group of institutional investors on Thursday to discuss their role in foreign takeovers of British businesses. Top of the agenda is expected to be U.S. food maker Kraft‘s hostile $17 billion (10.4 billion pound) takeover bid for confectioner Cadbury, Reuters reported. Institutional investors will be led by Keith Skeoch, chief executive of Standard Life Investments, one of Cadbury’s biggest investors. In the commentary, Mr. Mandelson, seen by many as the effective deputy prime minister, repeated recent comments that investors needed to take a longer view on mergers to create sustainable company growth. “Directors should expect to run the gantlet of public and shareholder criticism if they have done their homework poorly, plan to load companies with heavy debt, are motivated chiefly by the desire to strip assets or simply want to make a quick profit off the share price with little respect for the work force or local interests,” he wrote. The Unite trade union said nearly 30,000 jobs were at risk if the debt-laden Kraft wins Cadbury, and urged Cadbury investors to put the wider public interest ahead of price. The government faces an election by June and is keen to keep a lid on unemployment, which has recently leveled off at just short of 2.5 million, or 7.9 percent. Mr. Mandelson said he wanted to ask if London could set a new standard for high-quality, long-term engagement between investors and company directors. “The challenge is to find the right balance between the benefits of trading and the benefits of long-term ownership. Long-termism cannot mean complacency,” he wrote. “If we are serious about a strong record of company creation and sustainable company growth in Britain, especially in advanced manufacturing and other industries, we need investors willing to take the long view even while they hold management to account,” Mr. Mandelson said. He said it had been “an open secret” during the past two decades that through poor valuation or aggressive cost-cutting, too many mergers failed to create additional long-term value in the merged company. “For this reason, companies making acquisitions should set out an objective analysis of the potential gains and be entirely open about their intentions for the workforce, while shareholders on both sides have to be genuinely critical,” he wrote.

Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Markets yelped on Tuesday after the central bank raised the minimum ratio of capital to loans at banks by half a percentage point. But that amounts to little more than scooping water out of the sea. Some 1 trillion renminbi ($146 billion) of government bills mature in the next two weeks. If they are not rolled over, three times more money would flow into the system than the capital reserve increase would remove. Then there are foreign speculative flows  an estimated 378 billion renminbi in the fourth quarter of 2009. The reserve increase is not enough to calm the banks’ lending frenzy. They disbursed 600 billion renminbi of loans during the first week of 2010 alone, according to local media, more than in the whole of December. Furthermore, the capital ratio in the banking system in aggregate is already two percentage points above what is strictly required, so the new targets won’t necessarily have any effect on lending. Asset price inflation is already running wild in the real estate and stock markets, and another new government policy might make the problem worse. The State Council has approved the introduction of margin trading this year, so qualified investors will be able to use up to eight times leverage to buy stocks. The planned introduction of limited short-selling at the same time is unlikely to be enough to compensate. Even the central bank is not expecting much from the reserve increase. An official said the monetary policy stance is still reasonably accommodative and described the move as an attempt to fine-tune flexibly. Tinkering may be better than watching idly, but more substantial  and politically risky  moves will be required to get the financial beast under control. Holding Kraft’s Line Kraft Foods should not budge  at least not much. Its reluctant British takeover target, Cadbury, has disclosed some impressive, if unsurprising, results and high expectations. But unless talk of interest from Hershey turns into a concrete counterbid, there’s little to persuade Kraft to pay more right now. Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft, has her reputation on the line. Cadbury’s chairman, Roger Carr, is not giving any signals about whether a raised bid  to Cadbury’s market price of 789.50 pence, or even to 800 pence  would bring Cadbury to the negotiating table. Indeed, Cadbury is still citing other industry acquisitions with valuations that imply Kraft needs to pay something closer to 900 pence. On top of that, the math for a Kraft sweetener does not add up. The current offer already surpasses the present value of the deal’s cost savings. Even if Kraft found a few more costs to cut, it still could not go more than a few pennies higher than its offer of 762 pence. Then there’s Warren E. Buffett. He owns 10 percent of Kraft and has made it clear that he does not want the company using too many shares to pay for Cadbury. His letter on the topic even appeared to suggest that he thought Kraft was already offering a full price. That restricts Ms. Rosenfeld’s options. Many Cadbury investors may be expecting a bit more, but they know that if Kraft backs off, Cadbury will get cheaper. Add 15 percent for market gains and performance to Cadbury’s share price before Ms. Rosenfeld showed up, and the stock would only be at around 650 pence, well below Kraft’s offer. There is still a good chance a majority of Cadbury investors will not tender their shares this time around. That would leave Ms. Rosenfeld fighting to save face. But like the Comcast boss, Brian L. Roberts, when he failed to acquire Disney with a hostile takeover, she would be able to say that she had exercised financial prudence. If that is the worst outcome for Ms. Rosenfeld, there is no reason to sweeten her offer now. Regardless of whether a Hershey bid surfaces, she will have another chance at Cadbury down the road if her current bid fails.

Even if Kraft found a few more costs to cut, it still could not go more than a few pennies higher than its offer of 762 pence. Then there’s Warren E. Buffett. He owns 10 percent of Kraft and has made it clear that he does not want the company using too many shares to pay for Cadbury. His letter on the topic even appeared to suggest that he thought Kraft was already offering a full price. That restricts Ms. Rosenfeld’s options. Many Cadbury investors may be expecting a bit more, but they know that if Kraft backs off, Cadbury will get cheaper. Add 15 percent for market gains and performance to Cadbury’s share price before Ms. Rosenfeld showed up, and the stock would only be at around 650 pence, well below Kraft’s offer. There is still a good chance a majority of Cadbury investors will not tender their shares this time around. That would leave Ms. Rosenfeld fighting to save face. But like the Comcast boss, Brian L. Roberts, when he failed to acquire Disney with a hostile takeover, she would be able to say that she had exercised financial prudence. If that is the worst outcome for Ms. Rosenfeld, there is no reason to sweeten her offer now. Regardless of whether a Hershey bid surfaces, she will have another chance at Cadbury down the road if her current bid fails.

By selling its North American pizza unit to Nestlé for $3.7 billion in cash, Kraft raised money to increase the cash portion of its Cadbury offer, though it did not raise its overall price. Kraft also took out a potential rival in Nestlé, which said it had no plans to pursue an offer. Analysts and investors have wondered for weeks whether Nestlé was preparing to make a bid, speculation that grew on Monday after Nestlé, based in Switzerland, said it would sell its remaining stake in the eye care company Alcon for $28.1 billion. Instead, it chose to bolster its presence in the North American frozen-pizza business, acquiring brands like DiGiorno and Tombstone in the United States, Delissio in Canada and the California Pizza Kitchen trademark. Yet an unexpected wrinkle also arose when Berkshire, the conglomerate controlled by Warren E. Buffett, said in a statement that it opposed Kraft’s plan to issue up to 370 million new shares to support its Cadbury offer. Berkshire, which holds a 9.4 percent stake in Kraft, said it was worried that the company might spend too much and dilute its shareholders. It pointed to Kraft’s $3.6 billion stock buyback  at $33 a share  as proof that issuing too much new stock at today’s prices would be wasteful. “The share-issuance proposal, if enacted, will give Kraft a blank check allowing it to change its offer to Cadbury  in any way it wishes  from the transaction presented to shareholders in the proxy statement,” Berkshire said. The company added that it would change its mind if Kraft’s final bid, due Jan. 19, did not harm its investors. Kraft shareholders will vote on the new shares proposal on Feb. 1. While Cadbury has said that it would prefer independence than absorption into a low-growth food conglomerate, the company has also said that it would consider bids that were high enough. Analysts estimated £8, or $12.80, a share as a starting point. Cadbury’s chairman, Roger Carr, derided Kraft’s offer, saying its talk of discipline was “simply a smokescreen to justify an attempt to steal from the Cadbury shareholders.” But Kraft is under pressure from investors not to dilute their holdings too greatly, limiting the amount of stock it can issue. Mr. Buffett said last year that he believed Kraft’s original offer was a “pretty full” price. At the same time, Kraft has vowed to maintain an investment-grade rating. By selling its North American pizza business, Kraft plans to offer an additional 60 pence a share in cash to Cadbury shareholders. Kraft had begun talks with Nestlé over the pizza business before it bid for Cadbury, according to a person briefed on the matter. Jon Cox, a food and beverage analyst at Kepler Capital Markets based in Zurich, said he did not believe Berkshire’s opposition would sink the deal. “It has a negative impact, but I still think the shareholders will approve the deal,” he said, adding that Kraft would be buying Cadbury relatively cheaply, compared with similar recent deals. With Nestlé bowing out, Kraft’s remaining potential rivals are Hershey and Ferrero, the Italian chocolate maker, neither of which has yet presented a competing proposal.

The European Commission is now reviewing Kraft’s takeover plan after the company last month offered concessions to ease regulatory concerns that its Cadbury bid might be anticompetitive. A decision is expected by Wednesday. “It will be a Phase 1 clearance based on commitments offered by Kraft,” the person told Reuters, declining to provide details. Kraft said last month that it had offered concessions in a few markets and did not expect the regulator to demand major divestments. The combination of Kraft, the world No. 5 confectionery group, and No. 2 Cadbury would supplant the current No. 1 candy maker, Mars-Wrigley. Cadbury would help expand Kraft’s business into faster-growing markets like India and the higher-margin and faster-growing confectionery markets.

Office candy bowls overflow. Leftover Hanukkah gelt beckons. And home bakers are deep into holiday kitchen marathons.In the Cadbury corporate boardroom, British confectionary executives are fighting off a $16.2 billion takeover bid by Kraft Foods. Waiting in the wings is Hershey’s, which already has a license to sell an Americanized version of the British chocolate in the United States. The big prizes are emerging markets like India, where Cadbury is the confection of choice among the young upwardly mobile who are starting to buy chocolate for holidays instead of the more traditional sweets called mithai. But for many Brits, the business impact is beside the point. The prospect of Americans taking over production of their beloved Dairy Milk and Flake bars has sent the country into an emotional tailspin. “When it comes to protecting our chocolate — the taste of British childhood — then we turn and fight,” wrote Mayor Boris Johnson of London in The Telegraph this month. “We face an appalling choice of succumbing either to Kraft, makers of the plastic flaps of orange cheese, or to Hershey, whose Hershey bars have been likened in flavor — by independent experts — to a mixture of soap powder and baby vomit.” Americans eat about 12 pounds of chocolate a year, about half as much chocolate as Britons. But we feel just as strongly about our own confection. Chocolate has served as a beloved barometer of social mores, cultural shifts and economic conditions since before Milton Hershey turned out the first bar in 1900. Thomas Jefferson, for one, loved it. “It’s an intrinsically important thing to people,” said John Scharffenberger, the winemaker-turned-chocolate guru who in 2005 sold his well-regarded artisan company to Hershey for an estimated $50 million. “It connects to our emotions and our thinking.” Chocolate’s social role has been wide ranging. At the turn of the century, chocolate cigarettes were marketed toward women who felt social pressure not to smoke in public. Chocolate has been included in war rations as a kind of morale booster for troops since 1937. During the Great Depression, Hershey’s nickel chocolate bar made for an affordable lunch. More recently, chocolate has come to mean luxury. Godiva, which Campbell’s Soup owned for decades until selling it to a Turkish conglomerate, opened its first store on Fifth Avenue in 1972. Before long, it spread to shopping malls and became the chocolate of choice for the aspirational middle class. When America went on a health kick in the early part of this decade, chocolate and its anti-oxidants went along. When the country became food obsessed, fancy chocolate bars with complex names and cacao levels were a way to separate the real players from the Godiva crowd. Premium chocolate is the fastest growing part of what will be an $18 billion chocolate market by 2011, according to a report by the market research group Packaged Facts. Shelves at places like Whole Foods are crowded with chocolate from smaller producers and specific countries, reflecting a growing desire for food that is less processed, less packaged and more authentic. (Sorry, locavores. All cocoa is grown within 15 degrees of the equator.) And now, Cadbury and Nestlé are selling fair trade-certified Dairy Milk and Kit Kat bars in Britain, meaning producers are assured a fair price and consumers are promised that child labor and other unsavory practices weren’t used. But as it did during the Depression, chocolate has emerged in the past year as a barometer for the economy. In an age of shrinking household budgets and financial insecurity, chocolate remains an inexpensive and reassuring treat. That’s why higher-end chocolate sold well at Valentine’s Day as people traded down on big-ticket luxury items and traded up on affordable ones, said Marcia Mogelonsky, a senior analyst at Mintel. But even inexpensive chocolate bars are prospering. Snickers, named in 1930 after a favorite horse of its inventor, still sells about $2 billion worth a year. In fact, if you want to give someone a piece of cultural reassurance for Christmas, consider Hershey’s and Reese’s nostalgic variety pack — 20 candy bars in wrappers with original designs selling for $17.99 on Amazon. Because at the end of the day, chocolate can be as much about history as it is about taste. And that’s true whether you grew up in London or New York.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/kraft-lender-barclays-suspends-coverage-of-cadbury/?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Kraft Lender Barclays Suspends Coverage of Cadbury<date>December 18, 2009, 6:14 am</date><text>Barclays Capital, one of the banks providing $9.2 billion of loans to help fund Kraft Foods‘ hostile bid for Britain’s Cadbury, has suspended coverage of Cadbury because of its role, Reuters reported. “Barclays Capital is acting as financial advisor to Kraft Foods in connection with a potential takeover offer for Cadbury Plc,” credit analysts at Barclays Capital said in a note to clients, adding they had halted coverage of Cadbury because of the appointment.

But if the trust’s economic interest fell below 15 percent, company rules would mean its Class B stock would lose its supervoting rights. If the company sold equity at a 10 percent discount, it would need to issue around 190 million new shares to raise the additional $6 billion-plus needed for a Cadbury deal. That would dilute the trust’s economic interest to 17.5 percent  still above the threshold needed to maintain the dual-share structure  from 32.1 percent. And even after such a big stock issue, the trust would control 64 percent of Hershey’s votes. That might still be palatable to the trustees and local grandees who would like to keep a global chocolate powerhouse in Pennsylvania. But a transforming deal that perpetuated the trust’s control should raise a red flag for other shareholders. After all, the trust hasn’t done a great job of safeguarding its interests until now. In 2002, Hershey, with the trust’s backing, rejected an offer worth $45.50 a share from Wm. Wrigley Jr. The stock hasn’t traded at that price for years. That year, the group failed to buy the Adams gum division from Pfizer, leaving it to Cadbury. Just two years ago, it passed up a chance to merge with Cadbury in a deal that arguably would have brought the same strategic benefits as the bid it is contemplating, but without the need to pay a premium. Put it all together, and it’s hard to see why Hershey’s regular investors should back a deal that would pile on leverage of the financial kind but bring them little or none in the boardroom. Cadbury isn’t a sweet enough prize for that. Distraction of Saab Is General Motors about to pull an Opel on Saab? The sale of Saab, G.M.’s Swedish subsidiary, to Koenigsegg has fallen through, and directors are considering whether to keep it going. There may be some on the Detroit carmaker’s board who believe that G.M. should bring Saab back into its garage, just as the company did this month with Opel, its main European operation. They should resist the temptation. Granted, G.M. is in better shape after its restructuring. But the Motown manufacturer still has more than enough fine-tuning of its own to do. While it managed to generate $3.3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last quarter, many of its plants were idle for much of the summer and huge bills were paid in early July by its bankrupt predecessor. That means it’ll be hard to replicate the performance without an uptick in sales. And G.M. still has to cut more of its staff and dealers. The last thing it needs is the distraction of taking on another struggling niche operation. Opel, it can be argued, was a special case. G.M. was going to keep a third of the European mass-market carmaker anyway and was concerned about sharing technology with prospective buyers, Magna International and, via Sberbank, the Russian carmaker Gaz. That’s not the case with Saab. As sad as it would be for Swedish manufacturing, G.M. should send Saab to the junkyard.

Hershey could even do it without having the charitable trust set up by its founder lose control, according to calculations by Breakingviews.com. But investors would be unwise to entrust the candy concern with more of their cash without lots of sweeteners. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Hershey Co Cadbury Plc Go to your Portfolio » First, consider how Hershey would finance a deal that’s twice its market value without running afoul of the articles of incorporation that give the Milton Hershey Trust voting control despite owning just a third of the company. The trust was set up in 1909 by Hershey’s Mennonite founder to pay for his charitable works in perpetuity. By taking on debt equivalent to five times next year’s combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Hershey could raise $10.6 billion. That’s similar to the debt levels that InBev took on when it bought Anheuser-Busch before the credit crisis.

Buffett, the big Kraft shareholder, who has counseled Kraft not to overpay for Cadbury. It would be a mistake to think Hershey wouldn’t trump Kraft’s nearly $17 billion offer for Cadbury. Strict economics suggests Hershey should steer clear. The company has $1.7 billion of debt. If it were to add debt equal to five times operating cash flow it might be able to raise an additional $3.7 billion. That’s not enough on its own to pay for Cadbury  but it’s enough to put Hershey at risk financially. Moreover, though sweets are a stable business, Hershey has never acquired a company as large and global as Cadbury. Even if a combination could handle more debt, Hershey would still have to come up with about $13 billion, though it could also reduce that by raising debt against Cadbury’s earnings. Still, such a move would require changes that might disrupt the Hershey trust, established by the company’s Mennonite founder. The company could sell assets  Ferrero of Italy is said to covet some Cadbury brands. It could issue shares to Cadbury holders or bring in new investors in the way Mars did with Mr. Buffett when it bought Wrigley. If it issues too much equity, though, the trust could put its supervoting stock at risk. The returns on this potential investment don’t look especially sweet, even assuming Kraft wouldn’t top a higher competing offer  and it probably would. Hershey has fewer opportunities to cut costs since it overlaps in only half as many Cadbury geographies as Kraft, Credit Suisse reckons. It would struggle to earn a return on investment higher than its cost of capital. But Hershey’s trustees and managers may not just be thinking about the bottom line. In Kraft-Cadbury, Hershey sees a combination that could leave it as a global bit player. Faced with such a picture, any response  even an irrational one  can’t be discounted. Bubble Trouble The Bank of England has missed a trick on pricking bubbles. The central bank has fallen into an all-too-common trap of focusing on capital surcharges for banks as a way of preventing future financial parties from turning too rowdy. Capital buffers certainly need strengthening. But so does liquidity. Yet again, financing mismatches are being virtually ignored. The bank is the latest to wade into the debate about what is known as macroprudential policy. The phrase refers to how the authorities can limit bubbles  an area central to the debate about the Federal Reserve’s role in overseeing American banks. Most of what the Bank of England’s discussion paper says is sensible, although not terribly new. It makes sense to increase minimum capital ratios when a boom is getting out of hand, and to impose even higher capital ratios on the really big and interconnected banks, because these banks will cause the most damage if they collapse. But what about financing? During the boom, banks didn’t just leverage themselves to the eyeballs; they also relied increasingly on borrowing short-term money in the wholesale markets. That left them dangerously exposed when the market’s mood abruptly changed in August 2007. In virtually every case during the crisis  Northern Rock, Lehman Brothers, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Stanley, Fortis Group and Citigroup  the rapid evaporation of liquidity precipitated disaster or near disaster. The global regime for bank capital adequacy was, to put it mildly, inadequate. But the regime for liquidity is threadbare. If future crises are to be prevented, liquidity buffers need strengthening. When the party starts getting too lively, regulators must stop banks from relying excessively on short-term money. They should also require the biggest and most interconnected banks to have the strongest liquidity positions. To be fair, the Bank of England does mention liquidity in its paper.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Cadbury PLC. | Kraft Foods Inc. Add to Portfolio Cadbury Plc Hershey Co Kraft Foods Nestle SA Go to your Portfolio » While Kraft Foods’ $16.7 billion offer for Cadbury is the only official bid on the table, other snack companies are weighing their next steps. Hershey is considering making an offer of at least $17 billion, while both Nestlé of Switzerland and Ferrero of Italy are pondering their options, according to people briefed on the discussions at the companies. Cadbury, based in London, so far has spent months stonewalling Kraft’s hostile offer. But the entrance of another bidder could help its negotiating position against Kraft. The Cadbury chairman, Roger Carr, said in an article that appeared in The Sunday Telegraph of London that the company would prefer to remain independent. But he said it would consider “any compelling offer from a serious source.” He also added that as some potential bidders were “more aligned with our business model than others, it is the value of the offer rather than the source of the offer that is our priority.” When Kraft made public its offer for Cadbury in September, many analysts immediately speculated whether Hershey, the American chocolate giant, would be forced to take action. Hershey, whose largest shareholder is a trust that oversees a school for underprivileged children, must surmount some high hurdles if it is to bid for Cadbury. The mix of financial, legal and political impediments may leave the company at a disadvantage in competing with Kraft. Not the least of Hershey’s obstacles is its size and financial firepower. As of Friday, the company’s market value was about $8.5 billion, less than half of Cadbury’s roughly £11 billion ($18.2 billion) valuation and a fraction of Kraft’s $40.1 billion value. Research analysts at JPMorgan Chase (whose investment banking arm is advising Hershey) wrote in a report last week that with about $5 billion in annual sales, $1 billion in earnings and nearly $2 billion in debt, the company could afford to take on only about $4 billion in debt before losing its investment-grade credit rating. Hershey has been working with JPMorgan and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America to line up financing for a potential bid, according to people briefed on the matter. It may also sell assets to help raise money. Representatives for Hershey and the trust declined to comment about the company’s plans. But perhaps the biggest problems facing Hershey cannot be quantified by dollar figures. Founded more than a century ago by Milton S. Hershey in the Pennsylvania town that still bears his name, the company has long been a source of local pride and local jobs. The company’s main shareholder, the Hershey Trust, owns a significant portion of Hershey’s common stock and the vast majority of its Class B stock, giving it effective control of the company. As a result of a Pennsylvania statute  enacted after an aborted $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Company  the Hershey Trust must obtain the approval of the state attorney general for any transaction that could threaten that control. The statute limits the amount of new shares Hershey could issue as part of a Cadbury bid, as does a company bylaw that automatically converts the trust’s class B shares into common stock if its holdings fall below a certain threshold. It also raises the specter of political interference if Hershey takes on the debt necessary to finance a Cadbury offer. Robert H. Sitkoff, the John L. Gray Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and an author of a study of Hershey’s attempted deal with Wrigley, described the law as contrary to the best interests of the trust, the Milton Hershey School it oversees and the company. “To call that statute unorthodox is an understatement,” he said. “It prevents the trust from diversifying, and it may well block the company from realizing the synergies of a merger.” Even before the passage of the Pennsylvania state law, which legal experts say was meant almost solely for Hershey, the company’s management and the trust were proved vulnerable to local politics. The Hershey Trust initially backed the 2002 sale of the company to Wrigley as part of a way to diversify its holdings. But D. Michael Fisher, then the state attorney general who was running for governor, sought to block the sale in the Dauphin County Orphans’ Court, arguing that the deal would endanger the Hershey School. After the judge in that case agreed, the trust scuttled the deal, and a majority of its directors subsequently resigned. Since then, Hershey has been largely restrained in its deal-making. The company even held talks with Cadbury about two years ago, to no avail. Even if Hershey has found a way to navigate the political barriers, some experts think it remains at a disadvantage to the likes of Kraft. “This kind of impediment is really going to hobble you in a fast-moving contest,” said David A. Skeel, the Arsht Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

As a chocolate fiend, bunkered in my kitchen alongside a simmering bain-marie, I find it an ominous prospect. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Chocolate Four years ago, another American food giant, Hershey, swallowed up a small chocolate company named Scharffen Berger. Started in 1997 by a sparkling-wine producer, John Scharffenberger, and a doctor, Robert Steinberg, Scharffen Berger set out to make an American chocolate that was as delicious as a European confection. And, amazingly, the company succeeded. First in Dr. Steinberg’s kitchen and later in a handsome factory in the industrial section of Berkeley, Calif., Scharffen Berger developed a line of products that won the brand a passionate following. I myself became devoted to the 82 percent cacao extra-dark bar, with its unctuous mouth feel and fruity, acidic punch. On top of creating a first-rate product, Scharffen Berger kick-started a movement. High-end artisanal chocolate became the fastest-growing sector of the market. Naturally, the big boys noticed. In January 2005, Scharffen Berger received an unsolicited offer from Hershey. The owners had not yet begun to consider selling the company. Revenues had hit $10 million and were escalating quickly. It made sense to hold onto the business for a while. But Hershey, the Pennsylvania behemoth, would not take no for an answer and kept raising its offer. That August, for a price reported to be nearly $50 million, Hershey acquired Scharffen Berger. The company kept John Scharffenberger as a consultant and promised not to change the quality of the brand. The promise lasted as long as a Hershey’s Kiss on a summer afternoon. Soon I began noticing a marked deterioration in my beloved 82 percent bar. The texture was chalky. The cherry notes had vanished. It was becoming just another mediocre American chocolate. But luckily, long before this year’s announcement by Hershey that it was closing the Berkeley plant and consolidating Scharffen Berger production in Illinois, I discovered an alternative. Green &amp; Black’s, an English brand, was readily available in New York, and if its 85 percent bar didn’t have quite the flavor bouquet that Scharffen Berger 82 packed back in its heyday, it came very close, and the mouth feel was arguably better. Interestingly, Green &amp; Black’s had also been started by small entrepreneurs and then acquired in 2005 by a giant firm. But its new parent, Cadbury, vowed to let it operate as a stand-alone unit. Judging from my research, which has been basically confined to unwrapping the foil of countless bars and plunging in, Cadbury has been true to its word. So it was with a sense of alarm that I read in September that Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Philadelphia cream cheese, among many other brands, was trying to gobble up Cadbury, which is best known for such products as Dairy Milk chocolate and Trident gum. For Kraft, the deal no doubt makes sense: Mars, the maker of M&amp;Ms and the new owner of Wrigley gum, would no longer be the world’s biggest candy maker. The expanded Kraft would be at the top of the sugar hill, having ramped up its own gum offerings and, perhaps more critically, its global distribution network. But I found it hard to care much whether Asian consumers will have an easier time procuring Planters peanut bars and Toblerone bars at their corner store. What frightened me about the proposed deal was the threat to the privileged autonomy of Green &amp; Black’s. Although Cadbury rejected the offer, Kraft has continued to push. Still, I began to think that maybe I was being too pessimistic. As Kraft shares dipped, its offer was diminishing in value. Cadbury might very well retain its independence. And even if Kraft does buy Cadbury, I assured myself, the American giant will see the wisdom in maintaining the quality of Green &amp; Black’s, a brand that has no reason to exist if it does not continue to satisfy connoisseurs who can tell that a Milk Dud is really a dud. Yes, Hershey had perversely seduced a high-quality brand and then stripped away its conquest’s quality. But perhaps Kraft would be better about honoring the artisanal excellence of my 85 percent bar than Hershey had been with the lamented 82. Last week, it was reported that Hershey is considering its own offer for Cadbury. I have started the search for my next chocolate bar. Arthur Lubow is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.

Still, I began to think that maybe I was being too pessimistic. As Kraft shares dipped, its offer was diminishing in value. Cadbury might very well retain its independence. And even if Kraft does buy Cadbury, I assured myself, the American giant will see the wisdom in maintaining the quality of Green &amp; Black’s, a brand that has no reason to exist if it does not continue to satisfy connoisseurs who can tell that a Milk Dud is really a dud. Yes, Hershey had perversely seduced a high-quality brand and then stripped away its conquest’s quality. But perhaps Kraft would be better about honoring the artisanal excellence of my 85 percent bar than Hershey had been with the lamented 82. Last week, it was reported that Hershey is considering its own offer for Cadbury. I have started the search for my next chocolate bar.

The company has been working with JPMorgan Chase and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America to line up the financing for such an offer. Kraft has so far emerged as the only suitor for Cadbury, and were it to succeed it would become an international food giant that could threaten Hershey’s expansion prospects. Working in Hershey’s favor is Cadbury’s reluctance to team up with Kraft, which the British company has derided as a low-growth food conglomerate that would stunt its opportunities. Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury. The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States. Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan. But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step. In the past, Hershey has been restrained in business matters by the Hershey Trust, a 104-year-old charitable organization that oversees the Milton Hershey School, an institution for underprivileged children in Pennsylvania. Because of the trust, which controls about 79 percent of the company’s voting shares, and local opposition, Hershey scuttled a $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 2002 and has since become more reluctant to make deals. Many analysts and deal makers had thought the chances of Hershey’s challenging Kraft were slim. Hershey’s market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft’s $40.1 billion value. Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum. By contrast, while Kraft has nearly $3 billion in cash on hand, it had nearly $21 billion in total debt as of Sept. 30. Hershey shares edged up 4 cents on Friday, to $37.18, before reports broke about its serious consideration of a deal. Shares in Kraft also climbed a little, to $27.17, up 20 cents. Shares in Cadbury rose 1.2 percent, to about £8 or about $13.20, and have climbed about 40 percent since Kraft first publicized its offer in early September. Many investors have accumulated Cadbury stock, including hedge funds like Paulson &amp; Company, which are betting that the British company will ultimately agree to a merger. Kraft made a formal offer to Cadbury’s board last week, starting the clock on a tightly scheduled process governed by Britain’s takeover code. Once Kraft formally mails its letter to Cadbury’s shareholders, it has 46 days to raise its offer. Analysts have said that Kraft would be hard pressed to raise its current offer of cash and stock, initially worth about £7.17 for each Cadbury share. Warren E. Buffett, Kraft’s largest shareholder, has described the company’s current bid as adequate. If Hershey were to leap into the contest, it would try to reach a friendly deal with Cadbury, according to one person briefed on the matter. Behind the scenes, people close to Hershey have held talks with representatives for Cadbury, although there have been no formal negotiations. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, Hershey has also been working with Byron D. Trott, the former Goldman Sachs executive long known as Mr. Buffett’s favorite banker. But because of Mr. Buffett’s position in Kraft, he is unlikely to give Hershey any help. Hershey also has held talks with Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner that makes Rocher chocolates and Tic Tac mints, people briefed on the matter said. The two had been considering sharing control of Cadbury, although these people cautioned that no agreement may be reached. Ferrero is being advised by Rothschild and the Italian bank Mediobanca. Complicating Hershey’s deliberations is the Hershey Trust, which has served in the past largely as a brake on Hershey’s boldest business decisions. Deal makers point to the attempted Wrigley deal, in which the trust initially approved as a way to diversify its holdings. But local opposition  including from Pennsylvania’s attorney general at the time, residents of Hershey’s hometown and alumni of the Hershey school  persuaded a state court judge to criticize the trust’s decision as an abandonment of its mission. The trust reversed its support for the Wrigley merger, and four months later more than half its directors resigned.

Bubble Trouble The Bank of England has missed a trick on pricking bubbles. The central bank has fallen into an all-too-common trap of focusing on capital surcharges for banks as a way of preventing future financial parties from turning too rowdy. Capital buffers certainly need strengthening. But so does liquidity. Yet again, financing mismatches are being virtually ignored. The bank is the latest to wade into the debate about what is known as macroprudential policy. The phrase refers to how the authorities can limit bubbles  an area central to the debate about the Federal Reserve’s role in overseeing American banks. Most of what the Bank of England’s discussion paper says is sensible, although not terribly new. It makes sense to increase minimum capital ratios when a boom is getting out of hand, and to impose even higher capital ratios on the really big and interconnected banks, because these banks will cause the most damage if they collapse. But what about financing? During the boom, banks didn’t just leverage themselves to the eyeballs; they also relied increasingly on borrowing short-term money in the wholesale markets. That left them dangerously exposed when the market’s mood abruptly changed in August 2007. In virtually every case during the crisis  Northern Rock, Lehman Brothers, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Stanley, Fortis Group and Citigroup  the rapid evaporation of liquidity precipitated disaster or near disaster. The global regime for bank capital adequacy was, to put it mildly, inadequate. But the regime for liquidity is threadbare. If future crises are to be prevented, liquidity buffers need strengthening. When the party starts getting too lively, regulators must stop banks from relying excessively on short-term money. They should also require the biggest and most interconnected banks to have the strongest liquidity positions. To be fair, the Bank of England does mention liquidity in its paper.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Cadbury PLC. | Kraft Foods Inc. Add to Portfolio Cadbury Plc Hershey Co Kraft Foods Nestle SA Go to your Portfolio » While Kraft Foods’ $16.7 billion offer for Cadbury is the only official bid on the table, other snack companies are weighing their next steps. Hershey is considering making an offer of at least $17 billion, while both Nestlé of Switzerland and Ferrero of Italy are pondering their options, according to people briefed on the discussions at the companies. Cadbury, based in London, so far has spent months stonewalling Kraft’s hostile offer. But the entrance of another bidder could help its negotiating position against Kraft. The Cadbury chairman, Roger Carr, said in an article that appeared in The Sunday Telegraph of London that the company would prefer to remain independent. But he said it would consider “any compelling offer from a serious source.” He also added that as some potential bidders were “more aligned with our business model than others, it is the value of the offer rather than the source of the offer that is our priority.” When Kraft made public its offer for Cadbury in September, many analysts immediately speculated whether Hershey, the American chocolate giant, would be forced to take action. Hershey, whose largest shareholder is a trust that oversees a school for underprivileged children, must surmount some high hurdles if it is to bid for Cadbury. The mix of financial, legal and political impediments may leave the company at a disadvantage in competing with Kraft. Not the least of Hershey’s obstacles is its size and financial firepower. As of Friday, the company’s market value was about $8.5 billion, less than half of Cadbury’s roughly £11 billion ($18.2 billion) valuation and a fraction of Kraft’s $40.1 billion value. Research analysts at JPMorgan Chase (whose investment banking arm is advising Hershey) wrote in a report last week that with about $5 billion in annual sales, $1 billion in earnings and nearly $2 billion in debt, the company could afford to take on only about $4 billion in debt before losing its investment-grade credit rating. Hershey has been working with JPMorgan and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America to line up financing for a potential bid, according to people briefed on the matter. It may also sell assets to help raise money. Representatives for Hershey and the trust declined to comment about the company’s plans. But perhaps the biggest problems facing Hershey cannot be quantified by dollar figures. Founded more than a century ago by Milton S. Hershey in the Pennsylvania town that still bears his name, the company has long been a source of local pride and local jobs. The company’s main shareholder, the Hershey Trust, owns a significant portion of Hershey’s common stock and the vast majority of its Class B stock, giving it effective control of the company. As a result of a Pennsylvania statute  enacted after an aborted $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Company  the Hershey Trust must obtain the approval of the state attorney general for any transaction that could threaten that control. The statute limits the amount of new shares Hershey could issue as part of a Cadbury bid, as does a company bylaw that automatically converts the trust’s class B shares into common stock if its holdings fall below a certain threshold. It also raises the specter of political interference if Hershey takes on the debt necessary to finance a Cadbury offer. Robert H. Sitkoff, the John L. Gray Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and an author of a study of Hershey’s attempted deal with Wrigley, described the law as contrary to the best interests of the trust, the Milton Hershey School it oversees and the company. “To call that statute unorthodox is an understatement,” he said. “It prevents the trust from diversifying, and it may well block the company from realizing the synergies of a merger.” Even before the passage of the Pennsylvania state law, which legal experts say was meant almost solely for Hershey, the company’s management and the trust were proved vulnerable to local politics. The Hershey Trust initially backed the 2002 sale of the company to Wrigley as part of a way to diversify its holdings. But D. Michael Fisher, then the state attorney general who was running for governor, sought to block the sale in the Dauphin County Orphans’ Court, arguing that the deal would endanger the Hershey School. After the judge in that case agreed, the trust scuttled the deal, and a majority of its directors subsequently resigned. Since then, Hershey has been largely restrained in its deal-making. The company even held talks with Cadbury about two years ago, to no avail. Even if Hershey has found a way to navigate the political barriers, some experts think it remains at a disadvantage to the likes of Kraft. “This kind of impediment is really going to hobble you in a fast-moving contest,” said David A. Skeel, the Arsht Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.

Hershey is considering making an offer of at least $17 billion, while both Nestlé of Switzerland and Ferrero of Italy are pondering their options, according to people briefed on the discussions at the companies. Cadbury, based in London, so far has spent months stonewalling Kraft’s hostile offer. But the entrance of another bidder could help its negotiating position against Kraft. The Cadbury chairman, Roger Carr, said in an article that appeared in The Sunday Telegraph of London that the company would prefer to remain independent. But he said it would consider “any compelling offer from a serious source.” He also added that as some potential bidders were “more aligned with our business model than others, it is the value of the offer rather than the source of the offer that is our priority.” When Kraft made public its offer for Cadbury in September, many analysts immediately speculated whether Hershey, the American chocolate giant, would be forced to take action. Hershey, whose largest shareholder is a trust that oversees a school for underprivileged children, must surmount some high hurdles if it is to bid for Cadbury. The mix of financial, legal and political impediments may leave the company at a disadvantage in competing with Kraft. Not the least of Hershey’s obstacles is its size and financial firepower. As of Friday, the company’s market value was about $8.5 billion, less than half of Cadbury’s roughly £11 billion ($18.2 billion) valuation and a fraction of Kraft’s $40.1 billion value. Research analysts at JPMorgan Chase (whose investment banking arm is advising Hershey) wrote in a report last week that with about $5 billion in annual sales, $1 billion in earnings and nearly $2 billion in debt, the company could afford to take on only about $4 billion in debt before losing its investment-grade credit rating. Hershey has been working with JPMorgan and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America to line up financing for a potential bid, according to people briefed on the matter. It may also sell assets to help raise money. Representatives for Hershey and the trust declined to comment about the company’s plans. But perhaps the biggest problems facing Hershey cannot be quantified by dollar figures. Founded more than a century ago by Milton S. Hershey in the Pennsylvania town that still bears his name, the company has long been a source of local pride and local jobs. The company’s main shareholder, the Hershey Trust, owns a significant portion of Hershey’s common stock and the vast majority of its Class B stock, giving it effective control of the company. As a result of a Pennsylvania statute  enacted after an aborted $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Company  the Hershey Trust must obtain the approval of the state attorney general for any transaction that could threaten that control. The statute limits the amount of new shares Hershey could issue as part of a Cadbury bid, as does a company bylaw that automatically converts the trust’s class B shares into common stock if its holdings fall below a certain threshold. It also raises the specter of political interference if Hershey takes on the debt necessary to finance a Cadbury offer. Robert H. Sitkoff, the John L. Gray Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and an author of a study of Hershey’s attempted deal with Wrigley, described the law as contrary to the best interests of the trust, the Milton Hershey School it oversees and the company. “To call that statute unorthodox is an understatement,” he said. “It prevents the trust from diversifying, and it may well block the company from realizing the synergies of a merger.” Even before the passage of the Pennsylvania state law, which legal experts say was meant almost solely for Hershey, the company’s management and the trust were proved vulnerable to local politics. The Hershey Trust initially backed the 2002 sale of the company to Wrigley as part of a way to diversify its holdings. But D. Michael Fisher, then the state attorney general who was running for governor, sought to block the sale in the Dauphin County Orphans’ Court, arguing that the deal would endanger the Hershey School. After the judge in that case agreed, the trust scuttled the deal, and a majority of its directors subsequently resigned. Since then, Hershey has been largely restrained in its deal-making. The company even held talks with Cadbury about two years ago, to no avail. Even if Hershey has found a way to navigate the political barriers, some experts think it remains at a disadvantage to the likes of Kraft. “This kind of impediment is really going to hobble you in a fast-moving contest,” said David A. Skeel, the Arsht Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/22/opinion/22lubow.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">My Chocolate Meltdown<date>Published: November 21, 2009</date><text>TO investment bankers, it’s welcome news that Kraft Foods is offering more than $16 billion to acquire the British candymaker Cadbury: Maybe the frozen credit markets are thawing.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Chocolate Four years ago, another American food giant, Hershey, swallowed up a small chocolate company named Scharffen Berger. Started in 1997 by a sparkling-wine producer, John Scharffenberger, and a doctor, Robert Steinberg, Scharffen Berger set out to make an American chocolate that was as delicious as a European confection. And, amazingly, the company succeeded. First in Dr. Steinberg’s kitchen and later in a handsome factory in the industrial section of Berkeley, Calif., Scharffen Berger developed a line of products that won the brand a passionate following. I myself became devoted to the 82 percent cacao extra-dark bar, with its unctuous mouth feel and fruity, acidic punch. On top of creating a first-rate product, Scharffen Berger kick-started a movement. High-end artisanal chocolate became the fastest-growing sector of the market. Naturally, the big boys noticed. In January 2005, Scharffen Berger received an unsolicited offer from Hershey. The owners had not yet begun to consider selling the company. Revenues had hit $10 million and were escalating quickly. It made sense to hold onto the business for a while. But Hershey, the Pennsylvania behemoth, would not take no for an answer and kept raising its offer. That August, for a price reported to be nearly $50 million, Hershey acquired Scharffen Berger. The company kept John Scharffenberger as a consultant and promised not to change the quality of the brand. The promise lasted as long as a Hershey’s Kiss on a summer afternoon. Soon I began noticing a marked deterioration in my beloved 82 percent bar. The texture was chalky. The cherry notes had vanished. It was becoming just another mediocre American chocolate. But luckily, long before this year’s announcement by Hershey that it was closing the Berkeley plant and consolidating Scharffen Berger production in Illinois, I discovered an alternative. Green &amp; Black’s, an English brand, was readily available in New York, and if its 85 percent bar didn’t have quite the flavor bouquet that Scharffen Berger 82 packed back in its heyday, it came very close, and the mouth feel was arguably better. Interestingly, Green &amp; Black’s had also been started by small entrepreneurs and then acquired in 2005 by a giant firm. But its new parent, Cadbury, vowed to let it operate as a stand-alone unit. Judging from my research, which has been basically confined to unwrapping the foil of countless bars and plunging in, Cadbury has been true to its word. So it was with a sense of alarm that I read in September that Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Philadelphia cream cheese, among many other brands, was trying to gobble up Cadbury, which is best known for such products as Dairy Milk chocolate and Trident gum. For Kraft, the deal no doubt makes sense: Mars, the maker of M&amp;Ms and the new owner of Wrigley gum, would no longer be the world’s biggest candy maker. The expanded Kraft would be at the top of the sugar hill, having ramped up its own gum offerings and, perhaps more critically, its global distribution network. But I found it hard to care much whether Asian consumers will have an easier time procuring Planters peanut bars and Toblerone bars at their corner store. What frightened me about the proposed deal was the threat to the privileged autonomy of Green &amp; Black’s. Although Cadbury rejected the offer, Kraft has continued to push. Still, I began to think that maybe I was being too pessimistic. As Kraft shares dipped, its offer was diminishing in value. Cadbury might very well retain its independence. And even if Kraft does buy Cadbury, I assured myself, the American giant will see the wisdom in maintaining the quality of Green &amp; Black’s, a brand that has no reason to exist if it does not continue to satisfy connoisseurs who can tell that a Milk Dud is really a dud. Yes, Hershey had perversely seduced a high-quality brand and then stripped away its conquest’s quality. But perhaps Kraft would be better about honoring the artisanal excellence of my 85 percent bar than Hershey had been with the lamented 82. Last week, it was reported that Hershey is considering its own offer for Cadbury. I have started the search for my next chocolate bar. Arthur Lubow is a contributing writer for The Times Magazine.

The company has been working with JPMorgan Chase and the Merrill Lynch unit of Bank of America to line up the financing for such an offer. Kraft has so far emerged as the only suitor for Cadbury, and were it to succeed it would become an international food giant that could threaten Hershey’s expansion prospects. Working in Hershey’s favor is Cadbury’s reluctance to team up with Kraft, which the British company has derided as a low-growth food conglomerate that would stunt its opportunities. Even before Kraft made its hostile approach in September, Hershey had been considering its options, including a potential merger with Cadbury. The two already share ties: Hershey makes and distributes Cadbury products like Creme Eggs in the United States. Hershey had long assumed that it could not afford to strike a deal on its own, especially because Kraft had already locked up nine banks to provide a $9.2 billion loan. But with the financing markets having opened up this year, Hershey may become emboldened to take that step. In the past, Hershey has been restrained in business matters by the Hershey Trust, a 104-year-old charitable organization that oversees the Milton Hershey School, an institution for underprivileged children in Pennsylvania. Because of the trust, which controls about 79 percent of the company’s voting shares, and local opposition, Hershey scuttled a $12.5 billion sale to the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company in 2002 and has since become more reluctant to make deals. Many analysts and deal makers had thought the chances of Hershey’s challenging Kraft were slim. Hershey’s market value as of Friday was about $8.5 billion, a fraction of Kraft’s $40.1 billion value. Hershey also had only $119 million in cash on hand as of Oct. 4, although it had about $1.7 billion in total debt, leaving it with the ability to borrow a considerable sum. By contrast, while Kraft has nearly $3 billion in cash on hand, it had nearly $21 billion in total debt as of Sept. 30. Hershey shares edged up 4 cents on Friday, to $37.18, before reports broke about its serious consideration of a deal. Shares in Kraft also climbed a little, to $27.17, up 20 cents. Shares in Cadbury rose 1.2 percent, to about £8 or about $13.20, and have climbed about 40 percent since Kraft first publicized its offer in early September. Many investors have accumulated Cadbury stock, including hedge funds like Paulson &amp; Company, which are betting that the British company will ultimately agree to a merger. Kraft made a formal offer to Cadbury’s board last week, starting the clock on a tightly scheduled process governed by Britain’s takeover code. Once Kraft formally mails its letter to Cadbury’s shareholders, it has 46 days to raise its offer. Analysts have said that Kraft would be hard pressed to raise its current offer of cash and stock, initially worth about £7.17 for each Cadbury share. Warren E. Buffett, Kraft’s largest shareholder, has described the company’s current bid as adequate. If Hershey were to leap into the contest, it would try to reach a friendly deal with Cadbury, according to one person briefed on the matter. Behind the scenes, people close to Hershey have held talks with representatives for Cadbury, although there have been no formal negotiations. Besides JPMorgan and Bank of America, Hershey has also been working with Byron D. Trott, the former Goldman Sachs executive long known as Mr. Buffett’s favorite banker. But because of Mr. Buffett’s position in Kraft, he is unlikely to give Hershey any help. Hershey also has held talks with Ferrero, the family-controlled Italian confectioner that makes Rocher chocolates and Tic Tac mints, people briefed on the matter said. The two had been considering sharing control of Cadbury, although these people cautioned that no agreement may be reached. Ferrero is being advised by Rothschild and the Italian bank Mediobanca. Complicating Hershey’s deliberations is the Hershey Trust, which has served in the past largely as a brake on Hershey’s boldest business decisions. Deal makers point to the attempted Wrigley deal, in which the trust initially approved as a way to diversify its holdings. But local opposition  including from Pennsylvania’s attorney general at the time, residents of Hershey’s hometown and alumni of the Hershey school  persuaded a state court judge to criticize the trust’s decision as an abandonment of its mission. The trust reversed its support for the Wrigley merger, and four months later more than half its directors resigned.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » Felicity Loudon, the granddaughter of the former Cadbury Brothers managing director Egbert Cadbury, was quoted in The Sunday Telegraph saying that she was “particularly saddened by the possibility of one of the last remaining British icons disappearing into an American plastic cheese company.” After giving the back of her hand to Kraft, she made a plea to her fellow countrymen: “I cannot believe that something can’t be done for totally patriotic reasons.” Let’s set aside for a moment the charged rhetoric over the merits of Cheez Whiz versus a Dairy Milk candy bar, and consider this instead as Exhibit A in the argument that maybe, just maybe, the notion of shareholder democracy isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. First, some context. Kraft’s $16.7 billion hostile takeover bid for Cadbury, the confectionery company, is one of the largest deals of the year. If the takeover battle were happening in the United States, it would most likely be a fierce fight. And yet when I visited London two weeks ago, there wasn’t much talk of a fight at all. Indeed, most takeover experts I talked to said the deal is a fait accompli  it’s just a matter of time and the price Kraft will end up paying. The reason is that, unlike in the United States, British takeover law essentially handcuffs the board of a target company from doing anything to block a deal. No poison pills. No staggered boards. No changing the shareholder vote date. The potential for a C.E.O. or entrenched board to block a deal  or otherwise act in its own self- interest  is virtually nil. In other words, England is as close as any country gets to a true shareholder democracy. Any bid gets put to a vote, and all the board can do is offer an opinion. To many people, this is how the rest of the world should work. “I’m a majority-rules guy,” said Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. “The U.K. system is better.” Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management, also said that, in theory, the British system has much to commend it. “Economists will say it is much purer,” he said. “It creates a tremendous fluidity.” So what’s not to like? Professor Sonnenfeld noted an important asterisk  that this push for shareholder democracy may create a perverse incentive system so that short-term shareholders can end up determining the long-term fate of the company. So the balance of interests becomes skewed. “It raises a question about short-termism,” Professor Sonnenfeld said. Indeed, one parlor game in London has been to guess how much of Cadbury’s long-term shareholder base has already sold out to arbitrageurs, whose goal is to see the company sold as quickly as possible and then move on to another deal. (That’s not to say the right strategic decision isn’t for Cadbury to be sold to Kraft, though that’s the position of Cadbury’s board.) People involved in the deal estimate that about a third of the shares have already changed hands, moving from long-term shareholders to hedge funds. Those funds, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law School, “have a long-term time horizon of about 12 minutes.” If the board lacks power to weigh in on the deal, that also means nobody with any clout is looking out for other stakeholders, like employees. Most mergers never live up to their hype, resulting in lower values and fewer jobs. So the question worth asking is: Shouldn’t someone be looking further into the future? That’s been the argument of people like Martin Lipton, the takeover lawyer who invented the poison pill. He has long argued that shareholders don’t necessarily know what’s good for them, and that companies need someone looking out for their best interests. That best interest may include holding out for a higher offer, or even roping in other bidders. As a result, he has often been branded a friend of entrenched boards. Without the first-line defense of boards, shareholders may simply jump at the first bid. “It gives the company less negotiating leverage,” Professor Sonnenfeld said. That’s certainly the argument that some Cadbury insiders and bankers made to me, saying they feel helpless that their votes count for so little in this case study in shareholder democracy. There is also very little evidence that shareholder democracy works better than directors in deal-making. A number of academic studies suggest it is a wash. There will always be exceptions to every rule. Some boards make bad calls. “Look at the lost opportunity with Yahoo and Microsoft,” said Professor Sonnenfeld about the decision by Yahoo’s board to originally block Microsoft’s offer, a decision that probably lost Yahoo shareholders billions. Professor Kaplan argues that both boards and shareholders will always make mistakes, but that when shareholders are in charge, “Net-net, the shareholder wins.” And he may have a point: While Cadbury’s fate may now be in the hands of fast-money arbitrageurs, “some long-term investor had to make the decision to sell.” And selling is in itself a vote on the long-term future of the company. Democracy is indeed messy. The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

Professor Kaplan argues that both boards and shareholders will always make mistakes, but that when shareholders are in charge, “Net-net, the shareholder wins.” And he may have a point: While Cadbury’s fate may now be in the hands of fast-money arbitrageurs, “some long-term investor had to make the decision to sell.” And selling is in itself a vote on the long-term future of the company. Democracy is indeed messy.

No less was expected from the leader of the Cadbury defense team. But it’s ironic that Mr. Carr’s resolve in an earlier hostile takeover battle may well have helped inspire Kraft’s latest move on Cadbury. Skip to next paragraph Frantzesco Kangaris/Bloomberg News Kraft wants to buy the British confectioner Cadbury for $16.7 billion. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Go to your Portfolio » As chairman of Centrica, the gas company, Mr. Carr oversaw Britain’s last such contest  an unsolicited £1.4 billion takeover of another energy company, Venture Production. Centrica’s offer became unconditional shortly before Kraft’s informal proposal in September to buy Cadbury. Mr. Carr is now on the other side of the table. Like Centrica, Kraft formalized its bid shortly before the expiration of a deadline set by Britain’s takeover panel. And like Centrica, Kraft is playing hardball on price. Kraft hasn’t ruled out making a higher offer, but it is keeping the price down so far. After the decline in both Kraft’s share price and the dollar, Cadbury shareholders are now being offered 4 percent less than they were in September. Kraft will be hoping that it can repeat Centrica’s success in completing a hostile takeover without raising its initial bid. Venture’s shareholders succumbed, despite the arguing by the board and analysts that the offer “substantially undervalued” the company. Kraft doesn’t have as strong a hand as Centrica did. Shortly before beginning its offer, Centrica bolstered its stake in Venture to 29.9 percent by buying shares from a longstanding investor. That secured votes and gave its bid greater legitimacy. Investors are betting Kraft won’t repeat Mr. Carr’s success at Centrica. Cadbury shares closed on Monday at a 7 percent premium to the value of Kraft’s offer. Still, arbitrage traders should tread carefully. Kraft’s hand has been strengthened by the absence of competing bidders. However compelling Cadbury’s defense, the company’s stock could move lower in the absence of an alternative to Kraft’s bid. With time, there is a real chance that Cadbury’s shareholders will follow those of Venture and break ranks as Kraft’s offer begins to look more appealing. A Buyout of Yore The private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic are going back to the future with their latest buyout. They are buying Northrop Grumman’s defense consulting division, TASC, for $1.65 billion. The so-called carve-out looks to be one of the opportunistic deals that were traditional before buyouts got huge. It has a manageable capital structure, too. It doesn’t seem much like the typical deal of just a couple of years ago. Then, size seemed as important as value. Private equity firms offered big premiums for huge public companies, and buyouts got as big as $50 billion. Banks committed debt worth as much as eight times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Many of those deals are now struggling. By contrast, TASC’s buyout seems old-fashioned. Northrop, the military contractor, needs to sell its consulting business because owning it is now viewed as a conflict of interest by the government, its biggest customer. So the two buyout firms didn’t need to pay through the nose to attract an unwilling seller. The deal’s debt levels mimic pre-boom deals, too. The debt-to-earnings ratio will be around five times. That’s in the range of the leverage in buyouts from 1999 to 2004, according to Standard and Poor’s Leverage Commentary and Data. The deal could say something about the size of the new generation of buyouts. The TASC purchase would have easily made the top 10 largest deals for several years, from 2000 to 2003, leading up to the boom, according to Dealogic. The biggest deal so far this year for the newly modest private equity club was the $5 billion buyout of IMS Health by TPG last week. There are some drifts away from the old model. The TASC deal includes mezzanine financing, which has both debt and equity characteristics and which also showed up in the IMS buyout. Old-school leveraged buyouts didn’t always need this layer of financing. But it may be a regular feature of such deals for as long as straight debt financing is relatively scarce. Either way, the “new” buyout model is becoming clearer  and it looks quite a bit like the old one.

Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Go to your Portfolio » But Kraft did not raise its offer, sticking with its original proposal from September. Kraft, whose products include Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies, offered £3, or $4.90, in cash and 0.2589 new Kraft shares for every Cadbury share. The offer values each Cadbury share at £7.17, a 26 percent premium to the price before Kraft made its original proposal. Cadbury’s shares initially dropped 1.72 percent in London after Kraft’s announcement, indicating that investors became less optimistic that a deal would materialize, before increasing slightly. The shares remained above the offer price, at £7.63 a share. Analysts had expected Kraft to sweeten its original proposal. But in its filing with the London Stock Exchange, Kraft again asserted that its latest offer was full and fairly priced. Monday’s offer, it said, had an enterprise value of 13.9 times Cadbury’s 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Cadbury’s own acquisition of Adams in 2002 was valued at 12.8 times such earnings, Kraft said. That was not enough to persuade the Cadbury board to change its mind. “The repetition of a proposal which is now of less value and lower than the current Cadbury share price does not make it any more attractive,” Roger Carr, the company’s chairman, said in a statement. “As a result, the board has emphatically rejected this derisory offer and has strengthened its resolve to ensure the true value of Cadbury is fully understood by all.” The reason the offer was lower than the September proposal, Cadbury’s board said, was because Kraft’s share price declined 4 percent since then. “Kraft’s offer does not come remotely close to reflecting the true value of our company,” Mr. Carr said, “and involves the unattractive prospect of the absorption of Cadbury into a low-growth conglomerate business model.” Kraft now must post an official offer to Cadbury shareholders, which triggers a period for investors to respond. Analysts had long supported Kraft’s rationale for the merger, which would add Trident gum and Dairy Milk chocolates to Kraft’s brands and help the American food company expand into faster-growing countries like India, South Africa and Mexico. But they said Kraft would have to increase its offer to at least £8 a Cadbury share to succeed. “We remain convinced of the strategic merits for both companies of combining Kraft Foods and Cadbury,” the Kraft chief executive, Irene Rosenfeld, said in a statement. “We believe that our proposal offers the best immediate and long-term value for Cadbury’s shareholders and for the company itself.” Rival bidders for Cadbury have not emerged. Kraft’s move on Monday was the result of a deadline set by Britain’s Takeover Panel to either make a bid Monday or be barred from making another for Cadbury for six months. This month, Kraft cut its forecast for net organic revenue growth, disappointing analysts even as its third-quarter results beat expectations. Cadbury’s management and board have said that Kraft’s offer substantially undervalues its future prospects. Last month, Cadbury reported stronger-than-expected results, which it said reinforced its argument that the company’s prospects were better as an independent entity than as part of a “low-growth” conglomerate. Kraft reiterated that it expected a merger to achieve $625 million in pretax annual cost savings and that there was “potential for meaningful revenue synergies.” A combination would create a global food and confectionery giant with more than 40 confectionery brands and annual revenue of $50 billion, Kraft said. Since Kraft first showed interest in September, analysts and deal makers have watched the repartee with Cadbury in what would be one of the biggest mergers this year, if Kraft succeeds.

Skip to next paragraph Kraft Foods/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Kraft originally chose the name iSnack2.0 from almost 50,000 entries in a competition to name its new Vegemite product, but then bowed to public anger and agreed to call the product Cheesybite. The executives at Kraft Foods Australia, the company that makes Vegemite — the salty, gooey yeast paste beloved by millions of Australians — are still awaiting the answer to that question after a recent experiment with the country’s most recognized food product went awry. It all began in July when jars of caramel-brown Vegemite mixed with cream cheese began appearing on supermarket shelves with brightly colored labels inviting consumers to “Name Me.” After weeks of secrecy, during which the company sold more than 3 million jars of the new product to a population of just 22 million people, Kraft took an expensive advertising slot during a nationally televised Australian-rules football final Sept. 26 to announce its winner: Vegemite iSnack 2.0. The reaction was fierce. Vegemite-loving consumers took to the Internet to voice their collective indignation about the name. Thousands of Twitter posts, at least a dozen Facebook groups and a Web site dedicated to “Names that are better than iSnack 2.0” blasted American-owned Kraft for tampering with an Australian icon. One online commentator suggested that the 27-year-old designer who had submitted the winning name be tarred with Vegemite and forced to run naked through the streets of Sydney “as retribution for his cultural crime.” Others called the name “uStupid 1.0” and “un-Australian.” After four days, Kraft announced that it would put the name back to a vote. This time, it put forward six rather more conventional choices — including Vegemate, Snackmate and Vegemild — from which Cheesybite was elected through an online and telephone poll. The controversy quickly died away. Australians are passionate about Vegemite. Travel almost anywhere and you are likely to find an Aussie with a tube of the brewer’s yeast extract stashed in his bag. Babies are weaned on it. Schoolchildren eat it on sandwiches. Adults revere it as a hangover remedy, a vital source of Vitamin B and a staple breakfast food — spread lightly on hot buttered toast. “Australian food was really bad until the 1970s: boiled meat and vegetables without any butter or salt. Vegemite was one of the things that actually had any flavor, and that’s why it became so incredibly popular,” said Bill Granger, well known Sydney chef and the author of several modern Australian cookbooks. “It’s one of the only foods that is unique to Australia, and people see it as being quintessentially Australian.” Similar versions of the product exist elsewhere. Britain has Marmite, for example, but many Australians consider that an inferior substitute. Even Mr. Granger, who spends part of each year in London, said he always kept a supply of Vegemite on hand for his children. Simon Talbot, the head of corporate affairs at Kraft Foods Australia, said the company had taken only 72 hours to decide that the iSnack 2.0 name was “not worth defending,” given the level of outrage. But the furor was already paying dividends: Sales of iSnack 2.0 rose 47 percent during its first two weeks with the name, while sales of the original Vegemite were largely unaffected. (Jars with the Cheesybite name will appear on shelves only after Kraft unloads about 500,000 jars printed with the iSnack 2.0 name — in two or three months). “In the first week, we were in 15 percent of Australian households, which is unheard of. It usually takes many months to get that sort of impact,” Mr. Talbot said. “Time will tell the success of the product, but to date, the lack of cannibalization of the core product and the level of new uptake indicates that we’re onto a very, very successful winner for us.” The executives at Kraft chose iSnack 2.0 to reflect the fact that the product had been developed using information gleaned from thousands of online surveys indicating that customers wanted a more portable, spreadable, snack-able version of Vegemite. But a marketing concept that lives by the Internet can also die by the Internet. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »SYDNEY — What do you get when you take an iconic food product, change its ingredients and release it under a kitschy new name, prompting cries of outrage and a storm of media coverage: A marketing failure or a publicity coup?

Britain has Marmite, for example, but many Australians consider that an inferior substitute. Even Mr. Granger, who spends part of each year in London, said he always kept a supply of Vegemite on hand for his children. Simon Talbot, the head of corporate affairs at Kraft Foods Australia, said the company had taken only 72 hours to decide that the iSnack 2.0 name was “not worth defending,” given the level of outrage. But the furor was already paying dividends: Sales of iSnack 2.0 rose 47 percent during its first two weeks with the name, while sales of the original Vegemite were largely unaffected. (Jars with the Cheesybite name will appear on shelves only after Kraft unloads about 500,000 jars printed with the iSnack 2.0 name — in two or three months). “In the first week, we were in 15 percent of Australian households, which is unheard of. It usually takes many months to get that sort of impact,” Mr. Talbot said. “Time will tell the success of the product, but to date, the lack of cannibalization of the core product and the level of new uptake indicates that we’re onto a very, very successful winner for us.” The executives at Kraft chose iSnack 2.0 to reflect the fact that the product had been developed using information gleaned from thousands of online surveys indicating that customers wanted a more portable, spreadable, snack-able version of Vegemite. But a marketing concept that lives by the Internet can also die by the Internet. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/business/global/01kraft.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Deadline Set on Kraft’s Bid for Cadbury<date>Published: September 30, 2009</date><text>A British regulator told the food products company Kraft on Wednesday that it must make a binding takeover offer for Cadbury, the chocolate retailer, by Nov. 9 or walk away for six months.

Skip to next paragraph Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg News Cadbury says its chief, Todd Stitzer, was misconstrued. The controversy erupted when some remarks Mr. Stitzer made at an investor seminar in London on Tuesday were interpreted by some in the audience to mean that Cadbury saw some merit in a combination with Kraft, a larger rival, and was just holding out for a higher price. Cadbury, the British chocolate retailer, said Friday that Mr. Stitzer’s remarks were “seriously misrepresented” and that it was in touch with Britain’s Takeover Panel about the issue. At the two-day conference, Mr. Stitzer was asked about the strategic merit of a combination with Kraft, but “commentary on this issue has misconstrued Mr. Stitzer’s remarks to imply a softening of his view regarding a combination,” the company said in a statement Friday. “For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Stitzer does not believe that Kraft’s proposal makes strategic or financial sense for Cadbury, and his comments should not be interpreted in any other way,” it added. On Sept. 7, Cadbury rejected a takeover proposal from Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Toblerone chocolates, that valued the British confectioner at $16.7 billion, saying it undervalued the company. Cadbury’s share price has traded above the offer price ever since, with investors expecting a higher bid either from Kraft or another rival, like Hershey or Nestlé. Some analysts had previously said that Cadbury could be worth as much as 43 percent more per share than what Kraft offered. Cadbury’s share price closed up Friday for a fourth straight day, adding 5.5 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 800.5 pence In an attempt to encourage higher bids, Cadbury asked the Takeover Panel to give Kraft an ultimatum either to make a formal takeover offer or to walk away. A decision by the panel, an independent body responsible for supervising and regulating takeovers in Britain, is expected as early as the coming week. A spokesman for the Takeover Panel did not return phone calls seeking comment. Cadbury has tried to clarify Mr. Stitzer’s comments ever since a sales specialist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note issued to his clients that “Todd admitted that there is some strategic sense in combining the two companies and he doesn’t expect Kraft to walk away, so he said his job is to get as much value as possible,” Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing the note. Mr. Stitzer also allegedly gave a range for a fair takeover price, according to the initial note. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch later said that Mr. Stitzer did not discuss a fair price. It would be highly unusual for a chief executive of a takeover target to comment on a successful offer price before entering into discussions with the bidder. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment. Roger Carr, the Cadbury chairman, wrote Sept. 12 in a letter to Irene Rosenfeld, the Kraft chief executive, that Kraft’s proposal was unattractive because Kraft had a “considerably less focused business mix and historically lower growth” than Cadbury. The proposal also “fundamentally fails to reflect the current value of Cadbury,” its growth prospects and potential cost savings of a combination, he wrote. Cadbury said Friday that its “position in relation to Kraft’s proposal remained precisely as set out in the letter” written by Mr. Carr. The U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, who is also Kraft’s largest shareholder, has described the offer as adequate.

Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Go to your Portfolio » One recent Monday, the day’s headlines included agreed, proposed and rumored transactions totaling $37 billion. The biggest of them was Kraft Foods’ unsolicited proposal to take over Cadbury, the leading company for British confectionery goods. The latest crop of Merger Mondays has encouragingly lacked the overexuberance of the boom a few years ago. In nearly every case, there were good reasons for considering deals  cost savings, plausible growth plans or regulatory changes. With the market in recovery mode and once-spendthrift buyout firms largely on the sidelines, sanity looks to be prevailing. Yet further excitement over rising stock markets and a recovering lending appetite could bring the return of some old bugbears. Chief among these are so-called revenue synergies, a phrase some analysts have used in relation to Kraft’s bid for Cadbury. This refers to the notion that combining two companies can increase sales beyond what they can achieve separately. A study by McKinsey &amp; Company a few years ago found that 70 percent of mergers failed to achieve anticipated gains of this type, many missing targets by a big margin. Cutting out overlapping costs was generally found to be more achievable, with many mergers moving reasonably close to targets. Revenue synergies stand a better chance of happening when a big business buys a small one that has a good product that can then be sold through the larger company’s network. By contrast, squishing two giants like Kraft and Cadbury together risks cannibalizing their standalone businesses and causing customers to demand bigger discounts. Such a merger can also distract employees during the integration and cost-cutting process. That’s why, at least since the dot-com bust, it has generally been frowned upon for mergers to rely on revenue synergies, or even for acquirers to try to quantify them. Indeed, some investors regard attempts to do so as a red flag. Kraft is abiding by this tenet so far, but if Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive, wants to push her price for Cadbury further, she may be tempted to dip her hand into the revenue synergies bucket. Tasty Synergies Ms. Rosenfeld is widely regarded in the food industry as an innovator. So even if Kraft resists the urge to dangle the notion of revenue synergies, there may actually be some hope of squeezing out a few more dollars by creating new products combining Kraft and Cadbury brands. To wit, Breakingviews.com offers a few examples, from plausible to implausible: Dairy Milk Oreo Bar: Take America’s most popular sandwich cookie, turn it into a rectangle and then cover it with a coating of Cadbury’s trademark chocolate, and voilà! Brand synergy at its finest. Add the Planters peanuts of Kraft, and the group has a candy bar to take on the Mars/Wrigley/Snickers juggernaut. Max Chew: Chewing gum isn’t just about taste. It can also deliver salutary benefits like fresh breath, whiter teeth and nutrients. So why not make it addictive and functional, too, with the introduction of a caffeinated chew powered by the Maxwell House coffee of Kraft? ChocoBacon: With the bacon craze in full swing, brand extensions abound for the Oscar Mayer subsidiary of Kraft. Foodies are well acquainted with chocolate-covered bacon treats. But with Kraft’s marketing muscle, ChocoBacon could make its way to the shelves of mainstream supermarkets. Violet Beauregarde: This new brand takes its name from the character who swiped a test treat from the assembly line at Willy Wonka’s factory that simulated the tastes of a three-course roast beef dinner. The Violet Beauregarde line cuts across the Kraft-Cadbury flavor spectrum: from mouthwatering appetizers like Cracker Barrel cheese on Ritz Crackers, to Oscar Mayer hot dogs with Stove Top Stuffing, ending with a sweet smorgasbord of Cadbury Flake, Crunchie and Swedish Fish.

The executives at Kraft Foods Australia, the company that makes Vegemite — the salty, gooey yeast paste beloved by millions of Australians — are still awaiting the answer to that question after a recent experiment with the country’s most recognized food product went awry. It all began in July when jars of caramel-brown Vegemite mixed with cream cheese began appearing on supermarket shelves with brightly colored labels inviting consumers to “Name Me.” After weeks of secrecy, during which the company sold more than 3 million jars of the new product to a population of just 22 million people, Kraft took an expensive advertising slot during a nationally televised Australian-rules football final Sept. 26 to announce its winner: Vegemite iSnack 2.0. The reaction was fierce. Vegemite-loving consumers took to the Internet to voice their collective indignation about the name. Thousands of Twitter posts, at least a dozen Facebook groups and a Web site dedicated to “Names that are better than iSnack 2.0” blasted American-owned Kraft for tampering with an Australian icon. One online commentator suggested that the 27-year-old designer who had submitted the winning name be tarred with Vegemite and forced to run naked through the streets of Sydney “as retribution for his cultural crime.” Others called the name “uStupid 1.0” and “un-Australian.” After four days, Kraft announced that it would put the name back to a vote. This time, it put forward six rather more conventional choices — including Vegemate, Snackmate and Vegemild — from which Cheesybite was elected through an online and telephone poll. The controversy quickly died away. Australians are passionate about Vegemite. Travel almost anywhere and you are likely to find an Aussie with a tube of the brewer’s yeast extract stashed in his bag.

In a statement of its own on Wednesday, Cadbury said that “the board’s view has not changed since then and the board reiterates its rejection of Kraft’s approach.” The deadline was made at the request of Cadbury, presumably in the hope that Kraft would both formalize and raise its bid. By Nov. 9, Kraft must either make a formal bid or issue a statement that it is walking away from the deal, in which case it could not make another offer for six months, the regulator, British Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, said on its Web site. “If Kraft is smart, it will wait until just before the deadline to see if counterbids are made,” Marco Gulpers, an analyst at ING Financial Markets, said. Whether Kraft will raise its cash-and-stock offer is uncertain, especially if it faces no serious competition. Mr. Gulpers said major shareholders in Kraft wanted to restrain management from going much higher, but the company might have to raise the bid, worth 745 pence (or $12.22) a share when it was made public Sept. 7.

Skip to next paragraph Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg News Cadbury says its chief, Todd Stitzer, was misconstrued. The controversy erupted when some remarks Mr. Stitzer made at an investor seminar in London on Tuesday were interpreted by some in the audience to mean that Cadbury saw some merit in a combination with Kraft, a larger rival, and was just holding out for a higher price. Cadbury, the British chocolate retailer, said Friday that Mr. Stitzer’s remarks were “seriously misrepresented” and that it was in touch with Britain’s Takeover Panel about the issue. At the two-day conference, Mr. Stitzer was asked about the strategic merit of a combination with Kraft, but “commentary on this issue has misconstrued Mr. Stitzer’s remarks to imply a softening of his view regarding a combination,” the company said in a statement Friday. “For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Stitzer does not believe that Kraft’s proposal makes strategic or financial sense for Cadbury, and his comments should not be interpreted in any other way,” it added. On Sept. 7, Cadbury rejected a takeover proposal from Kraft, the maker of Oreo cookies and Toblerone chocolates, that valued the British confectioner at $16.7 billion, saying it undervalued the company. Cadbury’s share price has traded above the offer price ever since, with investors expecting a higher bid either from Kraft or another rival, like Hershey or Nestlé. Some analysts had previously said that Cadbury could be worth as much as 43 percent more per share than what Kraft offered. Cadbury’s share price closed up Friday for a fourth straight day, adding 5.5 pence, or 0.7 percent, to 800.5 pence In an attempt to encourage higher bids, Cadbury asked the Takeover Panel to give Kraft an ultimatum either to make a formal takeover offer or to walk away. A decision by the panel, an independent body responsible for supervising and regulating takeovers in Britain, is expected as early as the coming week. A spokesman for the Takeover Panel did not return phone calls seeking comment. Cadbury has tried to clarify Mr. Stitzer’s comments ever since a sales specialist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a note issued to his clients that “Todd admitted that there is some strategic sense in combining the two companies and he doesn’t expect Kraft to walk away, so he said his job is to get as much value as possible,” Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing the note. Mr. Stitzer also allegedly gave a range for a fair takeover price, according to the initial note. But Bank of America Merrill Lynch later said that Mr. Stitzer did not discuss a fair price. It would be highly unusual for a chief executive of a takeover target to comment on a successful offer price before entering into discussions with the bidder. A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment. Roger Carr, the Cadbury chairman, wrote Sept. 12 in a letter to Irene Rosenfeld, the Kraft chief executive, that Kraft’s proposal was unattractive because Kraft had a “considerably less focused business mix and historically lower growth” than Cadbury. The proposal also “fundamentally fails to reflect the current value of Cadbury,” its growth prospects and potential cost savings of a combination, he wrote. Cadbury said Friday that its “position in relation to Kraft’s proposal remained precisely as set out in the letter” written by Mr. Carr. The U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett, who is also Kraft’s largest shareholder, has described the offer as adequate.

But will they stay sensible? Skip to next paragraph Mike Cassese/Reuters Irene Rosenfeld is the chief executive of Kraft Foods. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Cadbury Plc Go to your Portfolio » One recent Monday, the day’s headlines included agreed, proposed and rumored transactions totaling $37 billion. The biggest of them was Kraft Foods’ unsolicited proposal to take over Cadbury, the leading company for British confectionery goods. The latest crop of Merger Mondays has encouragingly lacked the overexuberance of the boom a few years ago. In nearly every case, there were good reasons for considering deals  cost savings, plausible growth plans or regulatory changes. With the market in recovery mode and once-spendthrift buyout firms largely on the sidelines, sanity looks to be prevailing. Yet further excitement over rising stock markets and a recovering lending appetite could bring the return of some old bugbears. Chief among these are so-called revenue synergies, a phrase some analysts have used in relation to Kraft’s bid for Cadbury. This refers to the notion that combining two companies can increase sales beyond what they can achieve separately. A study by McKinsey &amp; Company a few years ago found that 70 percent of mergers failed to achieve anticipated gains of this type, many missing targets by a big margin. Cutting out overlapping costs was generally found to be more achievable, with many mergers moving reasonably close to targets. Revenue synergies stand a better chance of happening when a big business buys a small one that has a good product that can then be sold through the larger company’s network. By contrast, squishing two giants like Kraft and Cadbury together risks cannibalizing their standalone businesses and causing customers to demand bigger discounts. Such a merger can also distract employees during the integration and cost-cutting process. That’s why, at least since the dot-com bust, it has generally been frowned upon for mergers to rely on revenue synergies, or even for acquirers to try to quantify them. Indeed, some investors regard attempts to do so as a red flag. Kraft is abiding by this tenet so far, but if Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive, wants to push her price for Cadbury further, she may be tempted to dip her hand into the revenue synergies bucket. Tasty Synergies Ms. Rosenfeld is widely regarded in the food industry as an innovator. So even if Kraft resists the urge to dangle the notion of revenue synergies, there may actually be some hope of squeezing out a few more dollars by creating new products combining Kraft and Cadbury brands. To wit, Breakingviews.com offers a few examples, from plausible to implausible: Dairy Milk Oreo Bar: Take America’s most popular sandwich cookie, turn it into a rectangle and then cover it with a coating of Cadbury’s trademark chocolate, and voilà! Brand synergy at its finest. Add the Planters peanuts of Kraft, and the group has a candy bar to take on the Mars/Wrigley/Snickers juggernaut. Max Chew: Chewing gum isn’t just about taste. It can also deliver salutary benefits like fresh breath, whiter teeth and nutrients. So why not make it addictive and functional, too, with the introduction of a caffeinated chew powered by the Maxwell House coffee of Kraft? ChocoBacon: With the bacon craze in full swing, brand extensions abound for the Oscar Mayer subsidiary of Kraft. Foodies are well acquainted with chocolate-covered bacon treats. But with Kraft’s marketing muscle, ChocoBacon could make its way to the shelves of mainstream supermarkets. Violet Beauregarde: This new brand takes its name from the character who swiped a test treat from the assembly line at Willy Wonka’s factory that simulated the tastes of a three-course roast beef dinner. The Violet Beauregarde line cuts across the Kraft-Cadbury flavor spectrum: from mouthwatering appetizers like Cracker Barrel cheese on Ritz Crackers, to Oscar Mayer hot dogs with Stove Top Stuffing, ending with a sweet smorgasbord of Cadbury Flake, Crunchie and Swedish Fish. (Parental advisory: possible side effects include transmogrification into a dessert.) Cheez Egg: Children around the world anticipate waking up on Easter morning to find a delicious Cadbury Creme Egg in a basket of fake plastic grass.

By contrast, Cadbury has achieved annual revenue growth of 6 percent, at least since the acquisition of gum-maker Adams a few years back. So why would Cadbury shareholders sell out for a mixture of cash and “unappealing” Kraft stock? In reality, neither side has a performance history to make it terribly proud. Kraft is a rag-bag of businesses. These include some large commodity food businesses suffering from shrinking profit margins. The bid for Cadbury can be viewed as evidence of Kraft’s desire to strengthen its corporate profile. But until recently, Cadbury didn’t look much different. It happens to be slightly ahead of Kraft in its transformation, having sold its Dr Pepper soft drink business and made growth-inducing acquisitions. Kraft, meanwhile, says a combination of the two companies would deliver annual revenue growth of at least 5 percent and per-share earnings growth of up to 11 percent. While Cadbury hasn’t made any predictions for growth as a stand-alone company, Kraft’s projections are in line with the British company’s recent performance. If Kraft is close to right about the prospects of a Kraft-Cadbury combination, Cadbury shareholders do not have to make a grand strategic choice. They can stick with a company that has a mediocre history and reasonable prospects  or they can swap, at a premium, for New York-listed paper in a company with similar attributes. Cadbury shareholders may still be lured by an all-cash offer. But the obstacle to a deal is identifying more cost cuts. Kraft needs to find more than the $625 million of annual savings to justify paying more than it has already offered. But it will also need a friendly deal to ensure that the savings are realized.

Back then, the world’s financial problems seemed mainly Anglo-Saxon. Mr. Sarkozy thought the French could teach the world how to think about economic success. Mr. Stiglitz, an iconoclastic American Nobel laureate, was chairman, and Amartya Sen, the Indian-born Nobel laureate, was chief intellectual adviser. Their seemingly radical conclusion is that gross domestic product is a bad measure of an ill-understood good. G.D.P. may measure something, but its problems are numerous. It adds together and adjusts prices in arbitrary ways. Economists “input”  make up  many of them. It ignores housework but treats the costs of commuting, crime and finance as positives. It is a gross measure, ignoring depreciation and environmental damage. It is also a crude measure, ignoring wealth and the distribution of income. The worst thing about G.D.P. is not how it is counted but how it is commonly used: as a simple indicator of economic success. You don’t need to be Descartes or Derrida to know that more is not always better in this world. Whatever the meaning of life may be, a larger G.D.P., at least in rich countries, is unlikely to provide more of it.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg News Cadbury has rejected a $16.5 billion offer from Kraft Foods as too low. Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » As an investment rule of thumb, a company should resist paying a premium for a rival that is greater than the net present value of cost savings that would result from the deal. In the case of Cadbury, Kraft reckons that it can excise about £386 million ($625 million) of such synergies annually from Cadbury’s expenses. After accounting for one-time merger related costs, the total value of those savings to shareholders today would be a little more than £2 billion after taxes. The trouble is, that does not even cover the £2.4 billion that Kraft has already offered Cadbury’s shareholders over and above its closing share price last Friday. That means to justify the deal  not to mention paying even more now that Cadbury has rejected it  Kraft needs larger cost cuts. Based on previous deals in the food industry, that should be possible. Kraft is currently talking about chopping expenses worth some 6.5 percent of Cadbury’s overall revenue. But if Kraft can match the savings it achieved in its purchase of Nabisco in 2000, the picture improves for its shareholders. In that transaction, Kraft sought expense reductions of about 9 percent of sales. Achieving something similar at Cadbury would bring in an additional $240 million, or £150 million, in yearly cost savings. That would equate to an extra £1 billion in net present value, or £600 million more after covering the premium already on offer. That adds up to about £7.89 a Cadbury share compared with the £7.45 in cash and stock on the table. Cadbury closed at £7.86 on Tuesday. That’s still below the price that some analysts think Kraft will need to pay to seal a deal. But it would represent a robust 39 percent premium to Cadbury’s share price before Kraft went public with its proposal. Kraft says it wants the talks to be friendly. That may be why it has pegged synergies below those achieved in other similar deals. But to keep shareholders sweet, it may need to reveal a little more promise with its cost-cutting scalpel. For Planetary Health When it comes to United States-Chinese imbalances, the environment and the economy are strikingly similar. The meeting of the Group of 20 world leaders in Pittsburgh probably won’t do much about either. But they could at least start to recognize that the only fair solution to environmental issues involves joint effort. In economic terms, China and America are interlocked but out of kilter. China produces too much and consumes too little. In America, the reverse is true. There’s an environmental parallel. By relying on China’s manufacturing, the United States has effectively outsourced its industrial pollution. Together, the two account for more than 40 percent of carbon emissions. But some 70 percent of China’s energy is used by industry, while in the United States, consumers account for the same portion. The justifications for inaction on global warming mirror the economic ones. China’s politicians want the same right to pollute that America had in its industrial adolescence. Of the world’s accumulated carbon emissions, China contributed just 8 percent, versus the United States’ 28 percent. American politicians, meanwhile, see the source of future emissions and say there’s no point acting before China does. The logjam requires new thinking. Industrialized nations need to acknowledge that it is unrealistic for a transition economy to cap emissions, in effect putting a ceiling on growth. An alternative is for G-20 leaders to push for a widespread global carbon tax that the United States as well as developing nations would pay. Second, the cost of cleanup ought to be shared across the rich-developing divide. Jointly financed research is a start, but a big commitment is needed. A Beijing University study suggested reducing China’s emissions could cost $438 billion a year. That’s a big sum for China, but is just 1 percent of the G-20’s G.D.P. Whatever the obstacles, both sides must act. The financial crisis may now be starting to recede, but a global warming crisis would be immeasurably more destructive.

In a statement, Robert Thomson, managing editor of The Wall Street Journal, said A.I.G. would not be replaced in the 30-stock index by another financial company because of ''extremely unsettled conditions.'' Kraft was chosen because there is no food maker in the industrial average, said Mr. Thomson, who oversees the makeup of the index. A.I.G., the struggling insurer, is being removed as the company's poor health has prompted the Federal Reserve to provide an $85 billion emergency bailout loan. Shares of the company have fallen 83 percent over the last three sessions as A.I.G. faces a liquidity crunch amid the continued downturn in the credit markets. Its free-fall has dragged the industrial average down sharply. There are no set criteria for stocks added to the Dow average, but they must be established United States companies that are considered leaders in their industries. The 112-year-old index was last changed in February, when Bank of America and Chevron replaced the Altria Group and Honeywell International.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7D6143CF93AA15754C0A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=kraftfoodsinc">Food Makers Report Profits As Eating In Gains Favor<date>Published: July 29, 2008</date><text>Kraft Foods, the nation's largest food and beverage maker, reported growth in the second quarter Monday, as consumers abandoned restaurants for less costly meals at home. But Tyson Foods, the world's biggest meat company, said its third-quarter profit was nearly obliterated because of skyrocketing grain costs. The company earned $9 million, or 3 cents a share in the three months that ended June 30, down from $111 million, or 31 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Analysts had expected Tyson to earn 12 cents a share. While sales of Kraft's cheese line were down, sales of other products, like Maxwell House coffee and Kool-Aid, have been rising. The company raised its profit outlook for the rest of the year. ''There's no question that people are eating at home more, and we really find that as people eat at home more, they're turning to Kraft,'' Irene Rosenfeld, the chief executive, said. Kraft raised its prices 7 percent on average in the most recent quarter, and Ms. Rosenfeld said prices would continue to rise next quarter to keep up with increasing commodity costs. She would not give examples of products or amounts. Kraft reported that second-quarter profit rose to $732 million, or 48 cents a share, up from $707 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings excluding items rose to 58 cents a share, from 51 cents, above the 50 cents a share that analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected. The analysts typically exclude one-time items in their estimates. A weak dollar and gains from an acquisition helped sales jump about 21 percent, to $11.2 billion, beating analyst expectations of $10.7 billion. But price increases accounted for more than 7 percent of the revenue gain. Kraft's shares rose $1.45, or 4.9 percent, to $30.83. Tyson shares dropped $1.14, or 7 percent, to $15.09, after the company said it expected overall costs to rise an estimated $1 billion this year because of sharply higher costs for grain and other staples. The costs for grain to feed chickens rose $140 million in the quarter and are expected to jump $550 million for all of this year, the company said. Though analysts said conditions were improving a little, the company's chief executive, Richard L. Bond, said in a call with investors that Tyson's chicken business would need another quarter to revive. He cut estimated earnings for Tyson to 10 cents a share, from 35 cents, for the fourth quarter, and to $1, from $1.15, for the 2009 fiscal year. Analysts expect corn prices, down to about $6 a bushel from $8 a bushel, to stabilize but not return to the low levels of a few years ago. ''People will have to pay higher prices, and they'll have to get used to it,'' said Lawrence Baer, a senior broker at the Zaner Group in Chicago. Kraft's cheese prices are now 6 percent to 33 percent higher than they were a year ago, executives said. Despite the increase in the price of ingredients, Kraft said it expected to earn at least $1.92 a share for the year, up from previous estimates of $1.90, excluding one-time items. Analysts had expected, on average, $1.89, according to a poll by Thomson Financial. Revenue is expected to grow at least 6 percent this year, up from Kraft's previous estimate of 5 percent.</text></article><article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13feed.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">The Man Who Dared to Question Ethanol<date>Published: July 13, 2008</date><text>IT wasn’t too long ago that a loose coalition of anti-ethanol forces was bemoaning the futility of its fight. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Ethanol Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » After failing to block huge new ethanol mandates in the Senate last December, Jay Truitt, until recently the chief lobbyist for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, complained about the “fervor” and “spirituality” that surrounded ethanol on Capitol Hill. “You can’t get anyone to consider that there is a consequence to these actions,” he said, adding, “We think there will be a day when people ask, ‘Why in the world did we do this?’ ” That day has arrived sooner than Mr. Truitt, or most anyone else, anticipated. Of course, much of the turnabout is attributable to relentless price increases at the grocery store that have caused many people to argue that the land used to grow corn for ethanol should be used for food instead. But the changing perceptions about ethanol have been helped along by the most unlikely of characters, a bearded and mild-mannered economist with a dry sense of humor and an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcana of American farm policy. Until January, Keith Collins was the longtime and widely respected chief economist for the Department of Agriculture. In that position, he was a frequent booster of government policies that encouraged biofuel production. In the months after his departure, he was hired by Kraft Foods Global to analyze the impact of biofuels on food prices. He delivered a stunning, and unexpected, roundhouse to his former employers. The Bush administration had said biofuels were a minor factor in rising food costs. In a May 1 press conference, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said, “The bottom line is that we think that ethanol accounts for somewhere between 2 and 3 percent of the overall increase in global food prices.” A month later, in Rome at a United Nations conference on the food crisis, the agriculture secretary, Ed Schafer, echoed Mr. Lazear’s analysis in defending American biofuels policy. But Mr. Collins pointed out that the administration’s analysis was more like a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and that it hadn’t accounted for the impact of biofuels on crops other than corn. The push for ethanol has led farmers to grow more corn and less of other food crops, one factor in rising prices for commodities like wheat. Based on his own analysis, Mr. Collins maintains that biofuels have caused 23 to 35 percent of the increases in food costs. (The ethanol lobby dismissed Mr. Collins’s analysis as a “Krafty use of corn demand data.”) “I looked at a little bit more recent period,” said Mr. Collins, who appears uncomfortable in his role as a hired gun and treads carefully so as not to insult his former employer. “I was looking at a period when corn going into ethanol was rising much faster than what they looked at.” His move to Kraft came amid an aggressive effort by the Grocery Manufacturers Association to change perceptions about ethanol while food prices were high. The association hired the Glover Park Group, a politically wired public relations firm in Washington, to help it develop a more effective strategy. Scott Faber, lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, declined to comment. The Glover Park Group wrote in its proposal to the association, “We must obliterate whatever intellectual justification might still exist for corn-based ethanol among policy elites.” It also recommended identifying and recruiting “third-party validators.” Mr. Collins said he didn’t believe his hiring was part of an anti-ethanol campaign. Instead, he said, he was simply asked by Kraft Foods for his thoughts on biofuels’ impact, and he ultimately wrote those up in a 34-page paper. He also notes, correctly, that the turnabout in the ethanol debate has a lot more to do with relentless price increases than with P.R. strategists and his remarks. “High prices are the dominant factor,” Mr. Collins said. “Without that, this coalition would not have gotten the legs they have gotten.” Nonetheless, his criticism of the administration’s analysis was closely followed by a more thorough analysis from the Department of Agriculture. In comments made before a Senate subcommittee last month, Joseph Glauber, Mr. Collins’s successor, said the impact of biofuels on food prices was actually closer to 10 percent; the previous analysis had neglected to consider biofuels’ impact on soybeans, he said. In an interview, Mr. Glauber said his analysis simply looked at a broader set of assumptions than the earlier one by the administration; for instance, he included the impact of soybean-based biofuels on food prices. While saying he might “quibble” with some of Mr. Collins’s assumptions, he said the analyses were similar. “It just goes to show people have different ways of portraying these numbers,” he said. “I don’t think these analyses are all that different.” EVEN so, Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has asked the U.S.D.A. inspector general to investigate why such an error was made and perpetuated. “It is unfortunate that two high-ranking officials from the same agency have made such incompatible fact-based statements,” Mr. Flake wrote in a June 26 letter to the inspector general, adding that the U.S.D.A. “must be able to produce and disseminate clear and accurate information, particularly when it pertains to the culpability of U.S. policy in skyrocketing food prices.” Mr. Collins said his remarks did not contradict his work at the Agriculture Department. Back then, he said, he never anticipated that corn would hit $7 a bushel. “We expected stronger prices for corn,” he said. “If we got the prices we anticipated  high $3s  everybody would be happy. Ethanol would be cruising along just fine.” More Articles in Business »IT wasn’t too long ago that a loose coalition of anti-ethanol forces was bemoaning the futility of its fight.

But not many snack foods have a history and following like that of the Crown Pilot cracker. Skip to next paragraph Pat Wellenbach/Associated Press The Crown Pilot cracker in April 1997 in Portland, Me., shortly after it returned to store shelves. The New York Times A white rectangular biscuit that lies somewhere between an unsalted saltine and hardtack, the Crown Pilot has long been a staple in New England homes. Nabisco, its manufacturer, discontinued the cracker in 1996. But after months of hue and cry by loyal cracker crunchers  many of them from this island of 350 year-round residents  the company brought the cracker back in early 1997 in an elaborate ceremony aboard a ship in Boston Harbor. All was safe, people thought, until a few months ago, when Kraft Foods, which owns Nabisco, again discontinued the cracker. Now people here on Chebeague and throughout Maine are again rallying the old troops, calling the company daily and even floating the idea of a charity event whose proceeds would help with efforts to get the cracker back. “What if the Southerners had to go without their hominy grits? There’d be a big uprising there,” said an island resident, Sylvia Ross, who has been eating Pilot Crackers for most of her 76 years. “Now all of the sudden we can’t get Pilots any more. What else are we to do?” Once again, Donna Damon, a substitute teacher here, is leading the Crown Pilot cause. The goal, Ms. Damon said, is to have Kraft Foods either reintroduce the cracker or give the recipe to a local bakery, which can make and sell the crackers. “People up and down the coast have been calling me,” Ms. Damon said. “It’s the buzz right now. We did this once before. We have the passion and tradition to do it again.” Kraft Foods, however, does not have the same desire. “We do not have plans to bring the product back,” said a spokeswoman, Laurie Guzzinati. Ms. Guzzinati said demand for Pilot crackers was now half of what it was 12 years ago. According to newspaper articles about the 1996 discontinuation, the company sold about 241,000 pounds of Pilots a year. “Unfortunately we no longer manufacture the Crown Pilot crackers,” Ms. Guzzinati said. “The size of the Crown Pilot business declined so much we are no longer able to produce it. We have seen that folks in that region have highlighted how there is a very loyal customer base, but even within that region demand for the product has declined significantly.” But don’t tell that to people on Chebeague, a small island whose only connection to the mainland is a 15-minute ferry ride. “It’s a staple on Chebeague,” Ms. Ross said. “It’s been passed down through the generations. It’s Pilot crackers everybody wants to put in their chowders and their fish stews.” Joan Robinson, a lifelong resident of Chebeague, near Portland, explained the importance of the cracker to the area. “Some people say, ‘Why don’t you just use saltines?’ ” Ms. Robinson said. “They just don’t work. They’re good with sardines, but they just don’t go in a chowder.” A managing partner at the Chebeague Island Inn, Ed Jarrett, agrees. He planned the entire dinner menu for the inn’s restaurant around Pilot crackers  all of the restaurant’s seafood stuffings contained the crackers, and they were the base for all five of its soups. “It put a major scrimp in what I was planning,” Mr. Jarrett said. “It was in our baked stuffed lobster, baked stuffed haddock, all of our soups. I wanted to put that story of the island and the Pilot crackers into our menu. The vision got crushed.” Mr. Jarrett is thinking about donating some proceeds from a charity event at which children from the island are going to build a 25-foot-tall lighthouse out of sand to help get the cracker back. “If we have to do a phone bank with 1,000 people calling Nabisco, we’ll do it,” Mr. Jarrett said. “Whatever it takes to get the cracker back.” May Hall and other residents are dialing away. “The operator asked me where I was from,” Ms. Hall said. “I started to spell Chebeague, but the operator already knew how.” Residents are also frantically trying to replicate the recipe in their kitchens  the secret ingredient is molasses, they say  but with little success. Cal Hancock of the Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company, which used to include Pilot crackers with its chowders and sell boxes of the cracker on its Web site, sold out of crackers (at $3.69 a box) less than 24 hours after word of the Pilot’s demise spread. “The thing I remember most about Pilots is my dad getting up in the middle of the night and going down to the kitchen and having a Pilot cracker with peanut butter,” Ms. Hancock said. “You always have at least one box of Pilot crackers in the house, no question. They’re bland, but I have a box at home, and I’m savoring it.” More Articles in US »CHEBEAGUE ISLAND, Me.  Few pantry items can inflame an entire island, let alone a region.

He planned the entire dinner menu for the inn’s restaurant around Pilot crackers  all of the restaurant’s seafood stuffings contained the crackers, and they were the base for all five of its soups. “It put a major scrimp in what I was planning,” Mr. Jarrett said. “It was in our baked stuffed lobster, baked stuffed haddock, all of our soups. I wanted to put that story of the island and the Pilot crackers into our menu. The vision got crushed.” Mr. Jarrett is thinking about donating some proceeds from a charity event at which children from the island are going to build a 25-foot-tall lighthouse out of sand to help get the cracker back. “If we have to do a phone bank with 1,000 people calling Nabisco, we’ll do it,” Mr. Jarrett said. “Whatever it takes to get the cracker back.” May Hall and other residents are dialing away. “The operator asked me where I was from,” Ms. Hall said. “I started to spell Chebeague, but the operator already knew how.” Residents are also frantically trying to replicate the recipe in their kitchens  the secret ingredient is molasses, they say  but with little success. Cal Hancock of the Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company, which used to include Pilot crackers with its chowders and sell boxes of the cracker on its Web site, sold out of crackers (at $3.69 a box) less than 24 hours after word of the Pilot’s demise spread. “The thing I remember most about Pilots is my dad getting up in the middle of the night and going down to the kitchen and having a Pilot cracker with peanut butter,” Ms. Hancock said. “You always have at least one box of Pilot crackers in the house, no question. They’re bland, but I have a box at home, and I’m savoring it.”</text></article><article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/16/business/16buffett.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Buffett Increases Stakes in Kraft Foods and Wells Fargo<date>Published: May 16, 2008</date><text>Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company controlled by Warren E. Buffett, added to stakes in Kraft Foods and Wells Fargo in the first quarter, taking advantage of prices driven down by the credit crisis and the slowing American economy. Mr. Buffett also increased holdings in the health insurers UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint, according to a regulatory filing Thursday by Berkshire, based in Omaha. “If a stock goes down 50 percent, it doesn’t bother me in the least,” Mr. Buffett told reporters this month after Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. “If we’re going to be buying things, we want to buy them on sale.” Mr. Buffett, 77, built Berkshire from a failing maker of men’s suit linings into a $200 billion holding company with a $72.6 billion stock portfolio by investing premiums from insurance subsidiaries like Geico and National Indemnity. Berkshire is the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft and American Express as of March 31, according to Bloomberg data. Berkshire’s holdings of Kraft have risen 4.4 percent since Dec. 31, to 138.3 million shares. Mr. Buffett first disclosed a stake in the company at the end of 2007. The shares fell 5 percent in the first quarter. Berkshire’s filing discloses equity investments in the United States as of March 31. Berkshire’s stake in Wells Fargo increased by 1.4 million shares, to about 290.7 million. The bank’s share price averaged $29.74 on the New York Stock Exchange during the first quarter, about 9 percent lower than in the fourth, when Mr. Buffett increased Berkshire’s holdings by 3.4 percent. “He’s putting more in the things he’s invested in all along,” said Frank Betz, a partner at Carret Zane Capital Management, which oversees $800 million, including Berkshire shares, in Warren, N.J. “We’ll see more of that; why reinvent the wheel?” Berkshire added to its stakes in the two largest American health insurers as the shares fell. Holdings in UnitedHealth and in WellPoint increased by 6.7 percent each. WellPoint lost half its value in the quarter while UnitedHealth tumbled 41 percent. Mr. Buffett, the world’s richest man according to Forbes magazine, is often mimicked by investors who follow his stock picks. Using that strategy for 31 years could have delivered annual returns of about 25 percent, double the return of the S.&amp; P. 500, according to a study in 2007. Berkshire disclosed a 47 percent increase in shares in Ingersoll-Rand, the refrigeration equipment maker based in Hamilton, Bermuda. The company now holds 936,600 shares. Mr. Buffett reported no holdings in Ameriprise Financial, compared with more than 600,000 shares on Dec. 31. Berkshire got the shares when the company, an investment adviser, was spun off from American Express in 2005. Berkshire also cut its holdings of Iron Mountain, the records storage company, by 28 percent, to 3.37 million shares. Investors will not be certain they have a complete picture of Berkshire’s holdings because Mr. Buffett regularly asks the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to delay disclosure of holdings to avoid copycat investing. Thursday’s filing lists only equities traded on American exchanges. Mr. Buffett discloses other holdings in filings with non-American regulators.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, said that higher retail prices, cost controls and strong growth in emerging markets helped lift its third-quarter profit 8 percent. The company also raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 3 percent. A. G. Lafley, the chief executive, said the company remains optimistic about sustaining its growth because of daily uses for its many household brands such as Charmin toilet paper, Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent. “Virtually everything we sell is not discretionary; it’s a staple,” Mr. Lafley said on a conference call. Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said it expects costs to keep climbing, has increased spending on marketing, and will raise more prices this summer. Its rival, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, whose products include its namesake toothpaste and dish soap, said first-quarter earnings fell 4 percent as the company took restructuring charges and a higher provision for income taxes. Colgate, based in New York, said rising materials costs were offset by higher prices, but that margins would be pressured as the cost of raw materials keeps rising. Analysts questioned Colgate-Palmolive executives on whether they had been slow to lift prices and to anticipate the impact of rising costs for agricultural commodities. The company will raise Colgate toothpaste prices by 9 percent this summer. “If gross margin pressures persist, one leg of the Colgate growth stool falls off, which could start to impact growth as advertising spending is reduced,” a Deutsche Bank analyst, Bill Schmitz Jr., said in a note to clients. Colgate-Palmolive reported solid growth in Latin American markets and said its toothpaste business was strong in China, India and Russia. Among food companies, the Kellogg Company’s first-quarter profit fell 2 percent, despite recent price increases by the company, which makes cereal, Pop-Tarts toaster pastries and Eggo frozen waffles. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., raised wholesale prices an average of 3.2 percent across much of its product portfolio, said a spokeswoman, Kris Charles. Prices went up for snacks at the end of December and for cereal and frozen products in late January. At Kraft Foods, the nation’s largest food and beverage maker, first-quarter earnings fell 13 percent, also amid higher costs for ingredients. Kraft, which makes Oscar Mayer hot dogs, Maxwell House coffee and Oreo cookies, benefited from nearly across-the-board price increases. Kraft’s profit decline also came because earnings in the same period last year were raised by a one-time benefit related to the company’s spinoff from the Altria Group.

Buffett disclosed an 8.6 percent stake in the largest company in the sector. On Friday, the ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Company forecast quarterly profit above expectations and Hormel Foods posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Both benefited from price increases that helped offset rising commodity costs, though lower pork prices also aided Hormel. Even Campbell Soup Company, which missed analysts’ estimates for its fiscal second quarter, reported on Friday that its domestic soup business had improved and that it should benefit from price increases it took this month. Friday’s reports came a day after Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had taken an 8.6 percent stake in Kraft Foods, making it the largest shareholder. “I think there’s a bit of a halo effect that comes with any announcement of Buffett taking a position in any security and how it ripples through the sector,” said Matthew P. Kaufler, portfolio manager at Clover Capital Management. Clover owns 670,596 Kraft shares and 364,576 Heinz shares. The Standard &amp; Poor’s packaged foods index rose more than 3 percent on Friday, to its highest level in almost a month. Food stocks are traditionally considered defensive plays when the economy slows, since people always need to eat. The shares, however, had been battered over the last two months by soaring prices for wheat, cocoa and other commodities. Adding to those cost pressures was concern that consumers in the United States would begin to balk at the price increases being used to offset some commodities’ costs. “We clearly know that we need to try to continue to advance pricing to try to keep up with these cost increases,” Jeffrey M. Ettinger, Hormel’s chief executive, said. He said that the company has not seen consumers balking at the prices in grocery stores, but added that its food service business was enountering some softness as consumers eat out less often. Hormel said profit rose to $88.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on Jan. 27, from $75.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier, on an 8 percent sales increase. Analysts on average forecast 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Campbell profit fell to $274 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 27, from $285 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier, despite a 7 percent increase in sales. Heinz said it expected a profit of 67 cents to 68 cents a share in the third quarter ending Jan. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Hormel shares rose 3.9 percent, Heinz shares rose 5.2 percent, Campbell rose 6.1 percent and Kraft was up 6.9 percent.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Ethanol Add to Portfolio Kraft Foods Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » After failing to block huge new ethanol mandates in the Senate last December, Jay Truitt, until recently the chief lobbyist for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, complained about the “fervor” and “spirituality” that surrounded ethanol on Capitol Hill. “You can’t get anyone to consider that there is a consequence to these actions,” he said, adding, “We think there will be a day when people ask, ‘Why in the world did we do this?’ ” That day has arrived sooner than Mr. Truitt, or most anyone else, anticipated. Of course, much of the turnabout is attributable to relentless price increases at the grocery store that have caused many people to argue that the land used to grow corn for ethanol should be used for food instead. But the changing perceptions about ethanol have been helped along by the most unlikely of characters, a bearded and mild-mannered economist with a dry sense of humor and an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcana of American farm policy. Until January, Keith Collins was the longtime and widely respected chief economist for the Department of Agriculture. In that position, he was a frequent booster of government policies that encouraged biofuel production. In the months after his departure, he was hired by Kraft Foods Global to analyze the impact of biofuels on food prices. He delivered a stunning, and unexpected, roundhouse to his former employers. The Bush administration had said biofuels were a minor factor in rising food costs. In a May 1 press conference, Edward P. Lazear, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said, “The bottom line is that we think that ethanol accounts for somewhere between 2 and 3 percent of the overall increase in global food prices.” A month later, in Rome at a United Nations conference on the food crisis, the agriculture secretary, Ed Schafer, echoed Mr. Lazear’s analysis in defending American biofuels policy. But Mr. Collins pointed out that the administration’s analysis was more like a back-of-the-envelope calculation, and that it hadn’t accounted for the impact of biofuels on crops other than corn. The push for ethanol has led farmers to grow more corn and less of other food crops, one factor in rising prices for commodities like wheat. Based on his own analysis, Mr. Collins maintains that biofuels have caused 23 to 35 percent of the increases in food costs. (The ethanol lobby dismissed Mr. Collins’s analysis as a “Krafty use of corn demand data.”) “I looked at a little bit more recent period,” said Mr. Collins, who appears uncomfortable in his role as a hired gun and treads carefully so as not to insult his former employer. “I was looking at a period when corn going into ethanol was rising much faster than what they looked at.” His move to Kraft came amid an aggressive effort by the Grocery Manufacturers Association to change perceptions about ethanol while food prices were high. The association hired the Glover Park Group, a politically wired public relations firm in Washington, to help it develop a more effective strategy. Scott Faber, lobbyist for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, declined to comment. The Glover Park Group wrote in its proposal to the association, “We must obliterate whatever intellectual justification might still exist for corn-based ethanol among policy elites.” It also recommended identifying and recruiting “third-party validators.” Mr. Collins said he didn’t believe his hiring was part of an anti-ethanol campaign. Instead, he said, he was simply asked by Kraft Foods for his thoughts on biofuels’ impact, and he ultimately wrote those up in a 34-page paper. He also notes, correctly, that the turnabout in the ethanol debate has a lot more to do with relentless price increases than with P.R. strategists and his remarks. “High prices are the dominant factor,” Mr. Collins said. “Without that, this coalition would not have gotten the legs they have gotten.” Nonetheless, his criticism of the administration’s analysis was closely followed by a more thorough analysis from the Department of Agriculture. In comments made before a Senate subcommittee last month, Joseph Glauber, Mr. Collins’s successor, said the impact of biofuels on food prices was actually closer to 10 percent; the previous analysis had neglected to consider biofuels’ impact on soybeans, he said. In an interview, Mr. Glauber said his analysis simply looked at a broader set of assumptions than the earlier one by the administration; for instance, he included the impact of soybean-based biofuels on food prices. While saying he might “quibble” with some of Mr. Collins’s assumptions, he said the analyses were similar. “It just goes to show people have different ways of portraying these numbers,” he said. “I don’t think these analyses are all that different.” EVEN so, Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has asked the U.S.D.A. inspector general to investigate why such an error was made and perpetuated. “It is unfortunate that two high-ranking officials from the same agency have made such incompatible fact-based statements,” Mr. Flake wrote in a June 26 letter to the inspector general, adding that the U.S.D.A. “must be able to produce and disseminate clear and accurate information, particularly when it pertains to the culpability of U.S. policy in skyrocketing food prices.” Mr. Collins said his remarks did not contradict his work at the Agriculture Department. Back then, he said, he never anticipated that corn would hit $7 a bushel. “We expected stronger prices for corn,” he said. “If we got the prices we anticipated  high $3s  everybody would be happy.

The New York Times A white rectangular biscuit that lies somewhere between an unsalted saltine and hardtack, the Crown Pilot has long been a staple in New England homes. Nabisco, its manufacturer, discontinued the cracker in 1996. But after months of hue and cry by loyal cracker crunchers  many of them from this island of 350 year-round residents  the company brought the cracker back in early 1997 in an elaborate ceremony aboard a ship in Boston Harbor. All was safe, people thought, until a few months ago, when Kraft Foods, which owns Nabisco, again discontinued the cracker. Now people here on Chebeague and throughout Maine are again rallying the old troops, calling the company daily and even floating the idea of a charity event whose proceeds would help with efforts to get the cracker back. “What if the Southerners had to go without their hominy grits? There’d be a big uprising there,” said an island resident, Sylvia Ross, who has been eating Pilot Crackers for most of her 76 years. “Now all of the sudden we can’t get Pilots any more. What else are we to do?” Once again, Donna Damon, a substitute teacher here, is leading the Crown Pilot cause. The goal, Ms. Damon said, is to have Kraft Foods either reintroduce the cracker or give the recipe to a local bakery, which can make and sell the crackers. “People up and down the coast have been calling me,” Ms. Damon said. “It’s the buzz right now. We did this once before. We have the passion and tradition to do it again.” Kraft Foods, however, does not have the same desire. “We do not have plans to bring the product back,” said a spokeswoman, Laurie Guzzinati. Ms. Guzzinati said demand for Pilot crackers was now half of what it was 12 years ago. According to newspaper articles about the 1996 discontinuation, the company sold about 241,000 pounds of Pilots a year. “Unfortunately we no longer manufacture the Crown Pilot crackers,” Ms. Guzzinati said. “The size of the Crown Pilot business declined so much we are no longer able to produce it. We have seen that folks in that region have highlighted how there is a very loyal customer base, but even within that region demand for the product has declined significantly.” But don’t tell that to people on Chebeague, a small island whose only connection to the mainland is a 15-minute ferry ride. “It’s a staple on Chebeague,” Ms. Ross said. “It’s been passed down through the generations. It’s Pilot crackers everybody wants to put in their chowders and their fish stews.” Joan Robinson, a lifelong resident of Chebeague, near Portland, explained the importance of the cracker to the area. “Some people say, ‘Why don’t you just use saltines?’ ” Ms. Robinson said. “They just don’t work. They’re good with sardines, but they just don’t go in a chowder.” A managing partner at the Chebeague Island Inn, Ed Jarrett, agrees. He planned the entire dinner menu for the inn’s restaurant around Pilot crackers  all of the restaurant’s seafood stuffings contained the crackers, and they were the base for all five of its soups. “It put a major scrimp in what I was planning,” Mr. Jarrett said. “It was in our baked stuffed lobster, baked stuffed haddock, all of our soups. I wanted to put that story of the island and the Pilot crackers into our menu. The vision got crushed.” Mr. Jarrett is thinking about donating some proceeds from a charity event at which children from the island are going to build a 25-foot-tall lighthouse out of sand to help get the cracker back. “If we have to do a phone bank with 1,000 people calling Nabisco, we’ll do it,” Mr. Jarrett said. “Whatever it takes to get the cracker back.” May Hall and other residents are dialing away. “The operator asked me where I was from,” Ms. Hall said. “I started to spell Chebeague, but the operator already knew how.” Residents are also frantically trying to replicate the recipe in their kitchens  the secret ingredient is molasses, they say  but with little success. Cal Hancock of the Hancock Gourmet Lobster Company, which used to include Pilot crackers with its chowders and sell boxes of the cracker on its Web site, sold out of crackers (at $3.69 a box) less than 24 hours after word of the Pilot’s demise spread. “The thing I remember most about Pilots is my dad getting up in the middle of the night and going down to the kitchen and having a Pilot cracker with peanut butter,” Ms. Hancock said. “You always have at least one box of Pilot crackers in the house, no question. They’re bland, but I have a box at home, and I’m savoring it.” More Articles in US »CHEBEAGUE ISLAND, Me.  Few pantry items can inflame an entire island, let alone a region.

Mr. Buffett also increased holdings in the health insurers UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint, according to a regulatory filing Thursday by Berkshire, based in Omaha. “If a stock goes down 50 percent, it doesn’t bother me in the least,” Mr. Buffett told reporters this month after Berkshire’s annual shareholder meeting in Omaha. “If we’re going to be buying things, we want to buy them on sale.” Mr. Buffett, 77, built Berkshire from a failing maker of men’s suit linings into a $200 billion holding company with a $72.6 billion stock portfolio by investing premiums from insurance subsidiaries like Geico and National Indemnity. Berkshire is the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola, Wells Fargo, Kraft and American Express as of March 31, according to Bloomberg data.

Holdings in UnitedHealth and in WellPoint increased by 6.7 percent each. WellPoint lost half its value in the quarter while UnitedHealth tumbled 41 percent. Mr. Buffett, the world’s richest man according to Forbes magazine, is often mimicked by investors who follow his stock picks. Using that strategy for 31 years could have delivered annual returns of about 25 percent, double the return of the S.&amp; P. 500, according to a study in 2007.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors, said that higher retail prices, cost controls and strong growth in emerging markets helped lift its third-quarter profit 8 percent. The company also raised its full-year outlook, sending its shares up 3 percent. A. G. Lafley, the chief executive, said the company remains optimistic about sustaining its growth because of daily uses for its many household brands such as Charmin toilet paper, Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent. “Virtually everything we sell is not discretionary; it’s a staple,” Mr. Lafley said on a conference call. Procter &amp; Gamble, based in Cincinnati, said it expects costs to keep climbing, has increased spending on marketing, and will raise more prices this summer. Its rival, the Colgate-Palmolive Company, whose products include its namesake toothpaste and dish soap, said first-quarter earnings fell 4 percent as the company took restructuring charges and a higher provision for income taxes. Colgate, based in New York, said rising materials costs were offset by higher prices, but that margins would be pressured as the cost of raw materials keeps rising. Analysts questioned Colgate-Palmolive executives on whether they had been slow to lift prices and to anticipate the impact of rising costs for agricultural commodities. The company will raise Colgate toothpaste prices by 9 percent this summer. “If gross margin pressures persist, one leg of the Colgate growth stool falls off, which could start to impact growth as advertising spending is reduced,” a Deutsche Bank analyst, Bill Schmitz Jr., said in a note to clients. Colgate-Palmolive reported solid growth in Latin American markets and said its toothpaste business was strong in China, India and Russia. Among food companies, the Kellogg Company’s first-quarter profit fell 2 percent, despite recent price increases by the company, which makes cereal, Pop-Tarts toaster pastries and Eggo frozen waffles. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Mich., raised wholesale prices an average of 3.2 percent across much of its product portfolio, said a spokeswoman, Kris Charles. Prices went up for snacks at the end of December and for cereal and frozen products in late January. At Kraft Foods, the nation’s largest food and beverage maker, first-quarter earnings fell 13 percent, also amid higher costs for ingredients. Kraft, which makes Oscar Mayer hot dogs, Maxwell House coffee and Oreo cookies, benefited from nearly across-the-board price increases. Kraft’s profit decline also came because earnings in the same period last year were raised by a one-time benefit related to the company’s spinoff from the Altria Group.

Buffett disclosed an 8.6 percent stake in the largest company in the sector. On Friday, the ketchup maker H. J. Heinz Company forecast quarterly profit above expectations and Hormel Foods posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Both benefited from price increases that helped offset rising commodity costs, though lower pork prices also aided Hormel. Even Campbell Soup Company, which missed analysts’ estimates for its fiscal second quarter, reported on Friday that its domestic soup business had improved and that it should benefit from price increases it took this month. Friday’s reports came a day after Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had taken an 8.6 percent stake in Kraft Foods, making it the largest shareholder. “I think there’s a bit of a halo effect that comes with any announcement of Buffett taking a position in any security and how it ripples through the sector,” said Matthew P. Kaufler, portfolio manager at Clover Capital Management. Clover owns 670,596 Kraft shares and 364,576 Heinz shares. The Standard &amp; Poor’s packaged foods index rose more than 3 percent on Friday, to its highest level in almost a month. Food stocks are traditionally considered defensive plays when the economy slows, since people always need to eat. The shares, however, had been battered over the last two months by soaring prices for wheat, cocoa and other commodities. Adding to those cost pressures was concern that consumers in the United States would begin to balk at the price increases being used to offset some commodities’ costs. “We clearly know that we need to try to continue to advance pricing to try to keep up with these cost increases,” Jeffrey M. Ettinger, Hormel’s chief executive, said. He said that the company has not seen consumers balking at the prices in grocery stores, but added that its food service business was enountering some softness as consumers eat out less often. Hormel said profit rose to $88.2 million, or 64 cents a share, in the first quarter ended on Jan. 27, from $75.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier, on an 8 percent sales increase. Analysts on average forecast 58 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Campbell profit fell to $274 million, or 71 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 27, from $285 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier, despite a 7 percent increase in sales. Heinz said it expected a profit of 67 cents to 68 cents a share in the third quarter ending Jan. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.

Skip to next paragraph It is not intended for sale in the United States, but is aimed at rural Asia, Africa and Latin America, where worms leave millions of children lethargic, dangerously anemic and, sometimes, passing blood. The food is in the early development stage, and a spokeswoman said the company was not ready to say whether it would be a cheese, a pasta, a granola bar or something else. But it will incorporate deworming chemicals developed by TyraTech, a company in Melbourne, Fla., that makes safe pesticides. The pesticides, explained R. Douglas Armstrong, chief executive of TyraTech, are derived from plant oils. He would not name the plants, but compared the idea to the power of citronella to repel mosquitoes. The oils attach to three olfactory and central nervous system receptors found only in invertebrates. When overstimulated, Dr. Armstrong said, those receptors produce unstoppable cascades of impulses in the nervous systems of insects or worms, repelling or killing them. Dr. Armstrong compared it to ringing a doorbell so incessantly that it finally triggers a heart attack. Because vertebrates, including humans, lack these receptors, the oils are harmless to them. They have been tested on mice, which are also vertebrates. Five days of treatment cleared them of dwarf tapeworms, TyraTech said. Tests on humans have not been done, so it is not clear what the prospective delicacies will taste like, said Sarah Delea, a spokeswoman for Kraft. Dr. Armstrong said that different blends would work and that taste could be removed, masked with food flavors or coated with microencapsulization, as is done with medicine. Plant oils’ killing power was discovered by accident, he added. Essam Enan, a biochemist who is now the chief scientific officer for TyraTech, was formerly a cancer researcher studying the oils at the University of California, Davis, which is in the hot Sacramento Valley, when there was a power failure. “Pretty soon, the other labs in the building began to close down for the day,” Dr. Armstrong said. “They had opened their windows. But there were too many flies and bugs, and it was too hot to close them.” “But there were no bugs in Essam’s lab,” he continued. “Then he found some dead flies. That’s when he began to appreciate the potency.” Dr. Frank O. Richards Jr., a parasitologist at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said he found the idea of a worm-killing food “interesting but not convincing yet.” He would want to see proof, he said, that it worked on roundworms, which are metabolically different from tapeworms and much more common. And he would want proof that it killed worms, rather than just irritating them enough to make them migrate to other organs. “We’re always interested in new worm drugs, because there isn’t a lot of research into them,” he said. “But a lot in this remains to be looked at.” Although worm killing is a new angle for Kraft, Ms. Delea said, the manufacturer does reformulate some foods to be used in poor countries to improve health. For example, she said, the Tang drink it sells in Asia and Latin America has extra vitamins. And the Eden brand cheese it sells in the Philippines is fortified with iodine. Iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation, and it also leads to stunting and goiters.

Essam Enan, a biochemist who is now the chief scientific officer for TyraTech, was formerly a cancer researcher studying the oils at the University of California, Davis, which is in the hot Sacramento Valley, when there was a power failure. “Pretty soon, the other labs in the building began to close down for the day,” Dr. Armstrong said. “They had opened their windows. But there were too many flies and bugs, and it was too hot to close them.” “But there were no bugs in Essam’s lab,” he continued. “Then he found some dead flies. That’s when he began to appreciate the potency.” Dr. Frank O. Richards Jr., a parasitologist at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said he found the idea of a worm-killing food “interesting but not convincing yet.” He would want to see proof, he said, that it worked on roundworms, which are metabolically different from tapeworms and much more common. And he would want proof that it killed worms, rather than just irritating them enough to make them migrate to other organs. “We’re always interested in new worm drugs, because there isn’t a lot of research into them,” he said. “But a lot in this remains to be looked at.” Although worm killing is a new angle for Kraft, Ms. Delea said, the manufacturer does reformulate some foods to be used in poor countries to improve health. For example, she said, the Tang drink it sells in Asia and Latin America has extra vitamins. And the Eden brand cheese it sells in the Philippines is fortified with iodine. Iodine deficiency is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation, and it also leads to stunting and goiters.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/business/media/26adco.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Ritz’s New Approach Stresses Fun Over Function<date>Published: December 26, 2007</date><text>BACK in 1934, when the National Biscuit Company introduced a line of buttery little crackers, it named them “Ritz” to mean quality and class, the type of snack a guest might eat at César Ritz’s line of luxury hotels in Europe. Skip to next paragraph Posters on buildings will be part of a multimedia blitz. But now the custodians of Ritz crackers want to link their brand to something else: fun. Come New Year’s Eve, Kraft Foods, which merged with Nabisco in 2000, will mount an all-out blitz to depict Ritz as playful and lively. The “Ritz. Open for Fun” campaign may fly, or it may thud, but one thing is certain: It will be hard to miss. Starting at dusk on Monday, light projections scattered across Manhattan will show Ritz crackers merrily bouncing in and out of a box. Anyone at home watching “Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve” on ABC will see local newscasters asking celebrants to describe their idea of fun  with a Ritz logo on the screen. And, of course, there will be commercials. The inaugural one  called, appropriately enough, “Opener”  shows blink-of-an-eye vignettes of fantastical Ritz-induced fun. A boy and his dog play Frisbee with a Ritz, a girl blows bubbles through a Ritz, Ritz-shaped confetti rains down on an amusement park, a magician pulls Ritz crackers from someone’s ear, ... well, you get the idea. Two 15-second spots, one using live action to simulate a video game and another using animation to simulate a party, will make their debuts as well. “We don’t want consumers to just think Ritz is a fun cracker,” said Andrew Benett, president of Euro RSCG, the agency that dreamed up the campaign. “We want them to think Ritz is a champion of all kinds of fun.” In one sense, Ritz’s work is already done. The company’s research shows that people have long associated Ritz crackers with informal parties and other kinds of fun. They rank it above potato chips (but below cookies) as a “fun snack.” But Ritz has been around more than 70 years, so the association may be pretty subliminal by now. And as upscale crackers have carved into Ritz’s market share, the company decided it was time to bring it to the surface. “We want to take something that consumers know  that Ritz is fun  and draw a bright line around it,” said James Low, senior brand manager for Ritz.  For Euro, the Ritz fun is serious business. When JWT, Ritz’s longtime agency, was handling the account, most Ritz ads stressed the cracker’s functional attributes  it is durable enough to take to the beach and versatile enough for all kinds of toppings. But this year, Kraft put the account out for bid. Euro pitched the “Open for Fun” idea. It presented Ritz with the results of a “Ritz fun pulse,” a survey asking people what’s more fun (puppies won over chocolate, Swiss cheese beat out snow angels, and only doctors were considered less fun than President Bush). And it sketched out ideas for Web games and ads. “We wanted to create a magical world of Ritz, not one that’s anchored in some kind of functional benefit,” Mr. Benett said. New Year’s Eve is just the launch pad for an integrated campaign that will stretch throughout 2008. Already on ritzcrackers.com is a rudimentary quiz that lets visitors rate the fun quotient of silly activities like shooting their house with paintballs. There will be an expanded quiz, as well as online games in the form of banner ads (for example, tick-tack-toe, with Ritz Crackers as the O’s and stylized boxes as the X’s). There will be more commercials, both live action and animated  one of them has a cracker saying “don’t tell peanut butter we’ve been dating jelly”  in English and Spanish. There will be posters on buildings and construction sites showing Ritz crackers with humorous lines (“Crummy  but not like those guys you dated in college,” or “If being flaky is bad, we don’t wanna be good”). There will be print ads in unusual sizes and shapes, particularly in women’s magazines (Ritz’s core customer is women 25 to 54). And of course, there will be some in-store ads. As part of the campaign, Kraft commissioned the research company Yankelovich to ask Americans how much fun they’ve been having. Most said they were having lots, but 95 percent said they wanted to have more. Ritz will send out news releases elaborating on the survey next year. “This is an integrated campaign with a ton of elements, and we are committed to making a big bang with it,” Mr. Low said. Ritz will not divulge costs. But earlier this year Irene B. Rosenfeld, the chief executive of Kraft Foods, said she was increasing the company’s huge marketing budget  estimated at $1.4 billion a year  by as much as $400 million, and presumably a good chunk of that will go to the Ritz campaign. Laurie M. Guzzinati, director of corporate affairs for Kraft, said there was “no other creative being developed to swap in” later in the year.  A week before its debut, the campaign was already playing to mixed reviews. “I love it,” said Jill Avery, an assistant professor of marketing at the Simmons School of Management. “They’re taking an existing strength, the Ritz heritage of parties and fun, and teasing it up to the surface. And games, light shows, wild postings, all of those may attract young people who don’t already have an emotional connection to the brand.” But others were skeptical. Kelly O’Keefe, director of executive education at the Virginia Commonwealth University Adcenter, said he worried about overkill. “If they keep saying Ritz is all about fun, fun, fun, consumers might say, ‘Give me a break, it’s just a cracker,’” he warned. “They should explore why someone really would choose Ritz over some competing cracker.” That answer, said Nicholas Donatiello Jr., president of the research firm Odyssey, should be that it tastes good. “To most people, the important thing about food is its taste, not whether the brand is associated with some lifestyle attribute like fun,” he said. “There should be room in their big campaign to remind people that Ritz tastes great.” At Euro, Mr. Benett’s reaction was, basically, that’s so 2007. “Consumers know Ritz is buttery, that it has a great mouth feel,” he said. “If we stressed that, we would just be going back to the old functional-attribute approach.” More Articles in Business »BACK in 1934, when the National Biscuit Company introduced a line of buttery little crackers, it named them “Ritz” to mean quality and class, the type of snack a guest might eat at César Ritz’s line of luxury hotels in Europe.

Results were also affected by investments in new products, but the company posted better-than-expected revenue. Costs associated with making dairy products in North America were up 40 percent in the third quarter, and executives said the costs to make its products were expected to climb 9 percent for the year. “We’re in a much tougher input environment than we had expected,” said Kraft’s chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld. For the quarter that ended Sept. 30, net income fell to $596 million, or 38 cents a share, down from $748 million, or 45 cents a share, a year ago. Kraft, whose products include Maxwell House coffee and Oscar Mayer deli meats, said the results included asset impairments and charges of 6 cents a share. Excluding the charges, the company, based in Northfield, Ill., earned 44 cents a share, beating Wall Street forecasts. Revenue rose 10 percent, to $9.05 billion, from $8.24 billion in the third quarter of 2006. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expected earnings of 42 cents a share on revenue of $8.68 billion. Those estimates typically exclude one-time charges. Kraft has already raised prices on about 80 percent of its cheese products at least once this year.

The campaign is starting with five spots, Ms. Delaney said, and more are planned for 2008. The commercials are also different from usual Kraft fare in that they are short, 10 or 15 seconds long rather than 30; feature animation rather than actors; and take a humorous, even whimsical tack rather than a serious or self-important tone.

Sales for Kraft Singles, one of Krafts largest brands, totaled more than $600 million last year. Kraft spends about $40 million a year to advertise the brand. The creative assignment for Kraft Singles is the first that Kraft has awarded to Nitro. The decision was made in June as part of a shake-up of the Kraft agency roster that also involved familiar brands like Grey Poupon mustard, Oscar Mayer meats and Ritz crackers.

Tyson reduced its profit forecast for the year through September, citing an increase of almost $300 million for grain, which the company buys to feed poultry. Tyson shares fell nearly 13 percent, the most in six years, on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft, which said increased dairy and grain costs would erode profit margins, managed to raise its full-year earnings projection by laying off workers, reassigning executives and lowering the companys tax rate. But Alexia Howard, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company in New York, said the profit margin would narrow to 13.8 percent this year, from 15.3 percent in 2006. Farmers are growing more corn for use in biofuels, leaving less acreage for wheat and soybeans. That has pushed up the price of grain used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, so that consumers must pay more for milk, beef and chicken and related products. Wheat prices have jumped 58 percent so far this year. Global consumption has exceeded production in seven of the last eight years. Soybean prices were up 32 percent after American farmers cut acreage by 15 percent, to the lowest level in 12 years.

Correction: September 8, 2007 An article by Bloomberg News in Business Day on Thursday, about earnings projections for Kraft Foods and Tyson Foods, incorrectly attributed a statement that Kraft’s profit margin would narrow this year. The statement was made by Alexia Howard, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company in New York, not by Kraft. More Articles in Business »Correction Appended Tyson Foods and Kraft Foods said yesterday that soaring commodity prices would hurt the companies profits this year. Tyson reduced its profit forecast for the year through September, citing an increase of almost $300 million for grain, which the company buys to feed poultry. Tyson shares fell nearly 13 percent, the most in six years, on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft, which said increased dairy and grain costs would erode profit margins, managed to raise its full-year earnings projection by laying off workers, reassigning executives and lowering the companys tax rate. But Alexia Howard, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company in New York, said the profit margin would narrow to 13.8 percent this year, from 15.3 percent in 2006. Farmers are growing more corn for use in biofuels, leaving less acreage for wheat and soybeans. That has pushed up the price of grain used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, so that consumers must pay more for milk, beef and chicken and related products.

Yesterday, Kraft Foods, in which Mr. Peltz, the activist investor, has taken a 3 percent stake through his Trian hedge fund, said that it would offer 5.3 billion euros ($7.2 billion) for the cookie unit of Group Danone, a purchase that would expand its presence in Europe. Another Peltz holding, Wendys International, disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mr. Peltz, who owns a 9.8 percent stake through Trian, wrote a letter to its board suggesting that his other investment vehicle, Triarc, might be interested in bidding for the company. Triarc, a publicly held company that has Mr. Peltz as chairman, owns the Arbys chain of restaurants. Wendys said in April that it was exploring a sale of some or all of the company. While Trian will support the transaction that is best for all Wendys shareholders, we believe that Triarc is a natural, strategic buyer for the company and should be encouraged to participate in the process, Mr. Peltz wrote in the letter to James V. Pickett, Wendys chairman. A Wendys spokesman said that the special committee of the board will comment when it believes it is appropriate. A spokeswoman for Trian and Triarc declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing. The two developments are only the latest for Mr. Peltz, who has worn two hats  shareholder gadfly and corporate acquirer  as he has continued to shake up food companies. In March, he took a nearly 3 percent stake in Cadbury Schweppes. Days later, the company said that it would separate its confectionary and American beverage businesses. Last month, Cadbury confirmed that it would sell the drinks business. Last year, Mr. Peltz took on H. J. Heinz, the ketchup maker, in a heated proxy fight, winning two seats on the board. In Kraft, Mr. Peltz is taking on a company stocked with familiar brands, like Nabisco, Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House, but with few options for growth. Spun off from Altria this year, Kraft entered a marketplace crowded with lower-priced, private-label rivals lining shelves at stores like Costco and Whole Foods Market. Its processed foods, too, have lost favor with some consumers who now seek healthier, more natural products. By buying Danones biscuits unit, Kraft is hoping that a larger presence in the snack business, as well as exposure to markets in Europe and emerging markets, will bolster growth. Danone is hoping that selling the unit will allow it to refocus on its booming health-food offerings. Krafts chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, declined to talk specifically about Mr. Peltz, saying only, We are very happy to talk to any and all of our investors. Ms. Rosenfeld, however, was eager to talk about her companys acquisition of Danones biscuit business, which she called a great fit for Kraft. But while Mr. Peltz has apparently pushed Kraft to action with little fuss, he seems to be in for a messier fight with Wendys. In his letter, Mr. Peltz accuses the company of consistently hindering Triarc from preparing a possible bid, writing that Wendys would prefer to sell itself to anyone other than Triarc. Mr. Peltz added that he planned to contact other shareholders to explore alternative strategies for the company. At issue is what Triarc called a restrictive one-year standstill clause that it was asked to sign to see Wendys confidential financial data, though what the clause stipulated was not clear. In his letter, Mr. Peltz said that while his company was considering a bid, it wanted access to the financing that Wendys advisers, JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers, were offering other potential buyers. Mr. Peltz has been a persistent critic of Wendys, pushing it to increase its share price by slimming itself down. To settle a proxy fight last year with Trian and another hedge fund, Sandell Asset Management, Wendys agreed to expand its board to include three directors chosen by the funds. It also spun off Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffee-and-doughnut chain, and sold Baja Fresh Mexican Grill at a $244 million loss. In return, Trian agreed not to lift its stake above 10 percent, agitate for a merger, make a tender offer to other shareholders or mount another proxy fight. That agreement expired Saturday. In yesterdays filing, Wendys said that Trian had raised its stake to 9.8 percent, from 8.4 percent.

Kraft stock started the year at $35.70 and had dropped by more than 8 percent in May before it started to recover. Kraft may make an easy target. Like many other packaged food companies with popular brand names, Kraft Foods has struggled to keep up with rapidly changing consumer tastes. The company thrived in an era when consumers bought all their food at grocery stores lined with aisles of brand-name products. Krafts brands include Nabisco, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta and Post cereals. But now, consumers are shopping at superstores like Costco and specialty stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joes that offer organic products or private-label brands that have cut into brand-name dominance. And at a time when consumers are demanding healthier, more natural products, Krafts portfolio of processed foods has struggled to remain relevant. Last year, Kraft brought in Irene B. Rosenfeld from PepsiCo to turn the company around, and Ms. Rosenfeld has embarked on an ambitious plan to create more innovative products and bolster marketing. While many industry analysts believe Ms. Rosenfelds plan holds promise, they dont see much improvement anytime soon. Its success is centered on Krafts ability to rebuild its product pipeline and reposition brands in a broader market, Brian Weddington, an analyst at Moodys wrote in April. This could be difficult to accomplish with an already diverse and mature portfolio such as Krafts, but in any case, implementing the strategy will take time. In the first quarter, reported April 18, Kraft said its profit fell 30 percent and was short of analysts estimates.

The company, which makes Nabisco cookies, Oscar Mayer meats and Post cereals, said its earnings rose to $707 million, or 44 cents a share, for the period April through June. That is up from $682 million, or 41 cents a share, during the same period last year. Excluding charges for asset impairment and other items, Krafts income fell to $802 million, or 50 cents a share, from $852 million, or 51 cents a share. Revenue climbed 6.8 percent, to $9.21 billion, from $8.62 billion, beating Wall Street forecasts, with help from the acquisition of United Biscuits Iberia and a currency benefit. I am pleased to report that we made further progress in the second quarter to return Kraft to reliable growth, the chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, said in a statement. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast a quarterly profit of 47 cents a share on revenue of $8.97 billion. Analyst estimates typically exclude one-time charges. The company said a lower tax rate and share buybacks also lifted results in the latest quarter. Meanwhile, Kraft executives said they were raising their fiscal year guidance. Kraft said it now expected to earn $1.55 to $1.60 a share, up from its previous estimates of $1.50 to $1.55 a share. The new guidance includes 23 cents a share in costs related to the companys revamping plan and 3 cents a share to recognize interest income-related tax reserve transfers from the Altria Group, the companys former parent. The company maintained its guidance for net income including charges of $1.75 to $1.80 a share. Kraft shares fell 32 cents, to $32.43.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/business/worldbusiness/04peltz.html?ref=kraftfoodsinc">Investor Pushes Expansion at Kraft but Seeks Sale at Wendy’s<date>Published: July 4, 2007</date><text>Nelson Peltzs willingness to throw himself into a food fight shows no signs of abating. Yesterday, Kraft Foods, in which Mr. Peltz, the activist investor, has taken a 3 percent stake through his Trian hedge fund, said that it would offer 5.3 billion euros ($7.2 billion) for the cookie unit of Group Danone, a purchase that would expand its presence in Europe. Another Peltz holding, Wendys International, disclosed in a regulatory filing that Mr. Peltz, who owns a 9.8 percent stake through Trian, wrote a letter to its board suggesting that his other investment vehicle, Triarc, might be interested in bidding for the company. Triarc, a publicly held company that has Mr. Peltz as chairman, owns the Arbys chain of restaurants. Wendys said in April that it was exploring a sale of some or all of the company. While Trian will support the transaction that is best for all Wendys shareholders, we believe that Triarc is a natural, strategic buyer for the company and should be encouraged to participate in the process, Mr. Peltz wrote in the letter to James V. Pickett, Wendys chairman. A Wendys spokesman said that the special committee of the board will comment when it believes it is appropriate. A spokeswoman for Trian and Triarc declined to comment beyond the regulatory filing. The two developments are only the latest for Mr. Peltz, who has worn two hats  shareholder gadfly and corporate acquirer  as he has continued to shake up food companies. In March, he took a nearly 3 percent stake in Cadbury Schweppes. Days later, the company said that it would separate its confectionary and American beverage businesses. Last month, Cadbury confirmed that it would sell the drinks business. Last year, Mr. Peltz took on H. J. Heinz, the ketchup maker, in a heated proxy fight, winning two seats on the board. In Kraft, Mr. Peltz is taking on a company stocked with familiar brands, like Nabisco, Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House, but with few options for growth. Spun off from Altria this year, Kraft entered a marketplace crowded with lower-priced, private-label rivals lining shelves at stores like Costco and Whole Foods Market. Its processed foods, too, have lost favor with some consumers who now seek healthier, more natural products. By buying Danones biscuits unit, Kraft is hoping that a larger presence in the snack business, as well as exposure to markets in Europe and emerging markets, will bolster growth. Danone is hoping that selling the unit will allow it to refocus on its booming health-food offerings. Krafts chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, declined to talk specifically about Mr. Peltz, saying only, We are very happy to talk to any and all of our investors. Ms. Rosenfeld, however, was eager to talk about her companys acquisition of Danones biscuit business, which she called a great fit for Kraft. But while Mr. Peltz has apparently pushed Kraft to action with little fuss, he seems to be in for a messier fight with Wendys. In his letter, Mr. Peltz accuses the company of consistently hindering Triarc from preparing a possible bid, writing that Wendys would prefer to sell itself to anyone other than Triarc. Mr. Peltz added that he planned to contact other shareholders to explore alternative strategies for the company. At issue is what Triarc called a restrictive one-year standstill clause that it was asked to sign to see Wendys confidential financial data, though what the clause stipulated was not clear. In his letter, Mr. Peltz said that while his company was considering a bid, it wanted access to the financing that Wendys advisers, JPMorgan Chase and Lehman Brothers, were offering other potential buyers. Mr. Peltz has been a persistent critic of Wendys, pushing it to increase its share price by slimming itself down. To settle a proxy fight last year with Trian and another hedge fund, Sandell Asset Management, Wendys agreed to expand its board to include three directors chosen by the funds. It also spun off Tim Hortons, the Canadian coffee-and-doughnut chain, and sold Baja Fresh Mexican Grill at a $244 million loss. In return, Trian agreed not to lift its stake above 10 percent, agitate for a merger, make a tender offer to other shareholders or mount another proxy fight. That agreement expired Saturday. In yesterdays filing, Wendys said that Trian had raised its stake to 9.8 percent, from 8.4 percent.

That is what he is preparing to tell Kraft Foods, having quietly acquired a 3 percent stake in the company, according to people briefed on his investment. Mr. Peltz, who has taken on H. J. Heinz and Wendys, is now planning to mount a campaign to press Kraft to sell the Post cereal business and Maxwell House, these people said, in an effort to raise its long-stagnant stock price. He is also expected to recommend that Kraft take on more debt and begin a huge stock buyback program, these people said. Kraft has become the latest target for Mr. Peltz and his activist firm, Trian Fund Management. The firm has had a string of recent successes, including its effort to break up Cadbury Schweppes, which the company is now in the process of pursuing. Mr. Peltz has yet to approach Kraft directly, but is planning to do so in the next week, these people said. While he is prepared to mount a proxy contest for board seats if his demands are not met, he is hoping to start a dialogue with the company  the way he did with Cadbury and Tiffany &amp; Company  without resorting to a bitter public fight. A spokesman for Mr. Peltz declined to comment. Shares of Kraft rose $2.28, or nearly 7 percent, to $36.74, after news of Mr. Peltzs investment in the company was reported by CNBC. Kraft stock started the year at $35.70 and had dropped by more than 8 percent in May before it started to recover. Kraft may make an easy target. Like many other packaged food companies with popular brand names, Kraft Foods has struggled to keep up with rapidly changing consumer tastes. The company thrived in an era when consumers bought all their food at grocery stores lined with aisles of brand-name products. Krafts brands include Nabisco, Oscar Mayer, Velveeta and Post cereals. But now, consumers are shopping at superstores like Costco and specialty stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joes that offer organic products or private-label brands that have cut into brand-name dominance. And at a time when consumers are demanding healthier, more natural products, Krafts portfolio of processed foods has struggled to remain relevant. Last year, Kraft brought in Irene B. Rosenfeld from PepsiCo to turn the company around, and Ms. Rosenfeld has embarked on an ambitious plan to create more innovative products and bolster marketing. While many industry analysts believe Ms. Rosenfelds plan holds promise, they dont see much improvement anytime soon. Its success is centered on Krafts ability to rebuild its product pipeline and reposition brands in a broader market, Brian Weddington, an analyst at Moodys wrote in April. This could be difficult to accomplish with an already diverse and mature portfolio such as Krafts, but in any case, implementing the strategy will take time. In the first quarter, reported April 18, Kraft said its profit fell 30 percent and was short of analysts estimates. The company earned $702 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $1 billion, or 61 cents a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter rose 5.7 percent, to $8.59 billion.

But simmering beneath the surface is a thornier problem that worries Chinese officials: how to assure the world that this is not a nation of counterfeits and that Made in China means well made. Already, the contamination has produced one of the largest pet food recalls in American history, heightening global fears about the quality and safety of Chinas agricultural products. And evidence has also shown that China exported fake drug ingredients, threatening to undermine the credibility of another booming export. This isnt an international crisis yet, but if they dont do something about it quickly, it will be, said David Zweig, a China specialist who teaches at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. The question is whether it spills over and Made in China becomes known as Buyer Beware.  With contamination known to have spread to feed for livestock and fish, some of Americas biggest food companies, like Kraft Foods, are lobbying the United States government to press China to improve its food safety measures. Kraft, Kellogg and other food companies have said they are reviewing their food safety procedures and upgrading equipment. These executives worry that another scare involving China could set off a consumer backlash against Chinese or foreign imports and reverse a trend that has made large food makers increasingly dependent on processed ingredients from developing countries. Experts also say doubts about the quality of Chinas food shipments and worries about its fake drugs could affect other exports if buyers begin to find safety problems or other product flaws. Indeed, the frequency of recalls of Chinese imports has risen in recent years, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. For instance, two weeks ago, Wal-Mart Stores announced a nationwide recall of baby bibs made in China after some of those bibs tested positive for high levels of lead. Just this week, the Cardinal Distributing Company recalled 300,000 childrens rings with dice or horseshoes, and Spandrel Sales and Marketing recalled about 200,000 necklaces, bracelets and rings. In both cases, the jewelry, which was made in China and sold in American vending machines, had high levels of lead. Many consumers have also told pet food makers that they want goods that are free of any ingredients from China, according to the Pet Food Institute. At stake for China is more than $30 billion a year in agricultural and drug exports to Asia, Europe and North America. For multinationals, not to mention the smaller American importers, the stakes are much higher. The current scare may prompt changes in China. The former head of the nations food and drug safety watchdog is now on trial in Beijing, accused of accepting bribes and failing to curb the growing market in fake and dangerous medicines. Still, few trade experts believe that Chinas export boom is going to slow anytime soon. Chinas shipments of vegetables and seafood have been soaring in recent years. And many importers say they would rather work with Chinese companies to raise safety levels than switch suppliers. China is also negotiating with the United States and the European Union to have them accept Chinese poultry products. That move is opposed by American and European poultry farmers, who are using the pet food scandal to press their case. If you bring chicken in here from China, you dont know what that chicken ate, and I think thats dangerous, said Lucius Adkins, president of the United Poultry Growers Association. Indeed, certain industries will face greater challenges, starting with feed processing, where two Chinese companies were found to have intentionally mixed an industrial chemical called melamine with wheat flour to heighten protein readings artificially. Pharmaceuticals need to overcome even higher hurdles, particularly since last year when 100 people died in Panama after ingesting fake ingredients used in cough syrup. Were now learning some of the dirty secrets behind this fast-growing economy, said Wang Fei-ling, a professor of international affairs at the Georgia Institute of Technology. And the dirty secret is theyre cutting corners in making things. In some places around the world, reaction has been swift. In Europe, food safety authorities are testing all Chinese protein imports for melamine. In South Korea, the CJ Corporation, one of the countrys largest food and feed makers, said last week that it was recalling 42 tons of wheat gluten from China even though the products had not tested positive for melamine. The major effect of this seems to me that the Chinese have been alerted that they should get their house in order, says Dr. M. D. Merbis, an economist at the Center for World Food Studies in Amsterdam. Some Chinese exports are feeling the pinch. A Spanish company came to visit us and was planning to buy our product, said Sun Hong, chief executive of the Sanfu Biochemical Company, a rice protein maker in Hangzhou. We were going to strike a deal at the end of the month. But after what happened in the U.S. they havent even replied to our e-mail yet. Experts say that to restore confidence, China needs to confront the issue and not be seen as covering up or delaying the release of information, which seemed to be the case during recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and bird flu. In similar fashion, after the initial news about melamine came out, China denied having shipped any wheat gluten to the United States and one official said melamine could not have harmed pets. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »SHANGHAI, May 17  Weeks after tainted Chinese pet food ingredients killed and sickened thousands of dogs and cats in the United States, this country is facing growing international pressure to prove that its food exports are safe to eat.

It could be an astute diagnosis of a malady spreading through boardrooms and financial markets. Research shows that mergers are often poorly timed, with the volume of deals reaching a crest just ahead of peaks in the stock market. And there is little evidence that they improve the fortunes of shareholders  except those of the investment banks that instigate the transactions. The value of global mergers and acquisitions totaled $1.2 trillion in the first quarter, according to the research firm Dealogic. That is the highest amount ever and 23 percent more than the comparable figure for the 2006 quarter. American deals accounted for $442 billion, down a bit from the fourth quarter and a shade below the record set in the first quarter of 2000, when the technology boom began to go spectacularly bust. The feverish activity could help the stock market  for a while. Because cycles in mergers and acquisitions tend to lead the market averages, every transaction may be buying a bit more time for the bulls, said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup Investment Research. But what’s in it for merger participants themselves? The fact that the pace of corporate coupling increases after asset prices have soared might make you wonder. So might the de-merger mania that is occurring alongside the wave of takeovers; some companies created through mega-mergers are effectively undoing those transactions or thinking seriously about it. Altria recently cut loose Kraft, which it acquired in the 1980s in the largest corporate combination until then, and DaimlerChrysler is thought to be eager to dispose of its American half, even if it means accepting far less than the $36 billion it paid for Chrysler in 1998. The present run of mergers is fueled by very low yields on junk debt, which can make the numbers work out when they otherwise would not. As long as the financing cost is less than the anticipated cash flow from the combined corporate entity, a merger may seem reasonable. How the businesses will fit together and make their way in the marketplace is almost beside the point. Mergers often fail to produce expected benefits because the assumptions used to justify the transactions are too optimistic and the sale prices prove too high, said Alan Brown, head of investment at Schroder Investment Management in London. “All the evidence points to most deals not being good for the investor in the acquiring company, at least in the short to medium term,” Mr. Brown said. Data compiled by Thomson Financial confirms Mr. Brown’s observation. Share prices of 14 of the 20 companies executing the largest mergers last year fell in the 90 days after the transactions were announced. Of the 15 deals that had a 180-day history since announcement, stocks of 8 of the acquirers had declined. When deciding whether to invest in a company involved in a big deal, the critical factors are the reasons for undertaking the transaction and the price, Mr. Brown said. “One has to look for a really compelling logic for the deal and then that the price is reasonable,” he advised. “Too many deals founder not on the logic but on the price that the seller has managed to extract.” Mergers that work best often involve two similar businesses that are joined to try to achieve economies of scale and added commercial clout, like Exxon and Mobil, Nationsbank and Bank of America, and Procter &amp; Gamble and Gillette. ANOTHER common rationale is to create more profit opportunities by merging companies that seem to be two sides of a coin, usually a business that sells one type of content and a second that distributes it. Time Warner and AOL, and Travelers and Citibank, are examples. These deals often reap fewer gains, perhaps because participants overestimate the potential for cross-selling. For Mr. Levkovich, the value of a merger depends on the deal makers more than the deal. If a company’s executives do a good job adding value for shareholders generally, chances are the transactions they arrange will do the same. And if the people in charge are weak, a big merger is unlikely to make up for their deficiencies. “Good management trumps what may seem to be questionable deals,” he said. “In contrast, seemingly obvious deals could collapse into bankruptcies with bad management.” More Articles in Business »THE term “merger mania” may be more than a snappy description of the recent pace of corporate deal-making. It could be an astute diagnosis of a malady spreading through boardrooms and financial markets. Research shows that mergers are often poorly timed, with the volume of deals reaching a crest just ahead of peaks in the stock market. And there is little evidence that they improve the fortunes of shareholders  except those of the investment banks that instigate the transactions.

Rosenfeld, the chief executive and chairman of Kraft Foods. Brought in from PepsiCo last year to turn Kraft around, Ms. Rosenfeld faced weak sales in emerging markets, few innovative products and a portfolio of brands that are about as fresh as a “Brady Bunch” rerun. On Tuesday, facing a roomful of skeptical analysts, Ms. Rosenfeld, 53, laid out her vision for change, a strategy that involved “rewiring” the company’s culture, redefining its markets, bolstering marketing and invigorating her staff by encouraging risk taking and candor. “This is a pivotal time in Kraft’s history, and I’m energized and optimistic,” she said, addressing the annual meeting of the Consumer Analyst Group of New York, being held in Scottsdale. “I believe that for the most part we have a strong product portfolio. It’s simply not growing fast enough.” Wall Street’s reaction was decidedly tepid, in part because Ms. Rosenfeld made clear that earnings in the coming year would fall well below analysts’ expectations as the company plowed $300 million to $400 million into its turnaround plan. “We don’t see a lot here for investors to get excited about owning shares of Kraft,” an analyst for Citigroup, David Driscoll, said in a note to investors. Shares of Kraft dropped $1.09, ending regular trading at $33.86. The company, with revenue of $34.36 billion a year, is the world’s second-largest food company after Nestlé. Although Kraft’s stock is publicly traded, 88.6 percent is owned by the Altria Group, formerly the Philip Morris Companies. Altria’s board decided on Jan. 31 to spin off its remaining shares of Kraft Foods at the end of March. The problems Ms. Rosenfeld is facing are not unique to Kraft. What were once dominant brand names like Kraft, Coca-Cola and Pillsbury have struggled as consumers turn to private-label products, organic and natural foods and fortified products, like vitamin-enhanced water. In his speech, the chief executive of ConAgra, Gary M. Rodkin, outlined some of the same problems at his company (which makes Chef Boyardee) and charted plans for “a cultural revolution.” Ms. Rosenfeld was blunt in her assessment of Kraft’s problems, including an obsession with cost-cutting that has hurt quality. As an example, she cited the Tassimo single-serve hot beverage system, a much ballyhooed product that fell far short of expectations. The original expectations were too aggressive and people working on the project were too uncomfortable to speak up, among other problems, she said. As part of her new strategy, Ms. Rosenfeld, who worked at Kraft from 1981 to 2003 before leaving for PepsiCo, said she wanted to stop thinking of products from a manufacturing perspective  she joked about “chocolate enrobed sandwich cookies”  and focus instead on consumer needs. By “reframing” categories for Kraft’s products, she predicted that huge growth potential for some existing products. For instance, Ms. Rosenfeld noted that Oscar Mayer’s prepackaged meats had been stagnant until the company started offering them as deli-shaved meats to compete with store deli meats. Similarly, she said DiGiorno has broadened its competition beyond frozen pizza by introducing an “Ultimate” pizza with top-quality ingredients to compete against local pizzerias. Other Kraft brands include Post cereals, Nabisco, Planters, Jell-O and Grey Poupon mustard. With a clear strategy and big investments in marketing and innovation, Ms. Rosenfeld predicted that Kraft would “hit our stride” in 2009. “I understand that for all of us the proof will be in the numbers,” she said.

Altria said Wednesday that it would spin off its 89 percent stake in Kraft on March 30. The move had been widely expected by shareholders, who were looking for Altrias tobacco business to be freed from the weaker Kraft business. The earnings posted by both companies highlighted their differences: Kraft has struggled under higher commodity costs and sluggish sales, while Altrias Philip Morris tobacco businesses have been bolstered by price increases and more sales overseas. Altria said its profit was $2.96 billion, or $1.40 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $2.29 billion, or $1.09 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Altria earnings were $1.27 a share, exceeding the average analyst estimate of $1.22, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue, excluding excise taxes collected, was $17.99 billion, shy of analysts estimates of $18.19 billion. Operating income at Philip Morris USA rose 4.2 percent, to $1.1 billion, as higher prices helped offset a 0.4 percent decline in cigarettes shipped. Operating income at Philip Morris International rose 46.5 percent, to $2.2 billion, as the number of cigarettes shipped rose 3.9 percent, to 191.4 billion. Meanwhile, Krafts profit fell 19 percent, to $624 million, or 38 cents a share. Sales fell 3 percent, to $9.37 billion, in part from the effect of divestitures and having one fewer shipping week compared with the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 51 cents a share, matching the average analyst estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. Kraft reported that market share declined in its Maxwell House coffee, Kraft salad dressings and Planters nuts businesses.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Tobaccos Road Back The number of American smokers usually drops about 1 or 2 percent a year. Government agencies keep adding cigarette taxes and outlawing smoking in restaurants, workplaces and even on public sidewalks. And tobacco companies continue to pay billions of dollars in legal settlements, money that is used in part to produce antismoking ads. For all the industrys apparent troubles, however, the future of cigarettes appears to be brighter than ever. That at least is the message investors are sending as the Altria Group  the company once known as Philip Morris and the maker of the worlds most popular cigarette, Marlboro  prepares to split itself by spinning off its Kraft Foods division to shareholders and become, once again, primarily a tobacco company. Today, Louis C. Camilleri, the chief executive of Altria, is expected to set a timetable for completing the spinoff. It is a move that Wall Street is responding to with the equivalent of a standing ovation, but it is not because Kraft Foods, the worlds second-largest food company, after Nestlé, will finally shed the taint of tobacco. Investors are glad that Altria will finally be rid of Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies, Velveeta and Tang. Since October, when the company announced its plan for the move, its shares have risen 10 percent. Something that is forgotten in all of this is people like to smoke, said David Adelman, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, who noted that United States tobacco stocks have beaten the Standard &amp; Poors 500-stock index in each of the last six years. Its enjoyable and theres not an alternative product. He added: If frozen dinners get too expensive, people will try something else. Thats not true with cigarettes  you are not up at night worried about that product that is going to make cigarettes obsolete. In the five and a half years since Altria sold 280 million shares of Kraft at $31 each in an initial public offering, the stock has remained relatively unchanged, closing yesterday at $34.83. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock. By contrast, shares of Altria have nearly doubled during that period, moving from $47 to yesterdays price of $87.54. It is a remarkable turnabout, considering that in late 2001, Philip Morris announced its plan to change its name to the Altria Group (drawn from the Latin word altus, meaning high, to suggest high performance). At the time, executives said the name change was intended to reduce the damage to the companys reputation that cigarettes were causing, reflected in the long-depressed share price at the time. Now, it is Kraft that is seen by many investors as a hindrance to the company. Why is Wall Street so infatuated with cigarettes? Cigarettes have certain advantages over other consumer products, not the least of which is that they are addictive. They are inexpensive to make, require almost no innovation, there is a global market for them, and cigarette makers can raise prices without seeing much of a drop in business. On top of all that, a recent string of court decisions has convinced investors that the worst of the litigation against tobacco companies is over. That, in turn, has allowed Altria to move forward with a revamping that begins with cutting Kraft loose and will ultimately allow Altria to use the huge amounts of cash generated by cigarettes to buy back stock or acquire other tobacco companies, particularly overseas. You take away Kraft out of Altria and you are left with a balance sheet that is extremely strong, said Charles Norton, portfolio manager at the Vice Fund, a mutual fund that invests in tobacco, gambling, alcohol and military contractors. Altria is the funds biggest holding. Its just a cash cow. The free cash flow on this business is just tremendous. The future prospects are particularly attractive in developing countries, where smoking has not yet declined as it has in more developed parts of the world like the United States and Europe. In China, for instance, the Philip Morris International unit of Altria signed a deal in 2005 that allows it to manufacture and sell Marlboro cigarettes to the countrys 350 million smokers. There are an estimated 1.3 billion smokers worldwide. But even in the United States, with 45 million smokers, the Philip Morris USA unit of Altria continues to generate sizable profits by raising prices. It also hopes eventually to lure consumers with new tobacco products, including a small tea-bag-like pouch that is smoke-free, spit-free and tucks into the cheek. It says it is also working on developing cigarettes that are less harmful. The exciting part for me, said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup, is that tobacco use today will evolve. Its unlikely that there will ever be a 100 percent safe cigarette, but we feel that a reduced-risk cigarette is on the horizon. But some health advocates say that the diminished social acceptability of cigarettes will hurt the long-term prospects of companies like Altria. The industry knows that its days of successfully selling their product in this country are limited, said Dr. David A. Kessler, who called for regulating the tobacco industry as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration in the 1990s and is now dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco. They may be finding favor on Wall Street, but theyre not finding favor in the public arena, he added. There are fewer and fewer places that you can go and smoke in public. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »There are plenty of reasons cigarettes would seem to be a terrible business.

The founders of half a dozen companies that make and distribute beans and rice, specialty groceries, cheeses, coffee and baked goods left Cuba in 1961 and 1962, sometimes through a program called Pedro Pan in which more than 14,000 children were sent to Florida and cared for until their parents could follow. Miami was crowded at that time with more Cuban immigrants than there were jobs to occupy them, so Catholic Welfare Services and other charitable groups sent some families to California. We went to Long Beach where there was a house for us to stay in and my dad had a job to go to in the morning, Jorge Rodriguez recalled. His father, Graciliano Rodriguez, went to work waiting tables in a private club and doing janitorial work on a second job. But soon the elder Mr. Rodriguez, who had been a wholesaler of potatoes and onions in Havana, found a way to work for himself in food distribution. He opened a store in the Los Angeles produce market dealing in the kinds of beans, rice and peppers that people from Latin America favored. Today, at 91, Mr. Rodriguez still works daily at the warehouse complex in City of Industry, Calif., that serves as headquarters for Mercado Latino Inc., a company run by his sons and daughter that has become one of the largest processors and distributors of Latin groceries and household goods to the nations supermarket chains and Wal-Mart Stores. Similarly, C&amp;F Foods Inc., also based in City of Industry, a 49-year-old industrial city east of Los Angeles, was founded in 1975 by a Cuban émigré, Jose Fernandez. It is run today by his grandson Luis Faura and has become a large processor and distributor of beans favored by Latinos: pinto, black, red and others. Beans have grown in popularity with rising appreciation among consumers for their high-fiber, high-protein health attributes and with the growth of Hispanic populations in all parts of the country. We have a distribution center in North Carolina that supplies the Southeast, Mr. Faura said. It never was a big market before but now there are people from South America and Mexico and El Salvador in Atlanta and Raleigh and everywhere. The list goes on. A Cuban immigrant, Gilbert de Cardenas, started Cacique USA in 1973 and has made it a leading supplier of Mexican-style cheeses. F. Gavina &amp; Sons Inc., named for the Cuban coffee grower Francisco Gavina, has brought robust coffees to supermarkets and McDonalds restaurants. But establishing a business in specialty foods is anything but a slam-dunk. Growing Hispanic markets do not offer a free ride to anyone; to succeed demands determination and investment. At Mercado Latino, for example, the distribution of food and other products changed utterly with the growing abilities of information technology. In the companys early days, it served as a middleman for products of many food processors, delivering Hispanic foods and offering shelf-stocking and promotional services to retailers. But to growing supermarket chains like Kroger and Safeway, such middlemen services were an added cost they didnt want to pay, said Richard Rodriguez, Mercados marketing vice president. So, he said, our company adapted to directly distributing our own branded products through our own warehouse centers. Mercado Latino now has nine centers throughout the Western states for processing and distributing 3,500 products. It employs up to 400 full- and part-time workers depending on seasonal needs and has more than $110 million in annual sales. We invested in information technology  you can never spend enough money on that, Mr. Rodriguez added. He recalled how his father pressed the children in 1975 to buy one of the first I.B.M. System 32 minicomputers to upgrade Mercado Latinos accounting abilities. That computer cost more than our company was worth at that time, Mr. Rodriguez said. But using it allowed the family to take on more products and spread its operations from Texas to the Canadian border. C&amp;F Foods, meanwhile, has grown to 285 employees and well over $100 million in annual revenue thanks in part to Americas increasing demand for organic produce. Its a good business, and the profit is there, Mr. Faura said. But you have to be ready to bear the cost of getting into it. To qualify as an organic food supplier, he explained, a company needs to invest in more costly fertilizers and new machinery for milling and packing the beans. When the organic food phenomenon took off in 2000 or so, he said, we debated whether it was a fad or a trend. It took almost $8 million of investment, Mr. Faura recalled. But we decided to go for it, and now we have that first-mover advantage. Still, with all the growth and promise of Hispanic markets, these companies are relatively small compared with food processing giants like Kraft and ConAgra. Will small entrepreneurs face a difficult future? Not yet, said Jorge Rodriguez, chief financial officer of Mercado Latino. The big outfits in my opinion are not embracing Latino markets, he said. They do a lot and say a lot, but marketing to immigrant consumers, whether Latino or Korean or whatever, you need to know what youre doing. If black beans are processed and polished too much, they lose their flavor. He is saying, of course, that these are still specialty markets. A vendor needs to know not only which products to offer but how the customers like their native foods. In time immigrant specialties will grow into broad American dietary staples: it has been a long time, for example, since pizza was considered a specifically Italian dish. Being a relatively small family company is no bar to success, Mr. Rodriguez said, if you know what to do and be good at it. Finally, the younger generations of six Southern California Cuban business families, along with 300 other initial shareholders, backed the newly chartered Americas United Bank in Glendale this year. It is the first Hispanic-led bank in 40 years to be chartered in California, said Gilbert Dalmau, a 49-year-old Cuban-American, longtime banker and chairman. But dont stress the Cuban aspect, Mr. Dalmau said to an interviewer. This bank is to serve the whole Hispanic community and all the other small-business communities here. The Rodriguezes and other families say their parents emigrated from Cuba 45 years ago because they feared for their childrens future. But with hard work and a smart entrepreneurial spirit, the children and their children have made their own futures and brought something new to the whole American economy.

More Articles in Business »A LONG-TERM consequence of Fidel Castros policies in the early 1960s is a thriving Cuban-émigré-owned food processing industry in the Los Angeles area that serves a growing market nationwide for Hispanic foods. The founders of half a dozen companies that make and distribute beans and rice, specialty groceries, cheeses, coffee and baked goods left Cuba in 1961 and 1962, sometimes through a program called Pedro Pan in which more than 14,000 children were sent to Florida and cared for until their parents could follow. Miami was crowded at that time with more Cuban immigrants than there were jobs to occupy them, so Catholic Welfare Services and other charitable groups sent some families to California. We went to Long Beach where there was a house for us to stay in and my dad had a job to go to in the morning, Jorge Rodriguez recalled. His father, Graciliano Rodriguez, went to work waiting tables in a private club and doing janitorial work on a second job. But soon the elder Mr. Rodriguez, who had been a wholesaler of potatoes and onions in Havana, found a way to work for himself in food distribution. He opened a store in the Los Angeles produce market dealing in the kinds of beans, rice and peppers that people from Latin America favored. Today, at 91, Mr. Rodriguez still works daily at the warehouse complex in City of Industry, Calif., that serves as headquarters for Mercado Latino Inc., a company run by his sons and daughter that has become one of the largest processors and distributors of Latin groceries and household goods to the nations supermarket chains and Wal-Mart Stores. Similarly, C&amp;F Foods Inc., also based in City of Industry, a 49-year-old industrial city east of Los Angeles, was founded in 1975 by a Cuban émigré, Jose Fernandez. It is run today by his grandson Luis Faura and has become a large processor and distributor of beans favored by Latinos: pinto, black, red and others. Beans have grown in popularity with rising appreciation among consumers for their high-fiber, high-protein health attributes and with the growth of Hispanic populations in all parts of the country. We have a distribution center in North Carolina that supplies the Southeast, Mr. Faura said. It never was a big market before but now there are people from South America and Mexico and El Salvador in Atlanta and Raleigh and everywhere. The list goes on. A Cuban immigrant, Gilbert de Cardenas, started Cacique USA in 1973 and has made it a leading supplier of Mexican-style cheeses. F. Gavina &amp; Sons Inc., named for the Cuban coffee grower Francisco Gavina, has brought robust coffees to supermarkets and McDonalds restaurants. But establishing a business in specialty foods is anything but a slam-dunk. Growing Hispanic markets do not offer a free ride to anyone; to succeed demands determination and investment.

The justices, without comment, left intact an Illinois Supreme Court decision that threw out the case against Philip Morris, which is a division of the Altria Group and is the nation’s largest cigarette maker. Antismoking activists had hoped the verdict would be the first in a series of awards around the country against the industry over light cigarettes. “It’s clearly the end of lights litigation in Illinois,” said David Adelman, a Morgan Stanley analyst who has an overweight rating on Altria. Altria shares fell 33 cents, to $83.42, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. In overturning the award last year, the Illinois Supreme Court said smokers could not invoke a state consumer protection law because the Federal Trade Commission had endorsed the “light” and “low tar” descriptions in settlements with other cigarette makers. Like many states, Illinois bars claims over actions specifically authorized by a government agency. Supreme Court intervention might have complicated plans by Altria, which is based in New York, to spin off its Kraft Foods unit. On Nov. 16, Altria’s chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said the company was ready to split off the food company, pointing to what he said was a waning risk of costly tobacco-related awards. The tobacco industry is still defending a separate nationwide class-action lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on behalf of light cigarette smokers. That suit, which invokes federal racketeering law, also raises questions about the legal force of the F.T.C. settlements. Arguments in Major Antitrust Case WASHINGTON, Nov. 27 (AP)  The Supreme Court pressed both sides Monday in a case that turns on the question of how much evidence plaintiffs must provide to litigate a private antitrust-conspiracy suit. Some experts consider the case, Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, which stems from the deregulation of the telecommunications industry in the 1980s and 1990s, as the most important antitrust case to reach the Supreme Court in 20 years. The class-action suit was filed in 2003 on behalf of United States consumers of local telephone and Internet service, claiming that incumbent local telephone companies, or Baby Bells, illegally conspired to prevent competition by excluding new local phone companies from their territories and agreeing not to compete against each other. The original seven incumbent local phone companies have been reduced to four through mergers and acquisitions: Verizon Communications, the BellSouth Corporation, Qwest Communications and AT&amp;T. A federal district court dismissed the case, saying plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to show that a conspiracy would most likely be proved at trial. That decision was reversed by the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which ruled in October 2005 that a plaintiff must submit only a “short and plain statement of the claim” to survive a motion to dismiss. The case is being closely watched by numerous companies, who contend that a low standard would allow “meritless” and “abusive” cases to go forward. But the plaintiffs argue that a higher standard could make it too difficult for individuals to bring valid antitrust cases.

During a conference call with analysts, Altrias chief executive, Louis C. Camilleri, said that the board had carefully weighed the risks and rewards of a sell off and had decided to proceed. The precise timing of the sale is to be announced at the companys January board meeting. Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International. I think todays announcement clearly shows to the world that the board is comfortable with the entire litigation environment and is therefore prepared to move forward, Mr. Camilleri said. The announcement is an about-face for Altria, which said in September that a divestiture of its Kraft shares would be put off indefinitely, after a federal judge ruled that smokers of light cigarettes could pursue fraud claims as a class-action suit. The significance is the board is moving away from their very traditional stance and being a little more aggressive, said Christopher Growe, an analyst at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons. In doing so, the board signaled to investors that they would not have to wait much longer to benefit from the value created by spinning off Kraft, he said. Mr. Growe said a spinoff could happen as soon as this spring, but he added that the boards announcement was vague enough for it to put off the move at its January meeting. Altria owns 88.6 percent of Krafts stock, and its planned divestiture is part of a larger restructuring of the company. Bonnie Herzog, a Citigroup analyst, called the announcement very positive news. It is clear that the boards priority is to break up the company and now the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the breakup has finally diminished, she wrote in a research note. Altria shares rose $2.28, or 2.9 percent, to close at $82.10 after the announcement. Mr. Camilleri said the decision would be timed to coincide with the release of a strategic plan by Krafts chief executive, Irene B. Rosenfeld, to spur the companys profits. Ms. Rosenfeld, who was named chief executive in June, is expected to release her strategy in February. In allowing the class-action suit in September, Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn found substantial evidence that manufacturers knew that light cigarettes were at least as dangerous as regular cigarettes, though they were often promoted as a safer alternative. Many analysts, however, believe the class-action status will be overturned on appeal. In addition, yesterday, Altria posted a third-quarter profit of about $2.88 billion, or $1.36 a share, compared with $2.88 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 3.7 percent to $25.9 billion, from a year earlier.

The company raised its earnings outlook for the year, but only because of the expected gain from the sale of its Minute Rice brand. Kraft is the largest North American food company, with brands that include Oreo cookies, Maxwell House coffee and Kraft cheese. It posted a profit of $748 million, or 45 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with $674 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Kraft earned 46 cents a share, compared with Wall Street analysts average forecast of 45 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 2.3 percent to $8.24 billion. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $8.26 billion. The companys sales were hurt by a 9 percent decline in North American ready-to-drink beverages like Fruit2O water and by consumers shying away from salads amid an extensive recall of spinach because of deadly E. coli bacteria and a smaller recall of lettuce. At the same time, the company has not produced the blockbuster new products it needs to keep growing, especially given its already large size. Aside from the companys South Beach Diet products, the last successful major new line was DiGiorno Pizza in the 1990s, said Gregg Warren, an analyst at Morningstar. When you are a $32 billion company, you need a good handful of those to drive the needle, Mr. Warren said. Krafts chief executive officer, Irene B. Rosenfeld, also was critical of the new product pipeline during a conference call with analysts. Too many of our innovations are what we would characterize as new to Kraft, but not new to the world, Ms. Rosenfeld said. Kraft has been in the process of closing plants and cutting jobs in order to rein in costs amid higher prices for energy, wheat and other commodities. It has also sold off some brands to focus on products like cookies, beverages and South Beach Diet meals. Analysts and investors await an announcement from Krafts parent, the Altria Group, on when it plans to spin off the rest of Krafts stock and word from Ms. Rosenfeld about her strategy for running the company. Ms. Rosenfeld was named chief executive in June. Kraft raised its full-year earnings outlook to between $1.86 and $1.89 a share because of gains from the sale of its Minute Rice brand and its interest in United Biscuits. Kraft shares fell 4.5 percent, to $34.65, in late trading after the earnings were announced.
