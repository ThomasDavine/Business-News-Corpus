Buffett, take note. It is not just a few wealthy individuals paying unusually low taxes to the federal government. Corporate America is not far behind.A comprehensive study released on Thursday found that 280 of the biggest publicly traded American companies faced federal income tax bills equal to 18.5 percent of their profits during the last three years — little more than half the official corporate rate of 35 percent and lower than their competitors in many industrialized countries. Mr. Buffett, the billionaire investor, has said that the tax code is unfair, allowing him to pay just 17 percent in federal taxes last year, about half the percentage his secretary paid. The corporate study, prepared by the left-leaning advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice, examined the regulatory filings of the companies to compute each year’s current federal taxes. Some of the companies disputed the findings, saying that the study understated their tax payments by omitting deferred taxes that they may pay in future years. Using information from the companies’ own corporate filings, however, the study concluded that a quarter of the 280 corporations owed less than 10 percent of profits in federal income taxes and 30 companies had no federal tax liability for the entire three-year period. The report is being released as corporations are pushing for a cut in their official tax rate, saying the current system puts American companies at a disadvantage with competitors abroad and encourages them to shift jobs and investments overseas. The Congressional supercommittee charged with cutting the budget deficit is also considering proposals to revamp the tax system, simplifying the corporate structure and possibly lowering corporate rates. The study said that the shelters and loopholes in the current tax system rewarded companies that aggressively avoided taxes at the expense of those that did not. A quarter of the companies in the study had a federal tax bill of 35 percent of their profits, while a similar number had an effective rate of less than 10 percent. “Companies that are paying their fair share ought to demand that the tax-dodging companies pay their fair share too,” said Robert S. McIntyre, the author of study. “So should the public, which is subsidizing them in terms of increased federal debt.” The report is based on data gleaned from the companies’ regulatory filings, which can be different from their corporate tax returns. Even in a year when a company claims an overall tax benefit, it may pay some cash taxes while accumulating credits that can be redeemed in future years. But because most corporations do not release their tax returns, these corporate regulatory filings offer the best publicly available gauge of what companies pay and what strategies they use to reduce their tax bills. Among the companies that the study said escaped a liability for all three years were Boeing and Ryder System, whose chief financial officer, Art A. Garcia, said the company had benefited from the additional depreciation intended to stimulate the economy. Boeing officials said they, too, had paid  some federal taxes, but would not say how much. They said they had lowered their rate by taking advantage of tax breaks intended to encourage hiring. Chaz Bickers, a company spokesman, said Boeing hired 9,000 American workers this year Also on the list was General Electric, which has come under close scrutiny since The New York Times reported earlier this year that the company had recorded $5.1 billion in American profits in 2010, but claimed a federal income tax benefit of $3.2 billion in its regulatory filing. “The report is inaccurate and distorted,” said Kenneth Juarez, a G.E. spokesman. He said G.E. paid “billions of dollars in taxes in the United States over the last decade,” but would not say what part was federal income taxes. The company that recorded the biggest reduction in taxes was Wells Fargo Bank, which is a large holding of Mr. Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway. The banking company reported a total of $49 billion in profits in 2008 through 2010, yet received a tax benefit of $651 million. Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said much of the tax savings came from write-offs obtained after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, which incurred big losses during the financial crisis. American corporations are paying a smaller share of taxes than in previous decades. They paid a total of $191 billion in federal income taxes in 2010, the Internal Revenue Service said, representing about 1.3 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. That is down from about 6 percent during the 1950s (although some of the decline is because a smaller percentage of businesses now file as corporations).   Despite the decline in corporate tax rates since then, business advocates say the nation needs to lower its top rate further to encourage hiring and investment. Grover Norquist, head of Americans for Tax Reform, said that the United States system was not competitive because it taxed income earned around the world, instead of just in this country. “There are still Bolsheviks who recognize that we need to bring the rates down,” he said. But the Citizens for Tax Justice study found that two-thirds of  the American companies with significant profits overseas actually paid more in taxes to foreign governments than they did in the United States. Rather than lowering the corporate rate more, the study said, the federal government should end the subsidies and shelters that favor companies that game the system.  “Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and school — things that are really important for economic development here in the United States," the report said. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 4, 2011 An article on Thursday about a report from the Citizens for Tax Justice on the relatively small federal income tax payments by many large American corporations misspelled, in some editions, the surname of a General Electric spokesman who disputed the studyâs findings about that company.

Reports an Increase in Profits and Meets Analysts’ Expectations<date>Published: October 21, 2011</date><text>General Electric, the nation’s largest industrial company, said on Friday that it had higher net earnings for the third quarter, but price pressures in its energy business squeezed profit margins in an economic environment that the company’s chief executive described as “volatile.”The company reported net income of $3.2 billion in the July-September period, up 57 percent compared with the same period in 2010. A large part of that leap, however, resulted from a significant one-time charge last year related to G.E.’s discontinued consumer finance unit in Japan. The company said it had operating earnings per share of 31 cents in the third quarter, up 11 percent from 2010 and exactly in line with expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. That excluded the 8-cents-per-share impact of its payback of Berkshire Hathaway’s investment, made in October 2008 when G.E. was being battered by the financial crisis. The cash infusion was repaid this month for $3.3 billion. But the company said it expected that the payback would improve annualized earnings per share by 3 cents a share in future quarters. Revenue for the period was $35.4 billion, which the company described as flat compared with the third quarter of 2010. Analysts had forecast $34.93 billion in revenue, according to a survey compiled by Thomson Reuters. Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, said the company was pleased with the results, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in operating earnings, in what he called a “volatile macro environment.” “We ended the quarter with a record high order backlog of $191 billion and we remain confident in our full-year 2011 operating framework,” he said in a statement. In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Immelt said G.E. expected “solid” double-digit operating earnings for the year, with improved margins in the company’s energy business. Profits fell 9 percent in the third quarter in the energy unit, to $1.5 billion, with the wind turbine business driving margins down, mostly because of competition and weakness in new orders. “It was the largest driver of the margin pressure,” said Keith S. Sherin, G.E.’s chief financial officer, in an interview. Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ, said he thought the company reported a good quarter “given the kind of ups and downs that we see in the economic news.” “The hit there was the lower-priced wind turbine shipments,” he said. “Prices reflect when orders are booked, and it takes a while for prices to improve.” But Jeffrey T. Sprague, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, called the results disappointing. “The company is reporting very good order growth but you are seeing very intense competition for orders,” Mr. Sprague said. “You have got poorly priced products in the backlog that, when you begin delivering, it pressures the margins.” G.E. had been expecting its business for power generation equipment to improve this year. Industrial orders grew in the third quarter, but the rate slowed to 16 percent. Mr. Sherin said the data on long cycle equipment business could be “lumpy” and that orders for the first three quarters of the year were “very strong.” He said the company expected a strong fourth quarter in the energy business that would continue in 2012. The earnings report provided a glimpse into the company’s progress in overhauling its diverse range of businesses. With its global reach, it also gives a snapshot into how business is faring in the United States and around the world. The strongest industrial growth for large American manufacturers has recently come from abroad, but in the past month the debt crisis in Europe has caused concern about economic prospects. Mr. Sherin said in the call that G.E. was monitoring the situation in Europe closely. Other industrial companies also have announced results. Honeywell International reported Friday that earnings rose 45 percent, to $1.10 a share, and it raised its 2011 outlook. “Despite signals of slower economic growth, we expect positive organic growth to continue the rest of this year and into 2012,” said David M. Cote, the chairman and chief executive of Honeywell. United Technologies reported this week that its earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.47, up 13 percent compared with the same quarter in 2010. The company also raised its full-year outlook. Industrials rose nearly 2 percent on Wall Street. General Electric closed down nearly 2 percent at $16.31. Honeywell rose more than 5 percent to $51.28. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said that in the third quarter, its industrial segments had $23.4 billion in revenue, up 19 percent. International revenue was up by 25 percent, driven by growth in Brazil, Russia, China, India, Canada, Mexico and the Middle East. But it has been gradually paring back its finance business, GE Capital, as part of a long-term strategy to rely more on its core industrial units. In the third quarter, GE Capital showed a 1 percent rise in revenue to $12 billion. GE Capital earned about $1.5 billion in the third quarter, up 79 percent compared with the same quarter in 2010, because of lower credit costs and improved margins, the company said. Mr. Sherin said commercial real estate pared its losses to $82 million. After the financial crisis, G.E. cut its dividend in 2009, the first time it did so since the Great Depression. Since then, it has raised its dividend three times, to 60 cents a share. “When we get into the second or third year of the recovery, the longer cycle business will start to produce good returns,” said Mr. Tortoriello, the S&amp;P Capital analyst. “That is why we are going to see significant earnings growth in G.E. in 2012 which we may not see from industrial companies in general because of the slowing growth in the economy.”General Electric, the nation’s largest industrial company, said on Friday that it had higher net earnings for the third quarter, but price pressures in its energy business squeezed profit margins in an economic environment that the company’s chief executive described as “volatile.”</text></article>

Immelt, chief of General Electric. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, is not despairing over stagnant domestic growth and increased competition from China and other foreign producers. “We can win,” Mr. Immelt said, repeatedly, during a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event on Monday. Mr. Immelt has a unique perch from which to view the nation’s position in the global economy. He oversees a sprawling conglomerate with exposure to finance, manufacturing, aerospace and others. A longtime Republican, he also heads President Obama’s jobs council. That has drawn him, at times, into bipartisan crossfire. “You go through days where you’re being criticized by Dennis Kucinich and Fox News in the same day,” he said. A report recently submitted by the jobs council to the Obama administration outlining strategies for growth could result in “millions of jobs,” Mr. Immelt said. He added that the council, which he has headed since January, was treating the effort to spur domestic growth and reduce unemployment “like a turnaround at a company.” Mr. Immelt, whose pay package last year totaled $15.2 million, said he sympathized with the Occupy Wall Street movement, which has taken aim at what it sees as excessive compensation at Wall Street banks and other large corporations. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “It is natural to assume people are going to be angry,” in the economy’s weakened state, Mr. Immelt said, citing the current unemployment figure of 9.1 percent. He added that rising executive compensation had been “part of the problem that is creating this mood,” but said that he did not know if it would placate protesters to bring together the chief executives of America’s largest corporations on an agreement to forgo some of their compensation. “If unemployment is 12 percent, that will mean nothing,” he said. “If unemployment goes down, it won’t matter.” When talking about American’s position in the global economy, Mr. Immelt’s remarks took on the tone of a halftime pep talk. He said that with a clearer regulatory structure, an increased export base and an “all-in” business climate, the United States would be able to compete on a global front. “I just got back from China, and I am completely convinced that we can compete and win,” he said. G.E., he added, would “fight for our market share in every corner of the world.” Mr. Immelt defended claims that G.E. had avoided paying federal taxes in 2010, saying that the company had paid about $1 billion in taxes to various municipalities, and that its tax rate for 2011 would be more than 30 percent. He told the audience of reporters and business executives that although “the rest of the world plays harder than we do,” he welcomed the challenge of strong foreign rivals. “This focus on competitiveness that globalization brings – that makes us better,” he said.</text></article>

The coolant in old appliances (now banned from newer versions) can cause serious trouble, warming the atmosphere and depleting the ozone layer.Regulations forbid the release of liquid refrigerants during disposal. But what if the refrigerant was not in the cooling system, but stored up in the old foam used for insulation? The insulation in older machines is full of a gassy refrigerant that can waft away during dismantling and continue to diffuse later when the foam is shredded and sitting in a landfill. Now a few American companies have embarked on voluntary recycling programs that go beyond what many local governments do when a resident leaves an old refrigerator on the curb for pickup. The companies use ingenious robotic systems to squeeze out almost all of the coolant in refrigerators — including the hard-to-reach coolant in the foam — before they head for the landfill. Appliance Recycling Centers of America, a company based in Minneapolis with a chain of recycling depots, recently unveiled a 40-foot-tall behemoth that dismantles refrigerators the environmental way, extracting the coolant until only 0.2 percent is left. The machine, installed in Philadelphia, has a panoply of shredders, magnets, chutes and sluices worthy of a green Willy Wonka. Send a refrigerator down the conveyor belt of this unit and it is transformed into neat piles of plastic and metal that can be recycled rather than buried in a landfill. The foam insulation is turned into pellets that can be used as fuel or for other products. About a third of the coolant is recovered from the compressor and about 70 percent from the foam insulation, said Peter Hessler, managing director of Untha Recycling Technology, a company in Karlstadt, Germany, that created the new recycling system. The entire mechanical dismantling takes about a minute, said Jack Cameron, chief executive of Appliance Recycling Centers of America and of ApplianceSmart, a chain of appliance stores. The system costs about $5.5 million and can tackle about 150,000 used refrigerators a year, he said. The capital investment for the system was possible, Mr. Cameron said, because the recycling company has a six-year contract with General Electric. G.E. delivers new appliances and hauls the old ones away in 12 Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states for Home Depot. G.E. is supplying the recycler with all of those returns. Elaborate refrigerator recycling systems like Untha’s are rare in the United States but not in Europe, which has strict controls against the release of refrigerants. The dismantling of appliances in the Untha system takes place in a vacuum so that the gases, commonly known as freons, CFCs or chlorofluorocarbons, cannot escape into the atmosphere. The system Untha installed in Philadelphia had to be scaled up for American refrigerators. “The U.S. refrigerators are three times the size of European ones,” Mr. Hessler said. First refrigerators go through two Dumpster-size shredders placed end to end. The foam insulation is handled in a separate step. “We crack the cell matrix of the foam by heating it up in a pelletizer” and extracting the remaining coolants, he said. Another robotic system that captures refrigerants down to the last few drops is at the Stow, Ohio, location of JACO Environmental. Michael Dunham, director of energy and environmental programs, said the system separates more than 95 percent of the materials used to manufacture the old appliances and sends them to be made into other products. The system, which is portable, was manufactured by SEG of Mettlach, Germany. Many of these old refrigerators are still chugging along, Mr. Dunham said. JACO picked up about 480,000 refrigerators for recycling last year, with an average age of 21 years. “And the old ones stored away in garages and basements aren’t getting any younger,” he said. The company, which participates in a voluntary program to bag and burn old insulating foam in refrigerators, expects to receive a comparable volume of old refrigerators during the next decade. In the future, financial incentives may encourage the capture and destruction of refrigerants. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, California is completing a cap-and-trade regulation, set to start in 2012, that includes credit for pre-1995 refrigerants said Bart Croes, chief of the Research Division at the Air Resources Board, which will oversee the program. “Companies can use credits from the proper destruction of refrigerants to cover part of their annual emissions,” said Gary Gero, president of Climate Action Reserve in Los Angeles, which certifies projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and issues offset credits. Mr. Gero said many companies had already bought carbon credits in anticipation of the new regulation. Mr. Dunham of JACO says his company is already taking one of the refrigerants it destroys, CFC 12, to the carbon offset market. “People are buying the credits and banking them, hanging on to them in hopes they will be more valuable when cap and trade comes into effect,” he said. Many refrigerants that are now banned from production, but are still legally captured and recycled, have about 700 to 10,000 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide, Mr. Gero said. An average old refrigerator has about half a pound of the now-banned refrigerant in the cooling system and one pound in the foam, he said. “So the refrigerator has an equivalent of approximately five tons of carbon dioxide,” Mr. Gero said. “For comparison, that is like driving over 10,000 miles in an average car.” “If you capture these gases and take them to a destruction facility,” he said, “you’ve prevented a problem, and we give you credit.” E-mail: novelties@nytimes.comRECYCLING refrigerators — especially those made more than 15 years ago — is a tricky job.

Buffett invests in companies like General Electric or Goldman Sachs, markets almost always interpret it as a great vote of confidence. But is it not an even more positive signal when those same companies, returned to health and flush with abundant profits, pay him back? If so, then investors might want to use G.E.’s decision to return Mr. Buffett’s money — which served as a life raft to the company during the 2008 crisis — to reflect on just how much better off the American financial system has become.G.E. officially notified Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway on Tuesday that it intended next month to repurchase the $3 billion of preferred stock the company sold him in October 2008. The company has flagged the move for a while. Under terms of the deal it struck with Mr. Buffett when market mayhem was breaking loose, G.E. was obliged to wait three years to call the bonds. It also needed to give at least 30 days’ notice — hence this week’s letter from Fairfield, Conn., to Omaha, Neb. Mr. Buffett’s money does not come cheap, so it’s logical that G.E., as Goldman did recently, would seek to exit the deal as soon as possible. The perpetual preferred stock carries a dividend of 10 percent and can be repurchased at a 10 percent premium. Berkshire also received warrants to buy $3 billion of common stock at $22.25 a share within the next five years. With G.E. stock trading around $15, the warrants are currently out of the money. But that should not diminish the positives to be gleaned from G.E.’s payback. The company’s financial position is much stronger. G.E., led by Jeffrey R. Immelt, holds some $90 billion of cash to deal with any blips in refinancing the medium-term debt it took on during the crisis; halved its dependence on the short-term commercial paper market; and has nearly reached a goal of whittling down its finance arm’s balance sheet to $440 billion. True, many banks in the United States are still wobbling, thanks to mortgage and European debt woes. But even with all these troubles, Mr. Buffett secured only a 6 percent dividend and a 5 percent repurchase premium on his $5 billion investment in Bank of America last month. That, combined with G.E.’s decision to hand back his money, marks progress, however slow and grinding it may feel. A Taxing Idea An Italian megatax would be a game changer. A one-time wealth tax of 400 billion euros (about $550 billion), as proposed by the former UniCredit chief Alessandro Profumo, would solve Italy’s debt problem, thus helping reverse the euro crisis in general. Italians are wealthy enough that they could afford it. They certainly have no business asking for help from the Germans, who are actually poorer. But before such an idea has a hope of becoming reality, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi would first need to go. Italian entrepreneurs, including the head of Confindustria, the business lobby, have reacted surprisingly well to Mr. Profumo’s idea. Part of the reason is that every week Italians are effectively suffering a wealth tax as a result of plunging domestic stock and bond markets. The latest austerity program, which would balance budgets in 2013, has not stopped the rot. Even media reports that Italy was cozying up to China in the hope of getting it to buy bonds has not helped. Yields rose again on Tuesday after a poor bond auction. So getting the agony over with has some appeal to Italy’s wealthy. The 400 billion euros that Mr. Profumo has proposed would cut national debt to below 100 percent of gross domestic product from 120 percent. That would change market psychology. Equity and bond prices might rebound, meaning investors might gain more on the market swings than they lost on the tax roundabout. What’s more, Italians are frankly rich enough to bail out their own government. The latest Bank of Italy data shows that net wealth was 8.6 trillion euros, or 566 percent of G.D.P., in 2009 — more than Germany’s 6.1 trillion euros or 246 percent of G.D.P. in 2008. Even if a wealth tax focused only on the richest people, a one-time tax of 10 percent, collected over a few years, should do the trick. Mr. Profumo has not just pushed the tax idea. He has offered to enter politics as part of a coalition government to help see the idea through. Sadly, that can happen only if Mr. Berlusconi quits. For now, despite all the judicial scandals and economic mismanagement, he is clinging to power. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.When Warren E.

Barely eight months after ceding control of NBC Universal and its Universal Studios to Comcast, G.E. is diving into the documentary world as the financial backer of 30 three-minute films by directors including Morgan Spurlock (“POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold”), Joe Berlinger (“Crude”), Barbara Kopple (“Shut Up and Sing”) and Alex Gibney (“Magic Trip: Ken Kesey’s Search for a Kool Place”). The idea is to join Cinelan, a publisher of videos that tell stories within three minutes or less, in generating very short movies about world-changing innovation, through a project that has yet to be titled, according to both Mr. Spurlock and Karol Martesko-Fenster, a Cinelan founding director. “We’re really putting a call out to filmmakers, to see what they can come up with,” said Mr. Martesko-Fenster, who joined Mr. Spurlock in discussing the project by telephone last week. Mr. Spurlock suggested that a film about, say, the invention of microfinancing techniques might fill the bill, though no subjects have yet been set. Mr. Spurlock, Mr. Berlinger, Jessica Yu (“Ping Pong Playa”) and others are expected to join Mr. Martesko-Fenster in introducing the project next month at the Toronto International Film Festival, where Cinelan and G.E. will be sponsoring get-togethers at a filmmakers’ lounge. The first films should be ready to show at the Sundance Film Festival early next year. The minimovies, whatever their subjects may be, will also appear at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and elsewhere, and will simultaneously be circulated on the Web, both through a planned site and through syndication. In a statement, Judy Hu, a G.E. executive who oversees advertising and branding matters, said her company hoped to “inspire people to continue to work to change the world for the better.” The filmmakers, said Mr. Spurlock and Mr. Martesko-Fenster, will be paid a license fee for initial use of the films, but will ultimately own the rights. As for the festivals, they said, the project is a breakthrough for those who have long been trying to get G. E. on board. “They’ve been talking to G.E. ad infinitum, to get them involved with the festivals” Mr. Martesko-Fenster said.</text></article>

On Thursday, Berkshire Hathaway, run by Mr. Buffett, announced plans to invest $5 billion in Bank of America, a vote of confidence for the beleaguered financial firm. While investors initially cheered the news bidding up bank stocks in trading this morning, the sector settled down in the afternoon as the market digested the deal. Shares of Bank of America, which spiked more than 25 percent on Thursday, are currently at $7.55, up roughly 8 percent. Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, both up which jumped nearly 10 percent in the morning, gave back much of their early gains, too. JPMorgan Chase was off slightly in the afternoon. The pullback reflects the continued trepidation about the industry, which is clouded by economic concerns, regulatory uncertainty, and legal liabilities.

Last quarter, Bank of America reported an $8.8 billion loss, owing in large part to a settlement with mortgage investors. Mr. Moynihan has taken steps to cut costs and improve its capital cushion. He put the European credit card operation up for sale and sold off the Canadian card division, making it clear non-core assets would be on the block. Last week, the bank announced plans to cut 3,500 jobs. In a memo to employees, Mr. Moynihan said that “we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully.” But the embattled chief stopped short of raising capital, reiterating that the financial firm was on solid footing. The assertions did little to soothe investors. Then on early Wednesday, Mr. Buffett called Mr. Moynihan to discuss a potential deal. At first, Bank of America’s chief was skeptical, saying the bank didn’t need a capital injection. But Mr. Buffett emphasized it would be a long-term investment, not a short-term fix. Over the course of the day and multiple calls, they hammered out the investment, finalizing the details late on Wednesday. Under the terms of the deal, Berkshire will buy $5 billion of preferred stock that pay a 6 percent annual dividend, and receive warrants for 700 million shares that it can exercise over the next 10 years. Bank of America has the option to buy back the preferred shares at any time for a 5 percent premium. It is the sort of move industry insiders had been expecting. In May, Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman told reporters at his firm’s annual meeting that a big name investor was bound to jump into financials, prompting the “the malaise to lift.” “We think this news is clearly a positive for the entire group as Buffett’s investment injects confidence into the system and Bank of America in particular following its consistent erosion in recent trading,” Nomura analyst Glenn Schorr said in a research note, adding that it should help dampen volatility in the stock. Mr. Buffett has played the role of savior before. In the depths of the financial crisis, Berkshire Hathaway gave Goldman Sachs a $5 billion lifeline, which came with a hefty 10 percent dividend. The investment bank paid back the money earlier this year after getting the greenlight from regulators. When shares of General Electric got hit, Mr. Buffett stepped in with a $3 billion investment. The deal also came with a 10 percent annual payout. With Bank of America, Mr. Buffett is once again jumping in at a point of weakness. Since the beginning of the year, the bank’s shares have dropped to less than $7, from $15. Last year, it was trading at more than $19. “Bank of America is a strong, well-led company, and I called Brian to tell him I wanted to invest in it,” Mr. Buffett said in a statement. “I am impressed with the profit-generating abilities of this franchise, and that they are acting aggressively to put their challenges behind them. Bank of America is focused on their customers and on serving them well. That’s what customers want, and that’s the company’s strategy.” Mr. Buffett is a fan of financial companies that he thinks have a strong franchise and brand. He owns Wells Fargo, gradually upping his stake over the past year. In the latest quarter, he bought nearly 10 million shares of the lender. He has also counted Bank of America among his past holdings. In the midst of the subprime crisis in 2007, Berkshire bought 8.7 million shares, quickly increasing the stake to 9.1 million shares. But Mr. Buffett was critical of management at the time. He told Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that Bank of America paid a “crazy price” to acquire Merrill Lynch in the midst of the disaster. Mr. Buffett sold off his remaining shares in Bank of America at the end of 2010. In the video below, Susanne Craig discusses Warren E. Buffett’s decision to invest $5 billion in Bank of America.</text></article>

Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. With his $5 billion investment in Bank of America, Warren E. Buffett is adding yet another American financial giant to his stock portfolio. His investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, has long been an investor in the nation’s banks, and counts five firms in which it has a major stake. Here were Berkshire’s top holdings in financial companies as of June 30, according to a regulatory filing: FIRM MARKET VALUE OF STAKE AMOUNT OF SHARES CHANGE FROM 1ST QUARTER American Express $7.84 billion 151,610,700 No change Wells Fargo $9.89 billion 352,327,608 + 9,703,683 shares US Bancorp $1.76 billion 69,039,426 No change Source: Bloomberg News/S.E.C. filing Berkshire also owns smaller stakes in the Bank of New York Mellon and the M&amp;T Bank Corporation. Of course, Mr. Buffett’s most notable bets on the finance sector of late came from his big capital injections into Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the financial crisis. Those two deals closely resemble his new investment in Bank of America; he bought $5 billion worth of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman and $3 billion in G.E. Those purchases were highly profitable for Mr. Buffett, with the preferred shares carrying a 10 percent annual dividend, as well as requirement that Goldman and G.E. pay a 10 percent premium to buy Berkshire out. Goldman has since bought back Mr. Buffett’s holdings, while G.E. has said that it intends to do so. Still, not all of Mr. Buffett’s Wall Street moves have turned out well. While Berkshire earned a profit from its Goldman and G.E. investments, warrants that it received along with the preferred shares remain underwater. (The 700 million warrants that Berkshire received from Bank of America, on the other hand, are currently in the money: They carry a strike price of $7.142857, while the firm’s stock price is at $7.89 as of late Thursday morning.) Going further back, just before the market crash of 1987, Berkshire bought $700 million of Salomon Brothers preferred shares.

He stepped in as Salomon’s chairman in 1991 after John Gutfreund was forced to resign following a Treasury securities bidding scandal. Mr. Buffett was widely credited with saving the firm from collapsing by quickly cleaning house and winning over angry clients, politicians and investors. (He famously delivered the following lines in his testimony before Congress on the scandal: “Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding; lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”) Mr. Buffett stepped down as Salomon’s chairman after roughly 10 months. Berkshire sold its shares in the firm in 1997, after Salomon was sold to what is now Citigroup. Outside of banks, Mr. Buffett declined to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1993. After LTCM faced collapse in 1998 amid a global financial crisis, its officials approached Mr. Buffett — and he again passed.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/science/earth/21laser.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Laser Advance in Uranium Enrichment May Risk Bomb Spread<date>Published: August 20, 2011</date><text>Scientists have long sought easier ways to make the costly material known as enriched uranium — the fuel of nuclear reactors and bombs, now produced only in giant industrial plants.One idea, a half-century old, has been to do it with nothing more substantial than lasers and their rays of concentrated light. This futuristic approach has always proved too expensive and difficult for anything but laboratory experimentation. Until now. In a little-known effort, General Electric has successfully tested laser enrichment for two years and is seeking federal permission to build a $1 billion plant that would make reactor fuel by the ton. That might be good news for the nuclear industry. But critics fear that if the work succeeds and the secret gets out, rogue states and terrorists could make bomb fuel in much smaller plants that are difficult to detect. Iran has already succeeded with laser enrichment in the lab, and nuclear experts worry that G.E.’s accomplishment might inspire Tehran to build a plant easily hidden from the world’s eyes. Backers of the laser plan call those fears unwarranted and praise the technology as a windfall for a world increasingly leery of fossil fuels that produce greenhouse gases. But critics want a detailed risk assessment. Recently, they petitioned Washington for a formal evaluation of whether the laser initiative could backfire and speed the global spread of nuclear arms. “We’re on the verge of a new route to the bomb,” said Frank N. von Hippel, a nuclear physicist who advised President Bill Clinton and now teaches at Princeton. “We should have learned enough by now to do an assessment before we let this kind of thing out.” New varieties of enrichment are considered potentially dangerous because they can simplify the hardest part of building a bomb — obtaining the fuel. General Electric, an atomic pioneer and one of the world’s largest companies, says its initial success began in July 2009 at a facility just north of Wilmington, N.C., that is jointly owned with Hitachi. It is impossible to independently verify that claim because the federal government has classified the laser technology as top secret. But G.E. officials say that the achievement is genuine and that they are accelerating plans for a larger complex at the Wilmington site. “We are currently optimizing the design,” Christopher J. Monetta, president of Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of G.E. and Hitachi, said in an interview. The company foresees “substantial demand for nuclear fuel,” he added, while conceding that global jitters from the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan “do create some uncertainty.” G.E. made those reactors. Donald M. Kerr, a former director of the Los Alamos weapons lab who was recently briefed on G.E.’s advance, said in an interview that it looked like a breakthrough after decades of exaggerated claims. Laser enrichment, he said, has gone from “an oversold, overpromised set of technologies” to what “appears to be close to a real industrial process.” For now, the big uncertainty centers on whether federal regulators will grant the planned complex a commercial license. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is weighing that issue and has promised G.E. to make a decision by next year. The Obama administration has taken no public stance on plans for the Wilmington plant. But President Obama has a record of supporting nuclear power as well as aggressive efforts to curtail the bomb’s spread. The question is whether those goals now conflict. The aim of enrichment is to extract the rare form of uranium from the ore that miners routinely dig out of the ground. The process is a little like picking through multicolored candies to find the blue ones. 1 2 3 Next Page »Scientists have long sought easier ways to make the costly material known as enriched uranium — the fuel of nuclear reactors and bombs, now produced only in giant industrial plants.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/14/business/shared-value-gains-in-corporate-responsibility-efforts.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">‘Shared Value’ Gains in Corporate Responsibility Efforts<date>Published: August 13, 2011</date><text>CORPORATE social responsibility efforts have always struck me as the modern equivalent of John D. Rockefeller handing out dimes to the common folk. They may be well-intentioned, but they often seem like small gestures at the margins of what companies are really trying to do: make money.As well they should, an argument most famously made by the Nobel laureate Milton Friedman decades ago. He called social responsibility programs “hypocritical window-dressing” in an article he wrote for The New York Times Magazine in 1970, titled “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.” But Michael E. Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, may have an answer to the Friedman principle. Mr. Porter is best-known for his original ideas about corporate strategy and the economic competition among nations and regions. Recently, however, he has been promoting a concept he calls “shared value.” Earlier this year, Mr. Porter and Mark R. Kramer, a consultant and a senior fellow in the corporate social responsibility program at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, laid out their case in a lengthy article in the Harvard Business Review, “Creating Shared Value: How to Reinvent Capitalism — and Unleash a Wave of Innovation and Growth.” Since then, Mr. Porter and Mr. Kramer have been championing the shared-value thesis in conferences, meetings with corporate leaders, and even a conversation with White House advisers. Shared value is an elaboration of the notion of corporate self-interest — greed, if you will. The idea that companies can do well by doing good is certainly not new. It is an appealing proposition that over the years has been called “triple bottom line” (people, planet, profit), “impact investing” and “sustainability” — all describing corporate initiatives that address social concerns including environmental pollution, natural-resource depletion, public health and the needs of the poor. The shared-value concept builds on those ideas, but it emphasizes profit-making not just as a possibility but as a priority. Shared value, Mr. Porter says, points toward “a more sophisticated form of capitalism,” in which “the ability to address societal issues is integral to profit maximization instead of treated as outside the profit model.” Social problems are looming market opportunities, according to Mr. Porter and Mr. Kramer. They note that while government programs and philanthropy have a place — beyond dimes, Mr. Rockefeller created a path-breaking foundation — so, increasingly, does capitalism. The shared-value concept is not a moral stance, they add, and companies will still behave in their self-interest in ways that draw criticism, like aggressive tax avoidance and lobbying for less regulation. “This is not about companies being good or bad,” Mr. Kramer says. “It’s about galvanizing companies to exploit the market in addressing social problems.” The pair point to promising signs that more and more companies are pursuing market strategies that fit the shared-value model. Several years ago, executives at General Electric began looking across its portfolio of industrial and consumer businesses, eyeing ways to apply new technology to reduce energy consumption. They were prompted by corporate customers voicing concerns about rising electrical and fuel costs, and by governments pushing for curbs on carbon emissions. The result was G.E.’s “ecomagination” program, a business plan as well as a marketing campaign. In recent years, the company has invested heavily in technology to lower its products’ energy consumption, and the use of water and other resources in manufacturing. To count in the program, a product must deliver a significant energy savings or environmental benefit over previous designs. G.E. hired an outside environmental consulting firm, GreenOrder, to help in measuring performance. To date, more than 100 G.E. products have qualified, from jet engines to water filtration equipment to light bulbs. In 2010, such products generated sales of $18 billion, up from $10 billion in 2005, when the program began. “We did it from a business standpoint from Day 1,” says Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive. “It was never about corporate social responsibility.” 1 2 Next Page »CORPORATE social responsibility efforts have always struck me as the modern equivalent of John D.

    <article index="2" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/is-the-house-g-o-p-warming-to-tax-increases/?ref=generalelectriccompany">Is the House G.O.P. Warming to Tax Increases?<date>August 10, 2011, 1:33 pm</date><text>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -– While last month’s Congressional tangle over the debt ceiling suggested permanent partisan gridlock, signs are emerging that some House Republicans are opening the door to potential revenue increases, as Congressional leaders continued to name their members of a bipartisan committee charged with finding ways to tame the deficit. In a town-hall-style meeting in Virginia on Tuesday night with four Republican House members – Scott Rigell, who represents the Virginia district where the meeting was held; Larry Bucshon of Indiana; Phil Gingrey of Georgia; and Phil Roe of Tennessee — audience members asked what, if any, revenues the representatives would accept as part of a final deal to cut deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over the next decade and pave the way for a second increase in the debt ceiling up to $1.5 trillion. Of the four, three gave specific examples that they could possibly acquiesce to. Mr. Rigell – who had invited the other three House members to the meeting because it focused on health care and they are medical doctors – said he thought that at least a few forms of tax subsidies provided to oil companies should be on the table. Government should not subsidize one industry over another, Mr. Rigell said. Mr. Gingrey said he found the question “difficult” and suggested that he had been struggling with the answer himself. Raising the rates on those earning $250,000 a year – a category of beneficiaries under the Bush tax cuts that some Democrats have suggested be taxed more – was a no-go for him, but for those earning over $700,000, he said, “I’m not really sure.” In response to request for elaboration, Mr. Gingrey said Wednesday in an e-mail: “I have a proven decade-long record of voting against tax increases, and believe that tax hikes on anyone in the middle of an economic recession is the last thing our country needs. Instead, as included in the Fiscal Year 2012 budget passed by the House, we should pursue comprehensive tax reform that will close loopholes and revise the tax code to be simpler and less burdensome to promote economic growth, incentivize investment and encourage job creators.” Mr. Roe said that he would support closing certain legal loopholes that corporations take advantage of. “G.E. ought to pay some taxes,” he said, referring to General Electric, which has taken advantage of various loopholes in the tax system. The members made their remarks as leaders in both chambers put together their 12-member committee charged with coming up with recommendations to tame the deficit. On Tuesday, Speaker John A. Boehner appointed three Republican House members to the committee: Dave Camp of Michigan, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; Fred Upton of Michigan; and Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who is the Republican conference chairman. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, chose three senators: Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania; Rob Portman of Ohio; and Jon Kyl, the minority whip, who is retiring at the end of his term. On Tuesday, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, named three Democratic senators: Patty Murray of Washington, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Max Baucus of Montana.  Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, the minority leader, has yet to name her three selections. All six of the Republicans named have signed a pledge, written by Grover Norquist, not to raise taxes. But there are various ways of raising revenues, like closing the corporate loopholes or making adjustments to existing tax rates. All six are also supporters of a Balanced Budget Amendment, which will be voted on in Congress this fall. Among the Democratic picks, the most surprising may be Mr. Kerry, who tends to focus on foreign policy rather than fiscal issues; however, absent the passage of the budget amendment or the adoption of the committee’s recommendations by Congress, large cuts to both discretionary spending and defense would automatically be triggered. Mr. Kerry, who is a military veteran, may be perceived as sensitive to those defense cuts. Further, Mr. Toomey, along with numerous other Senate Republicans, has voted in the past to end ethanol subsidies, as he emphasized on a call with reporters Wednesday.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/25/biting-the-bullet-vermont-yankee-orders-fuel/?ref=generalelectriccompany">Biting the Bullet, Vermont Yankee Orders Fuel<date>July 25, 2011, 4:43 pm</date><text>Associated PressThe Vermont Yankee nuclear plant on the banks of the Connecticut River. Unless a court intervenes, the clock is winding down on the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor. Its initial license expires next March, and the state of Vermont is blocking a permit that it needs to run beyond then. But its owner, Entergy, which is suing the state in federal court over the permit, announced on Monday that it would order a new load of fuel for the plant, essentially betting that the legal proceedings will come out in its favor. Fuel for reactors is ordered in batches, and at Vermont Yankee, in Vernon, on the Connecticut River just north of the Massachusetts border, the fuel is supposed to last four and half years. The next refueling is scheduled for October, when one-third of the fuel bundles are supposed to be replaced at a cost of about $50 million. The shutdown for refueling, which is supposed to last about 30 days, will cost about $92 million, according to Chanel Lagarde, a spokesman for the company. The plant will bring in 800 to 1,000 temporary workers for the job, which includes various maintenance tasks, the company says. The plant was last shut for refueling in April 2010. Entergy stressed at the time that it had run for 532 days continuously without having to shut down to address a problem; one of the arguments by plant opponents is that it should be retired because it is unreliable. The plant’s reputation has not recovered since two executives, asked by state regulators if tritium could leak from buried pipes as it had at other other plants, said it had no such pipes. In fact, an underground pipe was leaking tritium. Vermont Yankee has also had assorted mechanical problems over the years. Entergy had sought a temporary injunction to allow the reactor to keep running while the court case proceeds, which would have given it clearer guidance about whether to order the fuel, but a judge turned down that request and set a trial for September. Refueling a reactor is not like ordering coal or natural gas. “Normally you order fuel six months to a year in advance,’’ said Margaret Harding, who used to design reactor cores at General Electric, which created the design for the reactor at Vermont Yankee and supplies fuel to reactors of that type around the country. For a refueling in October, she said, normally the fuel would be delivered at the end of August, allowing time for inspection. Reactor fuel differs from plant to plant. “It’s a very engineered product,’’ Ms. Harding said. “It’s designed specifically for their application.’’ Entergy owns several other reactors of the same type as Vermont Yankee, including Pilgrim, in Massachusetts, but Pilgrim uses shorter fuel assemblies. Other plants are designed for assemblies of a slightly different shape. “It’s not just, oops, we’re going to stick it someplace else,’’ she said of any unused fuel. In a statement, Entergy said that its board of directors “believes both the merits of the company’s legal position and the record strongly support its decision to continue to trial.” At the Conservation Law Foundation in Montpelier, Vt., Sandra Levine, a lawyer, said of Vermont Yankee, “This continues to be a dubious investment for Entergy.” Her group represents the New England Coalition on Nuclear Pollution, which is seeking to have the plant closed. In addition to requiring a certificate from the state stating that the plant is needed for the public good, it needs a water quality certificate, she said. Still, the plant would take in $90 million in revenue between October and March, so the cost of the refueling would be offset even if the plant had to close next spring, she said. The trial presents a challenge. Most suits filed against states are over administrative actions, but this was for a legislative one. The Vermont legislature reserved for itself the authority to decide on whether to issue the certificate. The decision to buy the fuel is Entergy’s biggest bet so far on its court case. The next would be if it had to close in March in the absence of a final court decision. The plant has 650 permanent employees and spends about $100 million a year on payroll, contractors, taxes and purchases, the company says. Those costs accrue whether it is running or not.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/sports/autoracing/23iht-SRPRIX23.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">A Connection Made for the Fast Lane<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>Most Formula One watchers are aware of the paradigm in which a major car manufacturer uses the sport not only to advertise its road cars with an eye to sales, but also to develop and improve their road car technology.In the same fashion, as Formula One has become increasingly dependent on computers, telecommunications and information technology, telecommunications companies have begun following that example. “Telecommunications and Formula One are made for each other,” said Mike Cansfield, a telecommunications consultant and analyst. “First off, telecoms are a global business, and Formula One is a global business. It is also a very high-performance business. Telecommunications networks are about operating in macro seconds just as a Formula One car’s performance and the superiority of the competition is measured in macro seconds. They are both high-technology sectors and both at the cutting edge of what is possible.” As the series enters the second half of the season, at the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring this weekend, it is taking this development to another level, thanks not only to the competitive environment but also to the current economic and financial situation. Companies like AT&amp;T, Vodafone and Telmex are helping teams with their technology needs or acting as sponsors, and General Electric joined with Team Lotus last month as both a sponsor and technology provider. This trend has been driven by the sport’s latest cost-cutting measures, which have led to the equivalent of a mobile office at the tracks, and the introduction of cloud computing. Formula One teams used to send as many employees as they wanted to every race around the world. But regulations now limit the number of technical and other crew that they can bring to the races. AT&amp;T is therefore providing ultra-high-resolution videoconferencing systems, robust Internet-like communications networks and other telecommunications infrastructure so that the teams can leave technicians back at the home base — eight of the teams are in England, two in Italy, one in Germany and one in Switzerland — but still do the job that used to be done at the track. “We are using AT&amp;T products and services throughout our business, to help us save costs, to help us be more efficient, to help us communicate more,” said Alex Burns, chief executive of the AT&amp;T Williams team. “And because we are doing this, we are a great example of their products and services in action.” As with the car manufacturers, some technology companies are both a team sponsor — like General Electric with Team Lotus, AT&amp;T is a title sponsor of the Williams team — and a technical partner from whom the team buys services. For the teams, the close relationship pays off in personalized development of the technology, as they work closely with the company’s technicians. For the telecommunications company, providing a mobile office in the Formula One environment is a considerable challenge, although it is one that helps them prove and develop their systems. “One of the clearest ways is through what we call ‘time to market’ — how long it takes us to provision these network services,” said Andrew Edison, head of AT&amp;T’s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “A large multinational may be able to tolerate a lead time of 60 or 90 days,” he added. “A Formula One team can’t do that. They were in Valencia, and then two weeks later in Silverstone. So we have had to develop bespoke service delivery processes and capability, which has tested our organization and tested our processes to be able to respond to the demands of a Formula One team. Secondly, we would have never thought about putting one of these high-definition AT&amp;T telepresence video devices mobile before. And we have now done that, so we have learned how to do that and to utilize productivity in a different way in order to enable that to be done.” 1 2 Next Page »Most Formula One watchers are aware of the paradigm in which a major car manufacturer uses the sport not only to advertise its road cars with an eye to sales, but also to develop and improve their road car technology.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/business/ge-profit-exceeds-forecast.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E. Profit Exceeds Forecast<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>The re-engineering of General Electric — a strategic overhaul begun in the depths of the financial crisis — remains on track and shows steady progress. That, analysts say, is the underlying theme of the company’s second-quarter results on Friday, with profits and sales slightly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. G.E. has been slimming down its huge finance arm, GE Capital, while increasingly relying on its bedrock industrial businesses for long-term growth. The finance business is mending, with operating profits more than doubling in the second quarter from the depressed level of a year ago. Indeed, GE Capital accounted for much of the profit improvement in the quarter. But industrial orders for equipment and services grew 24 percent during the quarter, and G.E.’s backlog of industrial orders reached a record $189 billion. “GE Capital continues to get healthier, and industrial demand is picking up,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “That is the progression the company needs for the strategy to work.” The solid second-quarter results from G.E., the nation’s largest industrial company, whose products range from jet engines to medical imaging machines, provide evidence of a gradually improving outlook for many industrial companies. Both Honeywell and Caterpillar reported sharply higher sales and profits on Friday and raised their earnings forecasts for the year. United Technologies and Goodrich also delivered strong results in recent days as well. The strongest industrial growth for G.E., as for other large manufacturers, came in international markets, where revenue rose 23 percent in the quarter. Sales outside the United States account for 59 percent of G.E.’s industrial business. “At least for companies that make advanced equipment that is often exported, there is a bit of manufacturing renaissance under way in the United States,” said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s. Still, investors did not reward the industrial companies on a skittish day in the markets. Honeywell and G.E. shares slipped, with G.E. off 12 cents, to close at $19.04. Caterpillar reported a 44 percent jump in earnings, but that was a few cents below Wall Street estimates, and its shares fell $6.45, to $105.15. G.E.’s net income for the second quarter rose 21 percent, to $3.76 billion, up from $3.11 billion in the period a year earlier. The company reported operating earnings per share — the measure of performance most closely watched by Wall Street analysts — of 34 cents a share, up 17 percent from 29 cents a share in the period a year earlier. The average estimate of analysts, as compiled by Thomson Reuters, was 32 cents a share. G.E. reported revenue of $35.63 billion, down 4 percent from the $36.93 billion it reported in the quarter a year earlier. The falloff was a byproduct of the company’s steps to narrow its focus, as it sold a majority stake in NBC Universal, the television network and movie studio, to Comcast. Excluding that from the year-to-year comparison, G.E.’s revenue would have increased 7 percent in this year’s second quarter. The company’s revenue for the quarter was nearly $1 billion ahead of analysts’ consensus estimate of $34.7 billion. GE Capital, which has aggressively shed bad debt since the financial crisis hit in the fall of 2008, reported a 1 percent decline in revenue, to $11.63 billion in the second quarter, while operating profits jumped to nearly $1.66 billion, up from $743 million in the period a year earlier. Some problems remain, mainly in commercial real estate, where it lost $335 million. Still, that was an improvement from a loss of $524 million in the second quarter of last year. “The turnaround is in place, and it is a smaller, more focused GE Capital today,” Keith Sherin, G.E.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. Despite the costly repair of its finance arm, G.E. has continued to invest aggressively to expand some of its industrial divisions. In the last nine months, for example, the company has spent more than $7 billion on three acquisitions to bolster its oil and gas equipment business — Dresser, the John Wood Group and Wellstream Holdings. The companies make specialized equipment for oilfield and offshore production, widening G.E.’s range of offerings in that $10 billion-a-year unit. In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, suggested that there would be no more sizable acquisitions for a while. In integrating the new businesses, he said, “We have a lot on our plate already.” Instead, he said, the company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., will look to spend its extra cash on increasing the dividend and buying back shares. G.E. has raised its dividend three times in the last year, to an annual level of 60 cents a share. But that is still less than half the $1.24 a share it had paid in early 2009, when the company had to sharply reduce its annual payout to shareholders to conserve cash. The move in 2009 was G.E.’s first dividend cut since the Depression. Most of G.E.’s industrial businesses — aviation, transportation, health care, and oil and gas — showed solid improvement compared with last year. But profits were down 19 percent in its big energy business for power generation equipment — gas, steam and wind turbines. G.E. executives described that business as a cyclical laggard, with orders already accumulating, and sales and profits poised to improve later this year. Over all, Mr. Immelt said, “We like our portfolio of businesses. We like the G.E. outlook.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 22, 2011 An earlier version of this article had an incorrect value for three General Electric acquisitions in its oil-and-gas equipment business. It was $7 billion, not $7 million.The re-engineering of General Electric — a strategic overhaul begun in the depths of the financial crisis — remains on track and shows steady progress. That, analysts say, is the underlying theme of the company’s second-quarter results on Friday, with profits and sales slightly surpassing Wall Street’s expectations. G.E. has been slimming down its huge finance arm, GE Capital, while increasingly relying on its bedrock industrial businesses for long-term growth. The finance business is mending, with operating profits more than doubling in the second quarter from the depressed level of a year ago. Indeed, GE Capital accounted for much of the profit improvement in the quarter. But industrial orders for equipment and services grew 24 percent during the quarter, and G.E.’s backlog of industrial orders reached a record $189 billion. “GE Capital continues to get healthier, and industrial demand is picking up,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “That is the progression the company needs for the strategy to work.” The solid second-quarter results from G.E., the nation’s largest industrial company, whose products range from jet engines to medical imaging machines, provide evidence of a gradually improving outlook for many industrial companies. Both Honeywell and Caterpillar reported sharply higher sales and profits on Friday and raised their earnings forecasts for the year. United Technologies and Goodrich also delivered strong results in recent days as well. The strongest industrial growth for G.E., as for other large manufacturers, came in international markets, where revenue rose 23 percent in the quarter. Sales outside the United States account for 59 percent of G.E.’s industrial business. “At least for companies that make advanced equipment that is often exported, there is a bit of manufacturing renaissance under way in the United States,” said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s. Still, investors did not reward the industrial companies on a skittish day in the markets. Honeywell and G.E. shares slipped, with G.E. off 12 cents, to close at $19.04. Caterpillar reported a 44 percent jump in earnings, but that was a few cents below Wall Street estimates, and its shares fell $6.45, to $105.15. G.E.’s net income for the second quarter rose 21 percent, to $3.76 billion, up from $3.11 billion in the period a year earlier. The company reported operating earnings per share — the measure of performance most closely watched by Wall Street analysts — of 34 cents a share, up 17 percent from 29 cents a share in the period a year earlier. The average estimate of analysts, as compiled by Thomson Reuters, was 32 cents a share. G.E. reported revenue of $35.63 billion, down 4 percent from the $36.93 billion it reported in the quarter a year earlier. The falloff was a byproduct of the company’s steps to narrow its focus, as it sold a majority stake in NBC Universal, the television network and movie studio, to Comcast. Excluding that from the year-to-year comparison, G.E.’s revenue would have increased 7 percent in this year’s second quarter. The company’s revenue for the quarter was nearly $1 billion ahead of analysts’ consensus estimate of $34.7 billion. GE Capital, which has aggressively shed bad debt since the financial crisis hit in the fall of 2008, reported a 1 percent decline in revenue, to $11.63 billion in the second quarter, while operating profits jumped to nearly $1.66 billion, up from $743 million in the period a year earlier. Some problems remain, mainly in commercial real estate, where it lost $335 million. Still, that was an improvement from a loss of $524 million in the second quarter of last year. “The turnaround is in place, and it is a smaller, more focused GE Capital today,” Keith Sherin, G.E.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. Despite the costly repair of its finance arm, G.E. has continued to invest aggressively to expand some of its industrial divisions. In the last nine months, for example, the company has spent more than $7 billion on three acquisitions to bolster its oil and gas equipment business — Dresser, the John Wood Group and Wellstream Holdings. The companies make specialized equipment for oilfield and offshore production, widening G.E.’s range of offerings in that $10 billion-a-year unit. In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, suggested that there would be no more sizable acquisitions for a while. In integrating the new businesses, he said, “We have a lot on our plate already.” Instead, he said, the company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., will look to spend its extra cash on increasing the dividend and buying back shares. G.E. has raised its dividend three times in the last year, to an annual level of 60 cents a share. But that is still less than half the $1.24 a share it had paid in early 2009, when the company had to sharply reduce its annual payout to shareholders to conserve cash.

In his State of the Union address in January, President Obama stressed the importance of nurturing America’s green economy to “strengthen our security, protect our planet and create countless new jobs for our people.” For something said to be so crucial to growth and economic renewal, however, surprisingly little is actually known about the nature, size and growth of the green economy. The Brookings Institution, in collaboration with the Technology Partnership Program of the research and development company Battelle, has compiled what it describes as one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date analyses of the nation’s enigmatic green economy. The report, “Sizing the Clean Economy,” collected data from every county and major metropolitan areas in the United States from 2003 to 2010. Defining a “green” or “clean” economy as the sector that produces goods and services with an environmental benefit, the study amassed numbers on mascots of green like wind, solar and hydropower and less glamorous sectors like public mass transit and waste management and treatment. One point the report makes is that while green initiatives are driving growth and innovation, market and policy challenges are preventing them from reaching their full potential. Those obstacles include policy gaps that undercut market demand, shortfalls in financing that lead to uncertainty and instability for investors, and an inadequate system for supporting innovation. According to the report, the green economy employed 2.7 million people in 2010, or about 2 percent of the American workforce. To put this number into some perspective, the health care sector, the largest private job provider in the nation, employs 13.8 million people, or 10.2 percent. Despite its relatively modest size, the green economy is still larger than the fossil fuels sector (2.4 million jobs) or the biosciences sector (1.4 million jobs). Over the last seven years, the green economy has grown at a rate of 3.4 percent, trailing the 4.2 percent growth achieved over all, but still noteworthy given the disproportionate impact of the housing crisis on the green sector. (Many housing and construction-related companies can be classified under the green rubric.) The report also found that the green economy weathered the recession better than the nation’s economy did as a whole. Where the green economy excels is at providing the kind of well-paid, low-skill jobs that are often lamented to be leaving the United States, the study suggests. These “green collar” jobs are manufacturing-heavy and export-driven and represent a substantial source of growth. One of the most surprising findings, said Jonathan Rothwell, a senior research analyst at Brookings, was where some of the largest and fastest-growing regional green economies are found. “Albany-Shenectady, New York emerged as the metropolitan region with the highest percentage of green jobs and the fifth-fastest growing green economy in the nation,” he said. General Electric, for example, is based in Albany and has opened innovative battery factories and started other green initiatives there. One of the greatest challenge facing the growth and development of the green economy, however, is that companies with promising patented ideas that have proven themselves in small-scale test production simply cannot secure the financing they need to scale up production. “The same risky and breakthrough nature of these products that make them so exciting and attractive for scientists and venture capitalists, is what repels large investment banks which feel like they can’t invest in a product unless it has a proven track record,” Mr. Rothwell said. To combat this financing obstacle, Mr. Rothwell advocates scaling up the Department of Energy’s loan guarantee program, and, more ambitiously, creating a tech fund that would parallel what crop insurance was for the agricultural industry. Such a program would further the development of new green initiatives but take the risk out of investing in them for the first few years by offering different types of insurance until they demonstrated their long-term viability. “The important take-away message here is that the green economy is real and it’s growing, but it needs some encouragement to live up to all the expectations,” Mr. Rothwell said.</text></article>

Invests in 10 Home Energy Start-Ups<date>June 23, 2011, 8:29 am</date><text>Fred Prouser/Reuters Jeffrey R. Immelt, head of General Electric, discusses his company’s ecomagination project in Los Angeles in 2007. General Electric, the huge global conglomerate, has entrepreneurial aspirations. On Thursday, the company announced $63 million of investments in 10 home energy companies as part of its so-called ecomagination Challenge. The initiative, announced last July, is a $200 million commitment to invest and develop partnerships with promising clean technology start-ups. The company along with its venture capital partners — Emerald Technology Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, RockPort Capital, the Carbon Trust and Foundation Capital — have so far deployed $134 million. “It allows us to connect to these incredible, innovative companies,” said Mark L. Vachon, the vice president of G.E.’s ecomagination effort. “We can help get these ideas faster into the commercialization process.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink For General Electric, which spent $1.5 billion in 2009 on clean technology research and development, the program is a low-cost way to identify promising start-ups with potentially breakthrough technologies. So far, it has made 22 investments and one acquisition, FMC-Tech, a power grid technology company. The latest batch of investments includes GMZ Energy, a company that helps convert heat to energy, and Hara, an energy management software maker. Kleiner Perkins, an early backer of Google and Amazon, participated in both financing rounds. While it is still unclear what these investments will yield, G.E. announced on Thursday that it was planning to expand the program. It will open a similar ecomagination Challenge in China later this year that will represent about $100 million in financial commitments. In addition, it is partnering with the Carbon Trust to establish a $5 million seed fund in Europe for clean technology start-ups. According to Mr. Vachon, General Electric may eventually apply the ecomagination Challenge strategy (of investing in a broad swath of early stage companies with venture captial firms) to other parts of the company. “This platform has a lot of applications, it could work with other parts of G.E.’s portfolio,” Mr. Vachon said. “We’ll start with China, and that will certainly keep us busy for awhile.”</text></article>

It also had a lot of big name stars visiting, and I heard lots of talk of new sponsors coming into the series; two of whom have been confirmed. Phillip Morris has extended its partnership with Ferrari until 2015, which is interesting, especially when you consider that the tobacco company does not have to right to do any advertising on the car. The previous deal, signed in 2005, was set to expire this year. And,  now that Team Lotus has cleared up the dispute over its name in the courts with the Lotus Renault GP team, it announced on Tuesday a new sponsorship deal with General Electric. “We are already exploring a number of initiatives that will bring the GE / Team Lotus relationship to life across the spectrum of GE’s interests,” Tony Fernandes, the team owner, said in a statement. He said these would include technology for electric cars, materials sciences and  design processes. As for the stars, Montreal was a huge draw. Rihanna was there, along with Ice-T,  George Lucas and others. Local newspapers reported that Julia Roberts was in Montreal doing a film and that people in her entourage had also bought tickets to the race. Not that a star of her level would need to buy tickets. She could have joined Lucas walking down the starting grid if she wanted to, I’m sure. I don’t know if she was there, but I did see Lucas on the grid.</text></article>

General ElectricPhase 2 involves a stretch from Rogers Island to north of the Three Sisters Islands (islands in green). Two dredges began operations in the Upper Hudson south of Rogers Island in Fort Edward, N.Y., with one assigned to remove sediment and the other debris, a spokesman for G.E., Mark Behan, said. He said that operations would continue 24 hours a day, six days a week through October, weather permitting. As many as four dredges, four backfill platforms, 17 tugboats and more than 25 barges will be operating in the Upper Hudson during the cleanup, Mr. Behan said. The project is intended to remove PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, that were discharged by two G.E. factories into the river over a 30-year period ending in 1977. It will continue to unfold for five to seven more years over a 40-mile stretch of river north of Albany. General Electric carried out the first phase of the cleanup along a six-mile stretch of the Hudson from May to November of 2009. In the second phase, the company is following new requirements issued last December by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is overseeing the effort under its Superfund program for redressing toxic contamination. Under the more stringent rules, G.E. is allowed to cap only 11 percent of the total project area, which stretches from Hudson Falls to Troy, N.Y., on the riverbed. That does not include areas where capping is unavoidable because of physical barriers in the river, which could amount to an additional 10 percent of the project, the E.P.A. said. By contrast, the company capped nearly 37 percent of the pollution that it treated in the first phase, the agency said. In the current phase, E.P.A. officials are also requiring a maximum of three passes by dredging vessels with the aim of limiting recontamination of the river. They have also required more rigorous sampling to determine the extent of the contamination. G.E. officials have said the new standards reflect a consensus for ensuring a practical and cost-effective project. At least 95 percent of the PCBs in the dredging area are expected to be removed under the new standards. Updates on the dredging will be posted at www.hudsondredging.com.</text></article>

But some military contractors and their Congressional enablers on the House Armed Services Committee are pushing as hard as they can in the wrong direction.In February, Congress bowed to the Pentagon’s pleas and terminated work on an unneeded alternative engine for the overbudget F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, at an estimated savings of $2 billion to $3 billion. Then the engine’s prime contractors, General Electric and Rolls-Royce, offered to pay next year’s development costs, hoping the Pentagon would then reconsider and buy their engine. By a huge bipartisan majority, the committee fell for it. The committee’s chairman, Representative Howard McKeon, is an avowed foe of Pentagon cost-cutting. But Republicans who equate unaffordable spending with strong defense are only part of the problem. Robert Andrews, a Democrat, added language to next year’s military budget that would require the Pentagon to give the companies access to the information and equipment they need to keep testing the second engine. And making its goal clear, the committee voted to reopen the competition to the rejected engine in the likely event of rising costs for the Pratt &amp; Whitney version the Pentagon prefers. Competition can cut costs. But this competition has already been won by the Pratt &amp; Whitney engine. Spending additional billions on continued development of the second version makes no sense. House members of both parties who favor a strong defense and lower deficits must strip out the alternate engine provisions when the authorization bill comes to the floor this week. At the same time, we have to thank G.E. and Rolls-Royce for coming up with a great idea, which we hope Congress will embrace for future acquisitions: Contractors should pay a larger share of development costs. Too often companies win contracts with unrealistically low estimates, leading to huge cost overruns during development. And once the Pentagon has paid these development costs, it is reluctant to cancel systems it might never have bought had the real costs been known. That has been the unhappy story of the F-35, whose initial selling point was its relatively cheap cost of $62 million per plane (in today’s dollars). Those costs have nearly doubled over the past decade. The nearly 2,500 F-35s the Pentagon plans to buy over the next two decades are now projected to cost around $382 billion. Eliminating the alternate engine is part of the Pentagon’s strategy for containing the F-35’s soaring costs. G.E., Rolls-Royce and their Congressional allies should not be allowed to thwart that. The Pentagon needs to get this enormous program back under control.Pentagon spending must come down to reduce the deficit.

    <article index="2" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/nuclear-problems-in-the-rearview-mirror/?ref=generalelectriccompany">Nuclear Problems in the Rearview Mirror<date>May 11, 2011, 2:00 pm</date><text>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said this week that in hindsight, a problem at the Browns Ferry nuclear plant in Alabama last fall was quite serious. And its records indicate that there have been reports in recent days of engineers’ flubbing a basic calculation of reactor operation at two other plants. The math errors and the Browns Ferry problem are not related to each other but come at a moment of heightened concern about reactor safety after the meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi reactors in Japan. Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesFuel at the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in New Jersey would have gotten hotter than operators realized. On Tuesday, the commission staff announced that a valve that got stuck last October at the Browns Ferry nuclear plant near Athens, Ala., posed a safety threat that fell into the “red” category, the most serious on its four-color scale. It is only the fifth time since the scale was established in 2001 that the commission has put a problem into that category. “It took us a while to work through the inspection findings,’’ said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the agency’s Atlanta regional office, explaining the delay. That process involved conferring with the plant’s operator, the Tennessee Valley Authority. And last week, operators of the Oyster Creek nuclear plant near Toms River, N.J., and Nine Mile Point 1, near Syracuse, reported separately that General Electric, which supplies their reactors with fuel, had notified them that it had made some math errors that could have resulted in the reactor fuel’s getting hotter than plant operators thought. But General Electric notified the companies in time for them to make changes to their reactors. Neither the fuel miscalculation nor the valve problem caused any damage or injuries, but both exposed flaws in the system. The valve problem at Browns Ferry could result in a fine, Mr. Hannah said. The valve, at Browns Ferry Unit 1, is located in the reactor’s residual heat removal system, which enables the reactor to cool after it has shut down. The failure was discovered when operators intentionally shut the reactor down for refueling, one of the few times that the heat removal system is used. It would also be used if there were an accident that required the reactor to shut down. The failure of the residual heat removal system is a cause of the meltdowns at the Fukushima reactors, which are of a similar design to those at Browns Ferry, Oyster Creek and Nine Mile Point 1. The valve consists of a flat metal disk that sits inside the pipe and is moved by a rod. The rod had become disconnected from the disk, apparently some time weeks or months earlier. The residual heat removal system consists of two separate sets of pumps, valves and piping, and one set would not have worked, Mr. Hannah said. “The public was never endangered because no actual event occurred,” the commission said. “However, the system is counted on for core cooling during certain accident scenarios, and the valve failure left it inoperable, which could have led to core damage.” Such an accident would nonetheless involve “a series of unlikely events,” the commission said. The Tennessee Valley Authority told the commission staff that the valve had a manufacturing defect but that it would still have opened if needed; the commission staff disagreed. Other “code red” findings by the commission include the notorious case of the Davis-Besse reactor near Oak Harbor, Ohio, where an unnoticed leak allowed acid to flow onto the vessel head. Workers discovered in 2002 that it had corroded away all but a fraction of a thick stainless steel liner. A red finding triggers an extensive inspection; at Browns Ferry that will include equipment, management and procedures to see if anything else is wrong there, Mr. Hannah said. The fuel problem at the Oyster Creek and Nine Mile Point plants was odder. General Electric notified Oyster Creek on May 4 and Nine Mile Point on May 6 of four separate calculation errors it had made in determining the peak cladding temperature of a new fuel that the plants were using in their reactor cores, operators said. In some cases the errors caused G.E. to underestimate the peak temperature, and in others, overestimate it. The calculation is important because it helps determine the maximum power level at which a reactor can safely run. The mistakes also involved the calculation of how much of the cladding would be damaged in an accident. Scott Burnell, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington, said that when the calculations were corrected, each plant was still legal to operate but had less of a safety margin than the operators believed. The operators can solve the problem by changing the power distribution within the reactor core with no loss of output, he said. Mr. Burnell said this would result in the fuel being used up slightly sooner, meaning that the operators were not getting all the possible energy out of their uranium. He said it was not yet clear if the same errors had been made in fuel dispatched to other plants. Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Constellation Energy, which owns the Nine Mile Point reactors, said, “There is no safety concern with the vendor’s calculation changes.” Operators had made changes in the plant’s software to assure the fuel was not overheated and to preserve their safety margins, he explained. Nine Mile Point got the notification before it started up after a shutdown for refueling, but Oyster Creek did not; still the operators of the latter said that “this event is not significant with respect to the health and safety of the public.’’ Both plants are already the focus of petitions brought before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by a member of the public, Mark Leyse, arguing that the commission has not paid adequate attention to experimental data that shows how severe a reaction could occur if cooling water were lost. Mr. Leyse says that damage to the fuel cladding and production of hydrogen would occur faster than the commission assumes in its calculations, and that the peak temperature should be lowered. The commission has not ruled.</text></article>

On the state level, one popular step is a renewable energy standard for the electricity industry. A coal scraper at a plant in New Haven, W.Va. The plant captures carbon dioxide emissions as it generates electricity. Generally the renewables standard is expressed as a percentage of the electricity generated by all energy sources, often with subquotas for solar power or geothermal energy. A few years ago, there was talk of a national renewable energy standard, but in his State of the Union address in January, President Obama called for something slightly different — a “clean energy standard,” with 80 percent of the nation’s electricity coming from clean sources by 2035. “Clean” is a broader category than “renewable,” but just what is it? Mr. Obama wants nuclear energy, natural gas and “clean coal” — or plants that burn coal more cleanly or use their technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions — counted in the total. In March, Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, and Senator Lisa Murkowski, the ranking Republican, put out a white paper on the question and asked for public comment on what should be counted. The paper said that renewable energy standards had been talked about before but that “the concept has not yet been seriously considered or analyzed.’’ The public comments were requested over a three-week period beginning in February, and they came in so fast that the committee’s e-mail server crashed. About 250 were substantive, according to a committee spokesman. Senator Bingaman has said he hopes that Congress will act on the idea by this summer. One factor that makes a national standard for clean energy or renewable energy much trickier than a state standard is that the state standards set limits on how much electricity can be imported to meet the quota. A national standard, however, implies free trade in wind and solar power, in which case the Plains States and Southwest desert states would make money exporting to states in the East and Southeast. One party with a foot in almost all camps is General Electric, which makes wind turbines and conventional turbines that run on natural gas or fuel oil as well as nuclear reactors. Walk through an old-fashioned coal plant, and chances are good you will see General Electric equipment there, too. At a meeting with reporters on Thursday, Darryl L. Wilson, head of a division of the company that makes small gas turbines, extolled the virtues of wind. A 100-megawatt machine, which is small by power-plant standards but large by the standards of wind farms, can go from 0 to 100 percent power in 10 minutes, he said. That is far faster than a coal or nuclear plant, and thus makes gas turbines a good dance partner for wind turbines. “It’s emerging as a solution for renewables backup,” he said. Another G.E. official, Rob Wallace, who handles federal relations, said he thought that Mr. Obama’s proposal was achievable precisely because “it incorporates the broadest number of technologies.” “The debate last year didn’t include gas, and four or five years ago, it didn’t include nuclear,’’ he said. “It has to be a standard that has a chance of passing.” But including “clean” coal, gas and nuclear power risks losing some support, too.  Many advocates of wind and solar power are adamant that coal can never be clean, even if burned cleanly, because of the environmental damage from mining. Lately the damage from drilling for natural gas in shale formations has also become a concern. And conventional ways of burning natural gas are too dirty for the goal set by Mr. Obama for 2050 of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent. Is Mr. Obama right to pull gas, coal and nuclear into the clean energy tent? Is the political calculus behind that — the idea that traditional renewable sources lack enough political support to get a national standard adopted — correct? Your comments are invited.</text></article>

But it turns out that the refrigerator does harm to the environment before it is even plugged in because the insulating foam in its innards is made with a gas that is more than 1,000 times worse, molecule for molecule, than carbon dioxide. General Electric GE’s first HFC-free model. Now, however, manufacturers are seizing on a single change can reduce both warming mechanisms at once. General Electric said Tuesday that it had become the first American manufacturer of a full line of refrigerators to take that step, which is to eliminate a gas called HFC 134a, a so-called blowing agent. The blowing agent is used to whip the foam into a frothy milkshake-like mix and move it into the doors and walls of their machines, where it hardens. Unlike the styrofoam in a disposable coffee cup, the material in appliances is filled with bubbles. Manufacturers once used chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs, for that job. When such gas is used, it flows into the atmosphere, either immediately or years later when the machine is junked and the tiny bubbles escape. But CFCs were banned because they accumulated in the upper atmosphere and the chlorine would break down molecules of ozone, which shield the Earth’s surface from harmful rays of the sun. CFCs were also used as the working fluid in the refrigerator, the material that the compressor squeezes down into a liquid that gives off heat. Then the liquid is allowed to expand back into a gas, absorbing heat that the refrigerator removes from its interior. The replacement for CFCs in both roles, blowing agent and refrigerant, was a class of chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs. These do not destroy ozone, but they do form a blanket at high altitudes, holding in heat. HFC 134a, the material GE had been using as the blowing agent, has a “global warming potential” of 1,430, according to GE. Carbon dioxide has a global warming potential of 1. And as a refrigerant, the HFCs were slightly less efficient than CFCs, requiring a little more electricity to do the same work. Now manufacturers are working to replace the HFCs. One choice is a hydrocarbon molecule called cyclopentane, which has a global warming potential of 3 to 10. But the cyclopentane turns out to have another benefit; it makes a better insulator. The new foam is about 4 percent better, said Paul Surowiec, general manger for refrigeration at GE’s appliances and lighting division. That is helpful because the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department are slowly tightening the rules on appliances, requiring them to do the same work with less and less energy. “Let’s face it, the standards are getting stricter,’’ Mr. Surowiec said. “We’re trying to find cost-effective ways to do all of the above,’’ from cutting energy consumption to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The company has converted its refrigerator factory in Decatur, Ala., for use of the new blowing agent. The effect will be to eliminate emissions that are equivalent to 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, about the same global warming impact as 78,000 cars, the company said. The company has also applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to use a refrigerant with less global warming potential. The next step is to recapture some of the harmful gases that were locked up years ago in those foam bubbles. About 90 percent of refrigerators are recycled, according to the company, but that does not usually include processing the foam. In February, GE announced a deal with a company called Appliance Recycling Centers of America that will collect old refrigerators from six states. GE will crush the styrofoam and capture the gas that was in the bubbles.</text></article>

Profit Tops Forecasts and Dividend Increases<date>Published: April 21, 2011</date><text>General Electric, the conglomerate that is closely watched because of its diverse products, reported first-quarter results on Thursday that showed gains in most businesses, including aviation and health care.The results easily topped the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, but its shares ended 2.2 percent lower on Thursday, reflecting concern about a decline in industrial margins, some analysts said. G.E. said net income was $3.4 billion in the first three months of 2011, or 31 cents a share, compared with $1.9 billion and 17 cents in the quarter a year ago. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 33 cents a share, exceeding the average estimate of 28 cents from analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Earnings from continuing operations were $3.5 billion compared with $2.4 billion in the period a year ago. The chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in a statement that G.E. had emerged from the recession a stronger company. “G.E. health care, transportation and aviation delivered strong results,” Mr. Immelt said. “Strategic investments in high-growth segments have strengthened the company’s energy portfolio and position that business to return to growth in the second half of this year.” Over all, revenue rose 6 percent, to $38.45 billion in the first quarter, exceeding analysts forecasts of $34.64 billion. Revenue in the same quarter a year ago was $36.2 billion. The results and outlook reflected the company’s efforts to diversify and make acquisitions, while trying to build its businesses in crucial sectors like energy. On Thursday, the company described itself as “cautiously optimistic” about the gas turbine business, with strong orders from the Middle East and plans to help Japan meet its energy demands after its nuclear plant was damaged in the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. “Our teams are working diligently to support our customers in Japan,” Mr. Immelt said in a conference call. Early this month G.E. announced plans to build the nation’s largest photovoltaic panel factory, with the goal of becoming a major player in the market. G.E. also completed the sale of 51 percent of NBC Universal to the Comcast cable network in the quarter, which resulted in an after-tax gain of 4 cents a share. In the deal, Comcast paid General Electric nearly $6.2 billion in cash and contributed its pay television channels like E Entertainment Television and the Golf Channel, worth $7.25 billion, to NBC Universal. General Electric said when announcing its last results in January that it had a backlog of orders that positioned it for growth in 2011, with the transportation, health care and finance units expected to lead in earnings. On Thursday, Mr. Immelt said the backlog, a gauge of future results, was $177 billion. Richard Tortoriello, an equity analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s, said the orders numbers suggested growth in the global economy, particularly in emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. “G.E. is a bellwether in the sense that they are one of the largest industrial companies out there, but they have a larger proportion of what you might call long cycle business than others,” Mr. Tortoriello said. “We are not taking off like a rocket ship,” he said, “especially with regard to the U.S. and Europe, but the growth is there.” The company, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., also raised its quarterly dividend by a penny, to 15 cents, beginning in the third quarter, the report said. It increased its dividend twice in 2010. In July, the dividend was raised to 12 cents a share from 10 cents, and in December it was increased further, to 14 cents. The company paid 31 cents a share until February 2009, when, for the first time since the Great Depression, the board cut the dividend to conserve cash. Timothy A. Hoyle, a vice president at Haverford Investments, said the potential for a dividend increase was apparent in 2010 as the company’s capital unit returned to normal and as it finished a deal involving the sale of NBC Universal. “We saw plenty of excess capital generation,” Mr. Hoyle said. “That is happening.” But he also noted that G.E. had said it had a decline to 14.3 percent in industrial operating margins because of weakness in the energy sector, partly as a result of lower wind turbine pricing. The company’s shares fell 45 cents, or 2.21 percent, to close at $19.95 on Thursday. While G.E. is a household name as a manufacturer of common household products like lights bulbs and electric fans, it also has a diverse portfolio of finance and business units. Its lending division, GE Capital, the nation’s largest nonbank financial institution, has provided more than half of G.E.’s profit in some recent years. But the unit was struggling amid the fallout from the collapse of the real estate market, and Mr. Immelt has tried to refocus G.E. more toward the industrial sector. The company said GE Capital reported net income of $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up from $583 million in the period a year ago. “With losses having peaked, we are originating new business at attractive margins and our funding costs continue to be favorable,” Mr. Immelt said of GE Capital.

Since the financial crisis, GE Capital has refocused on more basic lending to middle-market companies, while G.E. has worked to reduce its reliance on the unit. GE Capital’s tier 1capital ratio has risen to 9.8 percent from 7.8 percent, while its leverage ratio, a measure of its debts to assets, shrank to 4.5-to-1. “With losses having peaked, we are originating new business at attractive margins and our funding costs continue to be favorable,” Jeffrey R.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/business/energy-environment/07electric.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E. to Build Largest U.S. Solar Panel Factory<date>Published: April 7, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — In a move that could shake up the American solar industry, General Electric plans to announce on Thursday that it will build the nation’s largest photovoltaic panel factory, with the goal of becoming a major player in the market.“For the past five years, we’ve been investing extremely heavily in solar,” said Victor Abate, vice president for G.E.’s renewable energy business. “Going to scale is the next move.” The plant, whose location has not been determined, will employ 400 workers and create 600 related jobs, according to G.E. The factory would annually produce solar panels that would generate 400 megawatts of energy, the company said, and would begin manufacturing thin-film photovoltaic panels made of a material called cadmium telluride in 2013. While less efficient than conventional solar panels, thin-film photovoltaics can be produced at a lower cost and have proven attractive to developers and utilities building large-scale power plants. G.E. has signed agreements to supply solar panels to generate 100 megawatts of electric power to customers, including a deal for panels generating 60 megawatts with NextEra Energy Resources. G.E., a manufacturing giant, operates in a range of energy businesses, from nuclear power plants to natural gas turbines. It has been aggressively expanding its energy portfolio, particularly through acquisitions. Mr. Abate said G.E. had completed its purchase of PrimeStar Solar, the Arvada, Colo., company that made the thin-film photovoltaic panels. G.E. said the Energy Department’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory recently certified that a PrimeStar solar panels manufactured at its factory in Colorado had set a 12.8 percent efficiency record for cadmium telluride technology. Conventional solar panels typically are 16 to 20 percent efficient at converting sunlight into electricity. “We believe we’ll be a cost leader, a technology leader and we’re excited about our position in a 75-gigawatt solar market over next five years,” said Mr. Abate. The global conglomerate’s entry into the highly competitive photovoltaic market is likely to prove a significant challenge to First Solar, the thin-film market leader and the dominant manufacturer of cadmium telluride panels. Also at risk are start-ups like Abound Solar, a Colorado company that in December obtained a $400 million federal loan guarantee to build factories to manufacture cadmium telluride panels. G.E.’s initial panel manufacturing capacity will be a fraction of the more than 2,300 megawatts of capacity that First Solar, based in Tempe, Ariz., plans to have online by the end of 2011. But Mr. Abate said that G.E.’s solar effort would parallel the rise of its wind energy business. “It’s a $6 billion platform and it was a couple of hundred million dollars in ’02,” he said of the company’s wind division. “When you look at G.E., we’re very good at scale. In ’05, we were building 10 turbines a week. By ’08, we were doing 13 a day.” But as with its wind business, G.E. will face competition from low-cost, government-subsidized Chinese manufacturers. The United States government has offered a range of subsidies to help American solar panel makers, including loan guarantees for new factories. G.E. said it was not applying for a loan guarantee but was exploring applying for state and federal manufacturing tax credits.  Prices for conventional silicon-based solar modules have plummeted 50 percent in recent years and are expected to continue to fall, in large part because of the rapid expansion of Chinese manufacturing capacity. That has put particular pressure on thin-film companies to increase the efficiency of their panels and maintain a technological edge. Mr. Abate said G.E. would focus on improving the 12.8 percent efficiency of its panels as well as lowering costs. “We see our way to much higher efficiencies than that,” he said. “We probably can cut costs 50 percent over the next several years.”SAN FRANCISCO — In a move that could shake up the American solar industry, General Electric plans to announce on Thursday that it will build the nation’s largest photovoltaic panel factory, with the goal of becoming a major player in the market.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/05/opinion/05nocera.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Who Could Blame G.E.?<date>Published: April 4, 2011</date><text>With tax day fast approaching, many Americans are thinking hard, and perhaps a little creatively, about finding deductions to help lower their tax bills. Nobody, after all, likes paying more taxes than they have to. So why in the world should we expect the mighty General Electric to act any differently?Because it’s a giant, profitable multinational corporation? If anything, the fact that G.E. is a big company should give it even more incentive than we mere human taxpayers to minimize its tax bill. The executives who run America’s corporations have a fiduciary duty to maximize profit for their shareholders. That’s what they’re programmed to do. One way to maximize profits is to minimize taxes, something G.E. does better than just about any other company. If I were a G.E. shareholder, I would be thrilled to learn that its vaunted 1,000-person tax department is viewed within the company as a profit center. Yet the article The New York Times published a few weeks ago — saying that G.E. was likely to pay no federal income tax at all in 2010 — has landed like a bombshell, arousing the kind of populist outrage that hasn’t been seen since those derivatives traders at A.I.G. got their last big bonuses. In responding to the article, G.E. did not exactly help itself with its defensive tweets and conflicting statements. A week ago, a G.E. spokeswoman told a reporter that “G.E. did not pay U.S. federal income taxes last year because we don’t owe any.” On Monday, its tune changed. In an article jointly published by Fortune and ProPublica, a company spokesman said, “We expect to have a small U.S. income tax liability for 2010.” Whatever. The point remains that the company is going to pay little or nothing in federal income taxes for 2010. And the unambiguous reason for this is that G.E. took full advantage of the various tax loopholes in the U.S. tax code that are available to it. Wouldn’t you? The real villain here isn’t G.E. for gaming the corporate tax system. Rather, the villain is a political system that makes the corporate tax system so easy to game. There are two primary reasons why G.E.’s 2010 tax bill is so low. The first is pretty straightforward: its finance arm, G.E. Capital, lost billions of dollars during the financial crisis. Like any business entity, it is allowed to use those losses to help reduce its tax bill. This is known as a tax-loss carry-forward, and it isn’t remotely controversial. The second tax break, though, called the active financing exception, is a whole different kettle of fish. According to Robert Willens, a corporate tax expert, this tax break was first enacted in 1997. It allows companies to avoid paying U.S. taxes on overseas profits — if those profits were derived by “actively financing” some activity or deal. (The rationale is that this is supposed to help “equal the playing field” with foreign multinationals that get the same tax breaks from their home countries. Yadda, yadda, yadda.) The active financing exception was never supposed to be a permanent part of the tax code. Indeed, it still isn’t. But every year or two — after the usual campaign contributions and arm-twisting — it winds up back in the tax code “temporarily.” The Treasury now estimates that it costs the government $5 billion a year. Is G.E. one of the companies that lobbies for the active financing exception? You bet it is. As Willens nicely puts it, “They are taking advantage of a loophole they helped create.” But G.E. has also taken the next obvious step: It has managed, over time, to shift billions of dollars in profits from its U.S. income statement to its overseas income statements. Wouldn’t you know it? Most of their profits are also financing related. There is nothing illegal or even unethical about any of this. It’s Congress — the same Congress that is now screaming bloody murder about the deficit — that has paved the way for G.E.’s tax creativity. The corporate income tax rate for American corporations is around 35 percent. If you talk to American executives for more than five minutes on the subject, they’ll tell you it’s too high. Andrew Liveris, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Chemical, claims in his new book, “Make It In America,” that the U.S. has the “second-highest corporate tax rate in the world.” A lower tax rate, he argues, could help spur a manufacturing revival in America. And, maybe, just maybe, if American multinationals actually paid 35 percent of their profits in taxes, he might have a case. But it’s not just G.E. — none of them do. Mr. Willens told me that the typical multinational pays about half the stated tax rate. As for G.E., it says that its worldwide tax burden for 2010 was far lower than that: 7.4 percent. The bonuses should be pretty good this year in the G.E. tax department.With tax day fast approaching, many Americans are thinking hard, and perhaps a little creatively, about finding deductions to help lower their tax bills. Nobody, after all, likes paying more taxes than they have to. So why in the world should we expect the mighty General Electric to act any differently?</text></article>

When hot fuel interacted with steam there, a reactor suffered a hydrogen blast. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has allowed reactors to phase out some equipment that eliminates explosive hydrogen, the gas that blew up the outer containments of three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi in Japan. The commission says it judged that at the American plants, the containments were strong enough that the equipment was not needed or other methods would do. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, many reactors were required to install “hydrogen recombiners,” which attach potentially explosive hydrogen atoms to oxygen to make water instead. At Three Mile Island, engineers learned that hot fuel could interact with steam to give off hydrogen. That caused the plant’s reactor to suffer a hydrogen explosion, although it did not seriously damage its containment. By contrast, the secondary containments at Fukushima Daiichi blew apart when hydrogen detonated inside them. The change in commission policy was pointed out this week by a nuclear safety critic, Paul M. Blanch, who said that he had been involved in installing such equipment at Millstone 3, a nuclear reactor in Waterford, Conn. “Post-Three Mile Island, they were considered very important to safety,’’ Mr. Blanch said. He accused the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of having “gutted the rule’’ because the industry wanted to save money. But Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the commission, said that as the commission analyzed its rules to determine which ones actually improved safety and which did not, it had found the equipment was unnecessary. More than half the American reactors have applied to drop the hydrogen recombiners from their technical specifications, but many of those plants still keep them operable nonetheless, according to the commission. Commission officials said they have allowed reactors to rely on simpler, easier-to-maintain equipment instead of the recombiners. Indian Point 2 and 3, in Buchanan, N.Y., and Millstone 2 and 3 in Waterford, Conn., are among the reactors that were allowed to delete hydrogen recombiners from their formal “technical specifications,” the government list of equipment that must be inspected, tested and maintained within certain limits for the reactor to be allowed to operate. But James F. Steets, a spokesman for Indian Point, said that Units 2 and 3 there each had two recombiners and that one alone could eliminate all the hydrogen in a major accident. Millstone 2 and 3, near New London, are in the same category; the equipment should still be operable, but having it in working order is no longer a condition required by the license, said Kenneth A. Holt, a spokesman for Dominion, which owns the reactors now. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said that it changed the rules in 2003 as part of an “ongoing effort to risk-inform its regulations,’’ meaning adjust its rules to reflect actual risk to reactors. At issue were “design basis accidents” and “severe” accidents, which are worse. “They weren’t needed for design basis accidents and they didn’t help with severe accidents,’’ Mr. Brenner said. Depending on the type of reactor, the commission now requires a variety of other precautions. General Electric models of the type used at Fukushima, which are also common in the United States, must pump their primary containments full of nitrogen gas instead of air, for example. Because hydrogen requires that oxygen be in the air to detonate, this “inerting” of the primary containments is a way of preventing explosions. And some plants have to have “igniter systems” that would burn off hydrogen before it could build up. The recombiners and a great deal of other equipment and safety procedures will be re-examined as part of a 90-day review that the commission is conducting after the Fukushima accident, Mr. Brenner said. 1</text></article>

The components are used across a variety of industries at the core of G.E.’s industrial and energy operations, including its oil and gas initiatives, as well as solar and wind power. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release Under the agreement, which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2011, executives at Converteam would retain a 10 percent stake in the company, and management at both companies would buy any remaining shares over the next two to five years. In a statement, G.E. said the price for those shares would vary but would probably be no more than $480 million. The move is the latest in a string of energy infrastructure acquisitions for G.E., which also picked up the well-support unit of the John Wood Group for $2.8 billion last month, as well as Wellstream Holdings, the British oil services company, for $1.3 billion in December. It also bought Dresser, a manufacturer and servicer of natural gas engines, fueling systems and other components, for $3 billion last fall. Joseph R. Mastrangelo, a vice president with G.E.’s oil and gas division, said the acquisition would allow the company and its industrial and offshore oil and gas customers, for example, to readily replace inefficient fixed-speed drive technology with Converteam’s more flexible variable-speed systems, saving energy. Converteam also makes converters that smooth the intermittency bumps that make solar and wind power difficult to integrate with other sources of electricity. Roughly a quarter of the world’s electricity is used to turn rotating machines in all manner of industrial and power generating applications, according to General Electric. Making highly engineered components designed to make those processes as efficient as possible is an increasingly competitive — and lucrative — field, the company said. The sector was valued at roughly $30 billion last year, and companies like ABB, Siemens, Emerson Electric and Rockwell are trying to capture a piece of the market. Many analysts agreed that the acquisition was in keeping with G.E.’s overall quest to expand its energy infrastructure operations — though some noted that Converteam’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2010, about $240 million, were much smaller than the deal’s $3.2 billion price. “It seems a bit expensive,” said Daniel Holland, an analyst with Morningstar. “The company has been very forthright about wanting to build out its exposure into more end markets, so it’s not entirely unexpected. It’s just a little bit on the pricey side, that’s all.”</text></article>

An army of long-term unemployed workers is spread across the land, the human fallout from the Great Recession and long years of misguided economic policies. Optimism is in short supply. The few jobs now being created too often pay a pittance, not nearly enough to pry open the doors to a middle-class standard of living. Arthur Miller, echoing the poet Archibald MacLeish, liked to say that the essence of America was its promises. That was a long time ago. Limitless greed, unrestrained corporate power and a ferocious addiction to foreign oil have led us to an era of perpetual war and economic decline. Young people today are staring at a future in which they will be less well off than their elders, a reversal of fortune that should send a shudder through everyone. The U.S. has not just misplaced its priorities. When the most powerful country ever to inhabit the earth finds it so easy to plunge into the horror of warfare but almost impossible to find adequate work for its people or to properly educate its young, it has lost its way entirely. Nearly 14 million Americans are jobless and the outlook for many of them is grim. Since there is just one job available for every five individuals looking for work, four of the five are out of luck. Instead of a land of opportunity, the U.S. is increasingly becoming a place of limited expectations. A college professor in Washington told me this week that graduates from his program were finding jobs, but they were not making very much money, certainly not enough to think about raising a family. There is plenty of economic activity in the U.S., and plenty of wealth. But like greedy children, the folks at the top are seizing virtually all the marbles. Income and wealth inequality in the U.S. have reached stages that would make the third world blush. As the Economic Policy Institute has reported, the richest 10 percent of Americans received an unconscionable 100 percent of the average income growth in the years 2000 to 2007, the most recent extended period of economic expansion. Americans behave as if this is somehow normal or acceptable. It shouldn’t be, and didn’t used to be. Through much of the post-World War II era, income distribution was far more equitable, with the top 10 percent of families accounting for just a third of average income growth, and the bottom 90 percent receiving two-thirds. That seems like ancient history now. The current maldistribution of wealth is also scandalous. In 2009, the richest 5 percent claimed 63.5 percent of the nation’s wealth. The overwhelming majority, the bottom 80 percent, collectively held just 12.8 percent. This inequality, in which an enormous segment of the population struggles while the fortunate few ride the gravy train, is a world-class recipe for social unrest. Downward mobility is an ever-shortening fuse leading to profound consequences. A stark example of the fundamental unfairness that is now so widespread was in The New York Times on Friday under the headline: “G.E.’s Strategies Let It Avoid Taxes Altogether.” Despite profits of $14.2 billion — $5.1 billion from its operations in the United States — General Electric did not have to pay any U.S. taxes last year. As The Times’s David Kocieniewski reported, “Its extraordinary success is based on an aggressive strategy that mixes fierce lobbying for tax breaks and innovative accounting that enables it to concentrate its profits offshore.” G.E. is the nation’s largest corporation. Its chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, is the leader of President Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. You can understand how ordinary workers might look at this cozy corporate-government arrangement and conclude that it is not fully committed to the best interests of working people. Overwhelming imbalances in wealth and income inevitably result in enormous imbalances of political power. So the corporations and the very wealthy continue to do well. The employment crisis never gets addressed. The wars never end. And nation-building never gets a foothold here at home. New ideas and new leadership have seldom been more urgently needed. • This is my last column for The New York Times after an exhilarating, nearly 18-year run. I’m off to write a book and expand my efforts on behalf of working people, the poor and others who are struggling in our society. My thanks to all the readers who have been so kind to me over the years. I can be reached going forward at bobherbert88@gmail.com.So here we are pouring shiploads of cash into yet another war, this time in Libya, while simultaneously demolishing school budgets, closing libraries, laying off teachers and police officers, and generally letting the bottom fall out of the quality of life here at home.</text></article>

But with tens of billions of dollars at stake, General Electric and Rolls-Royce have continued lobbying on Capitol Hill, and their supporters have been seeking to win over some of the Republican freshmen who helped tilt that vote against them. The companies’ push also represents a challenge to the defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, who has said he would recommend that President Obama veto any bill that included money for the engine. The F-35 is expected to be the military’s main fighter, with the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps buying up to 2,400 of the planes. Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies, is building another engine, and the engine business could eventually be worth up to $100 billion. Congress had envisioned periodic competitions between the manufacturers to lower prices. But with budgets tightening, Mr. Gates contends that the Pentagon can no longer spend $2 billion to $3 billion to finish the second engine. A resolution has also been delayed by the wrangling over budget cuts in Congress, which has still not passed a spending bill for 2011. So the Pentagon decided on Thursday to try to bring the matter to a head. It ordered G.E. and Rolls to quit working on their engine for up to 90 days, pending a final resolution in Congress. But G.E. and Rolls fired back that they would not be deterred by “this unilateral action.” Rick Kennedy, a spokesman for G.E.’s aviation unit, said monthly costs had recently averaged $28 million as the companies tested parts of the engine. He said plans for the next three months called mainly for less-expensive design work. The House voted 233 to 198 on Feb. 16 to cancel the alternate engine, as more than half of the 87 new Republican members joined with Democrats who opposed it. But Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and other Republicans still support the project. And Mr. McKeon criticized the Pentagon’s action Thursday, saying Mr. Gates should “not pre-empt the Congressional deliberation process.”The Pentagon ordered General Electric and Rolls-Royce on Thursday to stop building an alternate engine for the F-35 fighter plane, but the companies said they would spend millions of dollars of their own money to keep the project alive.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/business/economy/25tax.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E.’s Strategies Let It Avoid Taxes Altogether<date>Published: March 24, 2011</date><text>General Electric, the nation’s largest corporation, had a very good year in 2010.The company reported worldwide profits of $14.2 billion, and said $5.1 billion of the total came from its operations in the United States. Its American tax bill? None. In fact, G.E. claimed a tax benefit of $3.2 billion. That may be hard to fathom for the millions of American business owners and households now preparing their own returns, but low taxes are nothing new for G.E. The company has been cutting the percentage of its American profits paid to the Internal Revenue Service for years, resulting in a far lower rate than at most multinational companies. Its extraordinary success is based on an aggressive strategy that mixes fierce lobbying for tax breaks and innovative accounting that enables it to concentrate its profits offshore. G.E.’s giant tax department, led by a bow-tied former Treasury official named John Samuels, is often referred to as the world’s best tax law firm. Indeed, the company’s slogan “Imagination at Work” fits this department well. The team includes former officials not just from the Treasury, but also from the I.R.S. and virtually all the tax-writing committees in Congress. While General Electric is one of the most skilled at reducing its tax burden, many other companies have become better at this as well. Although the top corporate tax rate in the United States is 35 percent, one of the highest in the world, companies have been increasingly using a maze of shelters, tax credits and subsidies to pay far less. In a regulatory filing just a week before the Japanese disaster put a spotlight on the company’s nuclear reactor business, G.E. reported that its tax burden was 7.4 percent of its American profits, about a third of the average reported by other American multinationals. Even those figures are overstated, because they include taxes that will be paid only if the company brings its overseas profits back to the United States. With those profits still offshore, G.E. is effectively getting money back. Such strategies, as well as changes in tax laws that encouraged some businesses and professionals to file as individuals, have pushed down the corporate share of the nation’s tax receipts — from 30 percent of all federal revenue in the mid-1950s to 6.6 percent in 2009. Yet many companies say the current level is so high it hobbles them in competing with foreign rivals. Even as the government faces a mounting budget deficit, the talk in Washington is about lower rates. President Obama has said he is considering an overhaul of the corporate tax system, with an eye to lowering the top rate, ending some tax subsidies and loopholes and generating the same amount of revenue. He has designated G.E.’s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, as his liaison to the business community and as the chairman of the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, and it is expected to discuss corporate taxes. “He understands what it takes for America to compete in the global economy,” Mr. Obama said of Mr. Immelt, on his appointment in January, after touring a G.E. factory in upstate New York that makes turbines and generators for sale around the world. A review of company filings and Congressional records shows that one of the most striking advantages of General Electric is its ability to lobby for, win and take advantage of tax breaks. Over the last decade, G.E. has spent tens of millions of dollars to push for changes in tax law, from more generous depreciation schedules on jet engines to “green energy” credits for its wind turbines. But the most lucrative of these measures allows G.E. to operate a vast leasing and lending business abroad with profits that face little foreign taxes and no American taxes as long as the money remains overseas. Company officials say that these measures are necessary for G.E. to compete against global rivals and that they are acting as responsible citizens. “G.E. is committed to acting with integrity in relation to our tax obligations,” said Anne Eisele, a spokeswoman. “We are committed to complying with tax rules and paying all legally obliged taxes. At the same time, we have a responsibility to our shareholders to legally minimize our costs.” The assortment of tax breaks G.E. has won in Washington has provided a significant short-term gain for the company’s executives and shareholders. While the financial crisis led G.E. to post a loss in the United States in 2009, regulatory filings show that in the last five years, G.E. has accumulated $26 billion in American profits, and received a net tax benefit from the I.R.S. of $4.1 billion. But critics say the use of so many shelters amounts to corporate welfare, allowing G.E. not just to avoid taxes on profitable overseas lending but also to amass tax credits and write-offs that can be used to reduce taxes on billions of dollars of profit from domestic manufacturing. They say that the assertive tax avoidance of multinationals like G.E. not only shortchanges the Treasury, but also harms the economy by discouraging investment and hiring in the United States. 1 2 3 4 Next Page »General Electric, the nation’s largest corporation, had a very good year in 2010.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/18/opinion/18fri1.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Early Questions After Japan<date>Published: March 17, 2011</date><text>As Japan’s nuclear crisis unfolds, nations around the world are looking at the safety of their nuclear reactors — as they should. But most are also waiting until all the facts are in before deciding whether or how to change their nuclear plans. The Obama administration has vowed to learn from the Japanese experience and incorporate new safety approaches if needed.That makes sense to us — so long as there is rigorous follow-through. The operator of the stricken plant, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, and the Japanese government have been disturbingly opaque about what is happening at the Fukushima Daiichi complex and about efforts to prevent a meltdown and the potential public threat. That has deepened anxieties in Japan and around the world and led the United States government to take the extraordinary step of announcing that the damage to at least one of the crippled reactors may be far worse than Tokyo had admitted — and urging Americans there to move further away from the official safety perimeter. Still, enough is known to begin raising questions about our own nuclear operations. We hope regulators and industry leaders are equally forthcoming about this country’s vulnerabilities and challenges. One of the first questions is whether current evacuation plans are robust enough. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires plant operators to alert the public within a 10-mile radius if a dangerous plume of radioactivity will be heading their way, and local officials decide whether to order an evacuation. The American Embassy in Japan, based on advice from Washington regulators, has told Americans there to evacuate to a radius of about 50 miles from the Fukushima plant. Why wouldn’t a worst-case accident here merit the same caution? The difficulty, of course, is that some plants — including Indian Point north of New York City — are within 50 miles of millions of people. Regulators will need to clarify this discrepancy or start coming up with more ambitious evacuation plans. Regulators need to immediately review their safety analyses of two California plants, which, like the Fukushima plant, are located on the coast and near geological faults and might theoretically face the double calamity of an earthquake and tsunami. The type of reactors used at the Fukushima plant — made by the General Electric Company, they are known as Mark 1 boiling-water reactors — have long been known to have weak containment systems. In Japan, they appear to have been ruptured by explosions of escaping hydrogen. American regulators will need to determine whether similar reactors in this country are vulnerable and whether modifications in newer versions have made them sufficiently safe. The stricken Japanese complex housed six reactors in close proximity; explosions, fires and radiation spread damage among four of them and has made rescue efforts harder. Regulators will need to look at whether American nuclear plants with multiple reactors are vulnerable to the same cascading effects. In recent days, a new danger has emerged in the spent fuel pools adjacent to the reactors. At least one has apparently lost its cooling water and another is cracked and possibly losing water. If the fuel catches fire, it could spew radiation over a large area. Regulators here may need to expedite the removal of some spent fuel from pools to dry storage in casks. So far, the all-important lesson would seem to be: have sufficient emergency power at hand to keep cooling water circulating in the reactors to prevent a meltdown. The Japanese reactors seem to have survived one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded without major structural damage. The crisis developed because the plant lost electrical power from the grid and the tsunami knocked out its backup diesel generators. American regulators must ensure that all nuclear plants have enough mobile generators or other backup power in place if their first two lines of defense are disabled.As Japan’s nuclear crisis unfolds, nations around the world are looking at the safety of their nuclear reactors — as they should. But most are also waiting until all the facts are in before deciding whether or how to change their nuclear plans. The Obama administration has vowed to learn from the Japanese experience and incorporate new safety approaches if needed.</text></article>

Science Mature Atlantic tomcod. Between 1947 and 1976, roughly 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, were dumped in the Hudson by two General Electric facilities. The Atlantic tomcod, a small bottom-feeding fish, quickly accumulated high levels of the toxic compounds, which caused lethal heart defects in juveniles of the species. Then, natural selection took over. In a matter of decades, a rare genetic mutation that allowed a small number of tomcod to tolerate PCB contamination spread through the broader population, allowing the species to thrive, scientists concluded after a four-year study. “We think of evolution as something that happens over thousands of generations,” Isaac Wirgin, a population geneticist at New York University and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. “But here it happened remarkably quickly.” Documented instances of rapid evolution in response to environmental contamination are quite rare, Dr. Wiggin said. The tomcod had long been known for its remarkable tolerance to PCB pollution, but the biological mechanism responsible for its survival was unclear until now. Researchers found that a mutation to just one gene effectively blunted the chemical’s toxic effects, and that fish with the mutation survived and reproduced while those without it died off. The study appears in the journal Science this week.</text></article>

The deal is the latest by G.E. in the energy sector, as the conglomerate builds out its deepwater oil and natural gas production capabilities. In its press release, G.E. cited International Energy Agency forecasts that unconventional natural gas production would make up about 35 percent of global supply by 2035, while unconventional oil production would account for 10 percent. G.E. has already struck several deals, including the $1.3 billion takeover of Wellstream Holdings of Britain two months ago, In an interview, John Krenicki Jr., president and chief executive of G.E.’s energy business, said the purchase of the well-support division of John Wood would give G.E. a large market presence in fast-growing segments of the oil and natural gas industry. John Wood, for example, is a leader in making specialized pumps used for enhanced recovery in large oil wells. Two thirds of the world’s oil, Mr. Krenicki said, comes from about 300 giant wells, where a third of the oil has been extracted so far. Combining G.E.’s energy research with proven technology from John Wood, he said, should lead to improvements in oil recovery. “And with oil prices up, this is the first place to hunt,” he said. Last year, John Wood’s well-support business posted a 55 percent jump in earnings, to $166 million, atop $947 million in revenue. The unit has more than 3,800 employees and more than 20 manufacturing and service centers around the world. The deal is expected to close later this year, subject to approval by regulators and John Wood shareholders. G.E. was advised by Citigroup.</text></article>

Among executives of multinational companies, Mr. Immelt is hardly alone in having presided over a major reduction in domestic jobs amid a major increase in foreign jobs. Witness the following chart, which shows changes in domestic and foreign employment at American multinational companies from 1998 through 2008 (that is, the decade leading up to the financial crisis): Martin Sullivan The chart is taken from testimony by Martin Sullivan, an economist and contributing editor with Tax Analysts, in a discussion of how international tax rules favor foreign, rather than domestic, job creation, especially by United States multinationals. As a result of these distorting effects of the current tax code, the leaders of a number of multinationals — General Electric included — have been calling for a tax holiday, under which companies could repatriate cash to the United States under a temporarily lower tax rate of about 5 percent, instead of the full 35 percent corporate tax rate. The companies have argued for this tax holiday, as well as other changes to the corporate tax system, as potential ways to encourage more firms to hire American workers. As the leader of America’s biggest multinational company, Mr. Immelt is expected to continue pushing for this particular policy in his new role as President Obama’s new jobs czar. He was chosen, after all, in order to bring the perspective of the business community to the table during discussions of how to get businesses hiring again. Unfortunately, though, the evidence on the effectiveness of another similar “tax holiday” is mixed at best. Which is one reason to be concerned about whether Mr. Immelt’s advice on how to stimulate job creation may be somewhat complicated by his role with General Electric. As Mr. Sullivan of Tax Analysts writes: Citizens have a right to be concerned the president’s new adviser will give priority to promoting the competitiveness of U.S. multinationals rather than the competitiveness of the overall U.S. economy. And why shouldn’t he? He has a fiduciary responsibility to his shareholders to do exactly that.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/24/business/24views.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Turning the Focus to Governance<date>Published: January 23, 2011</date><text>The BRIC acronym for the world’s biggest emerging economies, created by the Goldman Sachs economist Jim O’Neill a decade ago, became a somewhat self-fulfilling prophecy. It arguably diverted billions of investment from elsewhere to his chosen markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China.Mr. O’Neill’s new bloc of large growth markets — which could be called MIST for short and is made up of Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey — may do the same. But smaller markets with better governance could offer investors higher long-term returns. The BRIC grouping in 2001 was well timed. With global interest rates low for several years after its coinage, large money pools were actively seeking new investment opportunities. Growth in Asia made investing there appealing. And the active marketing of the BRIC concept attracted large amounts of money to Russia and Brazil that otherwise might not have flowed to either country, and thereby increased growth in both. The self-reinforcing effect may repeat itself. The latest countries chosen by Goldman have little in common aside from the fact that each economy represents more than 1 percent of world gross domestic product (in Indonesia’s case, just below it in 2009). For example, South Korea is much richer than the other three, with a per capita G.D.P. of $27,000. Growth in Mexico, meanwhile, has been notably sluggish over the last two decades. This G.D.P. limitation is unduly restrictive, as the indicator fails to correlate particularly well with market liquidity. For example, Indonesia’s Jakarta stock exchange had a November 2010 market capitalization of $339 billion and Turkey’s Istanbul exchange $304 billion. Meanwhile, the Santiago exchange had $326 billion, even with Chile’s much smaller economy. Exchanges in Johannesburg, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia, also in much smaller economies, were larger and presumably more liquid. Investors, therefore, may do better to focus on governance. The quality of national governments and their respect for property rights matter more than size when it comes to choosing investment opportunities. Apart from making an economy grow more rapidly, good governance ensures some protections to make the problems investors have encountered in, say, Russia or Venezuela, less likely. But understanding the nuances of such complex dynamics may require more than any simple acronym can ably provide. G.E. Chief’s New Role When the president asks for help, it would be difficult for even the busiest corporate chief to say no. It’s even harder when he owes the government a huge favor. And so it is that Jeffrey R. Immelt, General Electric’s longtime boss, is heading to Washington to advise Mr. Obama on how to make the United States a job-creating colossus again. G.E. shareholders, already cheered by stellar fourth-quarter earnings, including a strong showing by its troublesome GE Capital unit, didn’t seem bothered Friday that Mr. Immelt will divert some of his attention to the president’s agenda. After all, many of the objectives — like bolstering America’s manufacturing might and promoting access to foreign markets — dovetail nicely with G.E.’s own global industrial businesses. But it’s a matter of timing. While G.E.’s share price has nearly tripled from the dark days of the financial crisis, it’s still around 50 percent off the highs seen before the investors panicked about shaky investments that the conglomerate’s finance unit made. Mr. Immelt should be credited with steering the company — with generous support from the government through debt guarantees and short-term loans — in the right direction. But he clearly failed to avert G.E.’s fall into a precarious state to begin with. Gaining access to the president’s ear has its advantages, and there’s a long history of executives, including former G.E. officials, advising a commander in chief while continuing to run their own companies. Yet the current climate carries a distinctive disadvantage: backlash from the public if it suspects the relationship is too cozy. Just ask Goldman Sachs. And G.E. still needs its best minds focused on business. To Mr. Immelt’s credit, investors spend much less time worrying about the finance unit, which knocked its mammoth parent to its knees two years ago. He’s committed to cutting it down to a more manageable size by 2012 and making it less dependent on short-term financing. But G.E. shareholders, especially those who held on through its darkest days and are still nursing losses, deserve a committed captain. Should Mr. Immelt appear stretched too thin, they would be right in demanding he choose one job or the other. MARTIN HUTCHINSON and AGNES T.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/22electric.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E. Profit Rises 51%, Topping Forecasts<date>Published: January 21, 2011</date><text>General Electric said on Friday that it closed the books on 2010 with strong earnings and a backlog of new orders that position the company for growth in 2011.Fourth-quarter income rose 51 percent, to $4.5 billion, or 42 cents a share, from $3 billion, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were $3.9 billion, or 36 cents a share, compared with $3 billion in the quarter a year ago. The results topped analysts’ forecasts of 32 cents a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Net income for the year was $11.6 billion, compared with $11 billion in 2009. “G.E. exits 2010 with significant momentum,” the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in a statement. The company “ended 2010 with three consecutive quarters of strong earnings growth,” which was expected to continue in 2011 and 2012, he said. Revenue rose 1 percent to $41.4 billion in the fourth quarter, exceeding analysts’ estimated revenue of $38.9 billion. For the year, revenue was $150.2 billion, compared with $155.3 billion in 2009. Stock in G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., rose $1.31, or 7 percent, to $19.74 a share. With its diverse portfolio of business and finance units, including the nation’s largest nonbank financial institution, G.E.’s report presented a glimpse of expectations for the economy as it recovers from the downturn, and for the potential of global markets where the company is casting around for opportunities. “It is like a very diversified little country,” Richard Tortoriello, an equity analyst with Standard &amp; Poor’s, said in an interview before the release of the report. G.E. increased its dividend twice in 2010, the report noted. In July, it rose to 12 cents a share from 10 cents. In December, it rose to 14 cents, the report said. That was less than the 31 cents a share the company paid until February 2009, when, for the first time since the Great Depression, the board cut it to conserve cash. In a conference call, Mr. Immelt said the transportation, health care and finance units would drive earnings in 2011. Infrastructure orders in the fourth quarter were up 12 percent. “This is the highest order intake since 2007,” he said. Orders in the fourth quarter were up 20 percent for equipment and 5 percent for services. Energy infrastructure orders expanded 4 percent. “We feel very good about the backlog and how we are positioned,” he said. The total backlog increased to a record $175 billion at the end of the year, according to the report. But some analysts said G.E. would have to address concerns about pricing. “The pricing in orders was down about 1 percent, and that was something that needed to be watched,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research, “given excess capacity and increasing competition globally.” He added: “They put up a relatively good and clean quarter.” The company said GE Capital reported net income of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, almost a billion more than a year ago, helped by lower loss rates. Analysts and investors have tried to see if the company is deriving strength from industrial lines rather than from a recovery in the finance unit, which struggled in the collapse of the commercial real estate market and from defaulting consumers. The conglomerate has been simplifying its portfolio and shedding noncore financial assets. On Tuesday, a proposed deal to combine Comcast and NBC Universal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department. The decision clears the way for General Electric to sell Comcast a majority stake in the network. Mr. Immelt said the company had expected the deal to close in the last quarter of 2010; now it is scheduled to close on Jan. 28. “This delay resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter and will lead to a higher tax rate in the first quarter,” he said in the statement. “We expect this will contribute to a significantly higher G.E. tax rate for full-year 2011.” Mr. Tortoriello said the company should continue to benefit from emerging market strength and a modest recovery in consumer spending in the United States and Europe. This week, G.E. announced that it was completing five agreements in aviation, energy and rail sectors that were expected to deliver more than $2 billion in revenue. In November, during a visit to India with President Obama, Mr. Immelt said that G.E. had completed deals for power turbines and jet engines worth more than $1.4 billion and planned to double overall exports in five years. G.E. also announced a series of investments in late 2010 that reflected its intentions to bolster businesses in crucial sectors, especially in the energy division. In October, it said it had agreed to buy Dresser, a privately held energy infrastructure and services company, for $3 billion. In December, General Electric said that it would buy Wellstream Holdings, a British oilfield services company, for $1.3 billion.General Electric said on Friday that it closed the books on 2010 with strong earnings and a backlog of new orders that position the company for growth in 2011.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/economy/22obama.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Obama Sends Pro-Business Signal With Adviser Choice<date>Published: January 21, 2011</date><text>SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — President Obama, sending another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly, named a high-profile corporate executive on Friday as his chief outside economic adviser, continuing his efforts to show more focus on job creation and reclaim the political center.Here in the birthplace of General Electric, Mr. Obama introduced the new appointee, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, who will serve as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers. Mr. Immelt succeeds Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who is stepping down. The selection of Mr. Immelt, who was at Mr. Obama’s side during his trip to India last year, and again this week during the visit of President Hu Jintao of China, is the latest in a string of pro-business steps taken by the president. He has installed William M. Daley, a former JPMorgan Chase executive, as his chief of staff; is planning a major speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce next month; and just this week ordered federal agencies to review regulations with an eye toward eliminating some. Together, the moves amount to a carefully choreographed shift in strategy for the White House, both substantively and on the public relations front. Mr. Obama has started making the case that the United States has moved past economic crisis mode and is entering “a new phase of our recovery,” which demands an emphasis on job creation. And with corporate profits healthy again, the president has begun engaging business leaders more on what it will take for them to start investing again in new plants and equipment and stepping up hiring. As he moves into the second half of his term and lays the foundation for his 2012 re-election campaign, Mr. Obama is trying to frame the national conversation on the economy around this crisis-to-job-creation narrative. Republicans, who have spent their first weeks of the new Congress talking about repealing Mr. Obama’s health care bill and cutting federal spending, have given the president an opening to do so. The themes the president struck here, on competitiveness and the turning point in the economy, are expected to be at the heart of the State of the Union address he will deliver Tuesday. “The past two years were about pulling our economy back from the brink,” Mr. Obama said, standing against the backdrop of a huge generator in a well-lighted plant, with a giant American flag hanging from the ceiling. “The next two years, our job now is putting our economy into overdrive.” He went on, “Our job is to do everything we can to ensure that businesses can take root and folks can find good jobs and America is leading the global competition that will determine our success in the 21st century.” It is not clear how much substantive influence Mr. Immelt’s new role will give him. Under Mr. Volcker, the panel met relatively infrequently, and Mr. Volcker at times appeared frustrated by a lack of access to the inner circles of White House decision-making. The appointment of Mr. Immelt, who will retain his posts at G.E., is not without complications for Mr. Obama. G.E., one of the nation’s largest companies, routinely has a wide variety of regulatory, trade, contracting and other issues before the federal government, on matters as varied as television mergers, military hardware and environmental cleanup. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided $16.1 billion to General Electric by buying short-term corporate i.o.u.’s from the company at a time when the public market for such debt had nearly frozen. Having the chief executive of such a company advising the White House on job creation at a time when Mr. Obama is assuming a more deregulatory posture could further alienate liberals and be seen as undermining the White House’s commitment to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests. Another complicating factor is union uneasiness about outsourcing by G.E. Officials at the United Electrical Workers Union say the company has closed 29 plants in the United States and one in Canada in the past two years, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs. “We understand the logic of asking someone like that to step up and play a leading role,” said Damon Silvers, the policy director for the AFL-CIO. “But there’s a real tension there in making a G.E. executive a central figure thinking about U.S. jobs.” But Gary Sheffer, a General Electric spokesman, said the company has also been shifting operations back to the United States, and has added 6,000 jobs in this country, for a net increase. For example, Mr. Sheffer said, G.E. is moving all of its refrigerator manufacturing business back to the United States. He said 60 percent of G.E.’s revenues come from outside the country. At the same time, G.E.’s exports have roughly doubled in the past five years, which makes the company a good showcase for a president who is trying to promote trade and exports as a way to repair the battered economy. Exports were a major theme of the president’s India trip and the state visit by President Hu; Mr. Immelt was among the business leaders who attended a high-level meeting with Mr. Hu, as well as the state dinner at the White House on Wednesday. General Electric is benefiting from Mr. Obama’s emphasis on exports. When the president was in Mumbai, he announced a string of deals involving American companies, including a $750 million order from Reliance Power Ltd., in Samalkot, India, for steam turbines manufactured by G.E. Those turbines will be made here in Schenectady, a point Mr. Obama drove home in his remarks. “This plant is what that trip was all about,” Mr. Obama said. “That new business halfway around the world is going to help support more than 1,200 manufacturing jobs and more than 400 engineering jobs right here in this community, because of that sale.” Mr. Immelt’s White House job will be as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a newly named panel that Mr. Obama is creating by executive order; the president said Friday that he intends to name additional members, including business and labor leaders and economists, “in the coming days.” The change in the council’s name is intended to signify a shift in White House focus. It will be a reconfigured version of the board that Mr. Volcker led, the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, of which Mr. Immelt was a member. That body, created by Mr. Obama when he took office in the thick of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, is set to expire Feb. 6. Christine Hauser contributed reporting from New York.SCHENECTADY, N.Y. — President Obama, sending another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly, named a high-profile corporate executive on Friday as his chief outside economic adviser, continuing his efforts to show more focus on job creation and reclaim the political center.</text></article>

And no Western company has been more aggressive in helping China pursue that dream than one of the aviation industry’s biggest suppliers of jet engines and airplane technology, General Electric. On Friday, during the visit of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, to the United States, G.E. plans to sign a joint-venture agreement in commercial aviation that shows the tricky risk-and-reward calculations American corporations must increasingly make in their pursuit of lucrative markets in China. G.E., in the partnership with a state-owned Chinese company, will be sharing its most sophisticated airplane electronics, including some of the same technology used in Boeing’s new state-of-the-art 787 Dreamliner. For G.E., the pact is a chance to build upon an already well-established business in China, where the company has booming sales of jet engines, mainly to Chinese airlines that are now buying Boeing and Airbus planes. But doing business in China often requires Western multinationals like G.E. to share technology and trade secrets that might eventually enable Chinese companies to beat them at their own game — by making the same products cheaper, if not better. The other risk is that Western technologies could help China play catch-up in military aviation — a concern underscored last week when the Chinese military demonstrated a prototype of its version of the Pentagon’s stealth fighter, even though the plane could be a decade away from production. The first customer for the G.E. joint venture will be the Chinese company building a new airliner, the C919, that is meant to be China’s first entry in competition with Boeing and Airbus. For the most part, Western aviation executives say the Chinese are simply too far behind in both civilian and military airplane technology to cause any real fears anytime soon — although it does put pressure on Boeing and Airbus to continue to innovate and stay technologically ahead of China. G.E., which said it had briefed the commerce, defense and state departments on details of the deal, acknowledges that pairing up with a Chinese firm is a delicate dance. But because the commercial aircraft market in China is expected to generate sales of more than $400 billion over the next two decades, it is not a party the company is willing to miss. Eventually, G.E. executives say, China will become a potent player in the commercial jetliner market, and the company wants to be a major supplier to the emerging Chinese producers. “They are committed for the long term and they have every probability of being successful,” said John G. Rice, vice chairman of G.E. “We can participate in that or sit on the sidelines. We’re not about sitting on the sidelines.” Mr. Rice also said that the Chinese joint venture partner — the aerospace design and equipment manufacturer Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or Avic — has supplied G.E. with some parts for jet engines for years. And he said he had personally known Avic’s president for a decade. “This venture is a strategic move that we made after some thought and consideration, with a company we know,” Mr. Rice said. “This isn’t something we were forced into” by the Chinese government. G.E.’s new joint venture in Shanghai will focus on avionics — the electronics for communications, navigation, cockpit displays and controls. G.E. will be contributing its leading-edge avionics technology — a high-performance core computer system that operates as the avionics brain of Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner. The joint venture has a ready customer in the C919’s builder, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, which is also a government-owned enterprise. The plane will be a single-aisle airliner, carrying up to 200 passengers, intended to compete with Boeing 737s and Airbus 320s. Although the Chinese hope to begin deliveries in 2016, analysts say the schedule may well slip. With or without the C919, the Chinese market for commercial airliners is already huge and growing fast — a big market for G.E. jet engines and other systems, as well as Boeing and Airbus planes. But if the C919 grabs any significant slice of that market, it would represent a new, expanded opportunity for G.E. The company has already been chosen to supply engines for the Chinese plane, through its long-standing partnership with Snecma of France. Though the world’s largest producer of jet engines, G.E. has trailed other suppliers of avionics in overall sales, behind Honeywell, Rockwell Collins and Thales, all of whom competed for the C919 business. Several other American companies have also been chosen as suppliers for the C919 aircraft, providing power generators, fuel tanks, hydraulic controls, brakes, tires and other gear. The roster of United States suppliers includes Rockwell Collins, Honeywell, Hamilton Sundstrand, Parker Aerospace, Eaton Corporation and Kidde Aerospace. In fact, the corporate competition for contracts on the C919 became a “frenzy,” said Mark Howes, president of Honeywell Aerospace Asia Pacific. The Chinese government, he said, had made it clear to Western companies that they should be “willing to share technology and know-how.” 1 2 Next Page »This article was reported by David Barboza, Christopher Drew and Steve Lohr and written by Mr. Lohr.</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/sports/29olympics.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">In NBC’s Shadow, Comcast Must Ponder Taking Olympic Plunge<date>Published: December 28, 2010</date><text>Does Comcast cherish the Olympics with the same fervor as did General Electric, which has paid billions to make NBC the network of the Summer and the Winter Games for a generation?The question arises because Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, is close to regulatory approval to buy control of NBC Universal from G.E. in a deal valued at $30 billion — and because the Olympics are near-certain guarantees of prime-time dominance for 17 nights every two years. As early as next spring, Comcast will face ESPN, Fox and a possible CBS-Turner Sports bid at the International Olympic Committee’s auction for the media rights to the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. “I don’t think Comcast wants its first move with its new partner to be a negative one and to lose something NBC has had for years,” said Barry Frank, an executive vice president of IMG who has negotiated Olympic deals in the past. Comcast, which serves 22.9 million of the nation’s 100 million pay-television subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, has done little to tip its Olympic intentions. But it understands the effect of sports through its ownership of Versus, the Golf Channel, 11 regional sports networks, the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers. And its chairman, Brian Roberts, who has won four silver medals and one gold in team squash at the Maccabiah Games, attended the 2010 Vancouver Games. But Comcast has reason to be cautious about plunging into Olympic economics, where the cost of buying media rights in the United States has soared almost without a dip since CBS paid $50,000 for the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Calif. NBC lost $223 million on the 2010 Games because of the recession and the steep price it paid to carry them; the network could lose more on the 2012 Olympics in London on its highest-ever $1.18 billion rights fee. “They’re eager to show they can make money running NBC, and the Olympics may not be a way of doing it,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. The I.O.C.’s auction for the 2014 and ’16 rights, which has been delayed to avoid the worst of the recession, will test the networks’ desires to demonstrate financial prudence. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, said recently that he wanted more than $2.2 billion, which G.E. paid for the 2010 and ’12 rights and for a global sponsorship. But Comcast, without international interests like G.E.’s, has no reason to buy such a sponsorship. G.E. said in 2008 that its sponsorship was paying off with $700 million in contracts for 400 Olympic projects in and around Beijing. Privately, the I.O.C. thinks the Sochi-Rio media rights could be worth as much as $2.7 billion. But, Moffett said, “It’s a stretch to imagine making money at $2 billion.” Network executives say they think that Sochi is less valuable than Vancouver (cost: $820 million) because of its relatively warm winter climate and that Rio should not bring as large a rights fee as a domestic Olympics would have in Chicago, one of the losing bidders in the election to host the 2016 Games. But Richard Carrion, the I.O.C. member handling the auction, said in an interview, “I think there are plenty of things to make Sochi an exciting place, and Rio is a good summer site.” Last month, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS, mindful of NBC’s losses and what the I.O.C. is seeking, seemed to indicate he would bow out of the auction if he could not get a bargain. “We don’t need to invest in something to lose money,” Moonves told an industry conference, “or just to help the prestige of the network. I think we’re already there.” Despite its ability to acquire much of what it wants, ESPN has signaled that it will not be profligate in its Olympic bidding, which acts as a preauction brake on the I.O.C.’s optimism. Last April, ESPN was outbid for the rights to the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament by the combined forces of CBS and Turner, which are paying $10.8 billion over 14 years. ESPN offered 10 percent less than CBS and Turner. “The N.C.A.A. is instructive,” said John Skipper, ESPN’s executive vice president for content. “We felt we had the best plan. I’m confident we’ll have an excellent Olympic plan, but, like the N.C.A.A., we expect to be aggressive and prudent.” NBC and Comcast officials declined to comment. Acquiring the rights to the Olympics is often a case of want, not need. They provide 17 days of highly rated programming and blanket the Internet. But they lack the week-to-week power of N.F.L. games like those that NBC carries on Sunday nights, which is the network’s highest-rated program. Dick Ebersol, who has run NBC’s sports division since 1989, adores the Olympics, produces them and would probably have left if another network had acquired them. He is part of the Olympic movement, was a close friend of the former I.O.C. president Juan Antonio Samaranch and is a recipient of the committee’s highest honor, the Olympic Order.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/opinion/28tue2.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">A Great Day for the Hudson River<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>The General Electric Company agreed last week to finish the job of removing toxic PCBs from a 40-mile stretch of the Hudson River. This is wonderful news for the river and its aquatic life, and a tribute to the environmental groups and government officials who had spent years working and waiting for this day. It also says something positive about the present leadership of G.E. Ever since the river was declared a federal Superfund site a quarter-century ago, G.E. had stubbornly argued against the cleanup. The shift in its thinking is overdue but entirely welcome. The company completed Phase 1 of the project, covering a small part of the river, earlier this year. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency gave G.E. until Jan. 14 to decide whether to proceed with the second and more demanding phase — a choice the company had under a 2005 consent decree with the government. Withdrawing from the project would have exposed G.E. to a long court fight and potentially enormous financial penalties. It could also have required the federal government to complete the job — at G.E.’s expense — which the E.P.A. is not presently equipped to do. G.E.’s decision to proceed with Phase 2 is good for both its image and for the environment. The project is expected to take between five and seven years and may eventually cost more than $1 billion. Obviously, there will be glitches along the way, but G.E. has already built an impressive dredging facility near Fort Edward. And if any company has the drive, technical expertise and money to get the job done, it is this one. G.E.’s historic obligation to the river is undeniable. Over three decades or so ending in 1970, G.E. discharged about 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, into the river. The discharges were legal at the time, but the PCBs were found to be potential carcinogens, contaminating fish and posing a health threat to humans. The 40-mile stretch where the chemicals had accumulated in greatest concentrations was designated a Superfund site, with G.E. responsible for cleaning it up. The Hudson has endured repeated insults over the years, from industry, from untreated municipal sewage, from poorly planned residential development. G.E.’s pollution is surely among the worst of these. One can wish that the company had embraced its responsibility much earlier, but now that it has agreed to atone for its errors, one can only applaud.</text></article>

Under the terms of the deal, Santander will take over GE Capital's consumer mortgage unit in Mexico, which includes a $2 billion loan portfolio. GE Capital has provided mortgages in the country since 2002. Santander disclosed the price of the transaction in a regulatory filing with the Mexican stock exchange. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year. Before the financial crisis, G.E. had relied on GE Capital for years to bolster its profits. The unit provided handsome revenue from commercial lending, and eventually provided nearly half of the parent company's profits. But the market turmoil of 2007 and 2008 revealed weaknesses in the unit, including its heavy exposure to commercial real estate and subprime mortgages, the latter of which arose from an ill-timed 2004 purchase of WMC Mortgage of California. Since the crisis, G.E. has sold off assets to refocus the division on safer industrial finance operations. (It sold WMC in 2007 for a $1 billion loss.) G.E.'s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in a recent interview that he intended to limit GE Capital to areas in which G.E. already had a strong presence, including power generation, aviation and health care equipment, and lending to midsize industrial companies. ''This sale is consistent with our strategy to exit nonstrategic businesses that lack scale to help reduce GE Capital's balance sheet while investing in core industrial and commercial finance platforms, including in Mexico,'' Mark Begor, the chief executive of GE Capital's restructuring operations, said in a statement. Santander said that the deal would make it the second-biggest mortgage lender in Mexico. ''This acquisition is evidence of Santander's confidence in Mexico, and is consistent with Santander's strategy in Mexico of investing in the strengthening of our franchise,'' Marcos Martinez Gavica, the executive president of Financiero Santander, said in a statement. G.E. said it expected to continue doing business in Mexico, focusing on commercial lending in other sectors like real estate, transportation and aircraft financing. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/business/global/24trade.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Multinationals Sit Out China Trade Battles<date>Published: December 23, 2010</date><text>HONG KONGNo American company would seem to have more to gain than General Electric from the Obama administration’s decision on Wednesday to accuse China, in a World Trade Organization case, of providing illegal subsidies to Chinese wind turbine makers. Like other multinationals, G.E. acquiesced a few years ago to the Chinese government’s demand that it build a large wind turbine factory in China — only to then watch its market share plummet as China’s state-owned power companies steered contracts to homegrown wind turbine manufacturers. And now G.E. faces growing competition from those Chinese upstarts in its home market, the United States — even as a crucial G.E. wind turbine patent is about to expire. But with so much to potentially gain from the administration’s W.T.O. case, what was G.E.’s reaction? Total silence. The company said it would have no comment on the matter. G.E.’s silence is part of a broader Western corporate reluctance to criticize Chinese policies, particularly in public. So eager are multinationals for continued access to the world’s fastest-growing market that they are loath to cry foul even amid evidence that China may be flouting international trade laws. That reticence has long characterized foreign companies’ dealings with the ascendant China. But last winter and spring, there were signs of a new willingness by American and European multinationals to speak out. Google said in March that it would shut down its China-based Internet search engine, rather than continue allowing Chinese censorship. The leaders of big companies like G.E., as well as the German giants Siemens and BASF, voiced concerns in early summer about access to the Chinese market. It briefly seemed that Western companies might take a more coordinated and more assertive position. But that season of outspokenness seems to have passed, and virtually no companies are now willing to discuss the Chinese trade barriers publicly, executives and lobbyists in Beijing, Hong Kong and Washington said. “We’re seeing a lowering of the volume — that doesn’t mean the concerns have gone away, but the volume has come down,” said Christian Murck, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. China’s solid rebound from the global economic downturn, compared with continued malaise in the West, has made the Chinese economy look like a much better place for Western companies to pursue near-term opportunities — instead of fighting drawn-out trade and regulatory battles. It can take up to three years for a W.T.O. case to wend its way through a dispute resolution panel and any appeals. Moreover, assurances from Chinese leaders that they will give equal treatment to foreign enterprises, although not yet backed up with specifics, have also persuaded some foreign companies that conditions will eventually improve. This has eroded whatever fragile consensus that had been starting to form in favor of speaking out against Chinese policies. In fact, corporate leaders like G.E.’s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, have taken a more conciliatory public stance toward China in recent months, saying that they would fine-tune their competitive tactics to adapt to Beijing policy. Experts on Chinese business culture say that Chinese regulators like to see such statements. “It’s communicating, ‘I understand my place’ — that’s very Confucian,” said Judy Lam, a lawyer at Rutter, Hobbs &amp; Davidoff in Los Angeles who specializes in deals spanning the Pacific. The statements show, she said, that “the big American giant” is “willing to suck it up — that will win them points.” After the Obama administration announced its decision to pursue the trade case, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce denied in a brief statement on Thursday that the country’s wind energy policies had violated W.T.O. rules. Many countries help their clean energy industries, usually by subsidizing consumers who buy solar panels and other renewable energy equipment. Beijing’s approach to clean energy subsidies has drawn criticism from trade experts because it is based on helping manufacturers localize production in China and begin exports. And yet, no Western company was willing to file a trade case. It was the United Steelworkers, an American labor union with no sales to lose in China, that complained in September to the Obama administration, which opened a formal investigation in October. G.E. and other American clean energy companies have avoided taking positions on that investigation. The only big company to step forward and strongly endorse it has been SolarWorld, a German company with solar panel manufacturing sites in Oregon and California, but not in China. The United Steelworkers’ trade case alleges dozens of violations by China. The Obama administration filed a W.T.O. case on only one of those issues on Wednesday, and said that it was still investigating the rest but needed more time to do so, partly because it had not yet been able to gather all the information it needed. “The pace and content of our investigation will depend in part on the role played by stakeholders, including manufacturers and service providers in the green technologies sector, in sharing evidence and other relevant information,” said Nefeterius Akeli McPherson, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative. A Washington lobbyist for a wide range of corporations said that with sales barely growing in the United States and Europe, Western companies were particularly dependent on China for growth and inexpensive manufacturing. Retail sales in China are climbing nearly 15 percent a year. “At the end of the day, they have to make their numbers,” said the lobbyist, who insisted on anonymity because of the wariness of companies he represents. The lobbyist added that many companies also feared retaliation by Chinese regulators. Chinese laws are often just a few pages in length, even on complex industrial or financial subjects. That leaves broad discretion to regulators on enforcing regulations that may help some companies and penalize others. Regulators also have the authority in every industry to approve foreign investments, and even demand a say in details like what equipment will be purchased by foreign investors for their factories. Regulators have long used their involvement in the minutiae of corporate management, and their ability to delay even minor decisions, as a way to discipline companies for taking stances at odds with Chinese policy. “They have shown themselves to be retaliatory, and it really has the intended effect,” said a Western lawyer who advises many multinationals in China, and who insisted on anonymity because he said that he feared retaliation. American policy makers almost never have the same discretionary powers to reward or penalize companies based on their cooperation or lack of it. Some executives in China working for Western multinationals advocate taking a tough line in their negotiations with Chinese officials. But they say that the reluctance of other companies to take public positions means that united action is difficult. A result, one senior Western executive said in an e-mail, is “everybody eating bitterness in solitude.”</text></article>

The companies said Wednesday that full regulatory approval of the deal, under which Comcast would initially acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal from General Electric, would not be completed by the end of December, as Comcast executives had hoped. The news is a setback for Comcast, which said all year that it expected the deal - announced in December 2009 - to close by the end of 2010. The delays have to do with some lingering questions involving what concessions Comcast will be asked to accept in order to win acceptance by the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission. The F.C.C. is preparing to circulate its order for the deal, perhaps as early as Thursday. Representatives for both agencies declined to comment on Wednesday. According to filings before the F.C.C., online video has been a focus of discussions with Comcast. Accordingly, the agency is likely to impose strong conditions on the deal that would affect the online video market. There have been no indications that the agencies would block the deal outright. Jeffrey Zucker, the outgoing NBC Universal chief executive, said in a memo to staff members Wednesday that ''we have made substantial progress this month with both the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice, and expect that we will get a 'green light' in January.'' Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokeswoman, concurred in a statement, which read, ''We are appreciative of the hard work by the F.C.C. and D.O.J. staff and by our own transition teams, and look forward to completing the process early next year.'' The deal has come under serious scrutiny from critics who say consumers will be harmed by the combination of Comcast's cable operation and NBC's portfolio of channels. Some of those critics are on Capitol Hill. Senator John D. Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia who is chairman of the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation, wrote to the F.C.C. on Dec. 10 to convey his concerns that ''a media merger of this size has the potential to leave consumers with lesser programming and higher rates.'' In a letter to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, Mr. Rockefeller singled out the nascent online video market as an area where Comcast could cause harm by favoring its own content. Once regulatory approval is obtained, there are other complications for Comcast and NBC, some of which are tied to bookkeeping. ''The official close of the transaction would happen shortly after government approval,'' Mr. Zucker said in the memo. ''Until then, of course, business continues as normal.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Sets Tighter Rules for Hudson River Cleanup<date>Published: December 17, 2010</date><text>The Environmental Protection Agency announced tighter requirements on Friday for the second phase of General Electric’s cleanup of chemical pollution in the Hudson River, imposing a stringent limit for the first time on how much contamination can be capped and sealed on the riverbed rather than removed.G.E. will be allowed to cap only 11 percent of the total project area, which stretches along 40 miles of the upper Hudson, from Hudson Falls to Troy, north of Albany, the agency said. That excludes areas where capping is unavoidable because of physical barriers in the river, which could amount to another 10 percent of the project, it added. In the first phase of the project, involving work on six miles of the river from May to November 2009, the company capped nearly 37 percent of the polluted area. The agency said it would also require tighter procedures for the dredging of sediments to remove PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, that were discharged into the river by two G.E. factories in upstate New York over a 30-year period ending in 1977. The E.P.A. said it foresaw completion of the cleanup in five to seven years. G.E., which is conducting the work under the oversight of the environmental agency’s Superfund program, has until Jan. 14 to review the agency’s decision and to announce whether it will resume the cleanup in May. It has the option of rejecting the standards and pulling out of the job, risking a court fight and enormous penalties. Agency officials said they had reached their decision after months of consultations with G.E., New York State officials, environmental groups and others and an analysis of technical information about the project. Judith A. Enck, the agency’s regional administrator in New York, said the new standards relied “on the best science to ensure this dangerous pollution is addressed in an effective way.” “E.P.A. has advanced a PCB cleanup plan that will require the removal of huge quantities of PCBs, making the Hudson River cleaner for future generations,” she added. A spokesman for G.E., Mark Behan, said the company would review the new standards, and “if we determine that the plan is consistent with our technical discussions with E.P.A., and it’s based on sound science and it’s feasible to achieve, G.E. expects to move forward with Phase 2.” Mr. Behan said the company had already spent $561 million on the design and execution of the project’s first phase, and had set aside “sufficient funding” to finish the cleanup. He declined to give a specific figure. Lawrence Levine, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, described the standards for the second phase of the cleanup as a compromise. “Under these cleanup standards, there’s no doubt we’ll have a much cleaner and healthier Hudson River than we do today,” Mr. Levine said. But he argued that allowing G.E. to cover over toxic contamination presented “the ongoing risk of it being stirred up once again in the years to come.” But Ms. Enck said that even with capping, the cleanup was expected to remove most PCBs. “We believe that at least 95 percent of the PCBs in the dredge area will be removed,” she said in a telephone call with reporters. “We’re very proud of that number.” She added G.E. was responsible for checking the capped areas every 10 years and maintaining them. “We’re confident that the capping will be effective,” she said. A panel of independent scientists convened by the E.P.A. this year to review the first phase of the cleanup concluded that the effort had failed to meet standards consistently, including the levels of PCBs released into the water by the dredging itself and the levels remaining after an area was dredged or otherwise cleaned up. The panel called for “substantive changes” in the second phase. In the next phase, E.P.A. officials said, they will require a maximum of three dredge passes, with the aim of limiting recontamination of the river. They will also mandate improvements in sampling for more accurate and complete information on the extent of the contamination. From the 1940s to the 1970s, G.E. plants discharged approximately 1.3 million pounds of PCBs, cancer-causing chemicals that build up in fish over time, contaminating nearly 200 miles of the Hudson down to New York City, the agency estimates. The dredging is confined to the most contaminated section of the river, amounting to about 490 acres of river bottom, but the goal is to sharply reduce the risk to people and animals from eating fish caught anywhere in the Hudson. “This is about G.E.’s commitment to cleaning up the river,” said Stuart Gruskin, executive deputy commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation. “This is the moment to make that commitment.”</text></article>

Zabel has spent his career striking complex deals for wealthy families in sticky situations. But the $7.2 billion settlement he hammered out with the federal government and the Madoff bankruptcy trustee on behalf of his client, Jeffry M. Picower — the largest civil forfeiture in United States history — marks a milestone in Mr. Zabel’s four decades as a leading trust and estate lawyer. The settlement “will return every penny received from almost 35 years of investing with Bernard Madoff,” Mr. Picower’s wife, Barbara, said in a statement released through Mr. Zabel, a  partner at New York law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink At Friday’s standing-room only press conference at the United States Attorney’s office in Manhattan, Irving L. Picard, the court-appointed trustee seeking recoveries for Madoff victims, praised Mr. Zabel and his client for being “open and honest in sharing information and conducting good faith negotiations with us.” The settlement concludes the trustee’s case against the estate of Mr. Picower, a Palm Beach philanthropist and longtime Madoff investor who died in October 2009. Mr. Madoff, who admitted  running a giant Ponzi scheme two years ago, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison. “I represented Jeff for more than 20 years and many, many wills,” said Mr. Zabel of Mr. Picower. He said his hard-fought and complicated negotiations with the trustee and the government took more than a year-and-a-half. “T.S. Eliot said, ‘To do the right thing for the wrong reason is the worst treason,’ ” said Mr. Zabel. “Barbara did the right thing for the right reason.” The Picower settlement is a boon to the victims of Mr. Madoff’s  scheme. Thus far, Mr. Picard has recovered $2.6 billion. The total recovery is now almost 50 percent of the $20 billion in the estimated cash losses of victims eligible for restitution. The 72-year-old bow-tied Mr. Zabel has found himself at the center of many  messy upper-class controversies, including his representation of Jane Welch during her divorce from Jack, the chief of General Electric, and the guardianship of Lionel Pincus, the billionaire financier. Among his other celebrity clients: the investor George Soros, the golfer Greg Norman, and the shock-jock Howard Stern. Mr. Zabel began advising wealthy families as a young associate at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. He co-founded Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel in 1969 with several other colleagues, including Paul Roth, the pioneering hedge-fund lawyer. A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Mr. Zabel is an accomplished Churchill scholar. Negotiating with the Justice Department was an atypical assignment for a lawyer more accustomed to advising foundations and structuring trusts. But it was awkward for another reason. Richard Zabel, the chief of the criminal division of the United States Attorney’s office in Manhattan, is Mr. Zabel’s oldest son. Because of the elder Mr. Zabel’s connection to the Madoff case, Mr. Zabel said his son had recused himself from all Madoff-related litigation. “That disappointed me,” said Mr. Zabel of his son’s recusal. “Because I think I’m a good lawyer, but he’s a better lawyer.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/14views.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">For G.E. and Citigroup, Paring Down Bloated Balance Sheets<date>Published: December 13, 2010</date><text> Corporate titans are not usually rewarded for shrinking their companies. But the chief executives of two of the world’s biggest companies, Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, have had to do something similar. Bloated balance sheets heavily dependent on short-term financing forced both these companies to beg for government help two years ago. Since then, they have been shedding assets in a bid to return to normal business and create a buffer against ever needing taxpayer handouts again. If it were a race, Citi Holdings, the unit that houses the bank’s blacklisted assets, would have a sizable lead. Including the pending sale of the Student Loan Corporation, Citi Holdings has trimmed its balance sheet by 44 percent in two years. GE Capital, in comparison, is pacing itself. The unit’s balance sheet has shrunk 15 percent since the end of 2008, and its unwanted “red assets” are about 24 percent smaller than a year ago, at $105 billion. To be fair, Citi Holdings and GE Capital are two varieties of apple. Citi created its unit to clear the garbage — and noncore units like the Smith Barney brokerage house — out of its still mighty global bank. Much of GE Capital, meanwhile, remains an integral unit of its industrial parent. So while it might be shedding assets like Polish mortgages, those will be partly offset by growth in lines like commercial lending and leasing, which support its world-class industrial and infrastructure businesses. Still, both made similarly critical missteps by piling into risky investments linked to the booming real estate market with short-term borrowings. Citi received the most help from Washington — capital injections, guarantees for its debt and insurance on its most distressed assets. But without government support, it is hard to see how GE Capital could have managed through the crisis without a fire sale of good assets. It borrowed nearly $12 billion over five days from a Federal Reserve facility in October 2008. The race is still not over. GE Capital sees the finishing line in 2012, by which time it hopes to cut an additional $40 billion from the balance sheet. And though Mr. Immelt may be lagging Mr. Pandit, if he remains committed to shrinking he is unlikely to hear many boos at his annual investor presentation today. Deal Gusher It is tempting to use costlier oil to explain Monday’s three oil services deals, headlined by General Electric’s £800 million ($1.3 billion) purchase of Wellstream Holdings. But the stronger underlying theme is rising interest in techniques for reaching oil that is hard to get at. Specialists want new capabilities — and the majors want bigger partners. Wellstream and two other takeover targets, PSN and Easternwell, all have expertise and technology in extracting energy from tricky places. Flexible pipes of the type Wellstream makes are essential as energy giants delve deeper into the oceans. PSN is a specialist in increasing production from old wells. And Australia’s Easternwell knows how to extract coal seam gas — once a nuisance that killed canaries in mines, but now a precious resource. Demand for traditional drilling equipment remains slack despite rising oil prices because new discoveries of conventional fossil fuel deposits have been scarce. Instead, the oil services arms race has focused on how to reach difficult deposits. In addition, rather than abandoning old wells and moving on, it has become worthwhile to keep older wells alive — another technically challenging proposition. So far, only about a third of the fuel in existing wells worldwide has been harvested, according to the research firm IHS. This, rather than oil for $90 a barrel, is the main deal driver. Even two of the biggest deals of recent years, Schlumberger’s takeover of Smith and Baker Hughes’s purchase of BJ Services Company, had more to do with the targets’ expertise in cracking previously inaccessible energy out of rock than with buoyant oil prices. For the smaller players in oil services, there is a mergers-and-acquisitions motivation beyond technology, too: specialists in hard-to-get oil will need to grow as demand for their services increases. Of course, a bargain basement crude price would slow consolidation. At $50 a barrel, some of the more costly exploration and recovery methods cease to be economical. But assuming no such collapse, companies in the oil services sector will keep exploring for new deals. AGNES T. CRANE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN</text></article>

The bid values Wellstream at 800 million, and will pay Wellstream shareholders 780 pence cash a share, as well as a 6-pence special dividend. The Wellstream board intends unanimously recommend the offer, with the deal set to close in the first quarter of next year. The offer is 29.1 percent above Wellstream's closing share price the day before it first disclosed it had received bids, and 53 percent above the three-month average share price prior to that date. Peter Hitchens, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said that while the valuation for Wellstream looked high, there were high barriers to entry for the sector, and prospects for ''strong growth as the world moves into deeper and deeper water.'' Strategically, he called the deal ''very good'' for G.E., given that Wellstream is a one-product company second only to Technip, a French rival, in the production of tailored deepwater pipes. John W. Kennedy, chairman of Wellstream, said the bid ''allows shareholders to realize their investment in cash at a price which reflects both our progress since the I.P.O. in 2007 and the potential for further growth.'' Wellstream designs and makes flexible pipeline equipment for deepwater production, a sector where G.E. foresees double-digit growth in the next five years as its oil and natural gas unit focuses on Brazil, Africa and Asia. The Wellstream deal will help it in the ''floating production, storage and offloading offshore segment,'' G.E. said. ''We have been about 12 years now in the oil and gas industry and our aspiration is to do in the oil and gas industry what we have done over a century in the aviation industry,'' Claudi Santiago, head of the oil and gas unit, said two years ago. Calling Wellstream a strategic fit, Mr. Santiago said in the statement on Monday that the deal would give G.E. clients ''reliable technology and services needed to tackle their toughest deepwater challenges.'' Wellstream has pipe plants in Newcastle, England, and Nitaroi, Brazil, a country where the energy industry is booming because of oil discoveries larger than any seen since those made in Mexico in the 1970s. In its interim report in August, Wellstream said it had landed important contracts this year with Petrobras, which wrapped up the world's largest share issue over the summer to finance its exploration of the Brazilian deepwater fields, and with Statoil of Norway. The company reported a pretax profit of 10.6 million for the first six months of 2010, just two-fifths of what it was for the period a year earlier, citing ''the challenging market conditions prevailing outside Brazil'' as well as a revenue drop resulting after the completion of a project in Australia. Revenue fell 34 percent. General Electric hired Goldman Sachs as financial adviser, while Wellstream employed Credit Suisse and Rothschild. Wellstream shares rose 37.50 pence, or 5.02 percent, to 784.50 pence, in late morning trading in London.

As the Environmental Protection Agency prepares a decision on standards for the second phase of General Electric’s cleanup of toxic chemicals in the Hudson River, environmental advocates are worrying that the agency may allow more of the chemicals to remain in the river sediment than originally envisaged. The cleanup involves dredging to remove sediment contaminated with P.C.B.’s, or polychlorinated biphenyls, from discharges by G.E. plants over a 30-year period ending in 1977. A panel of independent scientists convened by the E.P.A. to review the first phase of the dredging, conducted last year, concluded that the cleanup had failed to consistently meet performance standards and needed to undergo “substantive changes” in its next phase. In letters and high level meetings with E.P.A. officials, New York environmental officials and advocacy groups have expressed concerns over ongoing discussions between the agency and G.E. officials about the extent to which contaminated sediment could be capped rather than removed. In one such letter this month, Stuart F. Gruskin, executive deputy commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, said the state did not support leaving contaminated sediment in places where it is feasible to dredge it out. He suggested that the only reason for doing so was to save G.E. money. “There is no environmental, technical, legal or sound policy basis for leaving P.C.B. inventory in the river that could otherwise be removed,” Mr. Gruskin said. “From an environmental and technical perspective, capping the PCB contaminated sediments in the upper Hudson River presents significant issues given its inherent lack of permanence and extended monitoring and maintenance requirements.” But Mark Behan, a spokesman for G.E., said that the company was not proposing to substitute capping for dredging. “The capping that E.P.A. and G.E. have discussed is limited to isolated spots in the river where extensive dredging has already occurred and yet some residual P.C.B.’s remain,” he said in a statement. He said that capping would address “the minute quantities of P.C.B.’s that will be left behind because dredging cannot remove every trace.” “The peer reviewers evaluated this issue as well and concluded that E.P.A. should make more use of capping, not less, to improve dredging productivity, reduce re-suspension of P.C.B.’s into the river and achieve E.P.A.’s risk-reduction goals,” he said. A spokeswoman for the E.P.A. in New York, Mary Mears, said that the agency had not yet made any final decisions. Officials with the E.P.A. have estimated that the cleanup could take 7 to 10 years. The first phase ran from May to November of 2009 and turned up more contamination than was expected in the dredging area, in the upper Hudson River north of Albany. The peer review panel suggested adjustments to deal with issues like the efficiency of the dredging in removing P.C.B.’s, the amount of P.C.B.’s released into the water by the dredging itself and the levels of contamination remaining in cleaned-up areas. One recommendation called for better data about how deep the contaminants are in any given area so that they can be removed in the first dredging pass rather repeated passes. The E.P.A. has designated nearly 200 miles of the river as a contaminated Superfund site. The cleanup is one of the largest environmental dredging operations ever attempted.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/business/economy/06fed.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Fed Records Show Aid to G.E. and JPMorgan in 2008<date>Published: December 5, 2010</date><text>Newly disclosed records show that during the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve essentially lent $16.1 billion to General Electric by buying short-term corporate i.o.u.’s from the company at a time when the public market for such debt had nearly frozen.And on Sept. 15, 2008, the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection, JPMorgan Chase received a $3 billion loan from the Fed. The loan was extended under one of several Fed programs tapped by the Wall Street bank, one of the more robust financial institutions to weather the crisis. The two companies received help even as their chief executives, Jeffrey R. Immelt of G.E. and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, sat on the nine-member board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Neither executive was involved in creating the emergency programs, which were approved by the Fed’s board of governors in Washington. Both companies also disclosed that they were among scores of institutions that received support from the Fed. Nevertheless, some policy experts expressed discomfort with the situation. “In my view, it is an obvious conflict of interest for C.E.O.’s of banks and large corporations who serve on the Fed’s board of directors to have received cheap loans from the Fed,” Senator Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent who wrote the legal provision requiring the Fed to make the disclosures, said in a statement on Sunday. “While they got a huge amount of government support, small businesses are going bankrupt because they can’t receive affordable credit, workers are losing their homes to foreclosure, and consumers are being charged 25 percent to 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards by the very same banks that were bailed out,” he added. The details of the emergency loan program were disclosed last week when the Fed reluctantly released records of 21,000 crisis-related transactions under orders from Congress. The disclosures are likely to renew questions about the influence of bank officers and corporate executives in the operations of the Fed. “It’s ugly,” said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and a historian of the Fed. “It has the appearance of impropriety.” The Dodd-Frank Act, which President Obama signed in July, bars representatives of banks that are members of the Fed system, like Mr. Dimon, from having a vote in selecting the presidents of the Fed’s 12 district banks, altering a system that went back to the creation of the Fed in 1913. Mr. Sanders also wrote a provision requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate potential conflicts of interest at the Fed. The results of that audit are expected in July. The New York Fed is the most powerful of the Federal Reserve’s 12 branches and was charged with carrying out various emergency programs that supported financial markets during the crisis. In a statement, the New York Fed said that its “board of directors was not involved in the creation of the emergency lending facilities authorized by the board of governors of the Federal Reserve.” The Fed says it has been, or will be, repaid on all of its loans. While Mr. Immelt and Mr. Dimon were not involved in setting up the programs, the records show their companies still received substantial support. G.E. was one of the largest beneficiaries of the Fed program to buy commercial paper, or short-term i.o.u.’s. A few institutions — among them Bank of America, UBS, Barclays and Citigroup — sold even more to the Fed. In contrast, JPMorgan got far less help under the program for investment banks than some of its Wall Street rivals, like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which each tapped the program on more than 100 occasions. On 12 occasions in October and November 2008, G.E. issued short-term i.o.u.’s — which all corporations use for everyday transactions like paying their employees and suppliers; the Fed purchased a total of $16.1 billion of them. “Our participation was not affected by Jeff’s status as a New York Fed board member,” said Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for GE Capital, the company’s finance arm. “We have been proactive in disclosing our participation in the funding programs.” The records indicate JPMorgan and its subsidiaries participated in seven Fed programs, including two related to its purchase of Bear Stearns in March 2008, a prelude to the deepening of the financial crisis later that year. JPMorgan Chase borrowed seven times from a program designed to make it easier for sound institutions to borrow as the financial strains in the market first became apparent. It received 23 loans under a program designed to stabilize the market for Treasury securities. And it got 570 loans for purchases of asset-backed commercial paper. Under a program the Fed created in March 2008 to lend directly to investment banks for the first time in its history, JPMorgan received three loans, including the $3 billion loan on the day that Lehman collapsed. (The other two loans were made the next month, for $10 million each.) Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, said the bank “is proud to have been a source of stability for the markets” and, in fact, was asked to take part in some of the programs as the Fed tried to calm the markets. “Our fortress balance sheet allowed us to help the federal government avoid a bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and to acquire Washington Mutual, providing essential credit and minimizing market disruptions that could have been disastrous,” she said in a statement. “In addition to these actions, the government encouraged us to use its lending facilities during times of market turmoil to help reduce any stigma and to improve market liquidity for our clients.” The Fed, as the nation’s central bank, has responsibility for guiding monetary policy and is an independent arm of the government. The New York Fed, like the other Fed banks, is overseen by a nine-member board. Three members are bankers, chosen by fellow bankers; another three are chosen by bankers to represent the public; and the final three are chosen by the Federal Reserve’s seven-member board of governors in Washington. The chairman of each Fed bank must come from the last group. The new disclosures do not represent the first time the New York Fed’s relationship with the banks it assisted has come under scrutiny. Goldman, previously an investment bank, became a Fed-regulated bank holding company during the crisis. It tapped the Fed program to help investment banks 52 times, owing $18 billion to the Fed at one point — receiving far greater support than JPMorgan. The chairman of the New York Fed at the time, Stephen Friedman, was a Goldman director and former chairman of Goldman. The Fed granted Mr. Friedman a waiver so he could continue serving as chairman of the New York Fed. While awaiting the waiver, Mr. Friedman bought shares of Goldman around the time the bank received Fed support. After The Wall Street Journal reported on the purchases, Mr. Friedman stepped down, saying the Fed “does not need this distraction.” The New York Fed’s top lawyer said at the time that Mr. Friedman “did not violate any Federal Reserve statute, rule or policy.” Mr. Friedman’s successor as chairman of the New York Fed was Denis M. Hughes, president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. Fed observers say it is unlikely that a former banker will serve as the agency’s chairman any time soon.</text></article>

And what wisdom is on tap at the United States Military Academy? “Adaptability” and “resiliency” amid uncertainty, says Mr. Immelt — skills as vital to surviving in business as they are on the battlefield. Strategies are useful, he says, but only if they can quickly adjust to nasty real-world surprises. “In the words of the great philosopher Mike Tyson,” Mr. Immelt says, smiling, “everybody has a plan till they get punched in the mouth.” Perhaps no company outside of the banking sector was hit as hard by the financial crisis as G.E., certainly none that seemed healthy before the economic tailspin. Its big finance arm, GE Capital, long a cash machine that bolstered the mother ship’s bottom line, became an albatross, threatening to pull down the entire enterprise. G.E. cut its dividend for the first time since the Great Depression, lost its triple-A credit rating and hastily arranged a $3 billion investment from the billionaire Warren E. Buffett. Having skirted disaster, G.E. is recovering gradually these days. Its finance unit is on the mend, with the size of its debts and troubled loans trending downward. Mind you, middling recoveries are a relative matter at G.E. After all, the company remains a colossus on track to deliver profits of more than $10 billion on sales of about $150 billion this year. But investors are used to getting more from G.E., which earned $22 billion on revenue of $173 billion in 2007. So G.E. has revamped its strategy in the wake of the financial crisis. Its heritage of industrial innovation reaches back to Thomas Edison and the incandescent light bulb, and with that legacy in mind, G.E. is going back to basics. The company, Mr. Immelt insists, must rely more on making physical products and less on financial engineering — a path that, he insists, is also necessary for the American economy as a whole. Mr. Immelt candidly admits that G.E. was seduced by GE Capital’s financial promise — the lure of rapid-fire money-making unencumbered by the long-range planning, costs and headaches that go into producing heavy-duty material goods. Other industrial corporations were enthralled with finance, of course, but none as much as G.E., which became the nation’s largest nonbank financial company. The big buildup of GE Capital occurred during the tenure of Mr. Immelt’s famous predecessor, Jack Welch. But while Mr. Immelt, who took over in 2001, spun off the unit’s insurance business, he also bulked up on commercial real estate and other loans. In 2004, G.E. even bought a subprime lender in California, WMC Mortgage, which it shed in 2007 for a $1 billion loss. IN the buoyant years before the credit crisis, the company’s finance arm contributed nearly half of G.E.’s overall profits. When Mr. Immelt had qualms about the unit’s risks, he sought outside opinions, including ordering up a study by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company in 2007. Sixty days later, the consulting team, he says, told G.E. that money from nations with a trade surplus, like China, and sovereign wealth funds, among other investors, would provide enough liquidity in the financial system to fuel lending and leverage for the foreseeable future. (McKinsey declined to comment on the study.) Mr. Immelt and his advisers had plenty of company in missing the gathering storm. “But clearly,” Mr. Immelt concedes, “GE Capital was too big in the context of G.E.” Going back to the early 1990s, he explains, anticipated returns — not so much market expertise — guided investment decisions. If a deal looked like a money spinner, he says, it got the nod. “And you don’t have to build a factory,” he adds. Today, the financial unit is becoming smaller and focusing on fields where G.E. believes it has a competitive advantage. Those specialty areas include industries in which G.E. has a strong manufacturing presence, like power generation, aviation and health-care equipment, and lending to midsize industrial companies. Unless a deal is in a business where G.E. has distinctive skills, Mr. Immelt says he won’t let GE Capital dive in. “We’re not going to do it, whether there are supernormal returns or not,” he says. He’s most animated talking about heavyweight products that take patience and piles of cash to develop, weigh tons and last for years — next-generation jet engines, power turbines, locomotives, nuclear plants, water-treatment systems, medical-imaging equipment, solar panels and windmills. Mr. Immelt notes, for example, that the cost of a good-sized solar-panel plant, about $70 million, is more than twice the total investment in Google in the six years before it went public in 2004. The costs and complexities of such businesses, he adds, make it hard for just any company to compete. These are markets, he says, that have “big moats. They’re tough to get in.”</text></article>

Plans Big Order of Chevy Volts<date>Published: November 14, 2010</date><text>7:57 p.m. | Updated General Electric said Thursday that it would buy 25,000 electric vehicles by 2015, including 12,000 from General Motors. Among the cars will be the Chevrolet Volt coming next year, although the Volt is technically a plug-in hybrid with a limited all-electric range. G.E. said it would convert ''at least half'' of its 30,000 company cars to electric cars and would act as a partner with fleet customers. The plan was originally announced in London last month by G.E.'s chairman and chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, but the company has now released details. G.E. said it would add other car companies to its order list ''as manufacturers expand their electric vehicle portfolios.'' According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Mr. Immelt also said in London that half of G.E.'s 45,000 sales force would drive electric cars. The company also will open what it called ''electric vehicle customer experience and learning centers'' at its Advanced Manufacturing and Software Technology Center in Van Buren Township, Mich., and at GE Capital Fleet Services headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minn. G.E.'s plan is a coup for General Motors, whose chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, called the order ''a vote of confidence in the Chevrolet Volt, which we will begin delivering to retail customers by the end of this year.'' G.E. said nothing about a possible order for the Nissan Leaf or other battery-electric cars, but the extra range of the Volt, which has an onboard gasoline engine, would presumably be an advantage for G.E.'s traveling sales force This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/05views.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.M. Payback Still a Long Way Ahead<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>Taxpayers will have to wait a while to reclaim the money invested to keep General Motors out of the scrapyard. The carmaker is running far more smoothly after declaring bankruptcy last year: it earned as much as $2.1 billion in the three months to September, its third straight quarter of profits. But the terms of G.M.’s coming share sale show that, once public, the stock will have to as much as double before its biggest shareholder, the United States government, gets close to breaking even.Assume G.M.’s initial public offering starts at $26, the bottom of the projected price range. That would mean the Treasury, which owns 61 percent, would be taking a 42 percent loss on any stock it sells in the offering. It is planning to sell 263 million shares. If it does, G.M. shares would need to more than double to get back into the black on its investment, reaching more than $52 a share, according to a Reuters Breakingviews analysis. The hurdle for G.M.’s debut performance lowers if G.M.’s bankers can sell the shares at the top of the price range. But if the underwriters sell more of the Treasury’s stock in the I.P.O., the barrier to breaking even increases. The calculation is similar for the G.M. stakes held by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Over all, this sounds like a tall order. All things being equal, it implies that G.M. will have to essentially double its profits. But it could have been worse. Had the Treasury insisted on dumping more stock on the market, as appeared to be the case just a few months ago, the I.P.O. price might have been lower and the need for a huge increase in G.M.’s value afterward far greater. The Treasury, whose G.M. efforts are being led by Ron Bloom, changed its tune and focused less on getting out quickly and more on exiting with minimal damage to taxpayers. That is a sensible about-face, but it still leaves getting back in the black a ways off. Buffett’s Swiss Stake Warren E. Buffett may struggle to repeat his Swiss Re exit. The billionaire bailed out three big companies during the financial crisis: the Swiss insurer, General Electric and Goldman Sachs. On Thursday, he allowed Swiss Re to buy back its expensive convertible stock. He may have less leeway to be as generous with the other two. Of the three deals, Mr. Buffett’s $3.1 billion investment in Swiss Re convertible shares had the most stipulations. Negotiated at the depths of the market slump, the stock paid a 12 percent annual coupon until March 2012, when it would convert into ordinary shares at 25 Swiss francs, or $25.53. As Swiss Re’s share price is now twice that, the insurer was eager to buy back the convertibles. But it had also agreed to pay Mr. Buffett a 40 percent premium if it redeemed before March 2011, and a 20 percent premium after that. Mr. Buffett is allowing Swiss Re to pay only a 20 percent premium, as well as the interest he would have received next March. That means he collects $1 billion, rather than the $1.6 billion to which he was entitled. That may look generous. But Mr. Buffett also owns 3 percent of Swiss Re’s stock, which will benefit from the redemption of the expensive convertible securities. The shares jumped more than 6 percent At first glance, Mr. Buffett faces a similar situation with Goldman and G.E., where he holds preferred shares worth $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Both would like to buy back the stock, which pays an annual coupon of 10 percent. He also has warrants over shares of both companies, giving him an incentive to help raise the stock price. But there is less room for a Swiss Re-style agreement. Because Goldman can redeem its preferred stock at any time for a 10 percent premium, it does not need Mr. Buffett to give it an early discount. G.E.’s stock cannot be redeemed until October 2011, opening the door for a negotiation. But Berkshire Hathaway’s G.E. warrants are deeply out of the money. That means it is unlikely to benefit from any short-term boost to GE’s shares. Despite Mr. Buffett’s apparent generosity with Swiss Re, Goldman and G.E. should not assume he will take the same approach with them.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/16/business/16electric.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">General Electric Quarterly Profit Falls 18%<date>Published: October 15, 2010</date><text>General Electric has come a long way back since the financial crisis sent it reeling. The company has pared back its troubled finance arm, focused on its mainstay industrial business, cut costs and revived profits. But G.E.’s credibility on Wall Street remains shaky, with any sign of weakness punished by waves of selling.The company on Friday reported stronger-than-expected profits, led by a big improvement in its finance unit, GE Capital. And orders for its industrial goods and services — an early sign of future revenue — grew for the first time in two years. But revenue slipped as current sales of industrial equipment were soft, and investors sent G.E.’s shares down 5 percent. “There is very little room for error for G.E.,” said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research. The quarterly results also included an unsettling reminder that liabilities in the finance business can linger and grow. G.E.’s third-quarter net profit fell 18 percent, weighed down by a $1.1 billion charge for obligations it may still have to pay on the Japanese consumer finance business it sold in 2008. Consequently, G.E. reported net income of $2.06 billion, or 18 cents a share, compared with $2.49 billion, or 23 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations rose 29 percent, to $3.16 billion. And earnings per share on that basis increased 32 percent, to 29 cents a share, which was above analysts’ forecast of 27 cents, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. In a conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company’s chief executive, called the performance “a good quarter in an improving environment” and evidence that the company’s back-to-basics strategy was progressing as hoped. Yet analysts expressed concern that most of the profit improvement came from a recovery in the finance business — not a robust performance from its high-technology industrial lines, including jet engines, medical imaging equipment and wind turbines. GE Capital, which contributes less than 20 percent of total corporate earnings, reported a sixfold jump in profit, to $871 million, from $141 million a year ago. The commercial real estate business is a continuing headache, losing $405 million, though the losses are declining. But analysts say the company’s consumer division, like retail credit cards, and lending to small businesses are solid performers. Wall Street analysts have long had concerns about the quality of earnings across the conglomerate’s mixed portfolio. The surest test of G.E.’s financial performance, some analysts say, will be its ability to increase its dividend. Those payments, they say, will be real cash commitments for the long term. “Dividends will be the key for G.E., raising the yield,” said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach. “G.E. is a special situation, a stock that is really more like a bond.” In July, G.E. announced a 20 percent increase in its quarterly dividend, to 12 cents a share from 10 cents. But that remains well below the 31 cents a share the company was paying until February 2009, when the board cut the payout to conserve cash. That was the first time since the Depression that G.E. had cut its dividend. One way to free up cash for further dividend increases, analysts say, would be to retire the $3 billion in G.E. preferred stock that the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett bought in October 2008. That deal, arranged soon after the financial crisis erupted, was done to secure cash and restore confidence in G.E., the nation’s largest nonbank financial institution. That stock pays a 10 percent dividend, or $300 million a year. Under the terms of the deal, G.E. cannot buy the shares back until next October. But G.E. executives have said that negotiating an earlier sale would be a step they might pursue — if it completes the spinoff of its media company, NBC Universal, into a joint venture 51 percent owned by Comcast, by the end of this year. G.E.’s big-ticket industrial products are often the last investments made by corporate customers during uncertain economic times. But analysts note that G.E. has been slower to return to a growth path than other industrial equipment makers, including Honeywell, Emerson Electric and Tyco. Revenue fell 5 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, to $35.9 billion. That was below Wall Street’s estimate of $37.6 billion, and down from $37.8 billion in the third quarter of 2009. One particular source of weakness was the once-booming market for wind turbines, which were down 32 percent, or $600 million, from a year ago. Keith Sherin, chief financial officer, attributed the steep fall in the American market for wind turbines mainly to the falloff in overall electricity demand and low prices for natural-gas power generation. Yet in a sign of improving fortunes, G.E. is investing again. Earlier this month, the company announced that it had agreed to purchase Dresser, a maker of equipment for natural gas distribution, for $3 billion. In the conference call, Mr. Immelt declared that G.E. was looking for similar purchases, typically of $1 billion to $3 billion. “All the deals,” he said, “will be bolt-ons to the core of what we’re doing.”</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/g-e-a-buyer-once-more/?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E.: A Buyer Once More<date>October 7, 2010, 12:10 am</date><text>General Electric marked its return to the takeover track with its first major deals since the start of the financial crisis, with G.E. executives suggesting that more are likely to follow in the coming months, Reuters writes. G.E. announced on Wednesday that it had agreed to buy Dresser, a privately held energy infrastructure company, for $3 billion, while the conglomerate’s GE Capital unit announced that it had acquired $1.6 billion of private-label credit card loans from Citigroup. The deal-making marks a change in stance at G.E., which has been hard hit by the credit crisis and recession and spent much of the past few years looking for ways to pare back its hefty finance arm, Reuters said. So what’s next on G.E.’s shopping list? The company, which has said it could spend up to $30 billion on takeovers over the next few years, sees opportunity for more acquisitions in sectors including energy, health care and financial services, John Krenicki, a G.E. vice chairman who serves as chief executive of the company’s Energy Infrastructure division, told Reuters. However, investors may want to reserve judgement on G.E.’s M&amp;A spree, Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cleveland, which holds G..E shares, told the news service. “Are they going to get it right? Are they going to pay the right price? It depends how eager they are to add on assets,” Mr. Klein said. Peter Sorrentino, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors, said he took heart in the fact that the investments in energy and credit cards came in sectors that have declined in value over the past year. “On some of the things they sold they have been on the receiving end of that punishment, where it was a buyer’s market,” Mr. Sorrentino told Reuters. “Now that they’re in the driver’s seat on that, hopefully they got pretty well schooled and are much tougher negotiators when they’re spending the shareholders’ dollars.” Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07views.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Shareholders Applaud G.E.’s Shopping Spree<date>Published: October 6, 2010</date><text>General Electric’s shareholders seem curiously overjoyed to see the conglomerate back in shopping mode. The company added $4.2 billion to G.E.’s market cap on Wednesday, when it spent $3 billion on an energy infrastructure business, confirmed its interest in a British maker of oil pipes and snapped up some of Citigroup’s more questionable loans. It is a shift from years on the defensive, selling assets. But the celebration looks overdone.G.E., under its chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, has overspent on takeovers in the past, and it is hard to determine whether it is bringing newfound discipline to its mergers-and-acquisitions machine. That should matter to shareholders. The fallout from past missteps, coupled with the financial crisis, has cost G.E.’s owners more than $250 billion in market value over the last three years — the equivalent of Apple’s market cap. Mr. Immelt’s purchase of Dresser does not seem like the most lucrative return to the deal business — though it is hard to be sure, as G.E. is not saying much about Dresser’s financials. It says the business had 2009 “earnings” of $318 million. Assume that is pretax income, as Credit Suisse suggests, and that the purchase price includes any debt, something G.E. has not confirmed. That would equate to an after-tax annual return of just around 7 percent absent any cost savings. While that is not terrible, it is less than the 9.2 percent at which Morningstar estimates G.E.’s weighted average cost of capital. Then there is the conglomerate’s interest in Wellstream Holdings of Britain, which makes bendable pipes for offshore oil rigs. The company rejected G.E.’s $1.2 billion offer. Fold in Wellstream’s debt, tax its 2011 operating income as estimated by Thomson Reuters, and the return on that deal would be at 4.5 percent. As with Dresser, there may be cost savings that G.E. can extract. But they would need to be hefty for a Wellstream deal to meet G.E.’s cost of capital any time soon. Of course, shareholders may simply appreciate G.E.’s display of confidence. Or perhaps, when it comes to G.E.’s deal-making past, they just have short memories. Prada’s Odd Ensemble Prada may be about to mix haute couture with financial fashion. The Italian label is considering going public, possibly in Hong Kong. This could make for an odd ensemble. An initial public offering is a recurring theme for Prada, which has toyed with a stock market listing at least three times over the last decade. That it failed each time was hardly the company’s fault — its first attempt was scheduled for Sept. 18, 2001 — but when the plans were shelved, high debts left Prada exposed. Now that Prada’s debt is under control, China adds a new twist. The country is on track to be the world’s biggest luxury market by 2015, according to a Chinese state research organization. Luxury apartment prices, a crucial indicator of demand for high-end goods, are rising at almost 20 percent a year. That shows in Prada’s numbers: first-half revenue from the Far East grew by 47 percent. Chinese investors may also pay up for a good growth story. If Prada can meet expectations for 25 percent sales growth this year, then grow an additional 10 percent next year, its sales would be just under $3 billion in 2011. Apply today’s 24 percent earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization margin, pop it on a multiple of 10 times — a small discount to its rival LVMH — and deduct $600 million of net debt, and the equity could be worth $6.5 billion. The question is whether Prada is ready to mix with the masses. Its borrowings are barely bigger than one year’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, but it lacks financial discipline. And while shareholders in Hong Kong are used to big founder-shareholders, Prada’s management quirks might be too much. The chief executive, Patrizio Bertelli, and his wife, the designer Miuccia Prada, hold 95 percent of the shares. Unlike rivals like LVMH, Versace and the Gucci Group, there is no clear divide between creative and financial management. This can make for inspired risk-taking — or wasteful indulgence. Being the first western luxury label to float in Hong Kong might appeal to Mr. Bertelli. The likes of Ferragamo, Armani and Versace may well follow. But for a company like Prada, the idea may be a bit too edgy for comfort.</text></article>

Mr. Hitchens named National Oilwell Varco and Saipem as potential acquirers of Wellstream, which makes flexible pipes used by oil companies in deep water, a product for which there is expected to be growing demand as oil companies increasingly move to deeper water to search for oil and gas.

The F.C.C. on Monday sent letters to Comcast and NBC Universal asking questions about both companies’ businesses. Among other things, regulators are seeking details about Comcast’s distribution agreements for several popular cable channels that it already owns, including regional sports networks, E! Entertainment, Versus and the Golf Channel. The F.C.C. also wants details about Comcast’s current channel lineups and about the thinking behind Comcast’s decisions on which programming to carry. From NBC Universal, the F.C.C. is asking for details about existing agreements with a number of cable, satellite and phone companies to carry popular NBC Universal channels, including Oxygen and local NBC and Telemundo stations. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, is seeking F.C.C. and Justice Department approval to acquire a 51 percent interest in NBC Universal from General Electric. The combination has raised worries among satellite companies, rival cable operators and other subscription video providers that Comcast would use its control of NBC Universal to push up prices for programming or even withhold it altogether.

    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/opinion/02sat3.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">G.E.’s Latest Maneuver<date>Published: October 1, 2010</date><text>After decades of legal maneuvering, the General Electric Company finally agreed in 2006 to clean up the industrial pollutants it dumped in the Hudson River from the 1940s to the ’70s. The consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency required the company to dredge the river free of toxic sediment. The first phase of the two-phase project ended last fall. The second is supposed to start next year after a period of study to fix whatever complications arose in Phase 1. G.E. has now asked the E.P.A. to give it another year in which to decide whether to proceed with Phase 2. If G.E. decides not to, the E.P.A. could still order the company to act or find some other way to get the job done, while holding the company liable for dredging costs plus triple that cost in damages. G.E. claims that Phase 1 stirred up too much contaminated silt and that it needs time and data to figure out what to do about that. Its chairman, Jeffrey Immelt, recently met with the E.P.A. administrator, Lisa Jackson, to make the case. New York’s environmental agency has found that “resuspension” of toxic sediments during Phase 1 did not significantly raise levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, in fish and river water. Its commissioner, Pete Grannis, has implored the E.P.A. not to allow any more maneuvering by G.E. The company will have to clean up its mess one way or another, so what advantage is there in another delay? Maybe it thinks that with time it can assemble more evidence favoring its preferred solution of letting the PCBs lie. Or it may be awaiting a bolt of political lightning — a Congress willing to overrule the E.P.A., perhaps? Unless the river is cleaned up, the PCBs will contaminate fish and water for years to come. This complex effort can be improved as necessary. But it must proceed. The Obama administration cannot let G.E. block the best hope for a clean river in our lifetime.</text></article>

But airline pilots in the United States often must still rely on antiquated ground-based radio and radar equipment to land at airports.So when American Airlines Flight 1916 followed a satellite-based approach to Bradley International Airport near Hartford on Thursday afternoon, it was a momentous occasion, at least according to the pilot. “This is really good stuff,” Capt. Brian Will told a small group gathered at the terminal to celebrate the flight, which originated in Dallas. Before departing, Captain Will was so excited about flying the approach, he briefed his passengers on the technology even while doubting they would understand it. “It’s a little bit like trying to explain a painting by saying, ‘Close your eyes and picture this,’ ” he said. But Captain Will need not have worried about Caitlin Hardee, a passenger from Seattle. Ms. Hardee understood the technology just fine. “It seems up until now they’ve had to route the flights along the ground in the track of physical stations, and now they’re using GPS with satellites,” she explained, while wondering why “they weren’t doing it sooner.” That gets to the heart of the matter. Airliners have been able to plan and execute GPS approach routes for about 15 years. Since 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration has authorized satellite-based approaches — called R.N.P., or required navigation performance — at more than 100 airports under its plan to modernize United States airspace by 2025. The fact that the American air traffic infrastructure is so well established is one reason progress is slow. “We’re in transition from ground-based to aircraft-based systems,” said Steve Fulton, an executive with the aviation navigation company Naverus. “You have to continue to operate the airspace while you’re improving it, while you are upgrading it,” Mr. Fulton said. “We don’t have the luxury of flipping a switch overnight and all of a sudden we’ve got a new one.” But airline officials say progress has been too slow. American, Southwest, Alaska Airlines and others have trained their pilots to fly R.N.P. procedures, and about 80 percent of United States airliners have the equipment to do so, the F.A.A. says. Still, the approaches are in use at only a small fraction of American airports. Their use abroad varies from country to country. Because R.N.P. landings are so precise, they are considered safer, and because they can cut miles from the approach route, they are more economical, too. The users “are demanding these procedures because it saves them money,” said Dale Wright, director of safety and technology at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Four years ago, Naverus, which has been setting up satellite-based systems for airlines and airports worldwide, offered to create an R.N.P. approach at Bradley Airport and give it to the F.A.A. for use by any airline that wanted it. It was a two-track plan to demonstrate the company’s skill at air navigation while navigating a federal bureaucracy in pursuit of more business. “We would talk to people at the top of the F.A.A., and they were completely 100 percent on board with what we need to do,” Mr. Fulton said. “But they had to communicate that to a complex bureaucracy so everyone had the same vision.” Mr. Fulton’s expertise with the technology is undisputed. As a pilot at Alaska Airlines in 1994, he helped create the first R.N.P. routes, then formed Naverus, which GE Aviation bought last year. Airlines and aviation authorities in Australia, China and Canada have used Naverus to install air traffic systems. Mr. Fulton says he hopes to win that kind of business from the F.A.A. “There’s a real skill to designing these procedures and routes, and Naverus is a real subject matter expert by a really good margin,” said John Gadzinski, an airline pilot and aviation safety consultant. Whether the Bradley Airport gamble will pay off with an F.A.A. contract to do more approaches is unclear. But after four years of planning, and an evening in the American Airlines simulator practicing the approach the night before the flight, Captain Will could not set the Boeing 737 down on Runway 15 as planned. Tail winds of 20 miles an hour required that he land from a different direction. He dismissed the last-minute change with a shrug. “From flying a very scripted GPS high-navigation-accuracy approach to this runway, we turned around and I hand-flew,” he said. “There was no magic, no computers, me hand-flying and looking out the window to fly the other way.” It could have been an allegory for the flip side of technology. “There’s always going to be things like weather,” Mr. Gadzinski said. “You get big thunderstorms and you’re back to Square 1.”</text></article>

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/nyregion/17hudson.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Scientists Urges Changes in Cleanup of Hudson River<date>Published: August 16, 2010</date><text>A cleanup of toxic chemicals in the Hudson River has failed to consistently meet performance standards and needs to undergo “substantive changes” in its next phase, a panel of independent scientists said in a draft report released on Monday. The panel, convened by the Environmental Protection Agency, also recommended that the second phase, scheduled to start in May 2011 and to last five years, be allowed to be extended to provide more flexibility. Officials with the E.P.A., which is overseeing the dredging by the General Electric Company under the Superfund program, estimate that the project may take 7 to 10 years, rather than the 6 years originally anticipated. The first phase ran from May to November of 2009 and turned up more contamination than expected in the dredging area, in the upper Hudson River, north of Albany. Two factories owned by General Electric discharged PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, into the river for three decades before the toxic chemicals were banned in 1977 as a threat to people and wildlife. The panel’s draft report evaluated the operation’s success in meeting engineering performance standards set by the E.P.A., like the efficiency of the dredging in removing PCBs, the amount of PCBs released into the water by the dredging itself and the levels of contamination remaining in cleaned-up areas. The panel suggested adjustments, having rejected some proposed changes by both the federal agency and G.E. One recommendation meant to reduce the amount of PCBs released in the dredging calls for better data about how deep the contaminants are in any given area so that they can be removed in the first dredge pass, rather than requiring repeated passes. Officials with both G.E. and the E.P.A. said they agreed that changes were in order. “The reviewers set forth a long list of data collection and analysis work that needs to be done to improve this project, and we’re prepared to do it,” said Mark Behan, a spokesman for G.E. The E.P.A. expects to make a final decision by October on how the next phase of the cleanup will proceed. Walter Mugdan, the director of the agency’s Superfund program, said the experts’ recommendations were not expected to delay the resumption of dredging next spring. But he said the cleanup might take up to 10 years because of the complexity of the project, one of the largest environmental dredging operations ever attempted. The E.P.A. has designated nearly 200 miles of the river as a contaminated Superfund site. “What we’re pleased about is that the peer review panel agrees that this project can go forward in a successful way,” he said. “It’s a very big, complicated project, and everybody knew going into this process that we needed to make some adjustments.” Some environmental groups that had pressed for a cleanup for years and were monitoring it said the project should be as thorough as possible and continue for as long as is needed. “Actually going out there and doing the work, whatever the imperfections, has shown that a cleanup can be done, and it has pointed the way to what the necessary improvements are,” said Larry Levine, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Fund. “If it takes longer, so be it.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/health/01radiation.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">After Stroke Scans, Patients Face Serious Health Risks<date>Published: July 31, 2010</date><text>When Alain Reyes’s hair suddenly fell out in a freakish band circling his head, he was not the only one worried about his health. His co-workers at a shipping company avoided him, and his boss sent him home, fearing he had a contagious disease.Only later would Mr. Reyes learn what had caused him so much physical and emotional grief: he had received a radiation overdose during a test for a stroke at a hospital in Glendale, Calif. Other patients getting the procedure, called a CT brain perfusion scan, were being overdosed, too — 37 of them just up the freeway at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, 269 more at the renowned Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and dozens more at a hospital in Huntsville, Ala. The overdoses, which began to emerge late last summer, set off an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration into why patients tested with this complex yet lightly regulated technology were bombarded with excessive radiation. After 10 months, the agency has yet to provide a final report on what it found. But an examination by The New York Times has found that radiation overdoses were larger and more widespread than previously known, that patients have reported symptoms considerably more serious than losing their hair, and that experts say they may face long-term risks of cancer and brain damage. The review also offers insight into the way many of the overdoses occurred. While in some cases technicians did not know how to properly administer the test, interviews with hospital officials and a review of public records raise new questions about the role of manufacturers, including how well they design their software and equipment and train those who use them. The Times found the biggest overdoses at Huntsville Hospital — up to 13 times the amount of radiation generally used in the test. Officials there said they intentionally used high levels of radiation to get clearer images, according to an inquiry by the company that supplied the scanners, GE Healthcare. Experts say that is unjustified and potentially dangerous. “It is absolutely shocking and mind-boggling that this facility would say the doses are acceptable,” said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiology professor who has testified before Congress about the need for more controls over CT scans. Yet because the hospital said no mistakes were made, regulatory agencies did not investigate. The F.D.A. was unaware of the magnitude of those overdoses until The Times brought them to the agency’s attention. Now, the agency is considering extending its investigation, according to Dr. Alberto Gutierrez, an F.D.A. official who oversees diagnostic devices. Patients who received overdoses in Huntsville say that in addition to hair loss, they experienced headaches, memory loss and confusion. But at such high doses, experts say, patients are also at higher risk of brain damage and cancer. A spokesman for Huntsville Hospital, which now acknowledges that some patients received “elevated” radiation, said officials there would not comment. Growing Number of Cases So far, the number of patients nationwide who got higher-than-expected radiation doses exceeds 400 at eight hospitals, six in California alone, according to figures supplied by hospitals, regulators and lawyers representing overdosed patients. A health official in California who played a leading role in uncovering the cases predicts that many more will be found as states intensify their search. “I cannot believe that this is not occurring in the rest of the country,” said Kathleen Kaufman, head of radiation management for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. “That’s why we are so keen on the rest of the states to go look at this.” The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges, too, that the number does not capture all the overdoses. The cases come at a time when Americans are receiving more medical radiation than ever before, a result of rapid technological advancements that improve diagnosis but can also do harm when safeguards and oversight fail to keep pace. Even when done properly, CT brain perfusion scans deliver a large dose of radiation — the equivalent of about 200 X-rays of the skull. But there are no hard standards for how much radiation is too much. The overdoses highlight how little some in the medical profession understand about the operation of these scanning devices and the nature of radiation injuries, as well as the loose requirements for reporting accidents when they are detected. For a year or more, doctors and hospitals failed to detect the overdoses even though patients continued to report distinctive patterns of hair loss that matched where they had been radiated. After the Food and Drug Administration issued a nationwide alert asking hospitals to check their radiation output on these tests, a few hospitals continued to overdose patients for weeks and in some cases months afterward, according to records and interviews.</text></article>

Revenue Falls Short of Forecasts, Despite Strength in Finance and Health<date>Published: July 17, 2010</date><text>General Electric reported on Friday that its second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, but revenue fell below analysts' expectations and, with the stock market in a broad decline, G.E.'s shares fell 4.59 percent. Analysts said that although earnings were positive, particularly in its finance and health care segments, improvement was still needed in its power generation and aviation businesses. ''Airlines postponing maintenance is significant,'' said Scott R. Davis of Morgan Stanley. ''Eventually you have to maintain a plane, but airlines are not spending cash and that's hurting G.E.'' Mr. Davis said his greatest disappointment in G.E. this quarter was that orders for equipment were not significantly greater than shipments. G.E. said demand for its industrial equipment was stronger, but aviation equipment and service orders were down. Total service orders, which tend to produce higher marginal revenue, decreased 1 percent. ''Airlines are still cautious about spending and pushing back as much maintenance work as they can,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Aviation equipment orders decreased 8 percent, the only category of five to fall, while aviation service orders decreased 5 percent. General Electric reported second-quarter net income of $3.03 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with $2.61 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Earnings per share for continuing operations were 30 cents. Revenue, however, declined 4 percent, to $37.44 billion, from $39.11 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 27 cents a share on revenue of $38.4 billion. Shares of G.E. fell 70 cents, to $14.55 on Friday. The chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in a statement that business was improving. ''Losses and impairments declined $0.5 billion from the prior quarter, with consumer losses down $0.4 billion and real estate losses in line with our expectations,'' Mr. Immelt said in the statement. ''We have strengthened the franchise over the past year and GE Capital's earnings recovery should continue.'' G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., is often considered the largest proxy for industrial America. ''If the overall global recovery takes place, you can argue G.E. will be the largest beneficiary,'' said Mr. Davis. ''Not only does it have a large subset of manufacturing businesses, but it has a large finance subsidiary.'' GE Capital profit increased 93 percent and the company said its earnings recovery should continue, though revenue from GE Capital Services decreased 2 percent, to $13.1 billion. ''Commercial real estate business remained the one tough area of GE Capital as expected,'' Keith S. Sherin, chief financial officer, said during a conference call. The real estate segment lost $524 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $237 million a year ago. The company did not have an update on the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast, which was announced in December. Mr. Sherin said G.E. had no news while the merger was being reviewed by federal regulators. ''I hate to predict when it's going to close just because we don't control it,'' Mr. Sherin said regarding the deal. The European Union approved the transaction on Wednesday. Total orders and equipment orders increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, with the latter increasing 17 percent in the quarter. ''This is significant because growth in G.E.'s heavy-equipment businesses tends to lag growth in the overall economy,'' Mr. Tortoriello said. ''Thus this data gives us an indicator that economic growth is on track.'' Mr. Davis had estimated the increase in equipment orders to be more than 10 percent, in part because of a $1 billion order from Iraq for 25 gas turbine units, but also because of greater activity from hospitals. ''The recovery in health care equipment has come a lot faster than expected,'' Mr. Davis said. ''A lot of businesses held off until President Obama's health care bill passed.''

Until now, the only definitive way to diagnose Alzheimer's has been to search for plaque with a brain autopsy after the patient dies. Scientists hope the new scanning technique, described June 24 in The New York Times's series ''The Vanishing Mind,'' will allow doctors to see plaque while the patient is still alive, improving diagnosis and aiding research on drugs to slow or stop plaque accumulation. Neurologists have known about plaques ever since Alzheimer's disease was first described in 1906. They are microscopic bumps made up of a protein, amyloid beta, appearing on the surface of the brain in areas involved with learning and memory. They are so characteristic of Alzheimer's that they are required for a definitive diagnosis of the disease. Of course, doctors do not wait for a brain autopsy to diagnose Alzheimer's. They use memory tests and evaluations of patients' reasoning and ability to care for themselves. Yet with autopsy, even doctors at leading medical centers have been wrong as often as 20 percent of the time: people they said had Alzheimer's did not have plaque. The scans were developed by a Philadelphia company, Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, and, independently, by Bayer and General Electric. They use a radioactive dye that attaches to plaque in the brain, allowing it to be seen with a PET scan. Although the scans looked promising, the companies needed to show that what they revealed was the same as what a pathologist would see on autopsy. That was what Avid demonstrated with its study, presented Sunday by its medical director, Dr. Christopher M. Clark. Dr. P. Murali Doraiswami, a biological psychiatrist at Duke who had helped recruit patients for the study, called the results among '' the most highly anticipated data from the entire meeting.'' To compare the scans with autopsy results, the company scanned the brains of 35 people in hospices who were expected to die within six months. Some had Alzheimer's and others did not. After the patients died, their brains were shipped to Phoenix, where a pathologist sliced them into about 100 tiny pieces and sent them off for analysis of plaque. Pathologists in Montreal analyzed the brain slices with a computer that counted plaques. Independently, pathologists in Chicago analyzed them the traditional way -- by looking at the brain slices under a microscope and manually counting the microscopic plaques. Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, radiologists examined the scans and calculated how much plaque was present in the patients' brains and, independently, used a computer to analyze the amount of plaque in the scans. Neither the radiologists nor the pathologists knew whether the patients had dementia. In 34 of the 35 patients, the PET scan, the pathologists' report and the computerized pathology report agreed. In one patient who had Alzheimer's, the pathologist and the radiologist analyzing the scan did not see much plaque, but the computerized analysis of the scan and the two autopsy reports did. And the data showed that the scans were completely accurate in ruling out Alzheimer's pathology: unlike doctors, they never said people had Alzheimer's pathology when they did not. In addition, the company scanned the brains of 76 younger people who would not be expected to have plaque in their brains. None did. ''That was very reassuring,'' said Dr. Michael W. Weiner, an Alzheimer's expert at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Reisa A. Sperling, an Alzheimer's expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and co-chairwoman of the session where the results were presented, said, ''Personally, I found the data quite convincing.'' Dr. Sperling, an investigator on a different AVID study but who is not paid by the company, said the challenge now will be to see whether the scans can accurately predict whether people are developing Alzheimer's before they have symptoms. That is the stage, she said, ''where we have the best chance of changing the course of the illness.''</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/energy-environment/19enrich.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Companies Bet on Market for Enriched Uranium<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Uranium enrichment, the market that the Noble Group has entered with its purchase of USEC stock, is a globalized business fraught with uncertainty.Besides rapidly changing technology and questions about how many new reactors will be built, the market can be affected by vagaries like future arms control agreements. But a lot of companies are bullish — which means plenty of competition for USEC. On Thursday a European company, Urenco, had a ceremonial ribbon-cutting in Eunice, N.M., for a second phase of an enrichment plant that it began operating there this month. The New Mexico factory is the first new uranium enrichment plant in decades in this country. When both phases are complete, the plant will cost $3 billion, and by 2014 it will have enough capacity to meet the needs of half the nuclear power reactors in the United States, according to the owners. More worrisome for USEC, the Urenco plant uses modern centrifuges. They consume only about 5 percent as much electricity, per unit of enrichment, as USEC’s plant, which uses a World War II-era technology called gaseous diffusion. Moreover, in May the Energy Department promised a $2 billion loan guarantee to another European firm, Areva, to build a centrifuge enrichment plant in southern Idaho. General Electric, meanwhile, is working on a laser system to enrich uranium, at its nuclear fuel plant in Wilmington, N.C. “Enrichment is needed, whether the United States builds another nuclear plant or not,” said Andrea Jennetta, president of International Nuclear Associates, a Washington consulting firm. China has a “hugely ambitious” reactor construction campaign and not much enrichment capability, she said, and some enrichment equipment around the world is getting old. USEC is also working on a new enrichment technology, a centrifuge system, but it is struggling. It has spent $1.5 billion on a centrifuge plant in Piketon, Ohio, where it formerly had a gaseous diffusion plant. But last July, the Energy Department turned down USEC’s application for a $2 billion loan guarantee, partly because it was not clear where all the financing would come from. USEC, though, was invited to resubmit its loan guarantee application, which the company said it would do. In May, USEC announced that two large nuclear companies, Toshiba and Babcock &amp; Wilcox, had agreed to invest $100 million each in the Piketon project, subject to certain conditions. Even as far back as 1992, when Congress passed legislation to privatize the government enrichment enterprise that is now USEC, it was clear that it would need new technology to survive. In fact, the assumption that a private company could more easily acquire that technology was a reason the government spun off USEC, which went public in 1998. At first, USEC bet heavily on a laser technology, but abandoned that in 1999. One of its continuing sources of profit has been its role in handling Russian military uranium, blended down and shipped to the United States. That has filled half the demand for reactor uranium for the last few years. But that is not a long-term survival strategy, in part because Russia itself has excess enrichment capacity. Enrichment is a crucial step in turning uranium ore into reactor fuel. In nature, uranium is about 99.3 percent uranium-238, a form that does not easily split, and about 0.7 percent uranium-235, which works well in reactors and bombs. Enrichment means raising the proportion of uranium-235. For reactors, it is usually between 3 percent and 5 percent. Some research reactors and reactors that make isotopes used in medicine run on much higher concentrations. But the United States is trying to discourage that, to reduce the amount that could potentially fall into the hands of a weapons builder. Bombs and the reactors used on aircraft carriers use uranium enriched to more than 90 percent.</text></article>

That’s up from the $2.76 million the nation’s largest cable TV company spent in the quarter a year ago but down from the fourth quarter’s $3.5 million. Comcast is seeking regulatory approval for its purchase of a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric. The deal, though opposed by consumer groups and subjected to Congressional hearings, is expected to close by year’s end because there’s little overlap of operations between Comcast and NBC. Comcast also lobbied Congress on cable ownership issues, carriage of independent programming, set-top boxes, sports programming, and others in the January to March period, according to the form filed on April 20 in the House clerk’s office.

Dean Metropoulos for about $250 million, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The newspaper said 15 other private equity firms had considered a bid for the brewer, based in Woodridge, Ill. But Mr. Metropoulos, known for buying big brands like Vlasic Pickles and Bumble Bee Tuna, will secure the deal, which is in its final stages and has financial backing from the lending arm of General Electric, according to The Journal. The company has been ordered by the Internal Revenue Service to sell itself under a federal law that bars charities from owning for-profit businesses for more than five years. The Journal said Pabst has been owned for about a decade by the Kalmanovitz Charitable Foundation, which was named for Paul Kalmanovitz, a brewing magnate who died in 1987, two years after buying Pabst. A 2005 deadline passed, so the I.R.S. granted a five-year extension that expires this year, the newspaper said.

That’s the suggestion of The New York Post, which reports that some Wall Street dealmakers are predicting that Sumner Redstone, who controls CBS, and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, may begin mulling whether to put their networks up for sale. The Post reports: Among bankers, CBS appears to be garnering the most attention amid signs Redstone these days isn’t dismissing out of hand the notion of selling CBS. “This is a good time to sell a network,” said one Wall Street exec. “Retransmission makes it look more interesting. [CBS] has assets in radio but no long-term strategy in cable.” Retransmission refers to fees for “retransmission consent,” in which cable and satellite operators pay a network a monthly per-subscriber fee to carry the channel on their systems…. Meanwhile, ABC’s future in the Mouse House is also not guaranteed, with Disney chief Bob Iger said to be taking a hard look at the network. “There are no guarantees,” Mr. Iger told The Post recently, referring to ABC’s future at Disney. The paper reported a source said that the issue was what would be done with the network’s accompanying stations. Go to Article from The New York Post »</text></article>

The privately owned ShoreBank, a community development lender on Chicago’s South Side near the home base of President Barack Obama and some of his top aides, is getting assistance from a consortium of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America, sources have said. Spokesmen for Citigroup and General Electric each confirmed $20 million investments on Tuesday, and JP Morgan previously said it was ready to inject $15 million. Another source said Goldman injected $20 million. ShoreBank, which has $2.3 billion in assets, was reported to have exceeded the $125 million in rescue capital it needed to avoid a takeover by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. A ShoreBank spokesman declined to comment on specific investments, saying only that capital-raising efforts so far had been “encouraging.” Small banks are failing at a rapid pace due to troubled real estate loan portfolios, but ShoreBank’s dedication to community development and environmental causes apparently secured its special status. “I think this is a very unique circumstance. But ShoreBank is kind of a unique institution in that regard,” said Geoff Smith, senior vice president at the Woodstock Institute, which studies lending in poor communities. “When you think of other banks, they don’t usually get bailed out in this manner,” he said. Mr. Smith and others say ShoreBank’s philanthropic reputation — it traditionally provided loans for small residential renovation projects in impoverished areas — and its Washington ties may have saved it.

Aris Kekedjian, chief executive of GE Capital Middle East and Africa, said the Islamic bond, or sukuk, would likely be a benchmark issue. In November, GE Capital became the first large American conglomerate to issue a sukuk when the company raised $500 million. Mr. Kekedjian said the firm wants to become a regular sukuk issuer over time. “We’re not a one-off issuer,” he told the news service on the sidelines of a conference in Dubai. “We don’t have any compelling need to issue sukuk, other than to be smart in this region.” Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/17/technology/17bulb.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">LED Bulbs for the Home Near the Marketplace<date>Published: May 16, 2010</date><text>The prospects of replacing today’s inefficient incandescent light bulbs with long-lasting, low-power LEDs are increasing. Two of the lighting industry’s three biggest manufacturers, Osram Sylvania and Philips, plan to sell energy-efficient LED bulbs this year that can replace a 60-watt bulb, the most commonly used incandescent lamp. The third company, General Electric, will sell an LED equivalent to a 40-watt bulb this year, but it will not have a 60-watt replacement ready until 2011. Beginning in January 2012, federal law will require that light bulbs, or lamps as the industry calls them, will need to be 30 percent more efficient than current incandescent bulbs. Standard incandescent lamps will most likely not be able to meet those requirements. LED makers hope their bulbs will. Compact fluorescents have been unpopular with consumers, and LED bulbs have been too dim. But Osram’s Ultra bulb, available in August, and Philips’s EnduraLED, which will be in stores in the fourth quarter, will use just 12 watts of power to equal the light output of a 60-watt bulb. “The 60-watt lamp is the most-sold bulb in America,” said James R. Brodrick, the manager for solid-state lighting at the Energy Department. “These new bulbs should give consumers something to think about.” The LED bulbs use 20 percent of the power of a current incandescent bulb and last up to 25,000 hours, compared with 2,000 hours for a standard bulb and 8,000 for a compact fluorescent. That’s 17 years if the bulb is on four hours a day. The companies say that, unlike compact fluorescents, these new LED lights completely mimic standard bulbs. They are dimmable, create light in all directions, and display virtually the same warmth and range of colors as incandescent bulbs. And most important, they work. “In our research, we mixed up these new LED lamps with regular bulbs, and when asked which was which, most selected the wrong lamps,” said Guido van Tartwijk, a Philips group manager. Unlike earlier versions, the new LED lamps look more like common light bulbs. The first products were heavy, with other-worldly metal fins attached to dissipate heat. Makers have now shrunk the fins and better incorporated them into the design. The major players are eager to begin selling the replacement lights, so people do not sour on LED lamps the way they did when poorly made compact fluorescents were first sold. Early compact fluorescents were plagued with harsh white light and short life. Those bulbs also contain tiny amounts of mercury. “Some early LED lamps have performed so poorly we’ve removed them from the market,” Mr. Brodrick said. This October, G.E. will introduce Energy Smart, its 40-watt LED equivalent that uses 9 watts of power; a 60-watt equivalent will be announced in a few months. “We decided to come out with a 40-watt lamp first so that we can meet Energy Star specifications,” said Steven J. Briggs, a vice president for marketing at GE Lighting. “We want to make best-in-class products.” With the major players about to enter the LED market with products aimed at consumers, the big question shifts from quality to price. GE expects its 40-watt equivalent to cost $40 to $50, while both Osram Sylvania and Philips think initial retail prices could be about $60. A lesser-known maker based in Satellite Beach, Fla., the Lighting Science Group, has said that its new 60-watt equivalent, Definity LED, will also be available later this year and cost around $30. All three major companies say they are working with regional utilities to offer rebates that could lower the price to something that could immediately be affordable. “By 2012 or 2013, we’ll get the price down to around $20,” said Mr. van Tartwijk of Philips.</text></article>

Join the discussion. More Arts News Mr. O’Brien granted the interview to the CBS correspondent Steve Kroft under the provision that it could not be broadcast until after May 1, because in his departure agreement with NBC he was prohibited from appearing on television or any other form of media until after that date. In the interview, Mr. Kroft presses Mr. O’Brien about his view of Mr. Leno’s move to return to late-night television, and while he says he cannot get inside Mr. Leno’s head, Mr. O’Brien does implicitly criticize his former NBC colleague for reversing his previous position that he was giving up the “Tonight Show." “If I had surrendered ’The Tonight Show’ and handed it over to somebody publicly and wished them well,” Mr., O’Brien says, referring to Mr. Leno’s on-the-air hand-off of the show to Mr. O’Brien last May, “and then... six months later. ...” Mr. O’Brien adds, referring to Mr. Leno’s willingness to return to the show. “But that’s me, you know,” Mr. O’Brien says.“Everyone’s got their own, you know, way of doing things.” Despite the evident disappointment of having to walk away from the “Tonight Show," Mr. O’Brien said that no one should feel sorry for him. "I’m fine; I’m doing great," he tells Mr. Kroft. Nor does he regret any of the moves or decisions he made. "No, I don’t regret anything," Mr. O’Brien says, "not one decision I made." At times Mr. O’Brien seems to hold back in the interview, particularly when he comments on NBC and Mr. Leno, acknowledging that he signed an agreement that he not disparage either Mr. Leno or network executives. When asked if he believes that Mr. Leno may have lobbied to regain the show, Mr. O’Brien says simply, "I don’t know," but he adds, "We’re all adults. We don’t take orders from the government." More tellingly, he says of Mr. Leno’s decision to come back to the show: “He went and took that show back and I think in a similar situation, if roles had been reversed, I know-- I know me, I wouldn’t have done that,” Mr. O’Brien says. Later in the interview, he notes, “I sleep well at night.” When Mr. Kroft suggests that he "got screwed," Mr. O’Brien says, "No, I didn’t. I’m fine. It just didn’t work out." But when Mr. Kroft points out that Mr. Leno has said both comics got screwed by NBC’s maneuverings, Mr. O’Brien asks, "How did he get screwed?" and notes that Mr. Leno wound up back on "The Tonight Show." Did that mean he believes Mr. Leno did something less than honorable? Mr. O’Brien hesitates and then says, "I can’t answer that." That non-answer seems to be rooted in the non-disparagement agreement, as Mr. Kroft notes. Jokingly, Mr. O’Brien tells him he has to be aware of that agreement and indeed, "I have one in my wallet." Neither Mr. Leno, nor the NBC chief executive, Jeff Zucker, has called him since the upheaval, Mr. O’Brien says. Not that he is surprised, he adds, because he would not expect them to sit around and "sing old Irish fight songs -- I don’t think they know any." But he does try to counter one point NBC has made since his departure: that his “Tonight Show" was in line to lose money. Not only does he not believe that, Mr. O’Brien states, "It’s really not possible.” Money was a major factor in the decision to oust him from the 11:35 p.m. time slot, Mr. O’Brien says, because Mr. Leno’s deal would have taken an enormous payout to resolve, perhaps as much as $150 million -- more than three times what NBC eventually had to pay Mr. O’Brien. So, he says, it should not be surprising that NBC’s corporate bosses at General Electric decided which host would "go away." And he argues that he was "absolutely not" given a fair chance to make the show work, comparing the seven months he had as host to the 18 months it took Mr. Leno before he took over the top spot in the late-night ratings battle against David Letterman. But Mr. O’Brien emphasizes that “life is too short” to dwell much on what occurred at NBC. For one thing, he says, he is thrilled to be back in front of audiences doing his live stage show around the country. And he says he is pleased that he has made a deal to return to television on the cable channel TBS next fall. But Mr. O’Brien also says it is too early to tell if his career has been damaged by the events of the past year. However, citing his Irish Catholic upbringing, Mr. O’Brien tells Mr. Kroft, "I believe things happen for a reason."

Cut Price to Build F-35 Engines<date>Published: April 28, 2010</date><text>Fighting to save a significant contract, General Electric and Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that they had once again cut their prices in an offer to build alternate engines for the Pentagon's Joint Strike Fighter. The companies said they would build up to 150 engines at fixed prices, saving the government as much as $1 billion if a rival, Pratt &amp; Whitney, matched the price. The defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, has said the Pentagon cannot afford to finish building the G.E. and Rolls-Royce engine. He has said he would recommend that President Obama veto any legislation that finances it. Congress has repeatedly blocked efforts to cancel the second engine over the last four years, and executives from G.E. and Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that were trying to provide more ammunition to counter some of the Pentagon's concerns. Congress ordered the development of the alternate engine years ago to keep from giving Pratt &amp; Whitney, a United Technologies unit that has the main contract, a monopoly. The Joint Strike Fighter, a stealth aircraft that is also called the F-35, is the Pentagon's largest program. The engines could account for $100 billion of the $328 billion that the Pentagon expects to spend for 2,400 of the planes, which will be used by the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines. G.E., Rolls-Royce and their supporters in Congress say that creating competition for the engine contracts could save up to $20 billion over the next 30 years and provide insurance against any problems with Pratt &amp; Whitney's version. David Joyce, the president and chief executive of G.E. Aviation, along with other company officials, said their offer meshed with the Obama administration's efforts to shift more of the risks of cost overruns to contractors. But Mr. Gates and other officials have said that the cost of finishing the second engine could amount to wasteful duplication. Pentagon officials recently estimated that it would cost $2.9 billion over the next six years to finish developing the G.E. and Rolls-Royce engine and create the tooling to produce it. Officials from both companies said on Tuesday that they believed they could complete the work for $1.8 billion. The companies said they were willing to expand a fixed-price offer that they made last fall. Under the new offer, G.E. and Rolls-Royce, which is based in Britain, would provide a fixed-price for any engines the Pentagon bought in fiscal 2012, followed by a lower fixed-price in 2013 and 2014. They estimated this would provide up to $1 billion in savings over previous projections if Pratt &amp; Whitney matched their prices. But Pentagon officials said on Tuesday that they were not swayed by the latest offer. Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, said that Mr. Gates ''does not believe the J.S.F. needs an extra engine. Period.'' Pratt &amp; Whitney also offered last fall to build its engines under fixed-price contracts, and it said in a statement on Tuesday that the latest offer from G.E. and Rolls-Royce was ''simply a distraction.''</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/business/17electric.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Income Falls, but G.E. Tops Forecasts<date>Published: April 16, 2010</date><text>General Electric, reassured by signs that a global recovery was gaining momentum, said on Friday that its profit for the year might exceed expectations.“We feel pretty good about where we’re positioned as the recovery continues,” the chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, told investors in a conference call about first-quarter results. He said G.E. might undertake additional cost-cutting as it refocused the business on its industrial components, which include production of items like wind turbines and jet engines. G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., said it was encouraged by indications that the tide of loan losses at its financial unit, GE Capital, was beginning to reverse. Credit card delinquencies have fallen, the company said, and losses on mortgages in Britain are easing. In total, the company reported net income of $1.9 billion in the first quarter — a 32 percent decrease from the quarter a year before — and earnings of 21 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected income of $1.8 billion and earnings of 16 cents a share. Revenue declined 5 percent, to $36.6 billion, slightly worse than expected. Earnings from continuing operations were $2.3 billion, down 18 percent from a year ago. G.E.’s results helped calm jitters about many segments of the economy, since the company has a hand in a variety of enterprises, including network television and health care. Analysts were particularly optimistic about the results for GE Capital, which Mr. Immelt said was showing “solid signs of stabilization” and had “turned the corner.” The unit eked out a profit of $607 million, 41 percent lower than a year ago, and revenue fell 9 percent, to $13.2 billion. That steep decline was partly because the unit received a smaller tax benefit this year. G.E. says it expects loan losses to continue to dwindle. But while GE Capital has been profitable, a foundering commercial real estate market continues to take a toll on its finances. To shield itself against further losses, the unit is gradually reducing its portfolio and tightening lending standards. Mr. Immelt said G.E. saw indications that the broader economy was strengthening, including increases in airline passenger traffic and a busier market for advertising. The company says it expects orders for new equipment to improve as businesses, particularly in emerging markets, regain confidence. Those factors could allow the company to end 2010 with an increase in overall profit. “A lot of their optimism is driven by the improvement in the credit markets and a general sense of economic improvement,” said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor’s. “But we also have to keep in mind that earnings were cut by more than half over the past two years, so it’s going to take a while for them to get back to where they were.” At the moment, Wall Street analysts expect G.E.’s profit for 2010 as a whole to fall slightly, hitting $10.9 billion, compared with $11.2 billion in 2009. The company had previously predicted profit to remain flat for the year. G.E.’s stock tumbled on Friday, declining 2.7 percent to close at $18.97 a share, mostly because of broader concern about the ramifications of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs. G.E. revealed on Friday that it was cooperating in a separate matter with the S.E.C. involving statements made by Mr. Immelt in September 2008, when he reassured investors about the company’s ability to finance its debt. In a recent book, however, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, suggested that Mr. Immelt had privately expressed doubts about G.E.’s ability to refinance debt in the commercial paper market. “We are fully cooperating with them and are entirely confident our disclosures were accurate,” a spokeswoman for the company, Anne Eisele, said by e-mail. On the industrial side, G.E. has found strength in its service industry, with businesses still reluctant to replace old equipment. Orders for new equipment have steadily declined and demand for big-ticket items like jet engines has dwindled with the decline of the airline industry. Industrial sales were $23.5 billion in the first quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago. But there are signs that production may be poised to pick up: backlogs for equipment orders have improved, holding steady at $174 billion in the first quarter, raising the possibility of stronger revenue later this year. The energy infrastructure unit was the only segment to show strong earnings growth, rising 12 percent. The company noted particular strength in oil and gas products, including gas turbines and oilfield equipment. Profit on health care products, like ultrasound equipment, rose modestly compared with a year ago. Earnings at NBC Universal dropped 49 percent in the quarter, after the company lost more than $200 million on Olympics coverage. But the company said advertising in local markets was strengthening. Mr. Immelt has sought to scale back the financial business, which is a major source of revenue, and return G.E. to its industrial roots. Analysts say G.E. has diversified so much that it has been difficult to draft a unified plan to deal with the recession. “The general strategy is to slim down the financial side of the business and focus on doing things where G.E. has a competitive advantage,” Mr. Tortoriello said. “We’re looking for broad-based improvement this year, but much of that will depend on the strength of the recovery.”</text></article>

But this time, it would be an entirely different role: supplying the technology, equipment and engineers to build high-speed rail lines.The Chinese government has signed cooperation agreements with the State of California and General Electric to help build such lines. The agreements, both of which are preliminary, show China’s desire to become a big exporter and licensor of bullet trains traveling 215 miles an hour, an environmentally friendly technology in which China has raced past the United States in the last few years. “We are the most advanced in many fields, and we are willing to share with the United States,” Zheng Jian, the chief planner and director of high-speed rail at China’s railway ministry, said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California has closely followed progress in the discussions with China and hopes to come here later this year for talks with rail ministry officials, said David Crane, the governor’s special adviser for jobs and economic growth, and a board member of the California High Speed Rail Authority. China is offering not just to build a railroad in California but also to help finance its construction, and Chinese officials have already been shuttling between Beijing and Sacramento to make presentations, Mr. Crane said in a telephone interview. China is not the only country interested in selling high-speed rail equipment to the United States. Japan, Germany, South Korea, Spain, France and Italy have also approached California’s High Speed Rail Authority. The agency has made no decisions on whose technology to choose. But Mr. Crane said that there were no apparent weaknesses in the Chinese offer, and that Governor Schwarzenegger particularly wanted to visit China this year for high-speed rail discussions. Even if an agreement is reached for China to build and help bankroll a high-speed rail system in California, considerable obstacles would remain. China’s rail ministry would face independent labor unions and democratically elected politicians, neither of which it has to deal with at home. The United States also has labor and immigration laws stricter than those in China. In a nearly two-hour interview at the rail ministry’s monolithic headquarters here, Mr. Zheng said repeatedly that any Chinese bid would comply with all American laws and regulations. China’s rail ministry has an international reputation for speed and low costs, and is opening 1,200 miles of high-speed rail routes this year alone. China is moving rapidly to connect almost all of its own provincial capitals with bullet trains. But while the ministry has brought costs down through enormous economies of scale, “buy American” pressures could make it hard for China to export the necessary equipment to the United States. The railways ministry has concluded a framework agreement to license its technology to G.E., which is a world leader in diesel locomotives but has little experience with the electric locomotives needed for high speeds. According to G.E., the agreement calls for at least 80 percent of the components of any locomotives and system control gear to come from American suppliers, and labor-intensive final assembly would be done in the United States for the American market. China would license its technology and supply engineers as well as up to 20 percent of the components. State-owned Chinese equipment manufacturers initially licensed many of their designs over the last decade from Japan, Germany and France. While Chinese companies have gone on to make many changes and innovations, Japanese executives in particular have grumbled that Chinese technology resembles theirs, raising the possibility of legal challenges if any patents have been violated. All of the technology would be Chinese, Mr. Zheng said. China has already begun building high-speed rail routes in Turkey, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It is looking for opportunities in seven other countries, notably a route sought by the Brazilian government between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, Mr. Zheng said. International rail experts say that China has mastered the art of building high-speed rail lines quickly and inexpensively. “These guys are engineering driven — they know how to build fast, build cheaply and do a good job,” said John Scales, the lead transport specialist in the Beijing office of the World Bank. The California rail authority plans to spend $43 billion to build a 465-mile route from San Francisco to Los Angeles and on to Anaheim that is supposed to open in 2020. The authority was awarded $2.25 billion in January in federal economic stimulus money to work on the project. The authority’s plans call for $10 billion to $12 billion in private financing. Mr. Crane said China could provide much of that, with federal, state and local jurisdictions providing the rest. Mr. Zheng declined to discuss financial details. China’s mostly state-controlled banks had few losses during the global financial crisis and are awash with cash now because of tight regulation and a fast-growing economy. The Chinese government is also becoming disenchanted with bonds and looking to diversify its $2.4 trillion in foreign reserves by investing in areas like natural resources and overseas rail projects. “They’ve got a lot of capital, and they’re willing to provide a lot of capital” for a California high-speed rail system, Mr. Crane said. Later plans call for the California line to be extended to Sacramento and San Diego, while a private consortium hopes to build a separate route from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Toyota is shutting a big assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., that it once operated as a joint venture with General Motors, and one idea under discussion is converting the factory to the assembly of high-speed rail equipment, said Mr. Crane, who is also a member of the state’s Economic Development Commission. Rail parts from China would then come through the nearby port of Oakland, in place of auto parts from Japan. “High-speed rail requires a lot of high technology — we would send many high-end engineers and high-end technicians” to California, Mr. Zheng said. G.E. estimates that the United States will spend $13 billion in the next five years on high-speed rail routes. China, with a much more ambitious infrastructure program, will spend $300 billion in the next three years on overall expansion of its rail routes, mainly high-speed routes, according to G.E. China’s long-term vision calls for high-speed rail routes linking Shanghai to Singapore and New Delhi by way of Myanmar, and someday connecting Beijing and Shanghai to Moscow to the northwest and through Tehran to Prague and Berlin, according to a map that Mr. Zheng keeps on a bookshelf behind his desk. He cautioned that there were no plans to start construction yet outside China. A high-speed rail link for passengers from Beijing to Shanghai will be finished by the end of 2011 or early 2012, and cut the journey to four hours, from 10 hours now, Mr. Zheng said. New York to Atlanta or Chicago is a similar distance, and takes 18 to 19 hours on Amtrak, which must share tracks with 12,000-ton freight trains and many commuter trains. For the American market, Mr. Zheng said, “we can provide whatever services are needed.”</text></article>

Now they just need a way to spend it — and that may include some deal-making.The top 50 holders of cash in corporate America have nearly $473 billion in cash on their books, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Among these are seasoned deal-makers like Berkshire Hathaway, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle. Take, for instance, the Simon Property Group, which added to its reserves over the last year to prepare for acquisitions. In February, the mall operator announced a $10 billion unsolicited takeover bid for General Growth Properties, most of it backed by cash. As companies exercised caution during the financial crisis, many began socking away cash to help them weather the market turmoil. But bankers argue that having too much cash on hand is wasteful because companies could put it to better use. To spend cash, companies have several options, including capital expenditures, research and development and share buybacks. But if companies are looking to bolster their growth significantly, mergers are one of the quickest ways to do so. As the markets recover, the percentage of deals that include a stock component will inevitably rise. So far this year, about 17 percent of worldwide merger activity has consisted of cash-only deals, down slightly from 18.3 percent for the same period last year, according to Thomson Reuters. Even so, bankers say, it’s hard to argue with the certainty of a cash offer.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/29/health/policy/29fda.html?ref=generalelectriccompany">Scientists Say F.D.A. Ignored Radiation Warnings<date>Published: March 28, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Urgent warnings by government experts about the risks of routinely using powerful CT scans to screen patients for colon cancer were brushed aside by the Food and Drug Administration, according to agency documents and interviews with agency scientists.After staying quiet for a year, the scientists say they plan to make their concerns public at a meeting of experts on Tuesday called by the F.D.A. to discuss how to protect patients from unnecessary radiation exposures. The two-day meeting is part of a growing reassessment of the risks of routine radiology. The average lifetime dose of diagnostic radiation has increased sevenfold since 1980, driven in part by the increasing popularity of CT scans. Such scans can deliver the radiation equivalent of 400 chest X-rays. An estimated 70 million CT (for computed tomography) scans are performed in the United States every year, up from three million in the early 1980s, and as many as 14,000 people may die every year of radiation-induced cancers as a result, researchers estimate. The use of CT scans to screen healthy patients for cancer is particularly controversial. In colon cancer screening, for instance, the American College of Radiology as well as the American Cancer Society have endorsed CT scans, in a procedure often called a virtual colonoscopy, while the American College of Gastroenterology recommends direct examinations in which doctors use a camera on a flexible tube. For patients, navigating the debate can be difficult because doctors, patient advocacy groups and manufacturers often endorse positions that are in their economic self-interest. Radiologists, who often own and use CT machines, for instance, often endorse their use; while gastroenterologists, who often own and use camera scopes, often favor their own methods. Patient groups often get financing from drug and device makers, or physician-specialty groups. The Food and Drug Administration, charged with sorting out such competing claims, has been just as torn on the issue. The internal dispute has grown so heated that a group of agency scientists who are concerned about the risks of CT scans say they will testify at the Tuesday meeting that F.D.A. managers ignored or suppressed their concerns, and that the resulting delay in making these concerns public may have led hundreds of patients to be endangered needlessly. Scores of internal agency documents made available to The New York Times show that agency managers sought to approve an application by General Electric to allow the use of CT scans for colon cancer screenings over the repeated objections of agency scientists, who wanted the application rejected. It is still under review. After an agency official recommended approving G.E.’s application, Dr. Julian Nicholas, a gastroenterologist who trained at Oxford University and the Mayo Clinic and worked under contract with the agency, responded by e-mail that he felt strongly that approving the application could “expose a number of Americans to a risk of radiation that is unwarranted and may lead to instances of solid organ abdominal cancer.” Dr. Robert Smith, a former professor of radiology at both Yale and Cornell and an F.D.A. medical officer, wrote that he agreed with Dr. Nicholas because “the increased radiation exposure to the population could be substantial and would raise a serious public health/public policy issue,” documents show. Alberto Gutierrez, deputy director of the F.D.A. office with responsibility over radiological devices, said in an interview that the right course on CT colonography was far from clear. “This device that you’ve mentioned has not been cleared or approved at this time, and that should tell you that the process we go through is not done,” Dr. Gutierrez said. Arvind Gopalratnam, a spokesman for G.E. Healthcare, wrote in an e-mail message that research had shown that “CT colonography can be a very valuable, noninvasive screening tool to help diagnose colorectal cancer at early stages and ultimately improve overall survival rates.” For decades, scientists at the F.D.A. approved many radiological medical devices with minimal oversight, declaring them modest improvements over older devices and thus not needing extensive reviews or clinical trials to prove their safety and efficacy. But these devices now play a central role in American medicine, helping not only to diagnose a wide array of ailments, but also to treat cancers. And the agency has done little to assess whether the rapid proliferation of scans is in the best interests of patients, and whether the machines themselves properly protect patients or are beneficial for all of their now-routine uses. The Times ran a series of articles this year documenting the harm that can result from mistakes involving medical radiation, leading to a House subcommittee hearing last month and a chorus of calls by radiology groups, researchers, medical physicists and equipment manufacturers for stronger patient protection. Even President Obama’s recent physical examination became part of the debate when the president had a virtual, rather than an actual, colonoscopy.</text></article>

The sitcom that gleefully skewers its corporate parent took on the sale of NBC in a slightly fictionalized form. In the world of Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy, the network was indeed sold by its current owner, the Sheinhardt Wig Company, to a Philadelphia-based cable company. Only here, it’s known as Kabletown (which Jack, played by Alec Baldwin, ruefully notes is spelled with a “K”.) Thursday’s “30 Rock” episode centered in part on Jack’s angst at being cut out of the deal loop. After the jump, watch a clip, featuring legendary former G.E. chief executive Jack Welch. The NBC deal definitely involved a fair amount of drama, including back-room dealings between top executives of G.E. and Comcast. But it’s safe to say that the “30 Rock” version is a bit more, as NBC’s current promos say, colorful. For starters, the real-life negotiations didn’t involve an isolated G.E. executive spinning the merits of a non-deal to his golden-tressed CNBC anchor girlfriend (who was more in the loop than he was). Neither did the talks involve stuffing a dead high-level executive in a freezer — at least, that we know of. Go to “30 Rock” Episode via Hulu »</text></article>

The Oklahoma City company is a limited partnership formed by natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy and Global Infrastructure Partners, an investment fund founded by Credit Suisse and General Electric. Chesapeake Midstream develops and operates natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, in Texas’s Barnett Shale, a major source of natural gas, as well as other fields in the Midwest. The company did not state I.P.O. terms or an expected trading debut date. Energy companies have been jockeying to build natural gas production. The cleaner-burning fuel plays a growing role in powering American homes and businesses. Chesapeake Midstream says its assets gathered 1.5 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day for the nine months ended Sept. 30, making it one of the largest players in the field. It is heavily dependent on Chesapeake Energy for its business, with 98 percent of the natural gas volumes in its pipelines and infrastructure coming from Chesapeake and its partners in the first nine months of 2009. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, Chesapeake Midstream said it lost $17.4 million, compared to a profit of $165.9 million in the first nine months of 2008. Revenue rose 53 percent to $358.9 million. The company plans to use proceeds to repay borrowing from its credit facility and fund capital expenditures in the future and for working capital. In its regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Chesapeake Midstream said had about $32 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The company plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ”CHM.” Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters.

We see the movement toward clean energy as a space that we can participate in with the technologies that we have.” The Hartford-based company in December paid about $271 million for a 49.5 percent stake in Carpinteria, Calif.-based Clipper. Mr. Hayes noted that technology developed by United Tech’s aircraft engine business could be used to improve the performance of Clipper turbines — an approach rival General Electric has also taken in the wind sector. “If over the next couple of years we see what we like, we always have the opportunity to take a majority share if we want,” Mr. Hayes said of Clipper. “If we like the market dynamics, I think you might see more in that space or other alternative technology spaces, which are adjacent to markets where we can use UTC technologies.” The world’s largest maker of elevators and air conditioners also has a sizable fuel-cell operation. Fuel cells use hydrogen to produce electricity without emitting carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas associated with global climate change. United Tech remains interested in other investments in the clean-tech area, Mr. Hayes said. The company has a $3 billion 2010 takeover budget, though more than half of that is going for its acquisition of G.E.’s security business. “We hope to play these small bets into a bigger bet sometime down the road,” he said.

In the United States alone, G.E. expects to spend more than $80 million this year on the campaign. Its role in health care is technical: G.E. makes and sells medical devices, like machines that measure bone density and perform M.R.I. scans. But the advertising focuses on the personal. “In the past, we have always shown the hardware, and that’s great  it works on one level  but we wanted to make a point here that this was about better health for more people,” said Don Schneider, executive creative director for BBDO New York, the Omnicom Group agency that created most of the ads. Beth Comstock, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at G.E., said that the company was trying to make health care more accessible  both in terms of consumers understanding it and in terms of providing cheaper, more widely available devices. (By 2015, G.E. has said, it will invest $6 billion in research and development for health care products and technology.) “This is a way to start to build awareness for G.E. in this space,” Ms. Comstock said. Ms. Comstock said that the health care debate in Washington “didn’t really affect the timing,” although it had renewed peoples’ interest in the topic. But Timothy Calkins, clinical professor of marketing at Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, said he suspected otherwise. “A lot of health care companies have really gotten kicked around a bit in the recent health care debates,” Mr. Calkins said. “Sometimes it’s easy for politicians to go after the pharmaceutical industry and the medical device industry and say that they’re the cause of the problem, so they’re a fairly easy target. It’s important to get out there and be a part of the debate.” The campaign begins Friday, with consumer-focused efforts ranging from Olympic television advertising to sponsored toolbars on the Web site Digg.com.  Although G.E. has traditionally used more business-oriented advertising media, the goal with this campaign was not necessarily to get viewers to buy or use G.E. devices, but to emphasize its broader role in health care.

Less expensive Web efforts balance the sleek TV ads, for a total of almost 60 videos. Howcast, which makes how-to Web videos, will produce G.E.-sponsored segments that will appear on its site, on YouTube and on blogs, with subjects like “How to party your way to better health.” G.E. will also introduce an application for the iPhone and for Android-powered smartphones to view Howcast health videos, and an app called “Morsel” that gives daily health tips.

Other elements of the digital campaign largely focus on “the ‘health spreading contagiously’ idea,” Mr. Schneider said, referring to the digital sharing of health-related ideas. For health articles on sites like Digg.com and Healthline.com, G.E. will sponsor the toolbars that allow visitors to e-mail the stories or post them to Twitter or Facebook.

Those show see-through images of athlete’s bodies that G.E. technology might produce, and carry lines like “The Olympic Games, in much greater definition.” “It’s this idea of simplifying complexity, but with a sense of optimism,” Ms. Comstock said. “It’s a way to bring to life that technology can be an answer.”</text></article>

The polluter, General Electric, and the Environmental Protection Agency have issued separate reports evaluating the six-month cleanup, which was designed as a trial run for a much larger second phase that will finally rid the river of PCBs, industrial lubricants that have poisoned its mud and fish for generations. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Graphic A Long Battle for the Hudson River Related Editorial: Reclaiming a River (May 16, 2009) Both reports acknowledge unexpected problems. In many places in the dredging zone  the upper Hudson above Albany  the contaminated layers of sediment were far thicker than sampling probes had predicted. The volume of PCBs released into the water and air was higher than expected. At times, dredges got hung up on debris, their jaws unable to seal in toxic contents. Removal was slowed by storms, rising water and a shortage of barges. The reports will now go through peer review and comment. But it already seems clear that before the dredging resumes, both G.E. and the E.P.A. will have to make some adjustments in order to meet the goal of having the river cleaned up within the next five years. What shouldn’t change is G.E.’s commitment to finish the job. The E.P.A. must make sure that happens, no matter how dire-sounding the company’s version of the first phase. G.E. fought in court for years to take the cheapest way out of the PCB problem. It argued for letting the potential carcinogens lie in the river, decaying on their own, because it said dredging would stir them up and make the problem worse. G.E.’s new report has similarly dire language. It said that the dredging had released “nearly 25 times more PCBs” than expected, and that PCB levels had spiked in fish in the dredging zone. The E.P.A.’s findings strike a very different tone. The agency said its own examination of the data show that the percentage of unexpected PCBs was actually far lower than G.E. reported and rising PCB levels in nearby fish would be temporary. Most importantly, it said that the percentage of stirred-up PCBs that spilled over the last dam from the dredging hot spot into the cleaner lower river was actually lower than expected. This is one of the most expensive and complicated environmental cleanups in American history. But G.E.’s engineers have the skills to do it. The only question is whether the company is willing to learn from Phase One and meet its responsibility, without any more delay, to clean up the Hudson. The E.P.A. must see that it does.
