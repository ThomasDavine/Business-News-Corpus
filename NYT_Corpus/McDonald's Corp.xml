But those diners might want to get ready to pay more.McDonald’s, the world’s largest hamburger chain, has performed well throughout the recession and its aftermath. But it noted potential challenges like the rising cost of beef and higher labor costs, and hinted that it could raise menu prices for the third time this year. “The economists say we are officially out of the recession, but it hardly feels that way,” Jim Skinner, the company’s chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. He referred to McDonald’s gains as “hard won” victories. The 9 percent rise in net income, to $1.51 billion, was McDonald’s ninth consecutive quarter of earnings gains. Earnings per share of $1.45 beat analysts’ expectations of $1.43. A 14 percent increase in revenue, to $7.17 billion, also beat the $7.02 billion predicted by analysts polled by FactSet. McDonald’s shares rose $3.31, or 3.7 percent, to close at $92.32. McDonald’s success has hinged on quickly adapting to customers’ changing tastes and reshaping itself as a hip and more healthful place to eat. It has added menu items like smoothies and oatmeal, remodeled restaurants and converted more locations to 24-hour operations. All those moves, the company says, have brought in more customers. The company’s commodity costs in the United States spiked 8 percent this quarter compared with a year ago. That is higher than the second quarter’s 6 percent and the first quarter’s 1 percent increase. The cost of beef, which normally declines at the end of the summer grilling season, stayed high, which McDonald’s said it had not expected. The Department of Agriculture now predicts that consumers will end up paying 8 or 9 percent more for beef and veal in 2011 compared with 2010. McDonald’s has already raised prices to offset the higher ingredient costs, raising menu prices by an average of 1 percent in March and another 1.4 percent in May. The chief financial officer, Peter Bensen, said the company had experienced good “flow through” on the two price increases, meaning they had not driven away customers. Grocery prices, which are increasing at a faster clip than restaurant prices, could also give McDonald’s some room to raise prices because customers could view eating in as less of a value. Beef was not the only expense to rise. McDonald’s effective tax rate climbed because of some lower foreign tax credits. Labor costs rose, and the company invested in new restaurant openings in China, where it now has about 1,400 locations. “Almost every category of costs is going in the wrong direction,” Mr. Bensen said. The store openings in China, where McDonald’s hopes to have 2,000 locations by the end of 2013, signal its strategy to invest in emerging markets.McDonald’s said Friday that its third-quarter net income rose by 9 percent as it kept defying a tough economy and attracting more customers.

In fact, she had a frown on her face.“It’s bad,” Erin M. Carr-Jordan said, swab in hand, as she collected samples from a surface that she would later deliver to a lab for microbial testing. Nearby, a restaurant worker diligently sanitized tabletops and banisters outside the play area, but he did not appear to use his rag and spray bottle inside the children’s maze. Dr. Carr-Jordan, a child development professor and a mother of four from Chandler, Ariz., has visited dozens of restaurant playgrounds in 11 states in recent months to test them for cleanliness. What the inspections and lab analyses have revealed is the widespread presence of an array of pathogens, from coliform bacteria to staphylococcus, at levels that experts said indicated that restaurants might not be disinfecting their playlands as diligently as they should. Those same experts pointed out that germs are everywhere and that they are not always dangerous. They add that hand washing is an important safeguard. “I’m not shocked or blown out of the water, because this is my business,” said Philip M. Tierno Jr., director of clinical microbiology and immunology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, who surveyed some of Dr. Carr-Jordan’s results. At the same time, Dr. Tierno said, “There are very high counts, and that means these places are not cleaned properly or not cleaned at all.” Dr. Carr-Jordan’s campaign, which has attracted the attention of the fast-food industry, began in April when she stopped at a McDonald’s near her Phoenix-area home because one of her sons needed to go to the bathroom. On the way out, her children asked if they could play in the children’s park, which McDonald’s calls a PlayPlace. She assented and accompanied her children inside. What she saw was alarming. “My kids were going, ‘Yuck!’ ” she recalled of the scene, which she videotaped with her cellphone and posted on YouTube. “It was gross and sticky. There were curse words and gang graffiti. The windows were black. There was matted hair and an abandoned Band-Aid.” Despite complaints to the manager and several follow-up visits, the play area was not cleaned, she said. So Dr. Carr-Jordan, who has a Ph.D. in developmental psychology but is no expert in microbiology, had samples tested. When the results were analyzed by Legend Technical Services Inc., an environmental testing company, they indicated the presence of potentially harmful bacteria, and she began inspecting and testing the playgrounds at other fast-food restaurants in her neighborhood. Lab results — she has since switched to another commercial lab — showed that most were far from clean, she said. Intent on showing that the problem was not an isolated matter, she has been mixing family vacations with her play area inspections. From New York to California, she has squeezed herself into the playgrounds at Burger King, Chuck E. Cheese’s, Peter Piper Pizza and numerous other restaurants. Playtime, a Colorado company that supplies play equipment to McDonald’s and other restaurants, recommends on its Web site that restaurant operators regularly clean and inspect their equipment to keep a check on “smudges, ink, goo.” The restaurants say they have policies in place that require the regular cleaning of their play areas. Danya Proud, a McDonald’s spokeswoman, said the company had stringent sanitizing procedures but had nonetheless assigned a team to review those procedures in light of Dr. Carr-Jordan’s complaints. “We’re human, and we make mistakes,” Ms. Proud said, indicating that McDonald’s considers cleanliness a priority. Still, Dr. Carr-Jordan said that of the nearly 50 play areas she had tested, only one had come back essentially free of pathogens, and that was at a Chick-fil-A restaurant not far from her home. That is now the only restaurant play area she permits her children to visit. To draw attention to the issue and push for legislation mandating stricter standards for play areas, Dr. Carr-Jordan, who teaches at Arizona State University and several other institutions, has formed a nonprofit group called Kids Play Safe. Her calls to health officials, from local health departments to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have failed to prompt any crackdown, she said. A C.D.C. spokeswoman, Bernadette Burden, said the federal agency would get involved only if called in by state officials concerned about a major disease breakout. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the Environmental Services Department considers play areas nonfood areas, and thus less of a priority during inspections than other parts of restaurants, said Johnny Diloné, a spokesman. So Dr. Carr-Jordan, fast-food vigilante, continues to climb into tubes, wriggle through tunnels and slide down slides. After emerging from one play area she inspected in Arizona last week, she shook her head. “No one would want their child playing in there,” she said, “and that one wasn’t the worst.”GILBERT, Ariz. — One of those who kicked off her shoes and slithered her way through the multihued plastic tubes of a fast-food restaurant playground here one recent morning was not enjoying herself in the least.

McDonald’s said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.5 percent globally. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were looking for an increase of 4.3 percent. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.9 percent in the United States, just shy of analysts’ 4.0 percent expectation. In Europe, the company reported an increase of 2.7 percent, missing analysts’ estimate of a 4.7 percent increase.

Now he’s engaged in geopolitics of another sort: deploying American fast food for the emerging Russian middle class.Mr. Wynne is the top franchisee in Russia for the Papa John’s Pizza chain. His competitors include the American chains Sbarro and Domino’s, and a Russian upstart, Pizza Fabrika. But so far, compared with the largely saturated United States market for fast food, Mr. Wynne says he is finding plenty of demand. “I could succeed in my sleep there is so much opportunity here,” said Mr. Wynne, who has just opened his 25th Papa John’s outlet in Russia, doubling the number in the last year. American fast food has been going global for years, of course. And China and India continue to be big expansion markets. But lately, the industry is finding a growing appetite for its fare in Russia — not only pizza, but Burger King’s Whoppers, Cinnabon’s Classic Rolls and Subway’s barbecue pulled pork sandwiches, among others. “As consumers have more disposable income they will spend it on fast food,” Jack Russo, a fast-food industry analyst at Edward Jones, said in a telephone interview. He compares the market here to the United States half a century ago. For years, McDonald’s, which opened its first restaurant on Pushkin Square in 1990 and generated gigantic lines, was the only American fast-food chain in Russia. McDonald’s now operates 279 restaurants in Russia. But other chains are flocking in. Burger King has opened 22 restaurants, mostly in mall food courts, in two years. Carl’s Jr. has 17 restaurants in St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk. Wendy’s has opened two restaurants including a flagship on Arbat Street in Moscow, and plans 180 throughout Russia by 2020. The Subway sandwich chain has opened about 200 shops in Russia, working through several franchisees. Yum Brands, which owns KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, operates a co-branded chicken restaurant chain in Russia, called Rostik’s-KFC, and Il Patio in the Italian food segment. Yum now has about 350 restaurants in Russia. Paving the way has been Russia’s development in many cities of the modern infrastructure needed for fast food to flourish — including malls with food courts, highways with drive-through locations, and specialty suppliers of frozen foods and packaging. Moreover, Russian consumers are increasingly affluent, partly because of the trickle down from the nation’s lucrative oil exports. And though they still trail far behind the average household income of Americans — $43,539 in the United States versus $7,276 here — Russian consumers tend to have a large portion of their money for discretionary spending. They are unburdened by the hangover of consumer debt that has curbed American purchasing power. Nor do Russians have high medical bills because the health care system, if flawed, is largely socialized. The income tax is a flat 13 percent. And a majority of Russians own property mortgage-free, as a legacy of the mass privatization of apartments in the 1990s. As a result, the fast-food chains find they can charge higher prices in Russia than in America. The average check at a Russian fast-food outlet — $8.92 according to research by a Wendy’s franchisee here — is significantly higher than the United States average of $6.50. A large “the works” pizza at Papa John’s in the company’s home base of Louisville, Ky., for example, costs $14, compared with $21.62 for the same pizza in Moscow. Ready buyers include Valery V. Mamayev, a man who reached his 30s without ever ordering a pizza. But he has been a steady Papa John’s customer since a shop opened in the spring in his neighborhood, the Maryino district, an hour’s drive from central Moscow. Maryino is a cityscape of concrete apartment blocks, tangled skeins of traffic-clogged thoroughfares and, these days, an ever growing array of food chain outlets. On a recent Sunday, Mr. Mamayev padded into the hallway of his apartment building in boxer shorts to take delivery of a pie topped with chorizo, salami, ham, Italian sausage and pepperoni. 1 2 Next Page »MOSCOW — Earlier in his career, Christopher Wynne put his Russian expertise to work researching arms proliferation for the American government.

Fat Chance<date>August 2, 2011, 8:10 pm</date><text>Mark Bittman on food and all things related. Tags: advertising, children, Food, health, marketing, nutrition Life would be so much easier if we could only set our own guidelines. You could define the average weight as 10 pounds higher than your own and, voilà, no more obesity! You could raise the speed limit to 90 miles per hour and never worry about a ticket. You could call a cholesterol level of 250 “normal” and celebrate with a bag of fried pork rinds. (You could even claim that cutting government spending would increase employment, but that might be going too far.) You could certainly turn junk food into something “healthy.” A Happy Meal with a piece of apple is still a box of branded, overpriced junk food. That’s what the food industry is doing. Back in May I wrote about the voluntary guidelines for marketing junk food to kids developed by an interagency group headed by the Federal Trade Commission. These non-binding suggestions ask that the industry market real food to kids instead of the junk they so famously favor selling. But the industry argues that the recommendations are effectively mandatory because non-compliance would lead to retaliation and eliminate all food advertising to adolescents, as well as 74,000 jobs. On the phone last week, Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut,  told me that even though the guidelines are “without teeth,” the pushback from the industry has been formidable: “We have seen political showmanship, misinformation about the impact of these voluntary guidelines, insistence that the industry has been successful in self-regulation and that these efforts would violate the First Amendment.” That voluntary guidelines could curb the right to free speech is absurd, but not as wacky as letting the industry set its own standards. Yet that’s what has happened: The Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), a group of food manufacturers that includes McDonald’s, Burger King, PepsiCo and Kraft Foods came up with its own guidelines defining foods healthy enough to market to kids. (It’s worth mentioning another group, too — if just to admire its name,  The Sensible Food Policy Coalition — led by PepsiCo, Kellogg’s, General Mills and other big companies,  evidently created solely to prevent the voluntary guidelines from gaining a foothold.) CFBAI is a champion of “self-regulation,” which means repeating a series of mantras that include “facts” like “there is no such thing as good food and bad food,” or that Cookie Crisp cereal (or dozens of others) “can be a part of a balanced diet,” all the while micro-adjusting hyper-processed food so that “more fiber” and “less sugar” aren’t outright lies, even though the food itself can hardly be claimed to be “less junky.” With self-regulation, even Kraft Singles can be considered “part of a balanced diet.” And guess what? In general, the companies fare well in meeting their own standards (which, pathetically, the F.T.C. sees as a “significant advance”): two-thirds of the products they advertise are A-O.K., with the remainder requiring just modest adjustments. See? Mission accomplished! Corn Pops are now healthy! Another example: last week, McDonald’s promised a minor tweak of its Happy Meal, (which, of course, “can be part of a well-balanced diet for kids”) adding a few apple slices, removing a few French fries and making milk — chocolate or regular — a more prominent option. It still comes with a toy, and soda will remain a choice. (I’m not sure anyone is claiming soda is part of a healthy diet, but stay tuned.) The move received widespread praise, with Michelle Obama leading the cheers. Self-regulation may be immediate, non-threatening and magical, but it doesn’t work. But despite the seal of approval of our first lady/self-appointed nutrition expert, a Happy Meal with a piece of apple is still a box of branded, overpriced junk food sold not by its value but by its marketing scheme. (Forty percent of McDonald’s advertising budget is spent on marketing to kids.) This is not “progress,” but a public relations victory along with — as Michele Simon points out in her blog — an attempt to short-circuit regulations and laws that have some guts, like the one in San Francisco that forbids the inclusion of toys in meals that don’t meet reasonable nutrition standards. The last thing McDonald’s or any like corporation wants to see is a strong, activist government protecting consumers, whether or not they’re  capable of adult judgment or are habituated (a harsher word is “addicted”) to self-destructive products. Self-regulation may be immediate, non-threatening and magical, but it doesn’t work. A study published earlier this week in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine by Dr. Lisa Powell and other researchers at  the University of Illinois at Chicago tracked changes in exposure for all food, beverage and restaurant TV ads seen by kids from 2 to 11 years old, from 2003 to 2009. It found that, overall, daily exposure to the ads declined but the percentage among companies that had pledged to self-regulate was higher than those that didn’t. And in 2009, 86 percent of these ads still featured unhealthy foods. What’s worse? Self-serving self-regulation or toothless guidelines set by an agency that appears to be complicit in maintaining the status quo? Hard to say. What’s better is having grass roots movements that drive agencies toward real regulation. Please visit my blog and join me on Facebook or follow me on Twitter.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/business/mcdonalds-happy-meal-to-get-healthier.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Happy Meal to Get Healthier<date>Published: July 26, 2011</date><text>Bowing to pressure from health advocates and parents, McDonald’s is putting the Happy Meal on a diet.The company announced Tuesday that it would more than halve the amount of French fries and add fruit to its popular children’s meal in an effort to reduce the overall calorie count by 20 percent. But McDonald’s appeasement only went so far. A toy will still come with each Happy Meal despite criticism that the trinkets, often with tie-ins to movies like “Toy Story,” foster a powerful connection between children and the often calorie-laden meals. While Happy Meals account for less than 10 percent of all McDonald’s sales, the signature box and its contents — first introduced in 1979 — have become a favorite target in recent years. Lawmakers and consumers have rallied around breaking that childhood link between toys and fast food, with the efforts increasing as Michelle Obama and national public health officials point to the estimated 17 percent rate of obesity among the nation’s youths. San Francisco, for example, has banned the inclusion of toys in children’s meals unless certain nutritional requirements are met. A New York City councilman is proposing a similar law. Other restaurant chains have gone further than McDonald’s in acceding to calls for improving the fare on children’s menus and eliminating marketing appeals. In June, Jack in the Box announced the end of toys in its children’s meals, and this month, Burger King, IHOP and more than a dozen other restaurant chains backed an effort led by the National Restaurant Association to serve and promote healthier options for youngsters. “McDonald’s is not giving the whole loaf, but it is giving a half or two thirds of a loaf,” said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which is representing a woman in California who is suing McDonald’s for including toys in its Happy Meals. “This is an important step in the right direction.” McDonald’s made it clear that it was changing the composition of Happy Meals in response to parental and consumer pressure. It also pledged to reduce the sodium content in all of its foods by 15 percent, with the exceptions of soda and desserts. It set a deadline of 2015 for limiting salt, and said it would spend the rest of this decade cutting back on sugars, saturated fats and calories and making adjustments to portion sizes. The new Happy Meals will be introduced in September and rolled out across the company’s 14,000 restaurants by April 2012. They will all include apple slices, but in a smaller amount of three to five slices than the current eight to 10 offered as an alternative. (The Apple Dippers also will be renamed after the company phases out the caramel dipping sauce, according to Tuesday’s announcement.) “It’s a trade-off between everybody getting a small portion and 10 percent of kids getting a larger portion, which is better than nothing and maybe will accustom kids to eating fresh fruits and vegetables when they go out to eat,” Mr. Jacobson said. Parents will have the option of requesting more fruit or, possibly at a later date, vegetables instead of fries. McDonald’s will also offer a fat-free chocolate milk option, along with the option of low-fat milk or the traditional soda. The price is not expected to change. Today’s Happy Meal with chicken nuggets has 520 calories and 26 grams of fat, and the reconstituted version, with 1 percent milk, will total 410 calories and 19 grams of fat, according to the company. The company said it had experimented with eliminating French fries altogether from the boxes, but that generated a lot of customer complaints. Danya Proud, a spokeswoman for the company, said that McDonald’s tests also found that parents wanted soda among the drinks available, too. “That’s what we’ve really felt all along, that ultimately, it’s a parent decision to make about their child’s well-being,” she said. McDonald’s has long offered parents the option of asking for fruit rather than fries, although a study by Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that only 11 percent took advantage of that option. While some critics of fast-food and public health officials praised the moves (Mrs. Obama called them “positive steps”), others complained that McDonald’s did not go far enough. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University and an outspoken critic of the food industry, called the changes a “sham,” in part because McDonald’s is not doing more to limit soda with the Happy Meal. “They’re going to get huge publicity for this — an ounce less of French fries,” Dr. Nestle said. “I’m not impressed.” In fact, when apples are added to the Happy Meal with a soda, the amount of sugar in the new package increases. As part of an effort to provide better access to nutritional information about its foods, the company has developed its first mobile application for the public. McDonald’s executives also plan to tour the country to hear directly from consumers about their concerns. “We are doing what we can,” Ms. Proud said. “We have to evolve with the times, and the times require us and our customers are asking us to offer more options.” Ms. Proud said that even with the changes, the Happy Meal would not meet San Francisco’s requirements, which demand both a fruit and vegetable serving, among other things, before a company can include a toy with a child’s meal. Public health experts expect the company to mount a legal challenge to that ordinance before it goes into effect in December, but Ms. Proud said McDonald’s was still evaluating its options.

Bowing to pressure from antiobesity campaigns, McDonald’s is putting the Happy Meal on a diet. The company announced Tuesday that it had planned changes to its popular children’s meal that will more than halve the amount of French fries in the package and add fruit. The new Happy Meals will be introduced in September. In most cases, they will include apple slices, or perhaps another fruit, and parents will have the option of requesting vegetables in lieu of fries. Additionally, the company will still offer a choice of milk with 1 percent fat, and is adding fat-free chocolate milk, although the default will be a cup for soda or water. In recent years, McDonald’s has faced increasing criticism about its menu as cities, states and public organizations pursued antiobesity campaigns. The Happy Meal has become a favorite target, because of the rising rate of overweight children nationwide, and the enticement of toys included in the packages. McDonald’s said its goal was to reduce calories in the meal package by 20 percent. A Happy Meal with chicken nuggets has 530 calories and 23 grams of fat, but the reconstituted version will have 435 calories and 17 grams of fat, according to the company. “McDonald’s has taken an extremely important step to help parents who want to please their kids while providing them with at least minimally nutritious food,” said Samantha Graff, director of legal research at Public Health Law and Policy. “We think it’s a terrific move.” McDonald’s made it clear that it was changing the composition of Happy Meals in response to parental and consumer pressure. It and other fast-food restaurants also are facing increased pressure from local governments that are moving to impose regulations aimed at improving the nutritional value of the food they serve. In San Francisco, toys with children’s meals are banned unless the meals meet certain nutritional criteria, and a New York City councilman is pushing similar legislation that would prohibit the toys unless the accompanying meals had a lower calorie and fat content. Even though McDonald’s has long offered parents the option of asking for fruit instead of fries, a study by Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity found that only 11 percent took advantage of that option. The company said Tuesday that it would no longer offer the caramel dipping sauce it previously served with apples. McDonald’s remains unyielding on the toys that it stuffs in every box, which are the bane of critics who believe that they lure children to fast food. Jack in the Box, however, recently eliminated toys from its meals for children.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/nyregion/policemans-stop-at-mcdonalds-produces-years-of-court-cases.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Policeman’s Stop at McDonald’s Produces Years of Court Cases<date>Published: July 22, 2011</date><text>The police officer, recalling that night, sounds like an actor in a fast-food commercial: “At some point, something told me, grab a Big Mac.” And so on a freezing January night in 2005, the officer, John Florio, then 39, stopped at the drive-through window of a McDonald’s in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. He ordered the combo, a Big Mac with fries and a Coke.“Have a nice night,” a young man in the cashier’s window said, according to Officer Florio. “You, too,” the officer replied. He drove away, with his dog, Dodger, a member of the Police Department’s canine unit, in the back seat. Officer Florio was heading toward Randalls Island to give Dodger a bathroom break and a run. As he drove, he bit into the burger. Top-row teeth met bottom-row teeth, and the course of two lives changed. “I felt something hard and sharp on the left-hand side of my face,” he said on a witness stand five years later. Something had cracked: “My tooth.” Inside the Big Mac were several shards of broken glass. It is impossible to overstate the seriousness with which the police take any attempt to harm one of their own. To the passer-by that night, it must have looked as if an officer had been drawn and quartered in the McDonald’s: there were two inspectors, two captains, three sergeants and five detectives among other officers at 875 Garrison Avenue. They combed the kitchen for glass and questioned employees and a manager, and they took the young man assembling sandwiches that night, Albert Garcia, then 18, into a back room, where he was questioned for about three hours. He confessed. “I started to make the sandwich and I was about to finish it,” he wrote in a statement for detectives. “I put the little pieces of glass into the burger as a joke.” He wrote, “I didn’t know it was going to be sold to a cop.” Then the case that seemed so open and shut just kept opening. Five years passed before Mr. Garcia’s trial began in the Bronx, and by then he had not only renounced his confession, but his lawyer, Raymond J. Aab, had accused Officer Florio of planting the glass in his own burger to make a quick buck from McDonald’s. The officer guessed that he bought the Big Mac around 11:30 that Saturday night, Jan. 29, 2005, but he had no receipt. He said Mr. Garcia had handed him the bag. He bit into the glass a couple of minutes later, he testified, but he did not call his sergeant until 12:07 a.m., after stopping at Randalls Island for his dog. He followed the sergeant’s command to get checked out at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, and he told doctors that he thought he had swallowed glass. One doctor said, five months later, that he had had three foreign-objects-in-McDonald’s-food cases that week, all from different locations. Doctors found no sign of cuts to Officer Florio’s throat, and X-ray tests came back negative. But Officer Florio said he monitored his stool for several days after, going to the bathroom in a bucket and examining its contents, and he found five shards of glass that had apparently passed through him without causing injury. Inside of two weeks, Officer Florio sued McDonald’s for $6 million. This would prove to be a tactical mistake, for the civil action allowed the defense team to question him and other police officers in depositions, a luxury unknown to most lawyers defending criminal cases. The depositions contradicted one another in various places, and a defense theory emerged: Officer Florio planted the glass and never laid eyes on Mr. Garcia that night; nor did Mr. Garcia see the officer. The cashier, a young woman, served him the burger. But when detectives, believing Officer Florio’s story, interviewed Mr. Garcia and he appeared nervous, they pushed harder, and he confessed. Officer Florio, the defense claimed, had learned of Mr. Garcia’s existence only many hours later, in a precinct station house, and, quite likely shocked that anyone had confessed to something that did not happen, said yes, that’s the guy. The defense theory worked. A jury acquitted Mr. Garcia in March 2010. Officer Florio, since retired, settled his lawsuit against the owners of that Bronx franchise restaurant for $15,000, his lawyer, Richard M. Kenny, said. It was a fraction of what he had sought. Officer Florio declined to comment, but Mr. Kenny said: “I’ve kicked a lot of people out of my office who I believe are trying to perpetrate fraud. This guy is as legitimate a guy as I’ve ever met.” Mr. Garcia said that he had gone on, improbably, to work at a White Castle restaurant a few months after his arrest, and that his new employer did not know it had hired “Burger Boy,” as people in Hunts Point called him. He now works for Walgreens, has two children, and has a lawsuit pending against the city and Officer Florio. A scheduling conference in that case is set for next month. “The reason I made a false confession is because I was scared,” he said this week. “I’ve never been in that type of position before. I gave up mentally. I was exhausted. I was hungry. I was thirsty. The only thing I was thinking about was going home.” A police spokesman, Paul J. Browne, shrugged off Mr. Garcia’s lawsuit. “It’s no surprise that the plaintiffs’ bar seeks remuneration for clients, regardless of how dubious their claims,” he said. The Big Mac remains in evidence six years later, in a city freezer. The case of the broken glass is not even its only mystery. Investigators found a strand of hair in the burger box, but forensic tests showed that it belonged to neither the young man who was accused in the case nor the officer who paid for a meal and drove away. Involved in a crime? E-mail: crimescene@nytimes.com Manny Fernandez contributed reporting.The police officer, recalling that night, sounds like an actor in a fast-food commercial: “At some point, something told me, grab a Big Mac.” And so on a freezing January night in 2005, the officer, John Florio, then 39, stopped at the drive-through window of a McDonald’s in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. He ordered the combo, a Big Mac with fries and a Coke.</text></article>

In a 50-minute video news conference on Wednesday morning, executives from McDonald’s were joined by present and former Olympic athletes to discuss the company’s plans for the Summer Games. The executives often repeated the phrase “balanced eating and fun play” in describing the focus of the McDonald’s advertising and marketing initiative for the Olympics, which will be held in London. And for the first time, the executives said, the McDonald’s Olympic restaurants will also serve Happy Meals in addition to their other menu fare. McDonald’s has been aggressive in fighting back against efforts by activists to limit or ban Happy Meals on the grounds that they provide children with too many calories and too much fat, salt and sugar. Dara Torres, the United States Olympic swimming champion, is being hired to serve as a “global ambassador” for the McDonald’s efforts for the 2012 Games. Ms. Torres appeared with Kevin Newell, the global chief brand officer of McDonald’s, to talk about how the restaurant chain will support what she called “the benefits of play for kids everywhere.” The McDonald’s sponsorship will proceed under an umbrella theme of McDonald’s Champions of Play for the Olympic Games. The “champions” are to be children ages 6 to 10, from around the world. They (with guardians) will be brought to London by McDonald’s to meet Olympic athletes, tour the Olympic facilities, see some of London and, of course, tour the McDonald’s restaurant at the Olympic Village. (As the “official restaurant” of the Olympic Games, McDonald’s will have four restaurants on the premises. In addition to the one in the Olympic Village, there will be two in the Olympic Park, for spectators, and one in the main press center. All told, projections call for the four eateries to serve 1.75 million meals during the 29 days the Games will go on.) The Champions of Play program is an expansion of an initiative by McDonald’s at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, British Columbia. There will also be elements of the Champions of Play program for 2012 that will take place in local markets, among them a Web site devoted to “balanced eating and fun play” and special packaging for Happy Meals. The news conference also included appearances by executives at the United States Olympic Committee Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., who lavishly praised the quality and nutritional aspects of McDonald’s food. People “would be amazed” if they were aware of the high-quality ingredients that go into the McDonald’s menu items, said Terri Moreman, associate director of food and nutritional services for the committee. She even ended her remarks with the “I’m lovin’ it” theme from the McDonald’s ad campaign. Dean Barrett, global marketing officer at McDonald’s, said the company would promote its sponsorship in 117 markets around the world and also with its 1.7 million employees. As it has done at several Olympic Games, McDonald’s will again draw from its worldwide employee ranks to staff the restaurants at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Jill McDonald, chief executive for the United Kingdom operations of McDonald’s, said there would be 1,800 workers drawn from those who work for the company in the United Kingdom and 200 from other countries. One of the four restaurants, in Stratford in East London, will be the largest free-standing McDonald’s ever, executives said. The restaurant, which will be one of the two for ticket-holders, will be two stories (or “storeys,” as the British say). In addition to trying to burnish its nutritional credentials, McDonald’s also intends to use the Olympic sponsorship to talk up its efforts in areas like the environment and sustainability. For instance, Ms. McDonald described how the sponsorship will include discussions of the Open Farms program, which invites customers and journalists to visit some of the 17,500 farms in Britain and Ireland that provide ingredients for food sold in restaurants in the United Kingdom.</text></article>

Muammar el-Qaddafi’s son Seif al-Islam said that the international intervention in Libya was motivated purely by a desire to control Libya’s oil and gas resources. “They have one target,” Mr. Qaddafi said of the countries participating in the NATO-led military campaign. “This country is a piece of cake: rich, full of gas, oil, and we have more than $100 billion deposits abroad… Their goal is not Qaddafi, their goal is to control Libya.” Imagining the conversation among NATO leaders, Mr. Qaddafi said: “We have to share this cake, that’s it. And we have to get rid of Mr. Qaddafi because he’s the only obstacle between us and the cake.” Later in the interview, Mr. Qaddafi, who has lived in London and is most likely familiar with popular critiques of consumer capitalism and the slow-food movement, expanded on his food metaphor, comparing the hasty military intervention to a taste for fast food. In remarks that fit quite neatly with Russia Today’s frequent criticism of all things American, Mr. Qaddafi told their correspondent Maria Finoshina: Listen, NATO and rebels both are in a hurry, they want to finish as soon as possible because they are hungry, they are tired, they want to share the cake. It’s like, for them, Libya is like fast food, like McDonald’s, fast. Because everything should be fast: fast war, fast airplanes, fast bullets, fast victory. But we are very patient, because we are in our country, it’s our country, we live here, we die here. One day, the French will go back to Corsica and France, the Italians will go back to Sicily and Italy, the Danish will go back to Denmark, the Canadians will go back to Toronto, and Libya will be back to the Libyans. Mr. Qaddafi, who was educated in Britain and was seen in recent years as a reformer and likely successor to his father, also told the Russian network that the lesson of the Libyan war is that other nations should maintain their weapons programs rather than disarm and engage with Europe and the United States. We got messages from many countries, and we heard many news from Iran, North Korea, saying, ‘This is your mistake, Libyans, you gave up your weapons of mass destruction, you stopped developing long-range missiles, you became very friendly with the West, and this is the result. So, what does this mean? This is a message to everybody: that you have to be strong, you never trust them and you have to be always on alert, because those people don’t have friends, over one night, they changed their mind and they started bombing us and the same thing could happen to any other country.</text></article>

The 48-year-old, red-haired mascot has come under fire from health-care professionals and consumer groups who, in recent days, have asked the fast-food chain to retire Ronald McDonald.— The Wall Street Journal, May 20 HUMAN RESOURCES Good morning, and thank you for participating in this fully confidential exit interview. Just to begin, how many years have you been with the company? RONALD MCDONALD (stares blankly at the wall, not seeming to hear) H.R. Er ... Mr. McDonald? RONALD ( singing the Big Mac song softly, like a hymn) ... two all-beef patties ... special sauce, lettuce, cheese ... (Distraught, he retrieves three single-serving packets of ketchup from his jumpsuit and squeezes them directly into his mouth.) H.R. I realize this must be difficult for you. It’s quite normal for employees in your position to experience a period of grief. RONALD Forty-eight years ... forty-eight years... (kneading his forehead) How could I have been so stupid! Why didn’t I put away more? Or even a little! I don’t even have a résumé! (suddenly engaged) Hey, maybe there’s something else I could do! Maybe in payroll or Web-development — even something on the political side? I know politicians! I once went on a golf trip with Steny Hoyer. (pulls out cellphone) Hold on, I think he’s still in my contacts — H.R. Mr. McDonald, once again, I want to stress that this has nothing to do with your performance. Management simply feels that, amid skyrocketing rates of diabetes and childhood obesity, it is no longer appropriate to retain a children’s character within the corporate structure. RONALD Good point. So maybe we can “age me up” a little bit? Lose the wig, hire a trainer, maybe engineer one of those sham P.R. relationships — how about Ke$ha? And then I could be Rona£d! You know, with a pound sign. H.R. I don’t know if we want to go there. RONALD (backtracking) Right, you’re right. Forget it. That’s just the ketchup talking. (introspective sigh) I guess I should have seen this coming. I heard they’re test marketing a Filet-o-Kale. Is that true? H.R. I wouldn’t — RONALD Aw, forget it, you wouldn’t give me a straight answer anyway. “Chinese wall,” right? (dark chuckle) You wanna know the hardest part? They’re right. (slaps his knee) They’re totally right! Maybe it didn’t seem so bad in the ’60s, but today? With everything we know about sodium intake and LDL levels? And let’s not even talk about factory farming! Who are we kidding? They’re not “Happy Meals,” they’re “Gateway Meals!” (shaken) I’m a monster. H.R. You’re not a monster. RONALD Statistically, I am. H.R. (protective) But how could you have known? RONALD Oh, don’t be naïve. We all knew! Grimace knew! And he has a brain the size of a pearl onion. To be honest, I’m amazed that guy can even stand up. H.R. (suddenly indignant) Mr. McDonald, you’re an ambassador of joy and optimism and generosity — everything that makes America great! You’re not just a clown. You’re an icon. Long, awkward pause. RONALD O.K. Well, thanks. That’s nice to hear. Longer, more awkward pause. Suddenly, Ronald’s cellphone rings. RONALD (He glances at the caller I.D.) Well, will you look at that? If it isn’t my good friend, Steny Hoyer! H.R. (skeptical) Really? RONALD (Guilty pause. He lowers his eyes.)

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/global/09fish.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s to Serve Sustainable Fish in Europe<date>Published: June 8, 2011</date><text>PARIS — McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast-food company, said Wednesday that it had reached a deal under which a nonprofit organization would certify as sustainable the catch used for each of the 100 million fish sandwiches the chain sells in Europe every year.Beginning in October, the blue eco-label of the Marine Stewardship Council will appear on the wrappers of McDonald’s Europe’s Filet-o-Fish sandwiches, which are made from fried white fish, tartar sauce and a slice of cheese served on a steamed bun. The European arm of McDonald’s, faced with persistent criticism from environmentalists who accuse it of destructive practices, has in recent years sought to burnish its image with the rollout of Rainforest Alliance-certified coffee and sustainable agriculture programs. Europeans are — at least on the surface — somewhat more sensitive to environmental issues than Americans. McDonald’s notes, for example, that in North America, “foods made with genetically modified ingredients are generally accepted, while that isn’t the case in Europe.” Joanna Trigg, a McDonald’s spokeswoman in London, said the company, sought the seal because “we recognized that using the M.S.C. eco-label would enable our customers to make sustainable choices without them having to change their behavior.” She said “there have been some conversations” about extending the deal to the United States as well. McDonald’s has 7,000 restaurants across 39 European countries. It is one of the highest-profile marine eco-labeling deals ever announced, and environmentalists were largely supportive of its goals. “This step, taken by a company with a volume of distribution as large as it has, shows the growing demand from the general public for more ecological sustainability in European fisheries and for the recovery of overexploited fish stocks,” said Xavier Pastor of the Oceana marine conservation group. In another big boost for seafood eco-labeling, Wal-Mart Stores, the biggest supermarket chain, has said that it will require all suppliers of the seafood products sold at its Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club stores to obtain the certification of the M.S.C. or an equivalent certifying organization for farmed fish. Wal-Mart said it “will require currently uncertified fisheries to develop work plans to achieve certification and report progress biannually.” The retailers Kroger, Costco and Supervalu are also adopting the Marine Stewardship Council program. The council, based in London, was founded in 1995 by the World Wildlife Fund and Unilever, then a big seafood retailer, to encourage stores, restaurants and consumers to choose fish harvested in responsible ways. It employs third-party companies to certify that fisheries are managed to safeguard jobs, maintain fish stocks and protect the ocean. For granting McDonald’s the right to its imprimatur, the nonprofit organization will receive 0.5 percent of the cost of the 100 million frozen filets it certifies. The deal “is a tremendous testament to the ability of our industry leaders to transform the seafood market and help drive changes on the water,” Rupert Howes, chief executive of the council, said in a statement. Ms. Trigg said McDonald’s Europe uses four species of wild fish for its sandwiches: cod, haddock, Alaska pollock and New Zealand hoki, with the percentages of the different species varying throughout the year. She said that McDonald’s could have begun using only sustainable fisheries several years ago by ending its relationship with those suppliers that did not meet its own environmental standards, but that the company’s policy “is to remain engaged, helping fisheries to improve their practices.” The Marine Stewardship Council is not without critics. Its certification of the New Zealand hoki has in particular been the object of scrutiny, because the fish are caught by trawling the ocean floor, a means of fishing that has been likened to driving a bulldozer across the ocean floor. Several retailers, including the upmarket British supermarket chain Waitrose, refuse to stock the fish for that reason. Some Eastern Baltic cod and Alaska pollock are also caught by bottom trawling. “This is just one step,” Mr. Pastor, of Oceana, said. “The definition and boundaries of sustainability still need to be sorted out, particularly regarding the labeling of products caught using destructive fishing practices. We cannot consider bottom-trawling fisheries to be sustainable since the impact that this fishing gear has on seabeds causes more damage to our already exhausted ocean ecosystems.”PARIS — McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast-food company, said Wednesday that it had reached a deal under which a nonprofit organization would certify as sustainable the catch used for each of the 100 million fish sandwiches the chain sells in Europe every year.</text></article>

Same-restaurant sales rose 6.5 percent in Europe and the same amount in its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit, reflecting strong results from China and Australia and a surprise sales rebound in Japan. “There are not many companies out there showing consistent same-store sales increases in the mid-single digits,” an Edward Jones analyst, Jack Russo, said, adding that visits held up as McDonald’s raised prices. McDonald’s in March raised menu prices by 1 percent in the United States, where it plans more increases. Prices in Europe are up by the same amount, and the company plans to raise prices in China. The company expects food costs to rise between 4 percent and 4.5 percent in the United States and Europe this year.The McDonald’s Corporation posted a better-than-expected 6 percent rise in global sales last month at established restaurants, as higher menu prices helped offset rising costs for beef and other ingredients.</text></article>

But analysts were more concerned about rising food prices, a global trend that is rippling to customers, franchisees and investors everywhere. The company is considering raising menu prices more, but that could scare off the customers who dine there mainly because of the low cost. It raised prices 1 percent in early March. Some franchisees are upset that McDonald’s is spending on remodeling stores while they are being squeezed by the cost of food. Separately, the company faces rising interest rates on debt and an overall higher tax rate. “Yes, we’ve got some headwinds,” Jim Skinner, the chief executive, said in a call with analysts. “But in another six months we may have some tailwinds.” In the first quarter, sales were strongest in Europe, McDonald’s largest market, and in Asia, though they also continued to increase in the United States. Europe accounts for 40 percent of McDonald’s revenue, compared with 32 percent for the United States. Net income rose 11 percent, to $1.2 billion, or $1.15 a share, compared with $1.1 billion, or $1 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased 9 percent, to $6.1 billion. As the world’s biggest hamburger chain, McDonald’s decisions about how to deal with the rising prices will be a leading indicator for the rest of the industry. Its shares fell $1.49, or 1.90 percent, to $76.91. The company said it expected an increase of 4 to 4.5 percent in food prices in the United States and Europe for the year. Mr. Skinner said the company did not pass along all cost increases to customers. “They get pinched everywhere,” he said. “They should not suffer the same fate at McDonald’s.” Outside of food prices, McDonald’s also faces increasing expenses on interest and taxes. It said it expected interest-rate expenses to increase 5 to 6 percent. It predicts its effective tax rate will be 30 to 32 percent, up from 29.3 percent last year. It did not give details on either prediction.The McDonald’s Corporation said on Thursday that it expected more price increases for beef and other crucial ingredients, sending its shares down even as the company reported improved earnings for the first quarter.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/world/asia/28hong-kong-mcdonalds-mcweddings.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Hong Kong’s Couples Invited to Wed at McDonald’s<date>Published: February 27, 2011</date><text>HONG KONG — As classical Muzak blasted from a loudspeaker, Kelvin Kwong got down on one knee and declared his love for his fiancée, Ashley Tse, in front of a rowdy media scrum. Their engagement party on Valentine’s Day was the inaugural event of a new and aggressively promoted nuptial service at McDonald’s restaurants in Hong Kong, the first in the world to offer McWeddings. About a week later, the first real wedding ceremony in a McDonald’s was held here involving a different couple, though the bride and groom, perhaps understandably, decided not to invite the press. In 2006, Hong Kong changed a law to allow for weddings held outside of places of worship or City Hall. Entrepreneurs quickly offered ceremonies on boats, in shopping malls and even under water in the aquarium of the Ocean Park theme park. McDonald’s, which has been in Hong Kong since 1975, is the first fast-food chain to get in on the lucrative trade. The local wedding industry is worth about 10.7 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $1.37 billion, a year, according to ESD Life, an online media outlet. An ESD survey of 1,781 people found that the average couple spent about $29,200, mostly to give face to families with lavish banquets, multiple outfit changes and even dowries, which are still paid in this otherwise modern city. Given that average monthly household income is only about $2,250, it is not uncommon for young couples — or, frequently, the groom’s family — to save for years or to go into debt to pull off a wedding. By contrast, a McWedding starts at $1,280, which includes food and drinks for 50 people. The package includes a budget version of the usual trappings: a “cake” made of stacked apple pies, gifts for the guests and invitation cards, each with a wedding photo of the couple. (Hong Kong wedding photos are taken in advance, with the couple in rented finery.) McDonald’s employees dressed in black suits mimic the actions of hostesses at upscale hotels. They greet guests at the entrance, usher them to the signature book and deliver food, even if it is just a Big Mac and fries. Before the engagement party started, Shirley Chang, managing director of Hong Kong McDonald’s 226 outlets, sat beneath a display of pink balloons, in a fuchsia Chinese-style top with traditional butterfly clasps and a decidedly nontraditional Golden Arches logo. She explained that McWeddings were devised in line with local customs, particularly Chinese numerology beliefs that determine the best dates for weddings or other important events. The engaged couple was given a photo frame shaped like Ronald McDonald, marked with the “limited edition number” 138, an auspicious figure. McWeddings were first announced on Oct. 10, 2010, because “10-10-10” is another lucky combination. The lack of alcohol has not seemed to bother anyone, and Ms. Chang said there had been no requests for it so far. Instead, couples toast with something sugary, because of the implications of “sweetness” in Chinese belief. “That’s why we toast with sundaes,” she said. “You can have a lot of fun with soft drinks.” According to Ms. Chang, 50 to 60 nuptials are under negotiation with Hong Kong McDonald’s party-planning managers. “Everyone wants a tailor-made wedding, and everyone is working on picking the best dates based on the lunar calendar,” said Ms. Chang, who started working for McDonald’s in 1984 in her native Taiwan. Gordon Mathews, an anthropologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, explained the appeal of a McWedding. “The generation getting married today grew up doing their studying at McDonald’s,” Mr. Mathews said. “That was one of the chain’s prominent roles in the 1980s and 1990s — as a safe haven where students could study and stay off the streets. “In the U.S. and other places, middle-class or upper-middle-class people look down on McDonald’s,” he said. “But Hong Kong is different. A McDonald’s wedding wouldn’t be seen as tacky here.” The success that McDonald’s has had in blending into this social landscape may foretell how it will fare in the mainland Chinese market, which it entered in 1990 with an outlet in Shenzhen, near the Hong Kong border. There are 1,300 McDonald’s on the mainland, and the company hopes to expand to 2,000 outlets by 2013. The company’s Hong Kong operations have been largely free of the anti-McDonald’s protests held elsewhere, partly because antiglobalization and anti-obesity movements are not as strong here as they are in the West. “Internationally, McDonald’s has become an icon of fast-food culture and there may be a stigma,” said Dr. Francis C. C. Chow, president of the Hong Kong Association for the Study of Obesity. “But while we do have issues with fast-food culture, it’s not just McDonald’s.” “It’s a matter of proportion,” Dr. Chow said. “Chinese foods like mooncakes or fatty pork are not healthy either, and should not be eaten every day.” If anything, McDonald’s is seen as a relief from strict cultural rules. In “Golden Arches East,” a 1997 study of McDonald’s in Asia, James L. Watson, an anthropologist at Harvard, described the chain’s “egalitarian environment” as a selling point — nobody had to be embarrassed at not ordering the same expensive dishes as the next banquet table, and people of all classes could participate. “I had a traditional Chinese wedding myself,” said Ms. Chang, the managing director. “It was so formal and it seemed like everyone was so happy except for me. I was dressed so beautifully, but I couldn’t even eat. Now, the focus is on the couple having fun.” Back at the party for Mr. Kwong and Ms. Tse, the hostess was leading guests through a rowdy game involving balloons. They seemed genuinely happy and not self-conscious at all, and repeatedly raised their milkshakes to toast the couple, the McDonald’s management representatives and even the journalists covering the event. But when asked if he would have his actual wedding at the same place, Mr. Kwong demurred. “I heard that some people get married on the beach,” he said.HONG KONG — As classical Muzak blasted from a loudspeaker, Kelvin Kwong got down on one knee and declared his love for his fiancée, Ashley Tse, in front of a rowdy media scrum. Their engagement party on Valentine’s Day was the inaugural event of a new and aggressively promoted nuptial service at McDonald’s restaurants in Hong Kong, the first in the world to offer McWeddings. About a week later, the first real wedding ceremony in a McDonald’s was held here involving a different couple, though the bride and groom, perhaps understandably, decided not to invite the press. In 2006, Hong Kong changed a law to allow for weddings held outside of places of worship or City Hall. Entrepreneurs quickly offered ceremonies on boats, in shopping malls and even under water in the aquarium of the Ocean Park theme park. McDonald’s, which has been in Hong Kong since 1975, is the first fast-food chain to get in on the lucrative trade. The local wedding industry is worth about 10.7 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $1.37 billion, a year, according to ESD Life, an online media outlet. An ESD survey of 1,781 people found that the average couple spent about $29,200, mostly to give face to families with lavish banquets, multiple outfit changes and even dowries, which are still paid in this otherwise modern city. Given that average monthly household income is only about $2,250, it is not uncommon for young couples — or, frequently, the groom’s family — to save for years or to go into debt to pull off a wedding. By contrast, a McWedding starts at $1,280, which includes food and drinks for 50 people. The package includes a budget version of the usual trappings: a “cake” made of stacked apple pies, gifts for the guests and invitation cards, each with a wedding photo of the couple. (Hong Kong wedding photos are taken in advance, with the couple in rented finery.) McDonald’s employees dressed in black suits mimic the actions of hostesses at upscale hotels. They greet guests at the entrance, usher them to the signature book and deliver food, even if it is just a Big Mac and fries. Before the engagement party started, Shirley Chang, managing director of Hong Kong McDonald’s 226 outlets, sat beneath a display of pink balloons, in a fuchsia Chinese-style top with traditional butterfly clasps and a decidedly nontraditional Golden Arches logo. She explained that McWeddings were devised in line with local customs, particularly Chinese numerology beliefs that determine the best dates for weddings or other important events. The engaged couple was given a photo frame shaped like Ronald McDonald, marked with the “limited edition number” 138, an auspicious figure. McWeddings were first announced on Oct. 10, 2010, because “10-10-10” is another lucky combination. The lack of alcohol has not seemed to bother anyone, and Ms. Chang said there had been no requests for it so far. Instead, couples toast with something sugary, because of the implications of “sweetness” in Chinese belief. “That’s why we toast with sundaes,” she said. “You can have a lot of fun with soft drinks.” According to Ms. Chang, 50 to 60 nuptials are under negotiation with Hong Kong McDonald’s party-planning managers. “Everyone wants a tailor-made wedding, and everyone is working on picking the best dates based on the lunar calendar,” said Ms. Chang, who started working for McDonald’s in 1984 in her native Taiwan.

No one expects that to happen immediately. And even the Chinese government is wary of making some of the free-market moves that would enable the renminbi to take its place alongside the dollar, euro and Japanese yen as a fully convertible reserve currency. Still, over the last year Beijing has begun to gradually loosen its tight currency controls. For the first time, for example, American companies like McDonald's and Caterpillar have been allowed to finance their China projects by selling renminbi-denominated bonds in Hong Kong. Richard Lavin, a group president at Caterpillar, said his company's $150 million Hong Kong offering last November was less expensive than taking out a loan in China or raising the money in dollars and then converting those dollars into renminbi. The bonds were issued to help finance Caterpillar's equipment leasing business in China. ''This was a successful issue,'' Mr. Lavin said. ''Before, we were funding our operations by bringing in dollars and changing them to RMB.'' Meanwhile, in Russia, Vietnam and Thailand, some cross-border trades with China can now be settled in renminbi, so that trading partners do not have to convert in and out of dollars. One pilot program lets Russian companies like Sportmaster, a retail chain based in Moscow, buy or sell goods using Chinese currency. And in New York, the Chinese government has permitted an overseas branch of Bank of China to accept deposits in renminbi. That enables depositors outside China to bet on a currency that is widely expected to appreciate against the dollar over the next few years. ''This is all encouraging the internationalization of the renminbi,'' Kelvin Lau, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank who is based in Hong Kong, said of Beijing's recent moves. ''They want to make the Chinese currency a popular currency.'' At Thursday's exchange rates, renminbi were trading just below 6.59 to the United States dollar -- a level that many experts say values the Chinese currency artificially low, as a result of Beijing's intervention efforts. Five years ago, the renminbi was trading at slightly more than 8 to the dollar. Beyond mere bragging rights, China has economic motives for trying to go global with the renminbi. Analysts say the moves, if successful, could strengthen China's influence in overseas financial markets and begin to erode the dollar's dominance. Beijing could also eventually reap the rewards, like cheaper debt financing, that come with being recognized as a world reserve currency. Global investors eager to bet on China's growth story, meanwhile, could find that looser controls on the renminbi make it easier to invest directly in bonds and other assets denominated in renminbi. And importers and exporters could reduce their currency-fluctuation risks by settling China-related trade deals in renminbi rather than dollars or euros. Robert A. Mundell, a Nobel laureate economist whose research is credited with helping develop the euro, says the renminbi's rise is all but inevitable. ''The RMB is likely to become a reserve currency in the future, even if the government of China does nothing about it,'' Professor Mundell said in an e-mail response to questions. He noted that the renminbi was already a regional currency in Southeast Asia, where China had become the dominant trading partner of many countries. If China does eventually open its capital market by eliminating currency exchange controls, he said, ''the progress of the RMB as an international currency will be assured.'' But analysts caution that right now the renminbi is far from ready to mount a serious challenge to the United States dollar as the world's leading reserve currency. For one thing, China needs to assure investors that its political system is stable and that its economy still has plenty of growth ahead. For all its rapid growth over the last 30 years, China remains relatively poor compared with the United States, the Europe Union or Japan.</text></article>

Revenue, including sales from company-owned restaurants and royalties from franchisees and other fees, rose 4 percent, to $6.21 billion from $6.0 billion. McDonald’s said it expected its costs to rise 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year in the United States and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent in Europe. The chief financial officer, Peter J. Bensen, said McDonald’s would “raise prices where it makes sense” to offset some, but not all, of the cost increases. McDonald’s did not give a commodity forecast for Asia and its other markets. Diners around the world remain cautious with their spending on food away from home, and McDonald’s will be careful not to turn customers off with higher prices, Mr. Bensen said. McDonald’s raised prices last year in China to offset an increase in commodity costs there. It also increased prices in Britain to cover a Jan. 1 value-added tax increase. Analysts expect McDonald’s to make smaller increases than many rivals because it uses its size to its advantage. “They’re large enough to put some pressure on their suppliers and they also will, through direct price increases or perhaps changing portion sizes, try to pass some of it on to consumers,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer with OakBrook Investments. McDonald’s historically has been a strong performer in times of inflation. John Ivankoe, a J. P. Morgan analyst, said in a client note that McDonald’s was “the most insensitive to commodities” from an earnings-per-share perspective. Renovated stores, expanded value menus and new food items like lattes and smoothies appealed to diners and helped it increase its market share last quarter. McDonald’s said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.7 percent overall in December. They gained 2.6 percent in the United States, slid 0.5 percent in Europe and rose 8.9 percent for the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa. For January, the company expects global same-restaurant sales to increase 4 percent to 5 percent.The McDonald’s Corporation posted a 2.1 percent increase in fourth quarter profit on Monday and said it would raise prices this year to cover rising commodity costs.</text></article>

Her family has not spoken to her since May, when Ms. Sultana, 21, swapped her home life for a cashier’s job at McDonald’s.Her conservative brother berated Ms. Sultana for damaging the family’s honor by taking a job in which she interacts with men — and especially one that requires her to shed her burqa in favor of a short-sleeved McDonald’s uniform. Then he confiscated her uniform, slapped her across the face and threatened to break her legs if he saw her outside the home. Her family may be outraged, but they are also in need. Ms. Sultana donates her $100 monthly salary to supplement the household budget for expenses that the men in her family can no longer pay for, including school fees for her younger sisters. Ms. Sultana is part of a small but growing generation of lower-class young women here who are entering service-sector jobs to support their families, and by extension, pitting their religious and cultural traditions against economic desperation. The women are pressed into the work force not by nascent feminism but by inflation, which has spiked to 12.7 percent from 1.4 percent in the past seven years. As a result, one salary — the man’s salary — can no longer feed a family. “It’s not just the economic need, but need of the nation,” said Rafiq Rangoonwala, the chief executive officer of KFC Pakistan, who has challenged his managers to double the number of women in his work force by next year. “Otherwise, Pakistan will never progress. We’ll always remain a third-world country because 15 percent of the people cannot feed 85 percent of the population.” Female employment at KFC in Pakistan has risen 125 percent in the past five years. Several chains like McDonald’s and the supermarket behemoth Makro, where the number of women has quadrupled since 2006, have introduced free transit services for female employees to protect them from harassment and to help persuade them take jobs where they may face hostility. “We’re a society in transition,” said Zeenat Hisam, a senior researcher at the Pakistan Institute of Labor Education and Research. “Men in Pakistan haven’t changed, and they’re not changing as fast as our women. Men want to keep their power in their hand. “The majority of the people here believe in the traditional interpretation of Islam, and they get very upset because religious leaders tell them it’s not proper for women to go out and to work and to serve strange men.” More than 100 young women who recently entered service jobs told of continual harassment. At work, some women spend more time deflecting abuse from customers than serving them. On the way home, they are heckled in buses and condemned by neighbors. It is so common for brothers to confiscate their uniforms that McDonald’s provides women with three sets. “If I leave this job, everything would be O.K. at home,” Ms. Sultana said. “But then there’d be a huge impact on our house. I want to make something of myself, and for my sisters, who are at home and don’t know anything about the outside world.” So far, the movement of women into the service sector has been largely limited to Karachi. Elsewhere across Pakistan, women are still mostly relegated to their homes, or they take jobs in traditional labor settings like women-only stitching factories or girls’ schools, where salaries can be half of those in the service industry. Even the most trailblazing of companies, like KFC, still employ 90 percent men. Pakistan ranked 133rd out of the 134 countries on the 2010 Global Gender Gap Report’s list of women’s economic participation. While there is no reliable data on the number of women who specifically enter the service sector, Pakistan’s female work force hovers around 20 percent, among the lowest of any Muslim country. Some women, like Saima, 22, are forced to lead secret lives to earn $175 a month. Her father’s shopkeeper’s salary does not cover the family’s expenses. Without a university degree, the only job Saima could find was at a call center of a major restaurant’s delivery department. But she impressed the manger so much that he offered her a higher-paying waitress job at a branch near her home. She reluctantly agreed, but pleaded to be sent to a restaurant two hours away so she would not be spotted by family members and neighbors. After three years, her family still thinks she works in the basement of a call center. On several occasions, she served old friends who did not recognize her without a head scarf. Her confidence has soared, but she is overwhelmed with guilt. “I’ve completely changed myself here,” she said in the corner booth of her restaurant before her co-workers arrived. “But honestly, I’m not happy with what I’m doing.”</text></article>

Still, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany gets to the point by calling for greater harmony and competitiveness of the euro-zone (or for that matter the whole of the European Union). Europe’s economic clout cannot be sustained by relying on common euro-zone bonds and other financial mechanisms designed to shore up the weak countries. Nor could it be strengthened by a new E.U. expansion project as suggested by four foreign ministers in your pages (“Europe, look outward again,” Views, Dec. 11). It’s like the Republicans in the United States calling for tax cuts and assuming that Wall Street will take care of itself for the good of the nation. Europe needs a new economic agenda to revive the capacity of existing member states.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/opinion/20mon4.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Not So Happy Meals<date>Published: December 19, 2010</date><text>It’s standard marketing: pitch your product to the most easily persuadable. Or as Roy Bergold, a former McDonald’s head of advertising, argued once: “Go after kids.” McDonald’s has done just that with the Happy Meal, a choice of burgers, nuggets, fries and other specialties with a must-have toy. According to a recent consumer survey, 37 percent of kids rank McDonald’s as the top fast-food restaurant. This is nearly four times as many as those favoring the No. 2 chain, Subway. The key is heavy advertising to children — Happy Meals account for about 10 percent of McDonald’s ad spending— and, of course, the toys. A Happy Meal of cheeseburger with fries and soda packs 640 calories, more than half the U.S.D.A. daily allowance for a sedentary child aged 4 to 8, as well as about half the allotment of fat. McDonald’s has added healthier choices to its menu — things like milk and Apple Dippers with low-fat caramel dip. But a study at 44 McDonald’s outlets from the Center for Science in the Public Interest found that French fries were automatically put in the bag 93 percent of the time. The Happy Meal is up for some well-deserved scrutiny. Last week a mom from Sacramento filed a class-action suit supported by the center to make McDonald’s stop using toys as bait to lure children. Last month, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a measure requiring that meals sold with toys meet a minimum standard of nutrition. McDonald’s chief executive, Jim Skinner, has pushed back at what he calls the “food police,” arguing that these actions seek to deprive families of choice. A company spokeswoman told us, “We are proud of our Happy Meals and intend to vigorously defend our brand, our reputation and our food.” Parents are responsible for their children’s diet. And they certainly could do a better job: almost 17 percent of American children are obese, three times as many as in the 1970s. But it would be easier for parents to do their job if they didn’t have to push back against the relentless tide of marketing aimed at their children.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/us/04happy.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Happy Meals Must Be Healthy Meals, Restaurants Told<date>Published: November 3, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Lost in the nationwide electoral tumult Tuesday was another important vote, this one by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, which took on one of the great (tasting) issues of our day: the Happy Meal.The board, whose political leanings can sometimes fall somewhere between Democrat and Dadaist, passed a ban on restaurant toy giveaways unless the aforementioned meals meet certain healthy nutritional standards for calories, sodium and fat. The bill, which passed 8 to 3, was sponsored by Supervisor Eric Mar, who had recounted how he had been horrified by his daughter’s collection of giveaway toys and envisioned the bill as a way to strike a blow against fatty, salty fast food. Mr. Mar said he hoped it would act as an incentive to fast-food companies to “provide better choices.” McDonald’s called the bill misguided. “It’s not what our customers want,” said Danya Proud, a spokeswoman for the company, in a statement. “Nor is it something they asked for.” Nor did the ban please Mayor Gavin Newsom, who was elected the state’s lieutenant governor on Tuesday and had said he would veto the bill, though the eight “yes” votes would be enough to override. “The mayor firmly believes this the wrong approach to fighting childhood obesity,” said Tony Winnicker, a spokesman for the mayor. But the board, which has often had a contentious relationship with the soon-to-be-former mayor, said its decision was backed by some unhappy facts, including a recent finding that nearly 30 percent of city fifth graders were overweight. San Francisco is not the first place to ban such toys; Santa Clara County, to the south, did so in April. Under the bill, any meals will have to have fewer than 600 calories, fewer than 640 milligrams of sodium and less than 35 percent of calories from fat (with an exception for some healthy items, like nuts). Restaurants can either match those standards, or no toy for you.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/30/us/politics/30ohio.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Workers Are Told Whom to Vote For<date>Published: October 29, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — When workers in a McDonald’s restaurant in Canton, Ohio, opened their paychecks this month, they found a pamphlet urging them to vote for the Republican candidates for governor, Senate and Congress, or possibly face financial repercussions.The pamphlet appeared calculated to intimidate workers into voting for Republican candidates by making a direct reference to their wages and benefits, said Allen Schulman, a Democrat who is president of the Canton City Council and said he obtained a copy of the pamphlet on Wednesday. The pamphlet said: “If the right people are elected, we will be able to continue with raises and benefits at or above the current levels. If others are elected, we will not.” It then named three Republican candidates after stating, “The following candidates are the ones we believe will help our business move forward.” The store’s owner, Paul Siegfried, did not return a call for comment, but a spokesman for McDonald’s USA, the parent company, said: “It was an unfortunately lapse in judgment on Mr. Siegfried’s part. He’s disappointed with himself.” The spokesman, Joe Woods, e-mailed a statement on Mr. Siegfried’s behalf. “For those that I have offended, I sincerely apologize,” the statement said. Mr. Woods said Mr. Siegfried’s action did not represent the policy of McDonald’s. Mr. Schulman, who is a lawyer, said that distribution of the pamphlet — which was printed on a McDonald’s letterhead — violates a 1953 Ohio statute that prohibits political material from being attached to wage envelopes. He declined to comment on how he got a copy, or who gave it to him, but said it was distributed to employees within the past week. He said he had forwarded a copy to the authorities in Canton, requesting that they investigate. Joe Martuccio, the law director for the city of Canton, said by telephone on Friday he was in the process of determining whether the distribution occurred within city limits and whether he had the authority to investigate. “We have to determine the facts first,” he said. The incident came as liberal voting-rights groups expressed concern that conservative complaints about fraudulent voting would lead to a reduced turnout on Election Day. Some Tea Party members have announced plans to question voters at the polls whom they suspect of being ineligible. The incident also highlighted how fraught politics have become just days before the midterm elections in Ohio, a key battleground state, where incumbent Democrats are struggling for their survival.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07insure.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">U.S. Waivers After Threats of Lost Health Coverage<date>Published: October 6, 2010</date><text>As Obama administration officials put into place the first major wave of changes under the health care legislation, they have tried to defuse stiffening resistance — from companies like McDonald’s and some insurers — by granting dozens of waivers to maintain even minimal coverage far below the new law’s standards.The waivers have been issued in the last several weeks as part of a broader strategic effort to stave off threats by some health insurers to abandon markets, drop out of the business altogether or refuse to sell certain policies. Among those that administration officials hoped to mollify with waivers were some big insurers, some smaller employers and McDonald’s, which went so far as to warn that the regulations could force it to strip workers of existing coverage. At a time when the midterm elections are looming and Republicans have been vocal in campaigning against the law, reaction to the rollout has been closely watched. To date, the administration has given about 30 insurers, employers and union plans, responsible for covering about one million people, one-year waivers on the new rules that phase out annual limits on coverage for limited-benefit plans, also known as “mini-meds.” Applicants said their premiums would increase significantly, in some cases doubling or more. These early exemptions offer the first signs of how the administration may tackle an even more difficult hurdle: the resistance from insurers and others against proposed regulations that will determine how much insurers spend on consumers’ health care versus administrative overhead, a major cornerstone of the law. Several leading insurers, including WellPoint, Aetna and Cigna, have also objected to new rules requiring them to cover even those children who are seriously ill, warning that they will stop selling new policies in some states because the rules do not protect them from having to cover too many sick children. “The hardest part of health reform is always going to be the transition,” said Peter T. Harbage, a former state health official who is a policy consultant in Sacramento. He predicts more insurers and employers will lean on the government to delay or weaken the new regulations. “I think this pressure just increases until we get to 2014,” he said, referring to the year that the law will fully go into effect. How much the administration can, or should, compromise in ways that could dilute the effect of the new law in the next few years is a subject of much debate, depending on the politics from state to state or the economic dynamics in a particular market. Policy experts say much of the authority to enforce the new law rests with the states, and they say the federal government may have little ultimate control over whether insurers will keep offering coverage in specific markets. Nancy-Ann DeParle, the director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, acknowledged that the concessions given to companies and insurers reflected attempts to avoid having people lose their current coverage before the full law goes into effect while meeting the aim of improving that coverage. “It is a balancing act,” Ms. DeParle said. “The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014.” The waivers issued so far include the policies offered by McDonald’s to its fast-food workers, typically capped at just a few thousand dollars, sold by a profit-making company owned by Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. As a result of the administration’s efforts, McDonald’s says it is “confident that we’ll continue to provide health care coverage for our 30,000 hourly restaurant employees.” Aetna and Cigna have also received waivers to continue selling limited-benefit policies, according to the list released by the Department of Health and Human Services, as have small employers like Sanderson Plumbing Products and Guy C. Lee Manufacturing. HealthMarkets, which offers policies through MEGA Life and Health and other insurers, says it also plans to apply for a waiver for some of its plans. Some states, like Iowa and Maine, have already said they might seek additional authority from federal officials to exempt some insurers, at least for a time, because of the potential disruption if carriers leave the market over the new standards on medical spending. “We have some very small carriers in the state,” said Susan E. Voss, the Iowa insurance commissioner, who said she favored letting state regulators decide whether some carriers should be given more leeway. The state has already lost some carriers, including the Principal Financial Group, which announced its decision last week. The new standards may prove a challenge to the administration in its attempt to protect the limited-benefit plans. Under the legislation, insurers are required to spend at least 85 cents of every dollar in premiums on the welfare of their customers, and many of these plans spend far less.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/economy/06leonhardt.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Health Care Law’s Uneven Path to Better Insurance<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>Consider what it would be like to have a health insurance plan that capped annual benefits at $2,000. For any medical care costing more than that, you would have to pay out of pocket.Examples of care that costs more than $2,000 — and often a lot more — include virtually any cancer treatment, any heart surgery, a year’s worth of diabetes treatment and care for many broken bones. Even a single M.R.I. exam can cost more than $2,000. A typical hospital stay runs thousands of dollars more. So does this insurance plan sound like part of the solution for the country’s health care system — or part of the problem? A $2,000 plan happens to be one of the main plans that McDonald’s offers its employees. It became big news last week, when The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was worried the plan would run afoul of a provision in the new health care law. In response to the provision, McDonald’s threatened to drop the coverage altogether, until the Obama administration signaled it would grant some exemptions. This episode was only the latest disruption that the health law seems to be causing. Also last week, the Principal Financial Group said it was getting out of the health insurance business, while other insurers have said they might stop offering certain types of coverage. With each new disruption come loud claims — some from insurance executives — that the health overhaul is damaging American health care. On the surface, these claims can sound credible. But when you dig a little deeper, you often discover the same lesson that the McDonald’s case provides: the real problem was the status quo. American families spend almost twice as much on health care — through premiums, paycheck deductions and out-of-pocket expenses — as families in any other country. In exchange, we receive top-notch specialty care in many areas. Yet on the whole, we do not get much better care than countries that spend far less. We don’t live as long as people in Canada, Japan, most of Western Europe or even relatively poor Jordan. Misdiagnosis is common. Medical errors occur more often than in some other countries. Unique to the developed world, millions of people have no health insurance, and millions more, like many fast-food workers, are underinsured. In choosing their health reform plan, President Obama and the Democrats eschewed radical changes, for better or worse, and instead tried to minimize the disruptions to the current system. Sometimes, Mr. Obama went so far as to suggest there would be no disruptions, saying that people could keep their current plan if they liked it. But that’s not quite right. It is not possible to change a system as huge, and as hugely flawed, as ours without some disruptions.  McDonald’s offers its hourly workers two different health care plans, which are known as “mini-med” plans. In one, workers can pay about $730 a year for benefits of up to $2,000. In the other, they can pay about $1,660 a year for benefits of up to $10,000, The Journal reported. In a memo to federal regulators, McDonald’s executives argued that their version of health insurance “positively impacts” the almost 30,000 workers who are covered. And that’s true. A plan with a $2,000 or $10,000 cap can cover some modest health problems and is better than being uninsured. But should the litmus test for American health care really be better than nothing? Mini-med plans force people to drain their savings accounts for dozens of common medical problems. They also force hospitals to let some bills go unpaid, which drives up costs for everyone else. Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has previously criticized AARP for marketing similarly limited plans to its members. “It’s not better than nothing,” Mr. Grassley argued, “to encourage people to buy something described as ‘health security’ when there’s no basic protection against high medical costs.” Dr. Aaron Carroll, an Indiana University pediatrics professor who studies health policy, says of mini-med plans: “They’re great if you’re healthy, because you feel like you’re covered. But if you ever need them, they’re so skimpy, they provide very little.” Gary Claxton of the Kaiser Family Foundation adds, “They really just shouldn’t be considered health insurance.” The plans’ skimpiness is the main reason they ran into legal jeopardy. Under the new law, most plans must spend at least 85 percent of their revenue on medical care, rather than administrative overhead. The McDonald’s plans aren’t generous enough to clear the hurdle. At the same time, it’s probably unrealistic to expect McDonald’s to give workers decent health insurance. Many of those workers make less than $20,000 a year. A typical family insurance plan would raise their total compensation by more than half, destroying the McDonald’s business model.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/health/policy/01insure.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Principal Financial to Stop Selling Health Insurance<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>The Principal Financial Group announced on Thursday that it planned to stop selling health insurance, another sign of upheaval emerging among insurers as the new federal health law starts to take effect. The company, based in Iowa, provides coverage to about 840,000 people who receive their insurance through an employer. Principal’s decision closely tracks moves by other insurers that have indicated in recent weeks that they plan to drop out of certain segments of the market, like the business of selling child-only policies. State regulators say some insurance companies are already threatening to leave particular markets because of the new law. And some regulators in states like Maine and Iowa have asked the Obama administration to give insurers more time to comply with some of the new rules. “What you’re seeing is the beginning of some serious math and some posturing,” said Len Nichols, a health economist and policy expert at George Mason University. While some insurers, like Principal, are choosing to leave the business rather than make the necessary investments to stay, others may be simply trying to delay some of the new rules or overturn them, he said. McDonald’s recently asked federal officials for an exemption to rules that would ban the kind of health plans many of its restaurant workers have, because the existing policies sharply limit coverage. The McDonald’s push was first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night. A McDonald’s spokeswoman declined to comment on that report, and the company has denied any intention of dropping coverage for its employees. So far, the administration has signaled at least some willingness to listen. In the case of McDonald’s, federal health officials told the insurer responsible for providing these plans that it would not be affected by new rules prohibiting annual limits on coverage. The new waiver will allow McDonald’s and other companies to continue offering such plans, which cap benefits, to their workers. The administration has already issued dozens of such waivers, as insurers and companies try to influence proposals for regulations to put the law in place. As far as giving insurers continued leeway to sell more restrictive coverage than the legislation intended, administration officials say they are trying to ensure that people do not lose their benefits before 2014, when the law is fully in effect. “It’s the best some people can do right now, and we don’t want to disrupt it,” said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who heads the Office of Health Reform at the White House. She emphasized that the administration had been working closely with insurers and employers to deal with their concerns and objections to some of the rules. “I think we’re working together very constructively,” she said. McDonald’s, which confirmed that its insurance carrier received a waiver from the government on annual limits, says it is negotiating with federal officials and others to determine how best to maintain employee coverage. Many of its restaurant workers are covered under plans that do not provide broad protections and limit individual insurance coverage to a few thousand dollars a year. Such plans are known as mini-med or limited benefit policies. Medical bills beyond those limits have to be paid out of pocket by employees. The company and its franchises “are committed to finding a solution whereby we can continue to provide health care options,” said Danya Proud, McDonald’s spokeswoman. At the Principal Financial Group, the company’s decision reflected its assessment of its ability to compete in the environment created by the new law. “Now scale really matters,” said Daniel J. Houston, a senior executive at Principal, which is headquartered in Des Moines. “We don’t have a significant concentration in any one market.” Because Principal Financial is primarily in the business of asset management, it decided not to make the investments needed to remain competitive as a health insurer, Mr. Houston said. The company, which focused on plans sold to small businesses for their employees, does not participate in other markets, like selling policies to individuals or for people enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid. Other aspects of the health care regulations are worrying some state insurance commissioners, who fear that insurers are going to stop selling policies in some areas of coverage. For example, in the case of child-only policies, the new rules require insurers to offer coverage to even those children who are seriously ill, leading some insurers to balk at the idea that they will be forced to cover too many sick children. Aetna, Cigna and WellPoint, among others, have said they will stop selling new policies in some states. “Disruption in our marketplaces is a concern for insurance commissioners,” said Jane L. Cline, the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, who is also a West Virginia regulator. In the case of Principal Financial, UnitedHealth Group’s insurance plans have agreed to offer coverage to Principal’s customers. “They are clearly going to be a long-term player in this market,” Mr. Houston said. More insurers are likely to follow Principal’s lead, especially as they try to meet the new rules that require plans to spend at least 80 cents of every dollar they collect in premiums on the welfare of their customers. Many of the big insurers have been lobbying federal officials to forestall or drastically alter those rules. “It’s just going to drive the little guys out,” said Robert Laszewski, a health policy consultant in Alexandria, Va. Smaller players like Principal in states like Iowa, Missouri and elsewhere will not be able to compete because they do not have the resources and economies of scale of players like UnitedHealth, which is among the nation’s largest health insurers. Mr. Laszewski is worried that the ensuing concentration is likely to lead to higher prices because large players will no longer face the competition from the smaller plans. “It’s just the UnitedHealthcare full employment act,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/business/10mcdonalds.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Sales Rose in August<date>Published: September 9, 2010</date><text>August provided a lift for the fast-food chain McDonald’s, pushing a crucial revenue figure up 4.6 percent in the United States as customers came in for frappés and fruit smoothies.That figure, sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, is important for restaurant operators because it measures growth at existing locations and excludes stores that open or close during the year. But the results were not as strong as analysts had expected, largely because of weakness in Europe, and shares fell Thursday. McDonald’s said that sales figure for its restaurants around the world rose 4.9 percent. While that beat the growth of 2.2 percent in August 2009, it was down from the 5.7 percent increase in July — the biggest monthly increase since a 6.1 percent gain in April 2009. McDonald’s said the sales figure rose 2.2 percent in Europe on strong results in Britain and Russia. Limited items, like a summer barbecue food event in Britain, drove sales. In Asia and the Pacific, Middle East and Africa, those sales rose 7.8 percent, a contrast to a decline of 0.5 percent in the same period a year earlier. Countries with the strongest performances included Japan, China and Australia. The company said menu items that appealed to local tastes and convenience helped increase sales. Shares fell $1.71, or 2.3 percent, to close at $74.37. Performance in most places was strong, said Mark Kalinowski, an analyst at Janney Capital Markets, but “Europe was the culprit.” He had expected revenue at locations open at least a year to rise 5.5 percent there. In a note to clients on Thursday, he said that results in Europe could have been low because France reduced its value-added tax on restaurant meals last year. That spurred a sales gain in August 2009, which created a tougher comparison, he said. Revenue rose 4.7 percent over all, but the company did not give a revenue figure. The company said it tentatively plans to release its third-quarter results on Oct. 21.</text></article>

Stock Price Isn't Royal<date>September 1, 2010, 3:29 pm</date><text>As Burger King holds talks with prospective buyers, including Brazilian-backed 3G Capital, it’s worth looking at how the buyout-backed fast food giant has performed since going public again in 2006. The answer: not well at all, especially compared with arch rival McDonald’s. Excluding the jump in Burger King’s stock price on Wednesday, thanks to reports of the company’s deal talks, shares in the fast food royal were actually down significantly since going public in May 2006. By Standard &amp; Poor’s reckoning, Burger King shares had fallen about 6 percent before Wednesday’s reports. (Thanks to the news, Burger King shares are now trading above the company’s initial offer price.) During the same time period, McDonald’s shares have jumped 111 percent. Taken private by TPG Capital, Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners in 2002, Burger King went public again in 2006 — but raised $425 million, short of the $600 million it had aimed for. (It isn’t the worst performing of the major publicly held fast food retailers, however. The Wendy’s/Arby’s Group, which counts Nelson W. Peltz among its biggest investors, is down 76 percent during the same time period.) Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/science/24ants.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Diet for Desert Ants in Art Display<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>Elizabeth Demaray, an artist based in Brooklyn, is at the counter at a McDonald’s in Midtown Manhattan. She is ordering up a storm. Cheeseburger. Apple dippers. Chicken nuggets. French fries. Baked apple pie. A strawberry shake.The shake is unavailable. “Then make it a strawberry smoothie — in your largest size.” Whether the red harvester ant Pogonomyrmex badius will enjoy this food is the subject of her current exhibition — “Corpor Esurit, or we all deserve a break today” — at Exit Art on Tenth Avenue and 36th Street through Wednesday. For one month, the ants, which usually thrive on seeds, are being fed a steady diet of McDonald’s Happy Meals. They even get the toys. The ants are housed in a roughly 6-by-10-foot plexiglass farm that is packed with Perlite pebbles and sealed with clear packing tape and nylon panty hose — “for gnat abatement,” Ms. Demaray said. The food is placed in a numbered grid on the floor of the feeding area. Ms. Demaray worked hand in hand with Dr. Christine Johnson, a scientific assistant at the American Museum of Natural History who specializes in ant research. This gallery offering may appeal to followers of the art world. Ms. Demaray’s goal is to stage a commentary on the effects of the American diet on the creatures that depend on us for food. But scientists bring a different lens. “My first response as a scientist would be bafflement as to why Pogonomyrmex was chosen,” Dr. Colin S. Brent, a research entomologist with the federal Department of Agriculture, wrote in an e-mail. “They might enjoy the sesame seeds on the buns, but that would be about it.” Ants of the genus Pogonomyrmex are desert seed harvesters known for their deep nests and toxic venom, not the kind of ants that intrude on a picnic. Dr. Michael S. Engel, a paleontologist and entomologist at the University of Kansas and a co-author, with David Grimaldi, of the sweeping book “Evolution of the Insects,” said the exhibit sounded fascinating but added, “If I had to toss in a particular group of ants into an enclosure to see how well they were going to thrive off of junk food, I’d throw in generalist carnivores and omnivores like army ants.” Pogonomyrmex, or “Pogos,” as they are affectionately known in the trade, are more selective eaters. Though mostly granivores, Pogonomyrmex badius workers will sometimes patrol for dead insects and termites to bring to the colony after a desert rain. At the gallery last week, many of the ants were dead. A few looked disoriented. This exhibit lacks a queen and brood, so the workers are leading a life devoid of its fundamental purpose. Bert Hölldobler, an Arizona State University professor who won the 1991 Pulitzer Prize with E. O. Wilson for their definitive book, “The Ants,” said by e-mail, “I have been asked repeatedly to help artists to fill their creations with ants. Some of the proposals were quite mind-boggling.” He added, “When we keep them in the laboratory, we pay very close attention to simulate their ecological requirements as closely as we can.” A whitewashed art gallery is a far cry from the ants’ ecological niche, but the craterlike nests in the tank have small, circular entrances that are particular to Pogonomyrmex badius. And while there is little foraging activity, the ants seem to be eking out an existence on apple slices and, apparently, the chicken nuggets — which on inspection seem to be totally excavated of meat.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/business/10mcdonalds.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">New Drinks Help Lift U.S. Sales for McDonald’s<date>Published: August 9, 2010</date><text>CHICAGO (AP) — The McDonald’s Corporation posted on Monday its biggest monthly increase in two years of a crucial American sales figure, saying its new fruit smoothies and frappés were a hit with customers during a hot and steamy July.In the United States, sales at restaurants open at least 13 months climbed 5.7 percent — the company’s biggest monthly increase since it reported a 6.7 percent gain in July 2008. Over all, the measure rose 7 percent around the world. It climbed 5.3 percent in Europe and 10.1 percent in the rest of the world, the company, the world’s largest hamburger chain, said in a statement on Monday. The figure is considered an important gauge of a restaurant chain’s performance because it excludes the effects of restaurants that open or close during the year. Shares of McDonald’s rose 1.6 percent, to $72.92, on Monday. McDonald’s is based in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, Ill. It has more than 32,000 restaurants around the world in 100 countries. About 14,000 of its locations are in the United States.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/technology/15starbux.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Starbucks to Offer Free Wi-Fi<date>Published: June 14, 2010</date><text>Many coffee shops try to discourage people from buying a cup of coffee and then lingering for hours to use the free Internet access. Starbucks will soon encourage them to stay as long as they want.The company said on Monday that as of July 1, its stores in the United States would offer free Wi-Fi, via AT&amp;T, that anyone can reach with a single click. In case customers run out of distractions on the Web, Starbucks is giving them even more reason to sit and browse, offering free online articles, music, videos and local information through a partnership with Yahoo. Starbucks has been squeezed lately by competition from both independent specialty coffee shops, which have long offered free Wi-Fi, and big chains like McDonald’s, which added it this year. “Starbucks hit back,” said Chris Brogan, president of New Marketing Labs, a social media marketing agency, who blogs about working on the go. “They said, ‘Not only do we have free Wi-Fi, but we’re going to offer this huge raft of digital products you can get while you’re here, and you like our coffee better anyway.’ ” Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, who made the announcement at a conference in New York, described it as a way to bridge the online world and real-world coffee outlets. Of course, people have been bridging those worlds for years, using coffee shops as pseudo-offices by bringing their laptops and borrowing free Internet connections. But Starbucks has never offered unlimited free Internet access. Customers who bought and registered a Starbucks card and used it in the last month have been able to use the Web for two hours, after a somewhat complicated log-in process. Cardholders who wanted to use the Web for more than two hours paid $3.99 for another two-hour session, and customers without cards who wanted to go online faced the same charge for an initial two-hour session. Starbucks is making the change as many coffeehouses experiment with ways to cut off squatters who browse and do not spend. Some post signs asking people to continue buying food and drinks if they stay, while the more aggressive ones cover their power outlets with tape so people cannot charge their laptops. Other coffeehouse owners say Wi-Fi detracts from the atmosphere they are trying to foster. Four Barrel Coffee in San Francisco has no Wi-Fi or power outlets for customer use. “We all have had experiences of working at cafes where the laptops just took over, and it started to feel more like a library,” said Jodi Geren, head of operations for Four Barrel. “We just really feel like it’s important for people to talk to each other.” Those who bring laptops to Starbucks now average an hour of Wi-Fi use, and the company does not expect that the free access and content will make people linger longer, said Stephen Gillett, chief information officer at Starbucks and general manager of a unit called Digital Ventures, which will oversee the new offerings. He said that Starbucks purposely kept video and music clips short. The coffee chain is catering in part to people who are out of work and need a place to perfect their résumés or do freelance jobs. In January, the company announced that same-store sales increased 4 percent after months of steady declines. Starbucks attributes the improvement, which came before consumer spending rebounded as a whole, in part to its role as an office for the unemployed. The new partnership with Yahoo, which is called the Starbucks Digital Network, will include an online section on business and careers that will include tools for people searching for jobs or writing résumés, Mr. Gillett said. “We expect this to be a very versatile tool for people who are using Starbucks for what we call the third place, between home and work,” he said. Customers will also get free access to paid Web sites, like those of The Wall Street Journal and Zagat, free iTunes downloads and previews of not-yet-released movies and albums. They will see local content based on the coffee shop’s location, like news from Patch, AOL’s local news site, check-ins on Foursquare and neighborhood photos on Flickr. For publishers and Web sites, the free content will serve as a marketing tool, Mr. Gillett said, letting customers sample things they might be willing to pay for later. The digital network could also serve as a virtual storefront, Mr. Brogan said. He imagines Starbucks using it to sell songs and virtual goods, or to offer loyalty points for online shopping. “If you have eight people sitting in a store for four hours on one cup of coffee, that’s not moving revenue,” he said. “However, if that same group is there for four hours on one cup of coffee and buys 14 songs, that’s sales.” Starbucks is not disclosing the terms of its agreements with the content providers, including whether they are paying Starbucks or sharing revenue if customers make purchases, said Tamra Strentz, a spokeswoman. Many coffeehouses, including Grounded in the West Village, a storefront one block from a Starbucks, offer free Wi-Fi to differentiate themselves from Starbucks. “It’s definitely been an attraction,” said David Litman, the manager of Grounded. Still, he said he doubted that Wi-Fi at Starbucks would be a threat. “This is a very neighborhood place — there is a Starbucks on the next avenue, but people like to support us.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/business/09mcdonalds.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Offers Cash in Recall of Shrek Glasses<date>Published: June 8, 2010</date><text>McDonald’s is taking the unusual step of paying customers a premium to return Shrek drinking glasses that it has recalled because of concerns that cadmium used in the paint on the glasses could come off on children’s hands.The company will pay customers $3 for every glass they return. The company had been selling the glasses for $1.99 with a food purchase and $2.49 without food. It announced on Friday that it was recalling millions of the glasses, which are painted with characters from the movie “Shrek Forever After.” “It’s highly unusual to see a company that executes a recall pay any premium over the regular purchase price,” said Don Mays, senior director of product safety for Consumer Reports. He said that only 10 to 30 percent of consumers responded in a typical recall. “If you offer a premium, it’s more apt to get consumers to respond to a recall and helps to get those unsafe products out of somebody’s home,” Mr. Mays said. McDonald’s gave further details about the recall on Tuesday, including the price it would pay for returned glasses. It said customers could bring the glasses into any of its restaurants beginning on Wednesday and receive refunds in cash. They are not required to bring a receipt. The premium was meant to account partly for taxes that customers may have paid, said Ashlee Yingling, a McDonald’s spokeswoman. “We are making sure our customers are fairly compensated for the recall experience,” she said in an e-mail message. While 12 million of the Shrek glasses were intended for distribution in the United States, about 7.5 million were sold to consumers, the company said last week. McDonald’s announced the recall after the Consumer Product Safety Commission said that tests on the glasses showed that low levels of cadmium, a heavy metal identified as a carcinogen, could come off on the hands of a person holding the glasses. The commission said, however, that the glasses were not considered toxic and that the risk to children was low. The level of cadmium in the glasses, according to the commission, was much lower than the level of the metal found in some children’s jewelry that prompted three recalls earlier this year, including the recall of 55,000 necklaces sold at Wal-Mart. In the case of the jewelry, officials worried that children could suck on pieces or swallow them and that high levels of cadmium could be absorbed into their bodies. The federal government has set a limit for the amount of cadmium that can be used in toys. The safety commission is working to set acceptable levels for other products. Long-term exposure to cadmium has been associated with a variety of health problems, including kidney and bone ailments. While the recalled jewelry was made in China, the recalled glassware was manufactured in the United States, by Arc International. Walt Riker, a McDonald’s spokesman, said last week that the company did not know where the paint used on the glasses came from, but he said that it did not come from China. Cadmium is used in some paints to make bright colors, but industry representatives said that it was unusual for paints containing cadmium to be used in consumer products like glassware. “To me the whole thing about the McDonald’s glasses is very much a mystery, and why they would be putting cadmium pigments in there,” said Hugh Morrow, a consultant for the International Cadmium Association and a former president of the trade group in North America. “Our position is that cadmium pigments should not be painted on consumer glasses.” Meanwhile, McDonald’s announced on Tuesday that sales at stores in the United States that were open at least 13 months rose 3.4 percent in May, compared with those in the month a year earlier. The company said that the sales increase was due in part to the popularity of Shrek-themed promotions for its Chicken McNuggets and Happy Meals. The statement on the monthly results did not mention whether the glassware promotion, which began on May 21, had also lifted sales.McDonald’s is taking the unusual step of paying customers a premium to return Shrek drinking glasses that it has recalled because of concerns that cadmium used in the paint on the glasses could come off on children’s hands.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/05/business/05recall.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s to Recall Glasses, Citing Cadmium<date>Published: June 4, 2010</date><text>Could cadmium be the new lead? Some parents and consumer advocates think so.Fears about cadmium exposure prompted McDonald’s on Friday to announce a costly recall of 12 million promotional drink glasses featuring cartoon characters from the movie “Shrek Forever After.” The paint on the glasses, which were sold for $2 each, contained traces of cadmium, which can cause cancer and other ailments. The Consumer Products Safety Commission said that the risk to children from the glasses was low. But the action comes on the heels of three recalls this year of children’s jewelry containing cadmium, including the recall in January of 55,000 necklaces sold at Wal-Mart stores. Don Mays, senior director of product safety for Consumer Reports, said cadmium was being used in some manufactured goods to replace lead, which has been eliminated from many products in response to heavy regulation and widespread health concerns. Many of those goods were once commonly associated with lead, like paint and inexpensive jewelry. “We’re just starting to see this,” Mr. Mays said. “It’s starting to creep into a lot of consumer products that never had it before.” But government regulation of cadmium in household products has lagged. Federal rules currently set a maximum cadmium level only for toys. Scott Wolfson, a spokesman for the Consumer Products Safety Commission, said the agency was now working to establish similar requirements for other products, like jewelry, where a child could be exposed to cadmium by sucking or swallowing. Ailments associated with long-term exposure to cadmium include cancer, kidney problems and weakened bones. The safety commission said that the level of cadmium in the McDonald’s glasses was far lower than what it found in the previously recalled jewelry and that consequently the glasses represented a much lower risk. “Both C.P.S.C. and McDonald’s are being highly protective of children in announcing this recall,” Mr. Wolfson said. He said the level of cadmium in the glasses was “slightly above” the level the agency was considering for its new regulations. Tests indicated that small amounts of the metal could wipe off onto the hand of someone holding the glasses, although the agency refused to provide more specific results. Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who has sponsored legislation to increase regulation of cadmium in children’s jewelry, said the presence of the element in the glasses was a significant concern. “I think I would be deeply troubled if a glass my child was holding had residue of a known carcinogen that got into their fingertips and they licked their fingers because they’d just had a McDonald’s French fry,” Ms. Speier said. She said she planned to change her proposed legislation to cover all children’s products, not just jewelry. McDonald’s said in a statement that it had tested the glasses when they were manufactured and that they met all regulations currently in place. But the restaurant chain said that in light of the safety commission’s “evolving assessment of standards for consumer products,” it had determined “in an abundance of caution that a voluntary recall of the ‘Shrek Forever After’ glassware is appropriate.” Walt Riker, a McDonald’s spokesman, said that 12 million glasses were intended for distribution in the United States and that about 7.5 million had gotten into the hands of consumers. He said the company would refund the $2 purchase price to consumers and that the company would provide information on its Web site next Tuesday on how to return the glasses. If all distributed glasses were returned, it would cost the company $15 million in refunds. Mr. Riker said McDonald’s had withdrawn advertising, including television ads, associated with the promotion. The glasses were manufactured in the United States by Arc International, a French company. In a statement, Arc said that all of its products “meet the highest standards of quality and safety.” “We therefore see this as an internal decision by McDonald’s and will be investigating the matter once we receive more information," the company said. The recall occurred after people concerned about toxic chemicals in the home tested the glasses with a device that could detect the presence of heavy metals like lead, cadmium and mercury. One of those people, a Massachusetts man, contacted Ms. Speier’s office on May 26. Ms. Speier asked the man to ship the glasses to her office and they were handed over to the safety commission for testing the next day. Ms. Speier’s office said the man did not want to be identified. At about the same time, a Los Angeles woman, Jennifer Taggart, bought some of the glasses for her 7-year-old son, Cole. Ms. Taggart, a lawyer who writes a blog about toxic chemicals in the home, regularly uses a hand-held device called an X-ray fluorescence analyzer to test items she uses from toys and shoes to kitchen gadgets. When the device signaled that the paint on the Shrek glasses contained cadmium, Ms. Taggart said she also contacted the safety commission. Ms. Taggart said she was an acquaintance of the Massachusetts man and they had exchanged e-mail about their findings. Some of the glasses were also sent to Jeffrey D. Weidenhamer, a chemistry professor at Ashland University in Ohio, who was involved in uncovering the high levels of cadmium in children’s jewelry. Professor Weidenhamer said he scraped some of the green paint off two of the glasses (Shrek is a green-skinned ogre) and conducted chemical tests. He said one glass showed a cadmium level of 670 parts per million and the other of 956 parts per million. The federal level for paint on toys sets a maximum of 75 parts per million. But Professor Weidenhamer said that despite those levels, the risk was modest. “The hazard is if it is ingested,” he said. “With a paint like this on a glass, the amounts that would be coming off would not be very much.”Could cadmium be the new lead? Some parents and consumer advocates think so.</text></article>

You could get all the girls.” The teenager smiles to himself as the slogan, “Come as you are,” appears. A spokesman for McDonald’s France said Wednesday that the advertisement was running only in France but would not comment further. The Web site Planet Homo criticized the company for featuring a young man who won’t disclose his sexuality to his father and added: “How this serves the gay community or McDonald’s for that matter is a mystery.

Now, he is strategically forging his own investment agenda, Reuters writes. The former wunderkind helped draft McDonald’s early sustainability practices and later turned the company’s emerging Mexican concept Chipotle into the industry standard for fresh fast food. Currently, his three-year-old growth capital firm, BeCause, is buying into sectors such as education and healthy food with positions in select companies such as the tutoring firm Sylvan Learning and restaurant startup Roti Mediterranean Grill. The investments are put through rigorous screens that test their prospects for both profitability and contribution to the greater good. When scrutinizing investments for BeCause, Lederhausen looks for businesses that can help tackle social problems ranging from rising obesity rates to dependence on fossil fuels, issues he is personally passionate about. Identifying the next big trend is not an exact science and neither are BeCause’s investment goals, which Lederhausen said usually fall between $2 million and $20 million. The firm has teamed up on some ventures with Chicago’s Sterling Partners, the $4-billion private equity firm known for its portfolio of educational ventures, including Sylvan, where Lederhausen serves as chairman. It has also done some deals with Boston-based venture capital firm Cue Ball. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>

Claim cappuccino, the East Village. Thank your Strawberry Fields, Central Park, for your flavor is strawberry. Sorry, SoHo, but you are plain old vanilla. These taste interpretations of four famous Manhattan neighborhoods come courtesy of German McDonald's, which introduced cupcakes at many of its restaurants here on March 30. Although they are a staple of bake sales and birthday parties across America, cupcakes were all but unknown in Germany until recently. To sell the unfamiliar treats to German consumers, McDonald's chose to push its connection to New York, home to fancy cupcake shops like Magnolia Bakery, which even some Germans know from dubbed reruns of ''Sex and the City.'' ''All of New York is crazy about the cult cupcakes and McCafe brings the hip little cakes to you,'' read the paper place mats at McCafe, the coffee shops found inside some McDonald's restaurants. ''The new cupcakes are all the rage for simply every occasion,'' it says about the ''trendy nibbles.'' The cupcakes themselves were rather small for the price of $2.40, and cold from the refrigerated display case, which made the icing hard. The cake itself was dense rather than fluffy and more sweet than flavorful. During a recent busy lunch hour at a McDonald's in downtown Regensburg, none of the customers had cupcakes on their trays. Simon Forster, 26, an engineering student from the city, agreed to sample a cupcake of his choosing, purchased for him by The New York Times. Mr. Forster, who stipulated that he had never knowingly consumed a cupcake but had seen them on television, bit into a chocolate Chelsea and gave a slight nod. ''Not bad,'' he said. Ultimately Mr. Forster judged the cupcake ''a little artificial,'' and said he would stick to the traditional Bavarian walnut pastries called Nussbeugerl. Perhaps it would have gone better if he had taken the advice from the McDonald's Web site, which recommended eating the chocolate cupcake by a harbor or a lake -- or in Regensburg perhaps sitting by the Danube River running through town -- to ''enjoy your personal Chelsea feeling.'' In an attempt to give readers and potential eaters a better sense of what that Chelsea feeling might be, the German Web site gives an explanation far more likely to disorient them: ''Chelsea was once terribly hip, then not again, and then once again it was. Was that too fast? Well, that's New York.'' The names featured on the Web site are not in the stores, but there was a blurry skyline shot on the promotional pictures that suggested Manhattan at night. The cupcakes, and the way McDonald's is pushing them to German buyers, are like little Rorschach tests of faraway views of the city. The East Village is ''where the most renowned artists come from'' and tourists now search ''in dozens of galleries for new art,'' while the cappuccino cupcake itself is ''great art.'' The cupcake, topped with a piece of chocolate shaped like a coffee bean, is pictured next to a young man wearing a gray hoodie and a bucket hat, who looked like he might be more comfortable in Brooklyn. But McDonald's chose not to venture into other boroughs for branding purchases, and does not offer de rigueur flavors like red velvet cake, which might have been a step too far from the traditional German palate. The owners of Cupcake Berlin, a shop in that city's Friedrichshain neighborhood, itself a little like the East Village a few years ago, down to the tobacco shops and young tourists, just celebrated their third anniversary in business and know well the perils of selling cupcakes to Germans, who at best call them muffins and in rarer instances are not even sure what to do with them. ''Someone came in once and asked if they were candles and whether you could eat them,'' said Daniel Bader, 33, who opened the store with his American companion. Mr. Bader admitted to having mixed feelings about the new McDonald's product line, but said that it was not really competition for their cupcakes, which were handmade on the premises with names like Fantasy Island, Pretty in Pink and the King, which, in honor of Elvis's favorite sandwich, has peanut butter frosting and a banana chip. ''If every German knows what a cupcake is, that's not bad at all,'' Mr. Bader said. But he said there were also perils to having Germans experience their first cupcake at McDonald's. ''I just hope they don't taste so terribly that people say, 'Cupcakes suck.' '' PHOTOS: McDonald's has begun selling cupcakes at many of its restaurants in Germany. The four flavors are named after Manhattan neighborhoods, although the connection seems a little tenous. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY OLIVER HARTUNG FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/business/media/31adco.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Marketers in Warm-Up for World Cup<date>Published: March 30, 2010</date><text>ALTHOUGH March Madness still has a weekend to go, advertisers are already gearing up for June and July Jubilation.The 2010 World Cup, to be held in South Africa from June 11 to July 11, has attracted a lengthy list of blue-chip sponsors seeking to capitalize on the global passion for soccer — or, as they say outside the United States, football. Marketers are starting to disclose details of their ads or, in some instances, introducing elements of their soccer-centric campaigns. Among those marketers are Adidas, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nike and Visa. The ardor for the World Cup is another example of how advertisers are stepping up support for marquee televised events, known as big event TV. Programs like the Grammy Awards, the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the Oscars have set ratings records or attracted significantly more viewers than in recent years. The strategy is “big voices in big places,” said Christopher J. Perry, interim head of marketing at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, Calif., and “we feel we’re reaping a lot of benefits from it.” Hyundai, which sponsored the broadcasts of the Super Bowl, on CBS, and the Academy Awards, on ABC, has a deal to be the exclusive automotive sponsor of the ABC and ESPN coverage of the World Cup, Mr. Perry said, which will be extended into print, online and radio. This dovetails with a deal for the Hyundai Motor America parent in South Korea, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, to become the exclusive automotive global sponsor of the event, which was struck with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA.  Powerade, sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is focusing its first worldwide integrated marketing campaign — for TV, print, online and outdoors — on the brand’s status as the official sports drink of the 2010 World Cup. The ads will even include a phrase proclaiming that Powerade was “chosen by FIFA to hydrate the 2010 FIFA World Cup players.” The campaign is to run in countries that account for more than 95 percent of Powerade’s sales volume, which include Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, South Korea and the United States. The campaign will also promote Powerade’s scheduled presence on the pitch — as they say in soccer — in the form of new squeeze bottles for the players at the 10 stadiums. And signs bearing the Powerade logo are to be posted around the stadiums. “Major sporting events, big-event television, are a wonderful platform,” said Mark Greatrex, senior vice president for global still beverages at Coca-Cola in Atlanta. They also can help “drive global scale for our big brands” as part of an initiative, called 2020 Vision, to more than double systemwide revenue, Mr. Greatrex said. “As we look at the sports-drink category out over the next 10 years,” he added, “there’s a lot of untapped potential” among dedicated athletes. “Part of the strategy is to build up the sports credentials of Powerade,” he said, which is where the FIFA relationship comes in. “We are making a big deal of the FIFA endorsement in every touch point,” he added, whether it is a sign in a convenience store, a Powerade channel on YouTube (youtube.com/powerade), a commercial or a poster. The campaign, which carries the theme “Keep playing,” is the first work for Powerade from the SapientNitro unit of the Sapient Corporation, which was recently named the worldwide digital agency for the brand. SapientNitro is also creating the nondigital elements of the campaign like the TV, print and outdoor ads. The ads present soccer as a game enjoyed around the clock and around the world by a gorgeous mosaic of players. “It doesn’t matter whether you have tons of money or play on a dirt pitch,” said Gaston Legorburu, worldwide creative officer at the Miami office of SapientNitro. “It’s kind of the neverending game.”The campaign aims to invoke the days “when you asked your mom to give you another 10 minutes to play outside,” he added. “There’s almost no light, but you still want to play.” Indeed, some scenes in the commercial and the video clips on the YouTube channel show games being played in the dark.  The Powerade push by Coca-Cola is coming as the brand’s far larger rival, Gatorade, sold by a unit of PepsiCo, is struggling with an unusual sales slump. Volume for Gatorade in the United States fell 15.5 percent last year compared with 2008, according to data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation. By comparison, volume for Powerade declined 1 percent, the data showed, and the sports-drink category fell 12.3 percent. Mr. Greatrex declined to discuss Powerade’s competitors. He did, however, contrast the Gatorade strategy of offering separate beverages to drink before, during and after athletic activity with the Powerade platform of providing consumers “one simple choice, to reach for one sports drink.”</text></article>

(AP) — The McDonald’s Corporation, the fast-food chain, said on Monday that sales at restaurants open at least a year climbed 4.8 percent in February on strong overseas growth and a small rise in United States sales.The 4.8 percent increase follows a 2.6 percent rise in January after sales declined in November and December. McDonald’s domestic performance also improved, edging up 0.6 percent after a 0.7 percent decline in January. Results in the United States were helped by strong demand for the chain’s breakfast dollar menu, McCafe drinks and a Chicken McNugget promotion centered around the Winter Olympics. Results in Europe rose 5.4 percent, while Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa’s performance climbed 10.5 percent. McDonald’s reported strong performances in Australia, Britain, China, France and Japan. Sales at restaurants open at least a year are a key indicator of performance because they measure growth at existing locations rather than newly opened ones. Systemwide sales, which includes sales at restaurants run by the company and franchisees, increased 11.2 percent in February. In January, McDonald’s, based in Oak Brook, Ill., said that its fourth-quarter profit climbed, helped by its dollar menu.

    <article index="5" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/07/super-bowl-ad-watch-a-look-at-the-other-side-of-tonights-game/?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Super Bowl Ad Watch: Blogging the Commercials<date>February 7, 2010, 5:24 pm</date><text>Stuart Elliott, The Times’s advertising columnist, is taking a running look at some of the evening’s Super Bowl commercials: Update | 9:57 p.m. And that’s a wrap, ad-wise and otherwise-wise, for Super Bowl XLIV. There were some surprises near the end of the game in the ad line-up. Anheuser-Busch InBev added a spot in the fourth quarter, for Bud Light, bringing its total for the game to nine. Hyundai also added a spot in the fourth quarter, running a commercial for the Hyundai Sonata that had appeared during the pre-game show. The spot, depicting the workers of the Hyundai plant in Alabama carrying a car from the beginning of its manufacturing to the end, becomes the second in the game using a crowd joining forces to do good; there was a Budweiser spot with a similar tack, in which townspeople built a human bridge. E*Trade also bought an additional spot that was originally not in its plans, also in the fourth quarter. The spot featured five babies; the first one had three. There had been speculation that additional commercials would turn up in the game because of the strong demand among advertisers for time during this Super Bowl. Update | 9:47 p.m. The Ad Bowl inside the Super Bowl may have come to an end. There are usually no more commercials after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. By a preliminary count, there have been 63 spots in the game, and with two of them the identical spot for Skechers, the final total could be 62. A typical Super Bowl has 62 commercials. This game marked the third in a row that the fourth quarter was close (well, in this instance, for a while). The old theories about not wanting to buy time in the second half of a game, or especially in the final quarter, may finally be disproved. Update | 9:36 p.m. More grist for the mill of those who believe there is a misogynistic streak in the Super Bowl spots: a commercial for Bud Light beer in which a loutish man disrupts a women’s book club. “I’d love to hear you read some words,” the Neanderthal tells an attractive woman. The punch line at the end involves a weak play on words on “Little Women”: “I’m not too picky, you know.” Add the Bud Light spot to others for brands like Dodge and Flo TV and there is going to be an intense conversation in the hours and days after the game about Madison Avenue’s attitude toward women. Update | 9:19 p.m. There seems to be a theme in many of the Super Bowl spots: the need to reassure men that they are as manly as they hope they are. That theme recurs in Super Bowl ads because so many of the viewers are men and so many of the products advertised are aimed at them. For instance, a Dodge spot carried the theme “Man’s last stand” and showed men thinking to themselves about the women in their lives. The thoughts were not of the type to win plaudits from feminists; they were grudging and stereotyped, along the lines of “I will watch your vampire TV shows with you.” There was a spot for Flo TV showing a man shopping with a woman for women’s clothes. A man observing him was not pleased, admonishing him, “Change out of that skirt, Jason.” A spot for Dockers touched on the theme but more subtly, telling men it is time to “wear the pants” and showing scads of them pantsless. The overly masculine tone is upsetting many people who are posting comments to blogs about the Super Bowl spots, particularly women, who are decrying those spots as misogynistic. Update | 9:04 p.m. With the third quarter over, here is a wrap-up of the first three quarters, ad-wise. There were 15 spots in the third quarter, although my count may be off. Adding 15 to the 15 in the second quarter and 18 in the first brings the total so far to 48. Scotts, with a third-quarter spot for Roundup weed killer, was an advertiser that had not been listed in any of the pre-game rosters of Super Bowl advertisers. And the Google spot in the third quarter was unexpected, too, although tech bloggers had been speculating about it for the last day. Still a lot of anticipated spots to come, including the first appearance by the Budweiser Clydesdales. Update | 8:57 p.m. The speculation was indeed true — Google bought a commercial during the Super Bowl. The spot, appearing in the third quarter, was, as bloggers reported in the last day, promoting Google’s search function and is part of a series demonstrating search in action. The spot began with “study abroad” in Paris and continued through what seemed to be a whirlwind romance, through “jobs in Paris,” “churches in Paris” and “how to assemble a crib” — with an infant’s gurgle at the end. It was just like that sequence from the animated film “Up,” showing the married life of the old man, only about three minutes faster. The spot was tipped off by a Tweet from Google’s chief executive that alerted everyone to watch the spots during the third quarter. Update | 8:56 p.m. Men without pants … a Super Bowl XLIV theme. In the third quarter there was a third spot featuring a pantsless man. It was for Coca-Cola and showed a man sleepwalking through the veldt, encountering animals. The other two, also in the third quarter, were for CareerBuilder.com and Dockers. Update | 8:48 p.m. CBS came in for a considerable amount of criticism before the game when it refused to sell a commercial during the game to a gay dating Web site, ManCrunch.com. But a gay couple appeared in a spot in the third quarter, for Motorola. The spot featured Megan Fox in a bathtub wondering what would happen if she was to send a photo of herself out into the world. Among the vignettes of havoc was a scene of two men in a kitchen. One slapped the other in the face and the second man slapped back. The implication was that Ms. Fox’s naughty pictures could even come between a gay couple. It was a nice moment of inclusion rather than exclusion. Update | 8:05 p.m. And here is the halftime report on the commercials. There were 15 spots in the second quarter, with an asterisk, which added to the 18 in the first quarter totals 33. The average Super Bowl has 62 or so commercials of varying lengths, so Super Bowl XLIV is on track to be typical. The asterisk for the second quarter refers to three spots that will probably not be counted by the USA Today Ad Meter, pollsters, data trackers and the like who obsess over Super Bowl ads. One was for Papa John’s pizza, but because it was bought from the National Football League rather than CBS it will not be counted by most folks. The other two were promotions from CBS itself, one featuring Mark Sanchez of the New York Jets in a “CBS Cares” spiel for women’s heart health and the other a hilarious surprise pitch for “Late Show With David Letterman.” The latter was a sequel to a surprise promotion that CBS ran the last time the network broadcast a Super Bowl, in 2007. The spot three years ago had Mr. Letterman with Oprah Winfrey on a couch watching the game together; the new one added Jay Leno to the mix. In a news release sent minutes ago by CBS, the network said the new promotion was taped last week at the Ed Sullivan Theater, the home of “Late Show.” Update | 7:49 p.m. For the second time in the second quarter, there were two spots in a row with common content. The last time, it was spots for CareerBuilder.com and Dockers that both had men without pants. This time, it was spots for Dr Pepper Cherry soda and a new series on the truTV cable channel, “N.F.L. Full Contact,” that both had mini-men. For Dr Pepper Cherry, the wee men were dressed as members of Kiss. For the TV series, there was a miniature version of the football star Troy Polamalu. Kudos to CBS if this is all on purpose. Update | 7:37 p.m. Who wears the pants in the Super Bowl? Maybe no one. A commercial for CareerBuilder.com after the second quarter began, in which office workers wore only their underwear, was followed by a spot for Dockers in which men were shown pantsless. The CareerBuilder spot, part of a contest to get consumers to create commercials, was a joke about casual Fridays being taken to their illogical extreme. The Dockers spot was meant to comment on men needing to “wear the pants,” i.e., be mature enough to be seen in a pair of khakis. A delightful coincidence or the result of careful planning? It may be a Super Bowl ad mystery for the ages. Update | 7:29 p.m. CBS had a trick up its sleeve with an eye-popping promotional spot that appeared not long after the second quarter started. The spot showed David Letterman on a sofa watching the game with Jay Leno and Oprah Winfrey. The spot promoted “Late Show With David Letterman” and will certainly get a lot of post-game attention. It looked as if the improbable trio was actually on the sofa all at the same time. 7:20 p.m.: The first quarter is over and here is the ad count so far: 18 commercials, including the much-discussed Focus on the Family spot. Anheuser-Busch InBev and Frito-Lay had the most, three apiece. The Anheuser-Busch spots were all for Bud Light. The Frito-Lay spots were all for Doritos and all finalists in its consumer-created “Crash the Super Bowl” ad contest. The company was to run three spots in the game but in an e-mail message a spokesman said that Frito-Lay had an opportunity to buy a fourth spot so there will be another Doritos ad created by a consumer to come. Universal Pictures followed, with two spots, for the movies “Robin Hood” and “The Wolfman.” 7:03 p.m.: It was at 6:43 p.m. Eastern Time that Super Bowl ad history was made: the first commercial to advocate a side on a contentious public issue was shown. The spot was, of course, the commercial from Focus on the Family, the evangelical organization, which bought 30 seconds of time from CBS. The spot was similar to one that the organization ran several times in the pre-game show. It was the third commercial to be shown during Super Bowl XLIV, after spots in the first quarter for Bud Light beer and Snickers. The spot, as expected, featured the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, who are both against abortion. The spot never used the word “abortion,” and the only nod to the organization’s anti-abortion stance was the sign off at the end, “Celebrate family. Celebrate life.” An article in USA Today on Friday suggested that the word was omitted to help smooth the clearance process for the spot to be accepted for airing. The spot directed viewers to the Focus on the Family Web site, where full information is available about a story Mrs. Tebow has often told about deciding to give birth to Tim despite doctors’ suggestions she get an abortion. The spot alluded to Mrs. Tebow’s story, which received extensive coverage before the commercial appeared, in a couple of ways. After Mr. Tebow pretends to tackle his mother, she says to him, “We’re trying to tell our story here.” And on screen these words appeared at the end of the spot: “For the full Tebow story, go to focusonthefamily.com.” The spot was slick and well done; a casual viewer might not have any idea it was from an organization as opposed to abortion as Focus on the Family. It used a production style and tone that is typical of Oprah Winfrey: upbeat, seemingly free of ideology, including chirpy music. The appearance of the spot has opened a debate on whether advocacy and issue ads belong on a Super Bowl, which has become an unofficial midwinter American holiday. If the answer is yes, there may come a time when watching the Super Bowl will be like watching TV in a swing state like Ohio or Florida the Sunday before a presidential election, with commercials taking sides showing up every couple of minutes. 6:35 p.m.: One of the last pre-game spots, for McDonald’s, was a winner. It was a sequel to a popular spot the company ran in the game in 1993, called “The Showdown,” pitting Michael Jordan and Larry Bird against each other in a game for fast food. The sequel was great, with LeBron James and Dwight Howard subbing for the original pair of basketball stars. And Mr. Bird even had a cameo. The question is, why didn’t McDonald’s run the spot in the game? Was the cost of a spot in the game so much more than one just a few minutes before the game starts? 6:25 p.m.: Although the Super Bowl is often the program watched each year by more women than any other, there are few signs of that in the line-up of commercials scheduled for the game. In the final minutes of the pre-game show, there was one spot aimed at women, for L’Oreal, and another, for Quilted Northern bathroom tissue, a product that is more often bought for a household by the woman than the man. As for the line-up in the game, some products are bought by women as well as men, among them Coca-Cola. But the lion’s share of spots will be aimed at men. Of course, the lopsided focus reflects that Super Bowls are by far the biggest show of the year for male viewers. Sometimes, though, advertisers reach out to the large female audience by scheduling spots for products meant for women. One year a commercial for Dove got a lot of attention. This year there will be a spot for Dove — but for the brand’s new line for men. 5:20 p.m.: The organization that is sponsoring what is perhaps the most talked-about commercial to be shown during Super Bowl XLIV is already running an ad. Focus on the Family, the evangelical organization that has bought a spot in the game, has been running a commercial during the pre-game coverage on CBS. The pre-game spot, like the spot the group is running during the game, features the college football star Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam, who have both in the past been vocal in their opposition to abortion. The pre-game spot, which has already run at least three times, shows Mrs. Tebow talking about her “miracle baby,” who turns out to be Tim. He appears at the end, hugging his mother, after which these words appear on screen: “For the full Tebow story, go to focusonthefamily.com.” It is not clear how much or how little the spot in the game will resemble the pre-game spot because Focus on the Family is not disclosing ahead of time any details about its in-game commercial. The presence of the commercial has been perhaps the biggest advertising story of this Super Bowl because it is probably the first time that an advocacy spot, taking sides on a contentious issue, has been accepted for broadcast during a Super Bowl. The commercial in the pre-game coverage does not include the word “abortion,” and is worded so carefully that an uninformed viewer might not know what the subject of the spot is. Focus on the Family is a conservative organization that is against abortion and gay rights. In a video clip on the organization’s Web site, an official says the Focus on the Family Super Bowl spot is to appear early in the game. USA Today reported on Friday that it is planned as the third spot in the first commercial break in the first quarter — in other words, the third commercial in the game.</text></article>

Semenov was growing lettuce on a collective farm outside Moscow in 1990 when a representative of McDonald's stopped by. The company had just opened a restaurant. Could he sell it a few boxes of lettuce each week? Mr. Semenov's assistant turned it down. One restaurant was too small an order. ''I said, 'My friend! You see how many McDonald's there are in the West?' '' Mr. Semenov recalled recently. ''I said, 'Sell them lettuce at any price. It's our new strategy.' '' With that, Mr. Semenov started a company that has all but cornered the market on packaged fresh vegetables in Russia. With a buy-one-get-one-free deal on hamburgers and a traditional Russian accordion band, McDonald's celebrated on Monday the 20th anniversary of the opening of its first store in the Soviet Union, a restaurant that drew long lines. But the company celebrated a different milestone earlier this year by outsourcing the last product -- hamburger buns -- it had made at a proprietary factory outside Moscow called McComplex. It was built before the chain opened its first restaurant. Nearly everywhere else, McDonald's buys ingredients, rather than making its own. But in the Soviet Union, there simply were no private businesses to supply the 300 or so distinct ingredients needed by a McDonald's outlet. Everything -- from frozen French fries to pie filling -- had to be made from scratch at a sprawling factory. McDonald's is always a good lens through which to view the 118 or so countries where it operates. In the 20 years since McDonald's arrived in Russia, enough private enterprises have sprung up to supply nearly every ingredient needed to operate one of its restaurants. Today, private businesses in Russia supply 80 percent of the ingredients in a McDonald's, a reversal from the ratio when it opened in 1990 and 80 percent of ingredients were imported. Starting with pickles, which now come from the farm of Anatoly M. Revyakin, every item has been spun off from the nine production lines at McComplex, spawning dozens of new businesses, some now among the most successful in the Russian food catering industry. Buns and pies are still made at the McComplex site, but by an independent contractor; the building is for sale. ''Our goal is to put the business in the hands of independent suppliers,'' Jim Skinner, the global chief executive of McDonald's, said in an interview. Mr. Revyakin, a cucumber farmer in 1990, went on to become the Pickle King of Russian processed food after taking over the marinating line from McComplex; he now sells pickles to three restaurant chains and is moving into relish for Heinz. ''We make $2 million a year selling cucumbers,'' he said in a phone interview. Mr. Semenov's shredded lettuce business, Belaya Dacha, already accustomed to working with Western companies from the McDonald's contract, exploded when Western-style supermarkets arrived in Russia in the last decade, bringing coolers capable of displaying prepackaged salads. He now sells 150 types of salad and is the lettuce magnate of Russia. And after his business success, Mr. Semenov has gone into politics, serving in Parliament with the ruling United Russia party. Dairy went to Wimm-Bill-Dann, a milk and juice packager that became the first Russian food company to list on the New York Stock Exchange, in 2002. Just last year, a Russian company, Miratorg, took over supplying Chicken McNuggets. It could hardly have come at a better time for McDonald's -- a trade war is threatening to cut off the importation of chicken into Russia. Today, frozen French fries are still imported, oddly enough, given that Russians are famous for growing potatoes. The problem, though is finding economy of scale in processing, McDonald's executives said. Russians still buy raw potatoes at supermarkets, instead of processed frozen potatoes. Until frozen potatoes catch on, McDonald's alone cannot provide the volumes needed to open a processing plant. From the day it opened the gates on the $50 million factory, McDonald's had intended to hand out its functions to other businesses and eventually shut it down, said Khamzat Khasbulatov, the director of McDonald's in Russia. Arms-length transactions for supplies allow McDonald's to step back from the interaction of franchisees and food-processing companies, sparing them a headache. Russia's 235 restaurants have not yet been franchised. ''We knew from Day 1 that our goal was to outsource all its functions,'' Mr. Khasbulatov said. Today the restaurants in Russia employ 25,000 people, a number far eclipsed by the businesses in McDonald's supply chain, which employ 100,000, Mr. Khasbulatov said. Even as it leaned on the proprietary factory in its early years, the McDonald's Russia operation, quick on its feet out of necessity to keep up with all the changes, has also been on the leading edge of other global business initiatives. The worldwide pushback against coffee chains, for example, had an early test run here. McCafés opened here in 2003 and espresso-style drinks are available in many restaurants; the concept was introduced in America last year. For McDonald's, bringing Russia in line with its horizontal business model is more important than ever because the country is an important market and its same-store sales are growing fast. The overseas business is generally leading both in the number of restaurant openings and growth in sales at existing restaurants. Russian restaurants are on average twice as busy as those in the United States, with 850,000 visitors a year per site compared with 400,000 domestically. McDonald's plans to invest $150 million in Russia this year to open 45 new restaurants and refurbish current sites. And that is good news for suppliers, too; those outlets will need a lot of shredded lettuce.

Sales at stores open at least 13 months grew 2.3 percent, rising in every region in both the quarter and in December, helped by a mix of discounted prices and new products, longer operating hours and remodeled restaurants. Net income in the fourth quarter climbed 23 percent, to $1.22 billion, or $1.11 a share, from $985.3 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 7.3 percent, to $5.97 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.03 a share.

Skip to next paragraph McDonald's, via Associated Press Don Thompson was named president and operating chief. Related Times Topics: McDonald's Corporation Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » McDonald's, via Associated Press Jan Fields will become president of the American division. Mr. Thompson succeeds Ralph Alvarez, who retired unexpectedly last month, citing health concerns. Like Mr. Alvarez, Mr. Thompson will have the dual titles of president and chief operating officer. He becomes the third person to hold the No. 2 post at McDonald’s since 2004, when the company lost two chief executives to fatal illnesses. Since then the company has stressed the importance of succession planning, and the No. 2 executive has been widely viewed as a chief executive in waiting. James A. Skinner, the chief executive, said Mr. Thompson would oversee operations at McDonald’s nearly 32,000 restaurants worldwide. The company operates in more than 117 countries. Despite the importance of its international markets  revenue from outside the United States made up nearly two-thirds of the company’s total of $23.5 billion in 2008  a company press release and profile of Mr. Thompson showed little evidence of foreign experience. Walt Riker, a company spokesman, said that Mr. Thompson had worked with the company’s international restaurants when he was executive vice president of restaurant systems in 2004, a job that included involvement with such things as modernized drive-throughs, new cooking systems, cashless payment systems and new menu items. McDonald’s has a long history of choosing its top executives from within. Mr. Thompson, 46, started working at McDonald’s in 1990 as an electrical engineer in the restaurant systems group. He then moved into restaurant operations and rose to executive posts in its West and Midwest divisions. In 2006 he was named president of the company’s United States division, when Mr. Alvarez was promoted from that post to the No. 2 spot. Mr. Alvarez’s predecessor, Michael J. Roberts, also left the company abruptly, reportedly over frustrations that Mr. Skinner, who became chief executive in 2004, had failed to step down as quickly as anticipated. McDonald’s has been a success story during the global recession, reporting strong sales and generally outperforming its fast-food rivals. Possible signs of weakness began to show in the United States business late last year, however. Same-store sales in the United States for the month of November were down 0.6 percent compared with the same period the previous year, the company reported. But year-to-date same-store sales for the period that ended Nov. 30 were up 2.8 percent in the United States and 3.9 percent companywide. The company also announced on Monday that Jan Fields would succeed Mr. Thompson as president of its United States division.

But the unexpected departure this month of its No. 2 executive, Ralph Alvarez, raises concerns that the fast food giant may have lost its touch in planning for changes at the top. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Peter Wynn Thompson for The New York Times Ralph Alvarez cited health reasons for retiring as No. 2, and said he did not expect the top job to be open in the short term. Related Times Topics: McDonald's Corporation Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » The abrupt retirement of Mr. Alvarez, 55, the company’s president and chief operating officer, came as a surprise to people in and around McDonald’s. The company announced Dec. 1 that Mr. Alvarez was retiring, effective Thursday, because of chronic knee pain. His departure is the second time in a little more than three years that the company’s No. 2 executive has left suddenly. In 2006, investors and analysts were similarly surprised when Mr. Alvarez’s predecessor, Michael J. Roberts, announced his resignation. Both Mr. Alvarez and Mr. Roberts had been widely viewed as likely successors to James A. Skinner, the chief executive, and experts in corporate succession said the departures could signal deeper problems. “If I’ve got churn at the top, and it’s unexpected churn or quick churn or repetitive churn, I start to get pretty concerned about that,” said David Lewin, a professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Skinner took over McDonald’s in 2004, after one chief executive, James R. Cantalupo, died of a heart attack, and his successor, Charles H. Bell, left with cancer. (Mr. Bell died in January 2005.) Those events imbued the No. 2 job at McDonald’s with added significance, and many analysts and investors came to see the person who held it as a chief executive in waiting. But things have not worked out that way. When Mr. Roberts left, he was said to be frustrated that Mr. Skinner was not stepping down as quickly as expected. Mr. Alvarez said his departure was prompted solely by health concerns. But he also said he was aware that Mr. Skinner was not planning to retire soon, and so he did not expect the top job to come open in the short term. “That was not something that was in the cards in the foreseeable future,” Mr. Alvarez said, “and that obviously plays a part in my decision.” Nell Minow, a founder of the Corporate Library, which rates the performance of boards, said “high turnover at the sub-C.E.O. level is always a risk factor.” “It’s just the nature of C.E.O.’s to be aggressive and competitive,” she added, “but you want that to be on behalf of shareholder value, not on behalf of putting a moat around the job so they can stay in it.” Ms. Minow said it was often difficult to keep ambitious and talented executives from chafing in a No. 2 role, and that chief executives should be evaluated on their ability to keep possible successors from becoming impatient and leaving. But she also said that Mr. Alvarez’s chronic health condition, although not life-threatening, should have made the board wary of promoting him to such a position in the first place, given McDonald’s recent history. “It’s an important part of the C.E.O. succession planning process that you have to have a very frank conversation about health issues,” Ms. Minow said. “Somebody was not asking the right questions there.” Walt Riker, the McDonald’s vice president for media relations, said that the board was aware of Mr. Alvarez’s health problems when he was promoted, but that they did not appear career-threatening at that time. He said succession planning was a top priority of the board. “McDonald’s succession planning process is well prepared to address circumstances as they arise,” Mr. Riker said in a statement, “and this is enabled by strong talent management and leadership development practices, which are aimed at keeping the bench deep and ready for the next level.” Roger W. Stone, a board member, said Mr. Alvarez had succumbed to the wear and tear of running the company in more than 100 countries, which required frequent travel. “It’s kind of a burnout job and a tough job, and it shouldn’t surprise anybody that good people leave,” Mr. Stone said. Mr. Alvarez said in an interview that he had degenerative joint disease in his knees and had undergone many surgeries, including two knee replacement operations this year. “The chronic pain that has continued to grow was just unbearable,” he said, adding that it was often worse on long flights. He said his decision to retire was also influenced by concern over the health of his wife, who has had cancer and other medical problems. Mr. Alvarez, who received $7 million in total compensation last year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, said he had been contemplating retirement for some time and finally made his decision over the Thanksgiving weekend. Mr. Alvarez said he told Mr. Skinner in a meeting on Nov. 30. He said that the two had talked about his health problems before, but that he had never told Mr. Skinner he was close to leaving. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 31, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.After McDonald’s lost two chief executives to fatal illness in rapid succession in 2004, the company was praised for managing a smooth transition.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Beef Products Inc.’s ammonia-treated beef. Multimedia Interactive Documents: Meat Industry and Government Records Related E. Coli Path Shows Flaws in Beef Inspection (October 4, 2009) Enlarge This Image Carol Guzy/Washington Post A Beef Products Inc. processing plant in South Sioux City, Neb. The company injects fatty beef trimmings with ammonia to remove E. coli and salmonella. The company, Beef Products Inc., had been looking to expand into the hamburger business with a product made from beef that included fatty trimmings the industry once relegated to pet food and cooking oil. The trimmings were particularly susceptible to contamination, but a study commissioned by the company showed that the ammonia process would kill E. coli as well as salmonella. Officials at the United States Department of Agriculture endorsed the company’s ammonia treatment, and have said it destroys E. coli “to an undetectable level.” They decided it was so effective that in 2007, when the department began routine testing of meat used in hamburger sold to the general public, they exempted Beef Products. With the U.S.D.A.’s stamp of approval, the company’s processed beef has become a mainstay in America’s hamburgers. McDonald’s, Burger King and other fast-food giants use it as a component in ground beef, as do grocery chains. The federal school lunch program used an estimated 5.5 million pounds of the processed beef last year alone. But government and industry records obtained by The New York Times show that in testing for the school lunch program, E. coli and salmonella pathogens have been found dozens of times in Beef Products meat, challenging claims by the company and the U.S.D.A. about the effectiveness of the treatment. Since 2005, E. coli has been found 3 times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat was caught before reaching lunch-rooms trays. In July, school lunch officials temporarily banned their hamburger makers from using meat from a Beef Products facility in Kansas because of salmonella  the third suspension in three years, records show. Yet the facility remained approved by the U.S.D.A. for other customers. Presented by The Times with the school lunch test results, top department officials said they were not aware of what their colleagues in the lunch program had been finding for years. In response, the agriculture department said it was revoking Beef Products’ exemption from routine testing and conducting a review of the company’s operations and research. The department said it was also reversing its policy for handling Beef Products during pathogen outbreaks. Since it was seen as pathogen-free, the processed beef was excluded from recalls, even when it was an ingredient in hamburgers found to be contaminated. The Beef Products case reveals a schism between the main Department of Agriculture and its division that oversees the school lunch program, a divide that underscores the government’s faltering effort to make hamburger safe. The U.S.D.A. banned the sale of meat found to be contaminated with the O157:H7 strain of E. coli 15 years ago, after a deadly outbreak was traced to Jack in the Box restaurants. Meat tainted with salmonella is also a hazard. But while the school lunch program will not buy meat contaminated with salmonella, the agriculture department does not ban its sale to the general public. Even so, E. coli outbreaks nationwide have increased in recent years. And this summer, two outbreaks of particularly virulent strains of salmonella in hamburger prompted large recalls of ground beef across several states. Although no outbreak has been tied to Beef Products, officials said they would thoroughly scrutinize any future industry innovations for fighting contamination “to ensure that they are scientifically sound and protect public health,” and that they were examining the government’s overall meat safety policies. The founder and owner of Beef Products, Eldon N. Roth, declined requests for interviews or access to the company’s production facilities. Responding to written questions, Beef Products said it had a deep commitment to hamburger safety and was continually refining its operation to provide the safest product possible. “B.P.I.’s track record demonstrates the progress B.P.I. has made compared to the industry norm,” the company said. “Like any responsible member of the meat industry, we are not perfect.” Beef Products maintains that its ammonia process remains effective. It said it tests samples of each batch it ships to customers and has found E. coli in only 0.06 percent of the samples this year. 1 2 3 4 Next Page » Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Tony Cenicola/The New York Times Beef Products Inc.’s ammonia-treated beef. Multimedia Interactive Documents: Meat Industry and Government Records Related E. Coli Path Shows Flaws in Beef Inspection (October 4, 2009) Enlarge This Image Carol Guzy/Washington Post A Beef Products Inc. processing plant in South Sioux City, Neb. The company injects fatty beef trimmings with ammonia to remove E. coli and salmonella. The company, Beef Products Inc., had been looking to expand into the hamburger business with a product made from beef that included fatty trimmings the industry once relegated to pet food and cooking oil. The trimmings were particularly susceptible to contamination, but a study commissioned by the company showed that the ammonia process would kill E. coli as well as salmonella. Officials at the United States Department of Agriculture endorsed the company’s ammonia treatment, and have said it destroys E. coli “to an undetectable level.” They decided it was so effective that in 2007, when the department began routine testing of meat used in hamburger sold to the general public, they exempted Beef Products. With the U.S.D.A.’s stamp of approval, the company’s processed beef has become a mainstay in America’s hamburgers. McDonald’s, Burger King and other fast-food giants use it as a component in ground beef, as do grocery chains. The federal school lunch program used an estimated 5.5 million pounds of the processed beef last year alone. But government and industry records obtained by The New York Times show that in testing for the school lunch program, E. coli and salmonella pathogens have been found dozens of times in Beef Products meat, challenging claims by the company and the U.S.D.A. about the effectiveness of the treatment. Since 2005, E. coli has been found 3 times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat was caught before reaching lunch-rooms trays. In July, school lunch officials temporarily banned their hamburger makers from using meat from a Beef Products facility in Kansas because of salmonella  the third suspension in three years, records show. Yet the facility remained approved by the U.S.D.A. for other customers.

These days, many customers care about how companies treat employees. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Adam Bird for McDonald's Corporation Eddie Davenport and Fatima Poggi were among 12 finalists in the Voice of McDonald's contest. Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » That’s the thought behind an “American Idol”-style competition called Voice of McDonald’s. Now in its third iteration, the competition gives McDonald’s employees from around the world a chance to sing at a giant trade conference  complete with vocal coaching and judging from stars like Ne-Yo  and win a $25,000 top prize. “We know that customer perceptions about your employment brand do have some impact in terms of people’s decisions to frequent certain restaurants or retail establishments,” said Rich Floersch, chief human resources officer for McDonald’s. Entrants submit audition videos. Professionals from the music industry select 30 semifinalists, and the public is encouraged to vote on which 12 singers should make the finals. “We wanted to be able to really leverage this concept that McDonald’s is known for, which is opportunity,” Mr. Floersch said. “Our employees can become entrepreneurs and end up owning stores, or come up through the ranks in the company.” Twenty of the 50 top executives, including the chief executive, James Skinner, began as restaurant workers, he said. Each Voice of McDonald’s finalist wins a trip, with a guest, to the McDonald’s Worldwide Convention in Orlando, Fla., in April. It’s a giant trade show and networking event, with 15,000 franchisees, employees and vendors who pay their own way to rub elbows. The convention has 800,000 square feet of exhibit space, where the Ukrainians can check out what’s new on the Brazilian menu, and the Japanese can show off their cellphone-ordering technology to the franchisee from Liechtenstein. “It’s all geared to, how do you run better restaurants, how do you contemporize your brand or your operating system, what’s new about the new menu items,” Mr. Floersch said. The Voice competitors, once in Orlando, get full “Idol”-like training and styling, including hair and makeup, wardrobe, choreography and vocal coaching. Their final performances are before those 15,000 attendees, backed by a 50-piece orchestra. Judges include people in the music industry, and usually a celebrity (Ne-Yo participated two years ago).  This year, there were 10,500 entries  China had the most, followed by Japan  which vocal coaches narrowed to 30 semifinalists. The semifinalists had to pick from among a list of Sony Music songs that McDonald’s had licensed to use, leading to employees like Weijie Wu from China, Jesus Miguel Molinares Espinoza from Peru and Franz Carl Guerrero from Canada all letting lose with versions of “Stand By Me” with a variety of accents. Using Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and international social-media sites like Russia’s VKontakte, McDonald’s asked the public to vote. There were 685,000 votes this year, versus the 46,000 from the last competition two years ago. This year, only two Americans made it to the 12-person final  and they were both from towns about a half-hour’s drive from each other in Michigan. Fatima Poggi, a 17-year-old senior at Pinckney Community High School in Pinckney, Mich., had been working part time at McDonald’s for a year and a half, handling the front counter and drive-through window. Ms. Poggi moved to the United States from Peru at age 10, and didn’t speak English. Now, in addition to the McDonald’s job and school, she performs lead roles in community theater musicals like “Aida” and “Aladdin,” and performs in events and contests around the country. “The owner found out I was singing around the area,” Ms. Poggi said, “and he talked to me about the competition that they were going to be having.” For Ms. Poggi’s semifinal song, she chose “Alone” by Heart. Her homemade video is dramatic, showing Ms. Poggi, in knee-high leather boots, strutting on a train track, interspersed with scenes of her emoting on a dock. Ms. Poggi is the youngest finalist ever in the competition, and the oldest ever, 50-year-old Eddie Davenport, is from Stockbridge, Mich., just west of Pinckney. Mr. Davenport moved to Michigan from North Carolina several years ago. After spending some time as a youth minister, he got a job at McDonald’s as a secondary maintenance man at two area restaurants. He works 24 hours a week, doing jobs like filtering the frying oil and washing windows. Mr. Davenport has retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease. “Because of the vision, I couldn’t see how to do the registers and things like that. Mopping the floor is pretty easy,” Mr. Davenport said. His semifinal submission is simple: showing him with a microphone, in front of a wall, singing Babyface’s “When Can I See You Again.”  Last week, Mr. Davenport arrived at work at 4:45 a.m. as usual, and was rearranging some stock items when he was called out front. He found his wife, a video crew, and a McDonald’s representative, who told him he had made the finals. He was thrilled, especially since he thought he was running out of time  Voice of McDonald’s happens only every two years, and he may not be able to see, or work at McDonald’s, long enough for the next event. “Honestly, I felt like this is my last shot, because the deterioration of my vision for the last year has been so severe that if it continues the way that it has been going, I don’t really feel that I would be able to work here actively two years from now to try again,” he said. Mr. Floersch, who will be in the audience at the April competition, said it was an important part of positioning McDonald’s as a good employer, especially since it needed 1.6 million workers worldwide. “We want to make sure that we have an employment brand that is compelling, that draws people to the organization,” he said.

Dear Walt Disney Company, I would also like a refund for “Cinderella,” my first Disney movie. “Cinderella’s” claim that “dreams do come true” is grossly misleading and none of mine have come true, even when following instructions to wish upon a star. I too have a nasty step mother, but unlike Cinderella, who led me to believe that if I cook and clean and wait around long enough, mice will make me dresses and the universe will practically hand stuff to me, this has not happened. All these years I pinned my life on the claim that having nice feet would get me somewhere. I even misplaced a grossly impractical high heel on the step outside a bar one night and raced home before midnight. But this has done nothing in the hot-man-arriving-at-my-door department. And I’m out a shoe. Speaking of corrupt claims, the scam that is “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” also calls for a refund.

And just like the so-called fairest of them all, I, too, found myself in an unsatisfying situation (again, nasty stepmother). So, I asked myself: “What would Disney do?” I moved in with a group of seven, very short older men.

Good ol’ Alice: In my previous lawsuit against McDonalds for making me fat, I cited expert testimony from Alice (in addition to several evidentiary plus-size pants with slit-open seams) that food does in fact say “EAT ME” and “DRINK ME.” Not to go on harping on these things, but like Peter Pan, for years and years I have refused to grow up. Yet it is patently false that all it takes to fly is to “think a wonderful thought, faith, trust, and pixie dust.” Unless you mean figuratively, with another kind of “pixie dust,” there are no wonderful thoughts, faith or trust involved in flying these days. “Peter Pan” in essence is nothing more than (and I hate to slander) a fairy tale: Flying involves paying money, missing years of your life waiting and being delayed, and seatmates who clip their toenails.

''It's disgusting,'' said Aidan Flax-Clark, an editor from Brooklyn. The honest appraisal didn't faze Alie Ward and Georgia Hardstark, a pair of winsome drinking buddies from Los Angeles who have ridden the McNuggetini to cult status on the Internet and are now hoping for more. Like the archetypal 1950s housewives from whom they borrow their fashion sense, the two smiled gamely through the criticism. ''It's fine once you get past the barbecue sauce,'' Ms. Hardstark, 29, said of the drink, part chocolate shake, part Chicken McNugget. ''It tastes just like a White Russian, but with meat.'' The recipe for viral success online is an elusive one -- no lesser marketing giants than Burger King and Sony have embarrassed themselves trying -- but Alie &amp; Georgia, as they are known, are having a moment thanks to their funny, Food Network-style instructional videos for revolting cocktails. Their three-minute short on how to make a McNuggetini has been viewed nearly 70,000 times on YouTube, and two other videos, for the Ham Daiquiri and the Bloody Bacon and Cheese, followed. One commenter on YouTube summed up their appeal: ''Well-dressed cute girls mixing god-awful drinks? I can't stop watching.'' In November, Hoda Kotb of the ''Today'' show took a small-enough sip of a McNuggetini to declare it, without wincing, ''delicious.'' This month, Ms. Ward and Ms. Hardstark were in Manhattan to meet with development executives and casting agents. Playboy has been in touch (for an article, not a centerfold). ''It's Anthony Bourdain meets Martha Stewart on crack,'' said Ms. Ward, 33, who by day is a staff writer for The Los Angeles Times. She is also a former actress who hopes you don't remember her small role on the TV crime show ''Nash Bridges,'' which starred Don Johnson and Cheech Marin. Despite her brief time on TV, neither she nor Ms. Hardstark, a receptionist at a real estate investment firm, had been trying to break into show business in any serious way when they dreamed up the McNuggetini in an East Los Angeles bar last year. The idea, drawn from the fact that they both craved Chicken McNuggets after a good night on the town, was to combine dinner, a drink and dessert into one single serving. ''We would always joke about wanting to have a travel show or launch some sort of 'Laverne and Shirley' kind of AbFab thing,'' Ms. Ward said, referring to the BBC show ''Absolutely Fabulous.'' But it wasn't until pictures of their concoctions spread across the Web that the two saw a possible career path online (or an online path to a career). ''McNuggetini is a game, and we are going to win,'' Ms. Ward declared. Ms. Hardstark posted pictures of the first McNuggetini on her blog in March 2008, where they sat unnoticed until Richard Blakeley, the video editor at Gawker.com, introduced a blog last February called ThisIsWhyYoureFat.com. His first posts included nods to the Deep Fried Cadbury Creme Egg, the Hot Beef Sundae, and the McNuggetini. The McNuggetini soon popped up on the Huffington Post, PerezHilton.com and, yes, ''Today.'' ''Suddenly we we're like, wait, we can get famous off a meat garnish drink?'' Ms. Hardstark recalled. The women brought in a friend, Peter Atencio, who directs videos for FunnyorDie.com, to help. In an attempt to transcend the usual amateur fare on YouTube, they donned snazzy Eisenhower-era dresses, and Mr. Atencio scored the video with French 1960s jazz-pop. The video was a hit, and more than one TV network came calling. ''They have really good stage presence, they look good on camera, they're hilarious together and they're not threatening at all,'' Mr. Blakeley said. ''You can't go wrong with that.'' Subsequent videos for the Ham Daiquiri (which includes pineapple, rum, honey, liquid smoke and ham) and the Bloody Bacon and Cheese (vodka, tomato soup, grilled cheese, bacon) have been greeted enthusiastically from some hungry, sometimes libidinous fans. There have been marriage proposals as well as less gentlemanly suggestions, though neither video has been as big a hit as the original. But Ms. Ward and Ms. Hardstark are hopeful. ''Denise Richards is probably a millionaire, and Lorenzo Lamas's children have their own TV deal,'' Ms. Ward wrote in an e-mail message, ''so my hosting a cooking or travel show really isn't as mythical a notion as, say, unicorns or the Kraken.'' Correction: December 24, 2009 An article last Thursday about Alie Ward and Georgia Hardstark, who have become famous with Web videos about their cocktails made with meat, repeated the misspelling of an actor's surname in quoting an e-mail message from Ms. Ward, who was discussing the nature of contemporary fame. He is Lorenzo Lamas, not Llamas. PHOTOS: DINNER AND A DRINK: In a video, Ms. Ward, left, and Ms. Hardstark sample their ham daiquiri. The verdict? ''A sandwich would be better.''

Weakness in Germany and China also pressured sales, which analysts said were worse than expected throughout the world. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months in the United States fell 0.6 percent, the latest sign that the fast-food sector, which had performed well through most of the recession, was weakening. The sales decline at McDonald's comes less than a week after a rival fast-food chain, Yum Brands, forecast weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. Shares of McDonald's, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., fell $1.32, or 2.1 percent, to close at $60.61. ''It does not bode well for spending in the restaurant category,'' said Tom Forte, an analyst at the Telsey Advisory Group. He added that high unemployment among 18- to 34-year-olds was weighing on the fast-food industry that McDonald's dominates. Fast-food chains like McDonald's were outperforming other restaurant categories until just recently, when rising unemployment began to cut into sales, particularly at breakfast, where McDonald's leads the industry. McDonald's has been doing better than other fast-food chains in the United States by offering a variety of items on its popular dollar menu. But its rivals are stepping up with a broad range of inexpensive fare, including a new $1 double cheeseburger from Burger King, a new 99-cent menu from Dunkin Donuts and a value menu from Yum's Taco Bell that offers items for less than $1. Same-restaurant sales were up 0.7 percent over all for November, helped by a 2.5 percent increase rise in Europe, McDonald's said. Same-restaurant sales fell 1 percent in the company's Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, hurt by China.</text></article>

The New World was about to strike at the heart of France’s most celebrated cultural symbol. The French would not take it lightly. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Owen Franken for The New York Times Some Parisians have not even heard of the plans by McDonald's to open a restaurant in the Louvre. The basement of the museum already contains a shopping mall and a small food court. Related Times Topics: France While some in the international news media, especially in Britain, found this line entrancing, the French simply shrugged at the news. The announcement was ignored by the national newspapers, apart from a small article published by Le Parisien, a popular daily. The reality is that the French have gotten used to their McDonald’s, widely nicknamed “McDo” (pronounced mac-DOUGH). Statistics suggest, in fact, that they have grown fond of it. Since McDonald’s France served its first Big Mac 30 years ago, it has opened 1,140 restaurants across the country. The French operation of McDonald’s is the second most profitable after the one in the United States. French patrons are also the world’s biggest spenders: an average visit here amounts to about $15, including tax, versus $4 in the United States. With the recession having driven customers away from more expensive restaurants, the company is estimating growth of 10 percent in France this year. Quick, a Belgian fast food chain with 346 restaurants in France, expects to grow by 3 percent in 2009, according to its chief executive, Jean-Paul Brayer. This trend marks a big change from the past decade. When José Bové, a French farmer and activist, decided to protest global capitalism and what he called “Coca-Colonization” in 1999, he dismantled a McDonald’s in the south of France. Some Parisians have never even heard of the company’s plan to open a restaurant in the Louvre, the basement of which already has a shopping mall and a small food court. “This is news to me,” said Laurent Mortin, 28, a bank employee who was in line to order lunch at a McDonald’s near the Opéra Garnier. “But if they open a McDo in the Louvre, what’s the big deal?” Part of McDonald’s success in France can be explained by the company’s efforts to adapt to local taste buds. “The French eat McDonald’s in a French way,” said Caroline Deleuze, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s France. “They come less often but spend more because they want a proper meal.” That is defined as a sit-down experience with two courses. Local menus offer sandwiches that aim to please local tastes. Le Royal Deluxe features a whole-grain mustard sauce on top of the standard beef patty, cheddar and vegetables, and it is now the second-largest selling burger in France, after the Big Mac. Le Big Tasty, a seasonal offering with a sauce that imitates the charred flavor of meat grilled on a barbecue, promises “le goût de l’Amérique,” or the taste of America. McDonald’s France offers its version of the Caprese salad, called Little Mozza, and beer and espresso are also available. The company emphasizes the French origin of the beef and vegetables in its restaurants. Prices are also higher than in the United States. Items are more expensive, in part, because of the current exchange rate  a Big Mac in Paris costs $4.95, tax included, compared with $4.12 in New York. Bernard Hasquenoph, the head of Louvre pour tous, or Louvre for everyone, an association for the defense of French museums, is one of the most vocal opponents of the McDonald’s restaurant in the Louvre. He said he contested a symbol, not a particular country or company. “I’m not going to chain myself to a McDo,” he said. “The Louvre claims it has nothing to do with the mall, but the museum granted it as a concession. For me, it is a symbol of what French museums are turning into.” Some people here struggle to understand the paradox of McDonald’s success in a country that prides itself on viewing food as a prime element of culture. “Gastronomy is a discourse, it is about collective belief,” said Alain Drouard, a historian who is president of the International Commission for Research into European Food History, a group of scholars that researches the history of food and nutrition in Europe. “There is a gap between this discourse and what the French eat,” he said. Mr. Drouard is untroubled by the McDonald’s in the Louvre. “We’re in a process of industrialization,” he said. “The French have become eaters of convenience food.” McDonald’s popularity, he said, is the result of declining standards in what the French consider traditional fast food. “Bistros don’t know how to make a good sandwich anymore,” Mr. Drouard said. “McDo is a legitimate competitor.” At the McDonald’s near the Opéra Garnier, tourists mingled with Parisian professionals. The lunchtime crowd seemed uninterested in the bright green macaroons on offer at the cafe counter. “I come here once in a while,” said Mr. Mortin, the bank employee. “It’s more of a real lunch than eating a sandwich in the street, and it doesn’t take as much time as sitting in a restaurant.” Mr. Mortin was about to order his usual, a Big Mac with a side of four Chicken McNuggets. “It doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy French cuisine,” he said. “It’s not exclusive.” The success of McDonald’s does not mean that the pleasures of simple French food have vanished completely. Ms. Deleuze, the McDonald’s spokeswoman, said that the jambon beurre, a sandwich of butter and slices of ham on a crusty baguette, “still outsells burgers 10 to 1.” More Articles in World » A version of this article appeared in print on October 26, 2009, on page A7 of the New York edition.PARIS  When McDonald’s France announced a plan to open a restaurant in the commercial mall under the Louvre, the scene appeared to be set for a new French controversy.

''Luke says there's a restaurant called McDonald's,'' he reported one day. There was no point denying it, so I asked him what else he learned. ''He says that other kids eat there, but we don't. And he says that the food is bad for you.'' It seemed as if Luke's nutritional views might enable us to keep Dexter away from the golden arches indefinitely, but a few months later he brought it up again. This time he wanted to try it. Many, maybe even most, Americans have relationships with McDonald's that are at least as complex and rich as the ones we have with other people. Years ago a cheeseburger, fries and hot apple pie meant that I'd been a good boy, that my mother loved me. Later, chicken McNuggets provided the quick dinner break that helped me struggle through a summer job in telephone sales for which I was spectacularly ill suited. In the past two decades the chain has been little more for me than a source of palatable coffee on the Interstates, but going there always triggers a rumble of old emotions. And now, as I knew it would, fatherhood has changed my relationship with McDonald's again. In the meantime, the country's attitude toward the chain has grown more fraught: among some people, it has become a symbol of everything wrong with the way we eat. Of course, French fries and sodas were already called junk food when I was a boy, but no teenagers had yet tried to sue McDonald's for making them fat, and no filmmaker had documented the decline in his health during a month of eating every meal there. For some well-meaning parents, McDonald's is anathema. They would no sooner take the family out for Happy Meals than they would let their kids follow the meal with a postprandial cigarette. My convictions aren't quite that strong, but Dexter's friend pretty much got it right: Other kids eat there. Mine don't. For one thing, there are roughly a thousand restaurants in New York City that are more interesting. Because we have so many alternatives (and also, I suspect, because we watch very little television), McDonald's hasn't had much opportunity to seize Dexter's young imagination. But seize it will, and seize it did. When my wife, Susan, was out of town, Dexter and I walked the two blocks to our neighborhood McDonald's with his younger brother, Elliot, in the stroller. I ordered the newish Angus Third Pounder and enjoyed it reasonably well. The boys had Happy Meals with McNuggets, fries and milk. For dessert, I bought two apple pies. Dexter immediately asked why he saw the yellow McDonald's M everywhere. How do you explain one of the world's most sophisticated marketing machines to a 5-year-old? Nor did I have a ready answer for his next question: ''What's in the food that makes it bad for you?'' The milk was fortified with vitamins A and D and contained 1 percent fat. No harm there. With the fries and McNuggets, we enter the polysyllabic realm of ingredients I don't keep in my kitchen: mono- and diglycerides, tertiary butylhydroquinone, a number of phosphates, dimethylpolysiloxane. The last one is used as a lubricant, a dry-cleaning solution, an aquarium sealant, a component of the tiles that let spacecraft plunge through the atmosphere without burning up, a treatment for head lice and the thing that makes Silly Putty elastic. McDonald's adds it to cooking oil to avoid foaming. I can't find any convincing evidence that it is bad for you. I wasn't worried that the Happy Meal would fatten my boys into unhappy obesity either. Dexter would have taken in 190 calories had he eaten all four McNuggets. He got 230 calories from his fries, which he did finish. Together with the milk (100 calories), the Happy Meal gave him less than a third of the calories some nutritionists say he ought to have in a day. The apple pie (270 calories) was my idea. The hot apple pie of my childhood was a regional peculiarity that made it big. Fried turnovers are popular in parts of the Southeast, including Tennessee, where they are usually made with dried apples. A McDonald's franchise owner in Knoxville, Tenn., served them for years before headquarters noticed and imported them to the national menu. The crust was cratered like a miniature moon, the yellow filling was tantalizingly hot and distinctly salty, and together they made me crazy with happiness.</text></article>

Sales at established restaurants, those open at least 13 months, rose 3.5 percent in Europe, helped by Britain and France, and increased 1.7 percent in the United States, where intense fast-food price competition weighed on results. Comparable sales slipped 0.5 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa segment, McDonald's said Wednesday. Analysts had expected an increase of 2.8 percent in the United States. On a global basis, some estimates called for a sales increase of as much as 3 percent. McDonald's said sales in the United States were supported by the new premium Angus Third Pounder burger and new McCafe coffee drinks. McDonald's said sales rose 1.1 percent systemwide in August, but were up 4.1 percent excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. As a result of diners' continued cautious spending, McDonald's has focused its advertising on its core and value menus and away from higher-priced items -- with the exception of the new Angus burger, which is being introduced across the United States. Stock in McDonald's, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., fell $1.13, to close at $55.09 a share.</text></article>

A rider on the train noticed the boy alone in the last car and alerted the police, who reunited the boy with his mother. They were separated for about a half-hour, the police said. It began shortly before 2 p.m. when the boy, Christian Marquez, and his mother, Marlene Marquez-Torres, were getting lunch at a McDonald’s at 136-61 Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing, a few blocks from their home, the police said. The boy apparently walked to the Main Street stop of the No. 7 line at Roosevelt Avenue. There seemed to be three ways the boy could have gotten down into the subway system: by crossing a busy stretch of Roosevelt Avenue and entering there; by walking a full city block to entrances at Main Street; or by taking a long escalator located about 200 feet from the restaurant down into the station. He somehow got by the turnstiles and boarded a westbound train, the police said. Meanwhile, Detective Adam Frasse from the Vice Major Case Team entered the same McDonald’s to buy lunch and saw the mother, who was by then “hysterical,” an empty stroller next to her, said Lt. Michael Costello, the team’s commander. Late Tuesday evening, in the family’s apartment, Ms. Marquez-Torres recalled the moment she realized Christian was missing. She said she let go of his hand for just a moment while she threw something away. Then he was gone. “I was screaming, ‘My son, my son, what happened to my son!’ ” Ms. Marquez-Torres said in Spanish. She said her first thought was that someone had kidnapped her child. She told Detective Frasse what had happened with the help of another customer who translated for her. The vice team checked the store’s surveillance video and saw the boy walking out alone. They issued an alert at 1:59 p.m. over the police radio. On the train, someone spotted the boy and noticed that he was alone, officials said. A transit worker, who was aware of the alert, notified the police. Officers from the 109th Precinct took the mother to the subway stop at 74th Street and Broadway, where she and her son were reunited at 2:30 p.m., officials said. “I’m going to watch him closer than ever,” Ms. Marquez-Torres vowed later. Tuesday evening, the boy’s father, Jose Lino Marquez, 40, said, “Everything now is O.K.,” adding, “My son likes trains.” Trymaine Lee and Mick Meenan contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » McDonald’s announced Thursday that residents of China, the world’s most populous nation, would now be able to feast on four new combo McDonald’s meals  the other two feature a chicken filet sandwich and a pork burger  for 16.50 yuan, or $2.41, a cut of up to one-third from the former price. The promotion, McDonald’s said, is “in line with the government’s direction to stimulate domestic demand” and “help build a stronger economy.” As the economy slows, “we can do our part by helping stimulate domestic demand in the restaurant sector,” said Jeff Schwartz, chief executive of McDonald’s China. McDonald’s is not the only food retailer to have lowered prices in China Others, like KFC, also have started promotions as consumers in China begin to fret about slowing growth and rising unemployment. But the price reduction by one of the world’s best-known companies highlights how the downturn that began in the United States has changed shopping and selling patterns as far away as China. Just a year ago, the prices of staples like pork, rice and cooking oil were soaring, lifting inflation and threatening to overheat the Chinese economy, which had recorded double-digit growth for half a decade. Now, with growth slowing to 9 percent in 2008, and expected to be even lower this year, the pressure is on for retailers to entice shoppers with special deals. Standard and Poor’s, the ratings agency, said on Thursday that it expected China to grow about 6.5 to 7 percent this year and to pick up steam slightly next year, with a pace of 7.8 to 8.3 percent in 2010. And S.&amp; P.’s chief economist for the Asia Pacific region, Subir Gokarn, said he expected consumer price inflation to slow to 1.7 to 2.2 percent this year, from 5.9 percent in 2008. Still, China remains attractive because of the size of the market and growth rates that are still ahead of those in most of the rest of the world. McDonald’s is planning to expand in China, which is now one of its fastest-growing markets. McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in China in the southern city of Shenzhen in 1990. Since then, the number of outlets has mushroomed to 1,050, staffed by more than 60,000 employees. Another 175 restaurants are planned for this year. McDonald’s has been a rare beneficiary of the global downturn, as shoppers around the world switch to lower-priced goods. Last week, the company reported that sales had continued to climb during the last three months of 2008, when nearly every other industry reported a sharp downturn.

But this weekend in Connecticut the new McDonald’s commercial was running over and over again to promote a deal on triple cheeseburgers (two for $3), so I was pulled in more than once.

Perhaps a snafu on the part of Ronald or the agency? A: (Stuart Elliott) McDonald’s works with several agencies, dear reader, one of which is Arnold Worldwide in Boston, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas. Here is a reply to your question from Chris Edwards, executive vice president and group creative director there. “That was not a triple cheeseburger the woman was eating in the body of the spot,” Mr. Edwards writes in an e-mail message. “However, it was definitely not a mistake.” Rather, the commercial is composed of two parts, he explains. One is “a ‘shell,’ which has 18 seconds of live action that reflects the crave-able nature of McDonald’s burgers,” Mr. Edwards says. “It was created independently of the triple cheeseburger promotion,” he adds, “but was designed with an eight-second ‘hole’ to house offers for crave-able products like the triple cheeseburger, which is what we filled the spot with” for the New York metropolitan market. An agency called Moroch Partners created the shell of the commercial, Mr. Edwards says, for what is known as the “shared program,” and Arnold “filled the shell with the offer.” “This shell is available nationwide and will likely be filled with various offers on various products,” he adds, “which is what it was designed to do.” Dear readers, I love how you pay such close attention to ads  and can distinguish in seconds between a Big Mac and a triple cheeseburger. Q: (Reader) Your article last Tuesday in The New York Times on the Army campaign was a solid, meaty column with a lot of food for thought. In reading the column, I thought how much more effective and truthful it would have been if we read that the agency people spent time on the ground in Iraq playing an upfront, on-the-scene role like war correspondents. I was always guided by the discipline that the more you know about a product, the better and more honest the advertising. Granted there are risks, but how much more believable the campaign would have been. And I’m sure what an adman sees is quite different than the views of a military officer. Personal observation would also protect the relevance of the theme (“Army strong”). A: (Stuart Elliott) Here is a response, dear reader, from Susan Irwin, a spokeswoman for one of the agencies working on the Army campaign, McCann Erickson Worldwide in New York, which is part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies. “The reader’s point is very well taken and perhaps no more so than when considering the Army,” Ms. Irwin writes in an e-mail message, “because the role of the soldier is unlike any other and the soldier’s experience has so many dimensions including, but not exclusive to, deployment.” “While our team members have not been deployed to any combat zones,” she says, “virtually every senior member of the McCann Worldgroup’s Army team  including creative, digital, account management, public relations and media  has been thoroughly immersed in Army culture and training, part of the deep commitment that this client has made to agency learning.” The agency employees have taken part in “mini-basic combat training” at Fort Jackson, S.C., Ms. Irwin says, which is the Army’s largest basic training site; observed pre-deployment training; attended the Basic Officer Leadership Course and the R.O.T.C. Leadership Training Course; “taken the Army physical training test with the troops”; and spent “considerable” time with soldiers on Army installations in the United States and overseas. The employees have “spent thousands of hours talking to Army soldiers, their families, their leaders and to young men and women considering Army service,” Ms. Irwin says, which enables them “to more accurately articulate the Army’s mission and empower soldiers to help communicate the Army’s message to the young men and women who are considering military service, as well as to those who help influence that decision.” More Articles in Business »Q: (Reader) Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » I normally fast-forward through commercials when I have the opportunity.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » The McDonald’s Corporation said Monday that its global same-store sales rose 8.2 percent during the month. That beat the company’s own prediction for a rise similar to the one it recorded in its last quarter, when same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, jumped 7.1 percent worldwide. The results were a bright spot in what was a dismal month for most restaurant operators. Many conventional restaurant chains have reported steep declines in same-store sales during October as consumers grow more anxious about the possibility of a prolonged recession. But consumers in the United states kept spending at McDonald’s. Same-store sales rose 5.3 percent in the United States, helped by new menu items, including the Southern Style Chicken sandwich, and continued demand for breakfast items. The company’s popular dollar menu and its annual Monopoly promotion also drew in value-hungry consumers. Same-store sales rose 9.8 percent in Europe and grew 11.5 percent in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Demand was particularly strong in Australia, the company said. McDonald’s said total sales rose 5.4 percent during the month. A Morningstar analyst, John Owens, said the results showed McDonald’s was probably benefiting from diners who might ordinarily go to more expensive conventional restaurants but were gravitating to fast food to save money. “It definitely shows they are recession-resistant,” Mr. Owens said. Shares of McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., climbed $1.01, to $56.48.

And a Florida chain called Pizza Fusion reuses the draft from its ovens to heat water. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Beth Rooney for The New York Times John Rockwell, manager of restaurant design for McDonalds, at the rooftop garden on the revamped restaurant. Across the country, a race is under way among stores and fast-food restaurants to build environmentally friendly outlets, as a way to curry favor with consumers and to lower operating costs. Most chains are focusing on prototypes at the moment, but the trend could eventually change the look and function of thousands of stores. One of the latest participants is McDonald’s, which recently opened a revamped restaurant in a gritty industrial area on the South Side of Chicago, across from a food manufacturing plant and next to the Swap-O-Rama flea market. The newly rebuilt restaurant is crammed with energy- and water-saving gadgets as varied as high-efficiency appliances, pavement that filters rainwater, and tables and chairs made out of recycled material. It even has a garden on the roof. The green building boom is partly being driven by retailers’ desire to capture the attention of consumers who have become fascinated by hybrid cars, energy-saving light bulbs and wind turbines. But more important for the companies, it is a way to shave long-term operating costs at stores and restaurants, which consume copious amounts of energy and water for ovens and fryers, heaters and air conditioners, sinks and toilets. McDonald’s, for instance, plans to take the most successful aspects of its Chicago restaurant and replicate them at new outlets across the country. “You get energy savings, and you can tell customers you are greener. That’s a win-win,” said Neil Z. Stern, a retail consultant for McMillanDoolittle in Chicago. While customers may like the idea of green buildings, Mr. Stern said he was skeptical that it would lure them into stores. “Ultimately, the reason you do it is it’s a better way to run your business,” he said. Subway unveiled its first “eco-store” last year in Florida and has opened four more. Target, Office Depot and Staples have opened green stores, and Best Buy has announced plans to do the same. A few chains are even further along. Recently, Kohl’s opened 45 stores that were built using recycled materials, water-saving plumbing fixtures and on-site recycling. Wal-Mart, meanwhile, has taken the most successful techniques from prototype stores and incorporated them into all new stores, and it continues to experiment with “high-efficiency” stores that save 20 to 45 percent in energy costs when compared with more traditional stores. While the “green” moniker is ill-defined and vulnerable to exaggeration, many of the chains, including McDonald’s, are seeking certification from the United States Green Building Council, a nonprofit agency in Washington whose rating system is a widely accepted standard. Called LEED certification, for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, it provides a rating for buildings based on human and environmental health, sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. Under a new program, McDonald’s hopes to obtain certification for its prototype and then build many more restaurants based on that template, without going through the paperwork and expense of certifying each restaurant. LEED certification, though, is not without detractors, some of whom complain about the cost and inconvenience. Michael Gordon, one of the founders of Pizza Fusion, a Florida chain that has several green restaurants and boasts of its environmental ethos, said a 2,000-square-foot restaurant paid the same certification fees as one five times as large. Some others say they are uncomfortable with companies promoting their buildings as green. “There’s no such thing as a green building with a full parking lot,” said Seth Kaplan, vice president for climate advocacy at the Conservation Law Foundation. “That’s just an unavoidable truth.” Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University and a frequent critic of fast-food chains, said the green buildings were laudable but were ultimately intended to make people feel better about eating unhealthful food. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on November 8, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.CHICAGO  In new Wal-Mart stores, the baseboards and moldings are made of plastic left over from diaper manufacturing.

Schultz returned to the helm of Starbucks in January, he has desperately tried to recapture the company’s original magic. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Lee Celano for The New York Times After Howard Schultz, left, reclaimed the job of chief executive of Starbucks, he rehired Arthur Rubinfeld to help restore the company to its former success, which they had helped to create. Add to Portfolio Starbucks Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Rob Bennett for The New York Times In an effort to revive Starbucks, Mr. Rubinfeld says, he will focus on adding stores to urban areas, to attract affluent young professionals, and begin to tailor new stores to specific neighborhoods. The nostalgia-flavored turnaround effort has included a new coffee blend that harks back to the company’s Seattle origins and smaller espresso machines that do not isolate employees from customers. With less fanfare, Mr. Schultz has also hired back one of the authors of Starbucks’s original success: Arthur Rubinfeld, its president of global development. Back at Starbucks since February, Mr. Rubinfeld is now guiding a renovation of its stores and refocusing on the urban markets that gave the company its illustrious start. Starbucks is to some extent real estate driven, a business that depends on selecting visible, convenient locations. That makes Mr. Rubinfeld, a 54-year-old architect, one of Starbucks’s most important stewards. He led the company’s real estate and design division throughout the ’90s, fashioning an expansion strategy that focused on traffic patterns and demographics and became a model for the rest of the retail world. Mr. Rubinfeld left Starbucks in 2002 to start his own consulting firm. Last December, while plotting his return as chief executive, Mr. Schultz met Mr. Rubinfeld at  where else?  a Starbucks, in Seattle’s affluent Madison Park neighborhood, and asked him to resume his old duties. “I was concerned and a little upset at where our legacy could have ended up,” Mr. Rubinfeld said, describing his decision to accept the offer. “Everything about the company was being defined by others.” Nearly a year later, that has not changed, and the company is increasingly seen as a fading symbol of an overexuberant age. Wall Street analysts and investors continue to disparage Starbucks, citing self-inflicted wounds like overexpansion and mediocre food. The company’s fortunes seem to be waning by the day. It is being squeezed by rivals like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, which have started offering lower-price espresso drinks, and by a faltering economy that is forcing consumers to reconsider their $3.65-a-day caramel macchiato kick. As a result, Starbucks stock has dropped more than half in the last year and hit a nearly seven-year intraday low this week before rebounding slightly. It closed Wednesday at $11.33, compared with above $26 a year ago. In an interview last week, Mr. Schultz said the number of customers in Starbucks stores had declined compared with last year but that the trend appeared to have bottomed out. He argued that the company was in a better position than most to navigate a recession, largely because it has already decided to close 600 stores in the United States and lay off 1,000 workers this year. “We believe we are more relevant to our customers than ever before because of what we are all facing,” Mr. Schultz said, arguing that his cafes can be a refuge from the economic storm. “We are not selling a commodity cup of coffee. We have created a unique experience.” Mr. Schultz met Mr. Rubinfeld 30 years ago when they were both bachelors and neighbors in the same East Village apartment building. Today, the two remain so friendly that they close personal e-mail messages to each other with the word “love.” Mr. Rubinfeld’s touchy-feely camaraderie and unwavering smile mask his exasperation over Starbucks’s recent setbacks. In particular, he feels that the company has been treated unfairly by the news media and critics who disparage its coffee and accuse it of environmentally incautious practices like wasting water. (Starbucks prides itself on its progressive policies. It said Wednesday that it was doubling its purchase of farmer-friendly “Fair Trade” coffee and donating to Bono’s RED philanthropy.) But Mr. Rubinfeld acknowledges that in its relentless expansion to around 17,000 stores, Starbucks overlooked the costs to its reputation of generic, cookie-cutter designs and of placing stores in dreary suburban strip malls. “We did not have the discipline to say no,” he said. “The issue was our failure to say, ‘That store in that location should not be opened.’ ” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 30, 2008, on page B3 of the New York edition.SEATTLE  Since Howard D.

Add to Portfolio Starbucks Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Rob Bennett for The New York Times In an effort to revive Starbucks, Mr. Rubinfeld says, he will focus on adding stores to urban areas, to attract affluent young professionals, and begin to tailor new stores to specific neighborhoods. The nostalgia-flavored turnaround effort has included a new coffee blend that harks back to the company’s Seattle origins and smaller espresso machines that do not isolate employees from customers. With less fanfare, Mr. Schultz has also hired back one of the authors of Starbucks’s original success: Arthur Rubinfeld, its president of global development. Back at Starbucks since February, Mr. Rubinfeld is now guiding a renovation of its stores and refocusing on the urban markets that gave the company its illustrious start. Starbucks is to some extent real estate driven, a business that depends on selecting visible, convenient locations. That makes Mr. Rubinfeld, a 54-year-old architect, one of Starbucks’s most important stewards.

But its economy is increasingly being driven by technology and green manufacturing companies, big and small. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Paul Hosefros/The New York Times From left, Gerald Thompson of Sky Detective, Jason Crawforth of MobileDataforce and Todd Kleperis, also of Sky Detective. Entrepreneurial Edge James Flanigan writes about small businesses mainly in California and the West.James Flanigans Columns » Most of those companies have settled in the Boise Valley, an area of about 600,000 people, where they have received an enthusiastic response from city officials and technological and business assistance from Boise State University. “Some 70 percent of Idaho’s economy is in high technology,” said Jason Crawforth, founder and chief strategy officer of MobileDataforce, a Boise company with a software system for compiling and transmitting information from handsets in the field to databases in the home office. Mr. Crawforth cited American Electronics Association statistics that show Idaho’s exports to be chiefly in computer chips, parts and equipment, notwithstanding the potato. Yet it was the potato, in a way, that started Boise on a path to high technology industry. In 1978, the late Jack Simplot, founder of the J.R. Simplot Company, developer of Idaho russet potatoes and of freeze-dried French fries for McDonald’s, invested in a start-up called Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors. Micron now has more than 20,000 employees and close to $6 billion in annual revenues. (Micron is not immune to the turmoil in global economic markets. It announced last week that it would lay off more than 3,000 employees in the next two years because of a glut in microchips.) Idaho farmers have been backing technological start-ups ever since. Gerald R. Thompson, for example, said he raised $2 million from farmers near Boise in 2006 to start a company, Sky Detective. The company combines global positioning satellite technology with cellular phone technology from Qualcomm to produce a device capable of tracking people and cargoes anywhere in the world. Mr. Thompson, now a retired deputy sheriff in Los Angeles, said he saw a device that added satellite surveillance to a Qualcomm system to monitor the whereabouts of commercial trucks and found that law enforcement agencies were interested in the device as well. So he went back to Boise, where he had grown up, raised the start-up money and now has a company with 13 employees, as well as contract consultants in the United States and a manufacturing staff in China. “We make the hardware in China,” Mr. Thompson said. “But for software, I recruited engineering students at Boise State University who came up with all sorts of great ideas.” The Sky Detective product is now being used by law enforcement agencies, and the company is pursuing expansion worldwide and into consumer markets, so users can track children and pets. It is also seeking substantial capital investment, though Mr. Thompson said last week that “it’s a tough time to raise money.” He added: “I am seeing very cautionary demeanors in the venture capital and investment banking community. But they also tell me there is a lot of money on sidelines for the right opportunity.” MobileDataforce, Mr. Crawforth’s company, also uses cellphone technology for tasks as diverse as enabling workers in the field to give instant estimates and insurance payments for damages to automobiles and homes to keeping track of every metal rod and bolt in the new Bay Bridge under construction between San Francisco and Oakland. The company, Mr. Crawforth said, is awaiting a contract from the Agency for International Development to monitor distribution of AIDS vaccines and medicines in 13 African countries. And yes, he said, the company has concerns these days about cash flow. “We do the work ahead of time and need to keep payments coming in.” Mr. Crawforth said he and MobileDataforce’s three other owners were looking to raise capital. Another Boise company, the two-year-old Balihoo, uses complex Web-based software to help advertisers find potential audiences in the fragmented media field of social networks, Web sites and phone devices, not to mention newspapers, television and cable channels. “There are unmanageable numbers of Web sites,” said Vincent Martino, who is in charge of technology as Balihoo’s chief operating officer. “But our software can communicate with 100 sites directly and get the advertiser information to make an intelligent, efficient decision.” Balihoo was founded by Peter Gombert, an entrepreneur who had previously started and sold three software companies. The company, which has 75 employees, is financed by $5.5 million in venture capital raised from Lacuna Gap Capital in Boulder, Colo., and Highway 12 Ventures, a Boise firm. As to current economic conditions, Mr. Gombert said in an interview last week: “As a venture-backed firm, we do not rely heavily on general credit markets. The bigger concern is whether recession causes companies to reduce marketing and advertising. We have seen some pullback from our advertisers, but nothing significant at this point. The true tale will be told over the next three to six months.” Boise’s enthusiasm for business encouraged Dr. Carl R. Thornfeldt, a dermatologist for 25 years, to found a company, Episciences Inc., and create nonprescription products to reduce skin inflammation. The company now distributes those products through physicians’ offices. Episciences has 22 employees and, he said, “will expand this year through a venture in Japan.” Sandhill Industries, which recycles plate glass to make tiles for kitchens and bathrooms, moved to Boise six years ago from Alaska. The company was founded in 1998 by Terri Raudenbush, an engineering graduate of Colorado State University, and her husband, Jim, a forest firefighter for the federal government, with close to $400,000 in grants from the state of Alaska’s Science and Technology Foundation and the federal Environmental Protection Administration. The move to Boise helped her business, Mrs. Raudenbush said, “because we are closer to a supply of plate glass and to customers for shipping.” In a factory just outside Boise, Mrs. Raudenbush and three employees fuse recycled powdered glass in a low-energy furnace, add pigment for up to 36 colors, cut and bake tiles in kilns, cool them and ship them out. The company was included in a list of green producers on Martha Stewart’s television show two years ago and has distributed its tiles through its Web site from that time. Sandhill Industries has about $500,000 in annual sales, Mrs. Raudenbush said. “Our big advantage is the fact that we are a ‘green’ producer,” she explained. As to the current economic financial environment, “We have minuscule debt,” she added, with emphasis. “We pay off every month any advances we take from our $10,000 credit line from the bank.” This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month.

But many companies fear admitting the unions will give their Chinese employees the power to slow or disrupt their operations and will significantly increase the cost of doing business here. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Associated Press Workers voted in August to form a union at a Wal-Mart store in Kunming, China. Businesses are not allowed to block unions. Related Managing Globalization Blog (IHT) Will China Be One Big Union Shop?Go to Blog » The companies, many of which moved to China to lower manufacturing costs and some to avoid unions in their home countries as well, are now being asked to meet a Sept. 30 deadline to make their offices and factories union shops. Companies that do not comply risk being publicly vilified or blacklisted by the union, and perhaps penalized by the government, since businesses are required by law to allow unions to form. Lawyers and analysts say that demands of the All China Federation of Trade Unions, the only union the Communist Party allows, could sharply alter business practices of foreign companies in China, including giving lower-level workers the power to bargain over anything from pay raises to whether a Chinese headquarters should be moved elsewhere in the country. “This will dramatically change the landscape here,” said Andreas Lauffs, a lawyer at Baker &amp; McKenzie’s Shanghai office who is an authority on China’s labor laws. “At the very least, company management must now consult, and in many cases bargain, with employees and unions on a wide range of matters, whereas in the past they enjoyed almost unlimited autonomy.” The union push is coming at a time when global corporations are already facing rising labor and commodity costs in China, which is struggling to contain inflation. Hundreds of big corporations, like Wal-Mart, McDonald’s and Yum Brands, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, have agreed to set up unions in their Chinese operations. But union officials say that some nonmanufacturing companies are resisting. Microsoft’s China operation did not respond this week to questions about the union drive. The consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers said that its workers were not unionized but that it was studying the matter. Union officials say they are focusing on global companies, but Chinese companies make up the bulk of the manufacturing work force and they are also expected to face audits and pressure to unionize. For years, Western labor activists have taken aim at China’s manufacturing industry, exposing hundreds of exploitive factories that employ child labor, force workers to toil as many as 100 hours a week without overtime pay or benefits, and violate labor and safety rules. And some of the world’s biggest brand names, like Wal-Mart, Disney and Adidas, have been singled out for using contractors that violate China’s labor laws. The companies have, in many cases, investigated the claims and fired contractors. The new government pressure seems to be part of a sweeping effort aimed at addressing some of the ugly consequences of China’s dynamic economic growth, like rampant pollution, a growing income gap and widespread labor abuse. Up until now, though, the state-controlled union has done little to agitate on behalf of workers, legal experts say, and has often done more to control workers than to benefit them. The union’s reputation for allowing abuses to exists has led some to doubt whether it can properly represent workers. But the union, which says it already has 200 million members, is promising to truly represent workers, and is gaining standing with Communist Party leaders. In 2004, the National People’s Congress, the state legislative body, carried out inspections of companies operating in China to ensure that they were following labor laws and had dues-paying union members. Union officials, using increasingly bold tactics, have zeroed in on the China operations of the 500 biggest global corporations, which would mean millions of new union members. The union says it intends to combat worker exploitation. “Some foreign companies in China haven’t behaved well in dealing with their workers’ interests and rights,” Wang Ying, an official at the All China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing, said in a telephone interview this week. “As the economy and society develops, China needs to improve workers’ legal rights and interests, which is a demand of a civilized society.” 1 2 Next Page » Chen Yang contributed reporting.

The consulting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers said that its workers were not unionized but that it was studying the matter. Union officials say they are focusing on global companies, but Chinese companies make up the bulk of the manufacturing work force and they are also expected to face audits and pressure to unionize. For years, Western labor activists have taken aim at China’s manufacturing industry, exposing hundreds of exploitive factories that employ child labor, force workers to toil as many as 100 hours a week without overtime pay or benefits, and violate labor and safety rules. And some of the world’s biggest brand names, like Wal-Mart, Disney and Adidas, have been singled out for using contractors that violate China’s labor laws. The companies have, in many cases, investigated the claims and fired contractors. The new government pressure seems to be part of a sweeping effort aimed at addressing some of the ugly consequences of China’s dynamic economic growth, like rampant pollution, a growing income gap and widespread labor abuse. Up until now, though, the state-controlled union has done little to agitate on behalf of workers, legal experts say, and has often done more to control workers than to benefit them. The union’s reputation for allowing abuses to exists has led some to doubt whether it can properly represent workers. But the union, which says it already has 200 million members, is promising to truly represent workers, and is gaining standing with Communist Party leaders. In 2004, the National People’s Congress, the state legislative body, carried out inspections of companies operating in China to ensure that they were following labor laws and had dues-paying union members. Union officials, using increasingly bold tactics, have zeroed in on the China operations of the 500 biggest global corporations, which would mean millions of new union members. The union says it intends to combat worker exploitation. “Some foreign companies in China haven’t behaved well in dealing with their workers’ interests and rights,” Wang Ying, an official at the All China Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing, said in a telephone interview this week. “As the economy and society develops, China needs to improve workers’ legal rights and interests, which is a demand of a civilized society.” 1 2 Next Page » Chen Yang contributed reporting.</text></article>

In the late stages of the Vietnam War, network television news shows in the United States were pressured into superimposing ''File Footage'' when they showed battle scenes or footage shot earlier in the war. In view of the deteriorating viewership of television news programs, stations and networks should embrace the use of disclosure and any other opportunity they can find to maintain a relationship of trust and credibility with the American people.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Meredith Corporation McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » But TV news? In recent weeks, anchors on the Fox affiliate in Las Vegas, KVVU, sit with cups of McDonald’s iced coffee on their desks during the news-and-lifestyle portion of their morning show. The anchors rarely touch the cups. Executives at the station, one of 12 owned by Meredith Corporation, say the six-month promotion is meant to shore up advertising revenue and, as they told the news staff, will not influence content. “There was a healthy dose of skepticism, and I’m pleased there was  it means they’re being journalists,” said Adam P. Bradshaw, news director of KVVU. The product placement was first reported Monday in The Las Vegas Sun. The arrangement does raise questions about potential conflicts between the intended message and news content. The ad agency that arranged the promotion said the coffee cups would most likely be whisked away if KVVU chooses to report a negative story about McDonald’s. “If there were a story going up, let’s say, God forbid, about a McDonald’s food illness outbreak or something negative about McDonald’s, I would expect that the station would absolutely give us the opportunity to pull our product off set,” said Brent Williams, account supervisor at Karsh/Hagan, the advertising agency that arranged the deal between McDonald’s and KVVU. If that did not happen, “it might lead to the termination of an agreement” to appear on the show, he said. KVVU, for its part, said it would continue to report truthfully and honestly about McDonald’s. Mr. Bradshaw said the station would remove the cups, just as it would remove spot advertising from a newscast for any advertiser who is the subject of a negative report. With the economy in rough shape and advertisers funneling more dollars to the Internet, the television industry is trying to increase its revenues. Neither the agency nor KVVU would reveal the price of the six-month deal. Other stations owned by Meredith  including WFSB, the CBS affiliate in Hartford, Conn., and WGCL, the CBS affiliate in Atlanta  are also accepting product placements on their morning shows. Arrangements like these are anathema to journalists and media watchdogs. And the broader issue of product placements is under scrutiny at the Federal Communications Commission, which is weighing tighter rules for how sponsorships on TV shows are disclosed. “Expanding this into news raises very troubling questions,” said Harold Feld, senior vice president for the Media Access Project, a consumer advocacy group. “Viewers, when they see news programs, are expecting to see things that reflect the marriage of the things reported, and do not look in the credits of these programs to see if there’s some small disclaimer that people are being paid for product placements.” The three major network morning shows, ABC’s “Good Morning America,” CBS’s “The Early Show,” and NBC’s “Today” do not accept fees in exchange for product placement, representatives of the shows said Monday. “It is against CBS News’s standards to accept money in exchange for product placement on any broadcast, and we do not do so,” Kelli Halyard, a CBS spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message. Paul Karpowicz, the president of Meredith Broadcasting Group, said that product placements on his stations were limited to morning news shows. “If something happens and we have to report something about McDonald’s, we’ll report it,” said Mr. Bradshaw of KVVU. “I would not put product placement into any of my traditional hard newscasts. I would not run it in my 5 p.m. or my 10 p.m.” He said he was not allowing the McDonald’s cups on the so-called straight news portion of the morning report, which is before 7 a.m., but on a lighter, news-and-lifestyle show that goes from 7 to 9 a.m. McDonald’s has also placed products on morning news shows on WFLD in Chicago, which is owned and operated by Fox; and on KCPQ in Seattle, a Fox affiliate owned by the Tribune Company, said Danya Proud, a McDonalds spokeswoman. Ms. Proud said the promotion was regional rather than national in scope. “This is a way for us to allow our customers to discover our products,” she said. Morning shows, she said, are a natural place to promote coffee drinks. But what if the reporters sitting in front of McDonald’s products are doing segments about, say, gang violence or outbreaks of tainted food? “That’s something we’ve taken into account,” said Mr. Williams of Karsh/Hagan, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group. “I’m kind of relying, my client is relying, on just the inner workings of that station,” he said. “Not that editorial would ever give a heads-up to sales or be expected to give a heads-up to sales, but these are professionals. They do realize that some businesses’ brands, some businesses’ reputations, could be at stake in terms of how commerce and news are interacting here.” In 2005, the F.C.C. issued a reminder to broadcasters that they must disclose when they use certain video news releases provided by corporations. The inquiry that the agency opened in June is focused on entertainment shows rather than news, but could easily be broadened. In June, the Writers Guild of America West sent a letter to the F.C.C. supporting real-time disclosure of product placement and asking for a ban on video news releases on local broadcast television. “This practice is unbelievably deceptive and is an attempt to trick the viewer to think that a paid advertisement is actually news,” the group’s president, Patric M. Verrone, wrote. Herbert Jack Rotfeld, a professor of marketing at Auburn University, said that product placement deals on news shows could backfire for both sides. “In the end, they just make the audiences even more skeptical of everything.” he said.

McDonald’s introduced a spirit-lifting jingle: “Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame-seed bun.” Skip to next paragraph Related The Big Mac Chant-Off MySpace Page Add to Portfolio McDonald's Corp Go to your Portfolio » Now it is 2008, and McDonald’s is reviving it as a TV commercial. The company has asked consumers to write their own songs using the exact words of the jingle, and submit them to a contest on MySpace.com. The official reason is this year’s 40th anniversary of the Big Mac, but the then-and-now cultural similarities are not entirely lost on the company. “That might be coincidental  unhappily, maybe, but coincidental,” said Marlena Peleo-Lazar, chief creative officer for McDonald’s U.S.A. The contest, she said, was dreamed up in the spirit of summer fun and the hamburger’s birthday. “Big Mac is just an iconic product for us, and it is a customer favorite,” she said. Nevertheless, the jingle itself suggests getting a whole lot of food  for what consumers know is a low price. The message seems to resonate in today’s economy, which is why chains like Quiznos, and Subway have been marketing the fact that $5 can fill your stomach at their restaurants, no matter how little it does for your gas tank. Today a Big Mac in New York costs $3.79, which is still less than a gallon of gas; in 1974, the price in New York was 85 cents, which was significantly more than a gallon of gas. Of course, there are also huge differences between today’s world and the one that existed when the jingle first appeared. In 1974, people were busy following President Richard Nixon’s downfall and tracking whether it was an odd- or an even-numbered day, when gas buying was restricted based on license plates. Nobody had heard of a mash-up or a Web site. But today the McDonald’s channel of choice is a social networking site geared to people who were not yet born in 1974. Nevertheless, nearly 1,000 songs have been submitted, and judges have selected five finalists. The public has been invited to vote, and a winner will be announced Tuesday. In keeping with the tone of today’s economy, the winner won’t get any cash, but his or her song will be featured in a commercial later this month. McDonald’s advertising agency, DDB Worldwide, created the video component, which is available on the MySpace contest site; users have been asked to provide only the soundtrack. “We knew there were a lot of consumers out there that would remember the chant, but we also felt like the younger audience was familiar with it, and we wanted them to give us a contemporary version,” said Jaime Guerrero, account director at Tribal DDB Worldwide in Chicago, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of Omnicom, which handled the online campaign. People can still watch some of the vintage commercials on YouTube, one of which ends with the period catchphrase, “Far out!” YouTube also features a few modern riffs on the jingle, but those videos have a bit less charm; in one example, a group of young men in a car rap the “Two all-beef patties” mantra into a McDonald’s drive-through speaker box. Among the official contest submissions on MySpace, the entries range from a yearning country song (“I wanna give to ya, two all-beef patties. ...”) to rap (“Load up the homeys in the car, get the keys, now we’re off on a Mickey D’s run/I want two all-beef patties. ...”). There are five music genres that contestants can choose from; the majority of entries are hip-hop. Quincy Alexander Mosley, a 21-year-old music producer from Bethlehem, Pa., submitted a track to the R&amp;B category called “SupaSize Dat.” Although he is not a regular Big Mac eater, he said, he decided to enter the contest after hearing a radio ad; the idea for his submission came after “a burst of inspiration.” “The sesame-seed, that part right there, threw me off for a minute,” he said, in terms of fitting the syllables into the rhythm. “I heard a lot of submissions on there that, when I heard them, it sounded like they was struggling with that word,” he said. McDonald’s is not the only company glancing backward for inspiration. Unilever’s Klondike is offering a $100,000 prize for the best video answer to the question, “What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?” Citigroup has revived “Citi Never Sleeps,” and Burger King wants you to “Have It Your Way.” “There’s no doubt that all the consumer-confidence stuff is a little rocky these days, and we’re all looking for a little bit of reassurance,” said Kendra Gale, an assistant professor in the school of journalism and mass communication at the University of Colorado in Boulder. “There’s certainly something comforting about it.” For companies, reviving a campaign through user-generated submissions can appeal to older consumers’ nostalgia while introducing a classic campaign to a younger set. There is a small risk that companies can seem out of touch by asking the MySpace generation to play with their parents’ (or grandparents’) taglines. “That’s the biggest paradox to me,” said William J. Jurewicz, the chief executive of Space150, a digital marketing agency in Minneapolis that is not involved with the McDonald’s promotion. “They’re going after a very young group with a very old jingle, and not necessarily correlating how cool and retro and throwback it was.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The year was 1974: gas prices were high, inflation was rampant and an unpopular Republican occupied the White House.

Thirty-one years, six films and countless tiny plastic storm troopers later, the toy retailer is hoping to once again establish itself as the ultimate destination for all things ''Star Wars.'' Starting this week, Toys ''R'' Us is mounting digital clocks in all 585 of its stores that will count down to July 26, when more than 225 of those stores will open at midnight to begin selling toys from the latest ''Star Wars'' film, ''The Clone Wars,'' an animated movie that opens in the United States on Aug. 15. Two of the retailer's flagship outlets, in Mission Bay in San Diego and in Times Square, will hold costume and trivia contests that night as well, and will give away limited-edition ''Star Wars'' toys with every purchase. This time, even McDonald's is getting involved, with its first ever Happy Meal promotion for a ''Star Wars'' movie. At Toys ''R'' Us, the promotion will last at least through the Christmas shopping season, according to executives at the company. Until then, all ''Star Wars'' items, some of which are exclusive to the retailer, will occupy their own branded boutiques in the stores. Also, a section of the retailer's Web site will be dedicated to the movie. The approach is not altogether new for Toys ''R'' Us, which has held midnight openings and other promotional events for each of the last three ''Star Wars'' movies, dating back to 1999's ''Episode I: The Phantom Menace.'' What is notable is the loyalty of Toys ''R'' Us to the ''Star Wars'' franchise as it shifts from blockbuster live-action films to a smaller, animated feature with a more niche focus. ''The Clone Wars'' is the first fully animated ''Star Wars'' film, as well as the first that is not part of the originally conceived trilogies. It builds off an animated miniseries, also called ''The Clone Wars,'' that appeared on the Cartoon Network from 2003-5. Many of the original actors lend their voices to the characters in the movie (Samuel L. Jackson plays Mace Windu, for instance, and Anthony Daniels is C3PO), but some others are new. Still in development is yet another ''Clone Wars'' animated series, which is to be shown on the Cartoon Network later this year. The approximately 90-minute feature being released this summer was originally intended for television as well, but was reformatted for a theatrical release after George Lucas, the head of the Lucasfilm studio that makes the Star Wars films, saw an early cut and decided that it should be seen on a larger screen. ''Sometimes George works in strange ways,'' said Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing. That shift brings with it some change in marketing partners. Neither Pepsi, Burger King nor Kellogg's have any connection to the new movie, whereas all had made major investments in the previous three movies in the form of product tie-ins and promotions. Their absence, according to Lucasfilm, is a consequence of the last-minute decision to release the film in theaters. For the 'Star Wars' prequels, ''we had a decade-long plan,'' Mr. Roffman said. ''Our decision to release this film came later in the process, so it was just the way that it worked out for us.'' Burger King declined to comment about its decision not to participate in the new film, but a spokeswoman from Kellogg's said in an e-mail message that the company makes ''every effort to offer promotions that are both interesting and enjoyable to our consumers.'' A spokeswoman for Pepsi, meanwhile, was unaware that a new ''Star Wars'' movie was being released. In their absence, however, is a significant new partner. For the first time in the history of the ''Star Wars'' franchise, McDonald's is coming along for the ride. Starting Aug. 15, the fast food chain will be offering Clone Wars Happy Meals. Each will come with a specially designed box and one of 18 exclusive toys. Collectors will have to be diligent however, as the promotion lasts only four weeks, and the toys will be available only with purchase of a Happy Meal.</text></article>

The Taco Bell value menu, for instance, gave rise to the Wendy's Super Value Menu, the McDonald's Dollar Menu and the Burger King Value Menu. The Angus beef burger from Back Yard Burgers begat similar burgers at McDonald's, Burger King and Hardee's. In the latest appropriation of a popular product, McDonald's has just introduced a Southern Style Chicken Sandwich -- one that looked suspiciously like the signature sandwich of the Chick-fil-A chain. ''We knew this was coming,'' said Don Perry, a Chick-fil-A spokesman. McDonald's is rolling out the sandwich in all 14,000 of its restaurants in the United States, in what the company says is one of its biggest product introductions this year. Television ads in five languages started running May 6, and on May 15 free Southern Style Chicken Sandwiches (and a breakfast version) were offered with the purchase of a drink in all McDonald's restaurants. Ads for the product are in print, on billboards, online and on the radio. A Web site, whatcamefirst.com, pits a chicken versus an egg in a dance-off, sort of like the ''Subservient Chicken'' site that Burger King put up in 2004 to promote its chicken sandwiches. McDonald's says that its new site, put up in late April, is meant to appeal to young adults and has so far attracted 150,000 visitors. But McDonald's disavows any similarity to the Chick-fil-A sandwich. ''Absolutely not,'' said Marta Fearon, the marketing director for McDonald's in the United States, when asked if the company was going after the smaller chain's customers. ''It is all about McDonald's chicken.'' The sandwich is a breaded chicken breast garnished with two pickles -- exactly what Chick-fil-A offers. It was thought up by a group of McDonald's franchisees in Atlanta, where Chick-fil-A is based. And it comes in breakfast biscuit or sandwich form, just as it does at Chick-fil-A. According to Chick-fil-A, a promotion in the Atlanta area for McDonald's has promoted the fact that the Southern Style Chicken Sandwiches are available on days ending in ''y'' -- an interesting approach, given that Chick-fil-A restaurants are closed on Sundays. Chick-fil-A, a private company with about 1,380 restaurants in 37 states and the District of Columbia, says that it is the second-largest quick-serve chicken chain (KFC is largest), but that it does not have the marketing resources to retaliate directly. ''We really encouraged the stores, 'Don't even waste time working on pushing back on McDonald's; you've got more important battles,' '' Mr. Perry said. The franchisees have been watching McDonald's test the product over the last two years in 2,000 stores. But Chick-fil-A was focused on its own new menu effort, a line of healthy foods (more salads, among other things) that was announced on Monday. ''We're very proactive with the media,'' said Steve A. Robinson, the chief marketing officer for Chick-fil-A, but ''we have very limited budgets'' for advertising. The focus of the national marketing is on college-sports sponsorships like the Chick-fil-A Bowl, and these efforts do not get going until the fall, he said. ''Why would we not pointedly come back and try to communicate something about Chick-fil-A versus McDonald's?'' Mr. Robinson said. ''The answer is we simply do not have the media resources to get into that contest. We're not going there.'' At least one Chick-fil-A franchisee could not resist a swipe. Arthur Greeno of Tulsa, Okla., saw a billboard near one of his franchises -- and near a McDonald's -- and found out it was available on May 15. For that day, he posted the message: ''Trade in Any 1/2 Eaten Copied Sandwich and Get the Original Meal Free at Chick-fil-A.'' Mr. Greeno said about 50 or 60 sandwiches were exchanged. ''They said, 'Don't spend any of your time focusing on it,' and I wouldn't have, but to be honest this opportunity kind of fell in my lap,'' he said. At McDonald's, the May 15 promotion was a bit less successful than expected: the company had estimated it would give away eight million sandwiches, but the actual figures came to two million biscuits and a little over five million sandwiches, said Ms. Fearon, the marketing director. ''In the northern part of the country, they may not be used to eating chicken at breakfast or chicken without a lot of toppings on it,'' she said. ''So we had a very large effort to promote this product with a sampling.'' As for the ads, the mass-market spots talk about the juiciness and simplicity of the chicken. Others, aimed at African-Americans, are ''grounded in this notion of their upbringing and their memories of Southern-style chicken,'' Ms. Fearon said. Those for the Hispanic market are mainly in Spanish, while ads for Asian consumers are running in Korean, Mandarin Chinese and a Tamil-English mix called Tanglish. DDB Chicago, part of the DDB Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, created the general consumer ads; Burrell Communications did ads for the African-American market; Alma DDB (also part of Omnicom), the ads for the Hispanic market; and IW Group (part of the Interpublic Group of Companies) the ads for the Asian-American market. McDonald's is not the only chain starting to embrace the Southern-style sandwich. Not long ago, many quick-serve restaurants rushed to add wrap sandwiches to their menus in rapid succession; now the same thing seems to be happening with Southern-style chicken. Arby's announced in March that it would offer its Southern Style Chicken at two for $4 as a limited-time menu item; soon after, Hardee's said it would roll out its Chicken Fillet Biscuit nationwide. ''The fastest-growing food over the last 10 years in the restaurant industry has been fried chicken sandwiches,'' Harry Balzer, who researches the food industry for the NPD Group, said. Analysts gave the new McDonald's sandwich positive reviews in both taste and sales potential. ''We like the flavor and portion size'' of the new product ''and think that it may be the closest offering we have seen to Chick-fil-A's signature chicken sandwich, which we consider to be a leader,'' Jeffrey Omohundro, a senior analyst for Wachovia Capital Markets, wrote in a recent report.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ariadne, another character in The Lost Ring. The game is part of McDonalds marketing for the Olympic Games in Beijing. For that reason, gamers were surprised to learn that McDonald’s was the sponsor of an enigmatic Olympic-themed online game called The Lost Ring, introduced last month. Nothing about the game was branded McDonald’s, and the game’s Web sites  mysterious and hip, like “Lost” mixed with “The Blair Witch Project” were a far cry from the golden arches. “The Olympics in Beijing are a very big event for us, and we have a lot of different types of activation, with The Lost Ring being the most creative,” said Mary Dillon, McDonald’s global chief marketing officer. “Our goal is really about strengthening our bond with the global youth culture.” The Lost Ring is part of a gaming genre called alternate-reality games that blend online and offline clues and rely on players collaborating to solve the puzzles. While corporate sponsorship of these games is common  a popular one called The Beast was created by Microsoft for the Warner Brothers film “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence”  this is McDonald’s first foray into the genre. The game began with 50 bloggers receiving packages with an Olympic-themed poster and a clue pointing them to TheLostRing.com. The site presented a dramatic trailer, replete with sci-fi lighting and a narrator with a British-accented baritone speaking over scenes of a woman waking up in a field with “Trovu la ringon perditan”  an Esperanto phrase  tattooed on her arm.  Within a day or two, as players searched for clues, they found the terms of service on the Web site, which revealed that McDonald’s, in partnership with the International Olympic Committee, was behind the game. “I think finding out that it was McDonald’s was kind of a big shock for everyone,” said Geoff May, a player in Ontario who founded a Web site (olympics.wikibruce.com) on the game. “Obviously it’s McDonald’s, and not everyone likes them,” he said. “Personally, I don’t mind as long as we don’t get products forced down our throat. If we’re getting McDonald’s meals sold by characters, it’s going to be hard to suspend our disbelief.” That’s part of the reason McDonald’s has remained behind the curtain thus far. A successful alternate-reality game relies on the players’ continuing interest. “If an A.R.G. is too clearly corporate or commercial, the gamers will not want to engage,” said Tracy Tuten, an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, who studies new-media marketing tools. “It’s very important that the game be written in a way where the branding is not obvious.” McDonald’s has been careful to reflect that, Ms. Dillon said. “Above all, we want to be credible, authentic and respectful to this new audience,” she said. With that in mind, development of the game was given to AKQA, a San Francisco marketing agency, and Jane McGonigal, a game developer. When released in early March, the game was available in seven languages. Ten characters provide clues via YouTube videos, blogs, Flickr photos and Twitter updates. Online clues are supplemented by offline ones: last week, players found documents in a Tokyo mailbox and a bookstore fireplace in Johannesburg. The clues have helped players deduce the outline of the game, which centers on a lost Olympic sport that one plays blindfolded. Soon, Ms. McGonigal said, players will be asked to participate in the sport in the real world. The game is scheduled to run through Aug. 24, the Olympics closing ceremony. “I think the players will be very happy to discover that around the closing ceremonies, there is a real-world payoff to their alternate-reality heroics,” Ms. McGonigal said. She was, in keeping with the game’s spirit, cryptic about what that payoff would be, though she hinted that the city of Beijing might be involved.  McDonald’s would not disclose the cost of the campaign, though Ms. Dillon said that “in the context of the total Olympics, it’s just a fraction of what we’re doing.” As for measuring the return on the company’s investment, Ms. Dillon said she saw it as more of a learning experience. “You can’t put an R.O.I. on this,” she said. McDonald’s said the game had attracted 150,000 players so far, with 70 percent of traffic from outside the United States. Both the quiet sponsorship and the game itself are unusual for McDonald’s. But the company does aim for the youth market, which overlaps neatly with the fan base for alternate-reality games. If those gamers develop new respect for McDonald’s, it would be a marketing coup. “The players appreciate that they got this good experience for free,” said Sean C. Stacey, the founder of the gaming fan site Unfiction. “That tends to create a stronger bond between the player and the brand than having a straight advertisement.” More Articles in Business »NOT known for its dark marketing, McDonald’s is more a try-our-new-salad, get-your-Shrek-action-figure, look-at-our-dollar-menu sort of place.

By the time it arrives in August for the start of the Olympic Games, Beijing will have largely completed a transformation from a staid seat of government to a modern metropolis. Skip to next paragraph Related Managing Globalization Blog (IHT) An Olympic Boost for BeijingGo to Blog » Even as its economy surged in recent years, Beijing, China’s capital, still lagged behind business centers like Shanghai and Guangzhou in commercial development. Roads and public transit were outmoded, developers said, and companies that wanted to expand there had limited options for office or retail space. But with the Olympic Games as a catalyst, government authorities undertook a vast makeover of the city. Since its selection in 2001 as the host city, it has poured $40 billion into infrastructure projects and Olympics venues while encouraging the development of glittering office, hotel and retail centers. Entire neighborhoods are being renovated. In 2007, four new shopping centers added nearly 1.2 million square feet of retail space, office space expanded by more than 14 million square feet, and 2,500 new hotel rooms came onto the market, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services and money management company. And that was just last year. In 2008, an additional 11 shopping centers totaling more than 11 million square feet are scheduled to open, along with 15 million square feet of office space and more than 11,000 hotel rooms, Jones Lang LaSalle said. With the new supply of high-quality real estate, more American companies have been heading into Beijing, seeking to expand their presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets. A less-stringent regulatory environment for business is also helping to clear the path; there are fewer ownership restrictions, for example, for foreign businesses in certain industries. “The city is expanding at such a pace, it’s creating new opportunities every day,” said Edwin Fuller, the president and managing director of international lodging for Marriott International, whose hotel brands include JW Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts, Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance Hotels. In the two years leading up to the start of the Games, Marriott International will have opened eight new hotels, totaling 3,000 rooms, including a JW Marriott and Beijing’s second Ritz-Carlton. Both the JW Marriott and the Ritz opened late last year in China Central Place, a new mixed-use development in the Central Business District. Companies already established in China are expanding in Beijing, including McDonald’s, Staples, Starbucks and Nike, while others are entering for the first time, or venturing into more direct investments. Apple plans to open its first Chinese store in Beijing this summer. The store, with 30,000 square feet of space, will be on Qianmen Street, a historic but neglected commercial district at the south end of Tiananmen Square that is being remade into a pedestrian shopping and dining corridor. Last August, Nike, which is sponsoring several Olympic teams, opened a flagship store on the busy Wangfujing Street in the city’s center. At 12,000 square feet, the store is the company’s largest in China, and the first in the country that Nike directly owns and operates. The company says sales have been brisk. (There are some 3,500 Nike stores throughout China, though they are owned and operated by franchisees or other partners.) The Fatburger restaurant chain, owned by the Fog Cutter Capital Group, also plans to open an outlet in Beijing before the Olympics, after the opening last fall of its first Chinese venture in Macao. And Auntie Anne’s Pretzels plans to open three outlets in Beijing in the coming months, in its first foray into China. “We’re using the Olympics as a catalyst to expose people to our brand,” said Mike McCoy, the director of franchise development and international operations at Auntie Anne’s. He said the company had long considered expanding into China but only recently found the right licensee with whom to form a partnership. “With the Olympics, the timing couldn’t be better,” he said. Even celebrity chefs are getting in on the action. Daniel Boulud, who owns high-profile restaurants in New York and Las Vegas, plans to have a restaurant in Legation Quarter, a luxury development that will open this spring in the former American Embassy near Tiananmen Square, next to the mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The appeal, of course, is easy to see: China’s economy has been growing by double-digits annually, and its 1.3 billion or so citizens are becoming more affluent. Yet few Chinese brands compete in the luxury categories. “The consumer market is a blank canvas in China, to a certain degree,” said Benjamin Christensen, the research manager of Jones Lang LaSalle Beijing. It was only in 2001 that the first modern shopping mall opened in Beijing. But the concept has caught on with consumers and retailers alike. The advent of a global event like the Olympics, expected to draw some two million foreign and domestic visitors, has been a strong springboard. Still, some people wonder what will happen when the athletes and the spectators go home, and Beijing is left to absorb an enormous increase in hotel rooms, shops and office space, some in unproven neighborhoods. Many Olympic host cities, like Montreal in 1976 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, experienced economic slumps after the Games as they struggled to recoup their costly investments. In recent months, some new retail centers have had trouble lining up tenants, according to leasing agents. Similarly, hotel occupancy rates in Beijing are likely to drop, at least temporarily, after the Games, said Andreas Flaig, an executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels in China. But hotels may partially offset that with higher prices, he said, noting that average room rates for luxury hotels in Beijing nearly doubled from 1999 to 2007, to roughly $200. These hotels “are built for the long term, not for a 16-day event in August,” Mr. Flaig said. “They want to participate in the long-term growth of Beijing.” Indeed, few companies coming into Beijing seem worried. For one thing, hotels groups like Marriott International tend to operate hotels for local business people who develop the properties, so they are more insulated from real estate costs and risks. Similarly, most retail outlets have a local partner or franchisee, although direct investment has been growing. MOREOVER, China’s long-term growth prospects and Beijing’s healthy mix of tourists and business travelers bode well for the long term. Past Olympic host cities have largely been in developed countries. Beijing, by contrast, is experiencing breathtaking growth, and the investments made for the Olympics, largely centered on improving transportation and infrastructure, will only help its future growth, according to Michael Thompson, the president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Asia unit. Mr. Fuller of Marriott agreed. “You’ve watched every city that has ever hosted the Olympics go into oversupply mode,” he said. In Beijing, he said, “I suspect it will be relatively short-lived.” More Articles in Real Estate »THE Olympic torch set off last week from Athens for Beijing.

With the new supply of high-quality real estate, more American companies have been heading into Beijing, seeking to expand their presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets. A less-stringent regulatory environment for business is also helping to clear the path; there are fewer ownership restrictions, for example, for foreign businesses in certain industries. “The city is expanding at such a pace, it’s creating new opportunities every day,” said Edwin Fuller, the president and managing director of international lodging for Marriott International, whose hotel brands include JW Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts, Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance Hotels. In the two years leading up to the start of the Games, Marriott International will have opened eight new hotels, totaling 3,000 rooms, including a JW Marriott and Beijing’s second Ritz-Carlton. Both the JW Marriott and the Ritz opened late last year in China Central Place, a new mixed-use development in the Central Business District. Companies already established in China are expanding in Beijing, including McDonald’s, Staples, Starbucks and Nike, while others are entering for the first time, or venturing into more direct investments. Apple plans to open its first Chinese store in Beijing this summer. The store, with 30,000 square feet of space, will be on Qianmen Street, a historic but neglected commercial district at the south end of Tiananmen Square that is being remade into a pedestrian shopping and dining corridor. Last August, Nike, which is sponsoring several Olympic teams, opened a flagship store on the busy Wangfujing Street in the city’s center. At 12,000 square feet, the store is the company’s largest in China, and the first in the country that Nike directly owns and operates. The company says sales have been brisk. (There are some 3,500 Nike stores throughout China, though they are owned and operated by franchisees or other partners.) The Fatburger restaurant chain, owned by the Fog Cutter Capital Group, also plans to open an outlet in Beijing before the Olympics, after the opening last fall of its first Chinese venture in Macao. And Auntie Anne’s Pretzels plans to open three outlets in Beijing in the coming months, in its first foray into China. “We’re using the Olympics as a catalyst to expose people to our brand,” said Mike McCoy, the director of franchise development and international operations at Auntie Anne’s. He said the company had long considered expanding into China but only recently found the right licensee with whom to form a partnership. “With the Olympics, the timing couldn’t be better,” he said. Even celebrity chefs are getting in on the action. Daniel Boulud, who owns high-profile restaurants in New York and Las Vegas, plans to have a restaurant in Legation Quarter, a luxury development that will open this spring in the former American Embassy near Tiananmen Square, next to the mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The appeal, of course, is easy to see: China’s economy has been growing by double-digits annually, and its 1.3 billion or so citizens are becoming more affluent. Yet few Chinese brands compete in the luxury categories. “The consumer market is a blank canvas in China, to a certain degree,” said Benjamin Christensen, the research manager of Jones Lang LaSalle Beijing. It was only in 2001 that the first modern shopping mall opened in Beijing. But the concept has caught on with consumers and retailers alike. The advent of a global event like the Olympics, expected to draw some two million foreign and domestic visitors, has been a strong springboard. Still, some people wonder what will happen when the athletes and the spectators go home, and Beijing is left to absorb an enormous increase in hotel rooms, shops and office space, some in unproven neighborhoods. Many Olympic host cities, like Montreal in 1976 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, experienced economic slumps after the Games as they struggled to recoup their costly investments. In recent months, some new retail centers have had trouble lining up tenants, according to leasing agents. Similarly, hotel occupancy rates in Beijing are likely to drop, at least temporarily, after the Games, said Andreas Flaig, an executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels in China. But hotels may partially offset that with higher prices, he said, noting that average room rates for luxury hotels in Beijing nearly doubled from 1999 to 2007, to roughly $200. These hotels “are built for the long term, not for a 16-day event in August,” Mr. Flaig said. “They want to participate in the long-term growth of Beijing.” Indeed, few companies coming into Beijing seem worried. For one thing, hotels groups like Marriott International tend to operate hotels for local business people who develop the properties, so they are more insulated from real estate costs and risks. Similarly, most retail outlets have a local partner or franchisee, although direct investment has been growing. MOREOVER, China’s long-term growth prospects and Beijing’s healthy mix of tourists and business travelers bode well for the long term. Past Olympic host cities have largely been in developed countries. Beijing, by contrast, is experiencing breathtaking growth, and the investments made for the Olympics, largely centered on improving transportation and infrastructure, will only help its future growth, according to Michael Thompson, the president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Asia unit. Mr. Fuller of Marriott agreed. “You’ve watched every city that has ever hosted the Olympics go into oversupply mode,” he said. In Beijing, he said, “I suspect it will be relatively short-lived.”</text></article>

He was 89. His death was announced by Monte Fraker, vice president for operations of McDonald’s restaurants in Santa Barbara. Mr. Peterson came up with the idea for the menu item, the signature McDonald’s breakfast dish, in 1972. The Egg McMuffin made its debut at a restaurant in Santa Barbara that Mr. Peterson owned with his son, David Peterson.

(AP)  The McDonald’s Corporation said on Monday that February sales at restaurants open more than a year jumped a better-than-expected 11.7 percent, aided by growth in Europe, the weak dollar and the benefit of an extra selling day. Two consecutive months of solid results to start the year have reassured investors worried about the effect of an economic slowdown on the company. Shares of McDonald’s increased $1.53, to $53.80. The leap year’s extra day helped by about 4 percent last month, McDonald’s said. Sales at stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, rose 8.3 percent in the United States in February, led by breakfast and coffee offerings. European same-store sales grew 15.4 percent on strong results in Britain, France, Germany and Russia. Same-store sales in the Asia Pacific region, Middle East and Africa rose 10.9 percent for the month, mostly on strength in Australia, China and Japan. Systemwide sales, which include restaurants owned by franchisees and affiliates operating under joint-venture agreements, rose 13.2 percent in February. An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Steven Kron, said McDonald’s was well positioned to navigate through economic challenges because of its tiered menu, which offers a mix of value and more expensive new products. Paul Westra, who covers the restaurant industry at Cowen &amp; Company, said he was hearing positive feedback from the introduction of McDonald’s specialty coffees, now available in more than 1,000 restaurants.

More Photos » It is not a new cafe heralding gentrification, but rather a McDonald’s, newly renovated with the consultation of experts in feng shui, the Chinese practice of creating harmonious surroundings. “We wanted to make the restaurant a little bit more of a destination,” said Bryan Carmack, one of its franchisees, who runs 23 McDonald’s restaurants with other members of his family around Southern California. “It’s not so much décor as a theme, our theme being we want this to be a harmonic, peaceful place for people to be.” The design clearly reflects the owners’ desire, shared by many purveyors of fast food, to keep customers in their establishments as long as possible. The goal is opposite that of fast-food restaurants of yore, whose greatest wish was high customer turnover. To that new end, the remodeled store also has a “McCafe”  essentially an outlet for McDonald’s coffee sold at Starbucks prices  a flat-screen television and soft cushioned chairs, all intended to encourage lingering. But the use of feng shui experts and the multiple Asian touches  a vase at the entry filled with bamboo, and red accents galore, among other things  are also nods to the ever-expanding Asian population here in eastern Los Angeles County, where streets with Spanish names are peppered with stores bearing Chinese-lettered signs and where one of the largest Buddhist temples in the nation makes its home. In the evermorphing county, the feng shui McDonald’s, as it has quickly become known, is “a perfect example” of global capitalism’s co-opting people’s cultures, said Gilda L. Ochoa, an associate professor of sociology and Latino studies at Pomona College, who grew up here in the 1970s. “Hacienda Heights,” she said, “is a microcosm of a changing United States.” From 1990 to 2000, census figures show, the number of Asians as a proportion of the 53,000 residents in the unincorporated town increased to 36 percent from 27 percent. The number of Hispanics, 38 percent of the population in 2000, also grew in that time, though less significantly. Mr. Carmack said he decided that the McDonald’s here, which opened in the early 1970s, needed to be rebuilt last year, and he wanted the place to reflect the community. So he consulted with a feng shui study group, made up of McDonald’s operators and officials and led by a feng shui master. They gave an extensive list of recommendations. He then turned to Brenda Clifford at JBI, a Long Beach firm that has designed many of Mr. Carmack’s themed McDonald’s restaurants, like one with a running train inside in Buena Park, near the Knott’s Berry Farm amusement park, and a ’50s-style drive-in in La Verne, a nod to Route 66. But not everything recommended for this McDonald’s was practical, Ms. Clifford said. One has to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act, among other things. Nonetheless, the traditional McDonald’s was radically altered. The walls are now curved, the ceiling and floor tiles are placed at distinctive angles, and the doors swing open and shut in opposite directions, all in the name of keeping luck within the restaurant. The number 4, considered bad luck in some Asian cultures, is absent in the street address and the phone number. The walls are painted in earth tones  close to nature and soothing to boot, Ms. Clifford said  with red accents. “A lot of things are subliminal,” she said. “Balance in life, that’s what you want.” There is also a wall displaying three pieces of brushed aluminum graphic art, one featuring a crane  because “it represents fertility,” Ms. Clifford said  another a koi fish (prosperity, she said) and the third an iguana. Yes, an iguana. “That last one was because I have to meet the demographics in the community,” Ms. Clifford said. “I have a Latino community that eats lunch there, and you don’t want to alienate anyone.” Calvin Liu sat in one of the cushy red booths the other day, finishing up a snack with his brother Willie. They work in nearby City of Industry, and were struck by the restaurant’s new look. They were not sure if it made them feel more balanced as they polished off their French fries, but they did concede that the design was appealing. “A lot of feng shui is conceptually esoteric,” Mr. Liu said. “But it does seem a lot more high-end.” More Articles in US »HACIENDA HEIGHTS, Calif.  On a busy commercial strip in this Los Angeles-area community is a quiet place where the walls are dabbed with red, the booths form a semicircle  perfect for a palaver with a paramour  and two waterfalls flow silently.

Video auditions came in from 3,600 singing workers across the globe, all vying for a chance to win the $25,000 prize (sorry, no recording contract). Now, 14 finalists are practicing every chance they get for a final showdown in April at a McDonald’s convention in Orlando. That is why a McDonald’s cashier, Aziah Bolling, 20, burst into a gospel tune here the other day as she handed a customer, Bill Osborne, a sausage McMuffin and coffee. Her rendering of “Amazing Grace” drew admiration from a group of retirees hanging out at McDonald’s for breakfast. By small-town Pennsylvania standards, she is already a star. “She’s a lovely worker,” said Rich Burdyn, 65. “She’s always singing here. Beautiful.” Theresa Judge, 69, added, “That takes a lot of courage in front of us peons.” The contest, Voice of McDonald’s, was first held in 2006 when a Brazilian worker named Elisangela Silva Dos Santos, 20, was crowned the winner. It was such a hit McDonald’s decided to do it every two years. This time, with the addition of online voting by the public, the contest bears an even closer resemblance to “American Idol.” A Web site includes biographies and videos of the finalists, including Ms. Bolling’s version of “Son of a Preacher Man.” Zulfiya Zagashtokova delivers a throaty rendition of “Yesterday” in a thick Russian accent. Frank Steding of Germany croons “Stand by Me” while tending bar with what appears to be an intoxicated puppet. And Mary Yu of the Philippines offers a video that shows her being courted by the son of a preacher man. Ms. Bolling, a college student who was raised in a musical family, said she was thrilled and surprised to be a finalist. She applied for seven jobs last year to earn spending money, but only McDonald’s called her back. “I had a bad taste in my mouth from fast-food restaurants,” she said, explaining that she had previously worked at a competitor. “It was like fate.” Employee contests with big prizes are nothing new in corporate America. McDonald’s has pitted stores and regions against one another to determine who makes the best shakes. But McDonald’s officials say they believe their corporate singing contest is the first of its kind, at least on this scale. A spokesman for Fox, which broadcasts “American Idol,” said he was unaware of other corporate versions of the show. A few years ago, McDonald’s marketing and human resources executives discussed ideas for how to show off the talents of their employees. With so many employees, “if you just assume that the top 1 percent are going to be fantastic singers, dancers, comedians, that’s a lot of people,” said Rich Floersch, the company’s executive vice president and chief human resources officer. Executives debated between singing and dancing, but settled on the former because it would be easier for contestants to show off at work. “It’s hard to dance and serve your fries,” said Lisa McComb, a company spokeswoman. The first Voice of McDonald’s contest attracted 2,500 video auditions, with contestants graded on singing ability, creativity and stage presence. For the second competition, the company added online voting for the semifinalists as a way to get employees and customers more involved, Mr. Floersch said. Once the 35 semifinalists were selected in late September, they were given a list of 38 songs from which to choose. It includes British and American standards, including 16 Beatles songs, “The Gambler” by Kenny Rogers and “Sugar, Sugar” by The Archies. “I preferred ‘Yesterday,’ but I imagined a lot of people would sing it,” said Axel Gaston Rivero, 20, a finalist from Argentina, speaking through a translator. Indeed, three finalists sing “Yesterday,” while Mr. Rivero is alone in offering “Hey Jude.” The list of semifinalists was pared to 14 in December, with online voting accounting for 25 percent of the score. At the finals competition in April, contestants can choose any song, and will be able to work with voice coaches. Ms. Bolling, who started at McDonald’s in March 2007, said she was encouraged by a co-worker to submit a video for the contest. Just before the deadline, she made a videotape at her father’s church office. “I didn’t think I was going to make it because the tape was so unprofessional,” she said. Once Ms. Bolling was named a semifinalist, posters with her picture and name were plastered in McDonald’s stores in the Scranton area and fliers were placed on food trays encouraging customers to vote for her online. “We wanted to help her in any way we could,” said Pat Stella, who owns the Dunmore McDonald’s and eight others. It is not clear how many customers voted for Ms. Bolling, though she admits she voted repeatedly for herself. She also watched the videotapes of her competition and is particularly worried about Stan Wilkins from Georgia and Jesus Rios from Puerto Rico. Her parents came to the same conclusion but, not surprisingly, remain optimistic. “If I was to describe her, I would say she is a female Nat (King) Cole,” said Rudolph Bolling, her father and an associate pastor at a local church. Her mother, Stephanie Bolling, who works at United Parcel Service, said, “I’m just foolish enough to believe.” Aziah Bolling says she flirts with the idea of auditioning for the real “American Idol” but admits that confronting the acid-tongued Simon Cowell, one of the judges on that show, would scare her more than singing to a room full of McDonald’s conventioneers. “I have to get out of” that frame of mind, she said. “I really do want to try it.” More Articles in Business »DUNMORE, Pa. Might as well call it “Corporate Idol.” Skip to next paragraph VideoMore Video » The “American Idol” craze has spawned an elaborate knock-off at McDonald’s, which put out a casting call to its 1.6 million restaurant workers worldwide and was overwhelmed by the response.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/business/29mcdonalds.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">McDonald’s Posts Profit but Issues Warning<date>Published: January 29, 2008</date><text>CHICAGO (AP)  McDonald’s reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.27 billion on Monday, but warned that sales at restaurants open at least a year were flat last month. The shares fell $3.03, to $51.07. In its comments, McDonald’s cited severe winter weather as the primary reason for the weakness in American sales, which were more than offset by international sales gains. But the warning raised concerns about the impact of a possible recession, as investors focused on the slowing growth. “Weak U.S. trends are likely to put some pressure on the stock until investors have a sense of whether December was a one-month outlier or a new trend,” an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, Larry Miller, said in a note to investors. Net income for the fourth quarter was $1.06 a share, up from $1.24 billion, or $1 a share, in the period a year ago. Excluding income tax benefits of 33 cents a share, the company earned 73 cents a share, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of 71 cents, according to a Thomson Financial poll. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $5.75 billion from $5.45 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, also topping Wall Street’s $5.61 billion estimate. Global same-store sales rose 6.7 percent for the quarter.

More Articles in Business »CHICAGO (AP)  McDonald’s reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.27 billion on Monday, but warned that sales at restaurants open at least a year were flat last month. The shares fell $3.03, to $51.07. In its comments, McDonald’s cited severe winter weather as the primary reason for the weakness in American sales, which were more than offset by international sales gains. But the warning raised concerns about the impact of a possible recession, as investors focused on the slowing growth. “Weak U.S. trends are likely to put some pressure on the stock until investors have a sense of whether December was a one-month outlier or a new trend,” an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, Larry Miller, said in a note to investors.

The ''food prize'' program, as it was called, for students of the Seminole County Public Schools in kindergarten through fifth grade was sponsored by the owners of the McDonald's restaurants in Seminole County, in central Florida northeast of Orlando. The decision to end the promotions for the program, appearing on children's report-card jackets, came from executives at McDonald's USA, part of the McDonald's Corporation, the world's largest fast-food business. The sponsorship, between the restaurant owners and the Seminole County school board, drew national and international attention amid an outcry over childhood obesity and junk food diets because a fast-food chain was tying its products to academic performance. It also generated controversy because McDonald's USA had agreed to curb its advertising to children in schools. The decision was made ''because we believe the focus should be on the importance of a good education,'' William Whitman, senior director for communications and public affairs at McDonald's USA in Oak Brook, Ill., said Thursday. ''McDonald's, not the school district, will cover the cost to reprint the report-card jackets,'' he added, and ''remove our trademarks.'' The reward program, called Made the Grade, will continue, Mr. Whitman said, because the local restaurant owners agreed in September that it would run through the current school year. The sponsorship became known last month when a parent complained about it to an activist organization, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. The parent, Susan Pagan, was upset about the promotion on her daughter's report-card jacket. The jacket showed Ronald McDonald, the company's mascot for children; its Golden Arches logo; and Happy Meal menu items like Chicken McNuggets. ''Check your grades,'' the jacket advised. ''Reward yourself with a Happy Meal from McDonald's.'' The local McDonald's restaurants replaced Pizza Hut as a sponsor of the incentive program. Pizza Hut had sponsored a similar promotion for a decade, as part of a national campaign to encourage children to read. Because of the attention the complaint drew, the school district said last month that it would review the appropriateness of the jackets in the spring when making plans for the 2008-9 year. But when McDonald's USA offered to reprint the report-card jackets immediately, Beverly Perrault, executive director for elementary education, said, the district accepted the offer. Susan Linn, director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, said Thursday that she was pleased with the end of the report-card advertising. ''In the absence of needed government regulation to protect schoolchildren from predatory companies like McDonald's,'' she added, ''the burden is on parents to be vigilant about exploitative marketing aimed at children.''</text></article>

A New Restaurant Genre Offers Manhattan More Choices<date>Published: January 13, 2008</date><text>Amid the toe-to-toe traffic and camera-twirling tourists, people who work in Manhattan face an agreeable decision in the middle of each day: what to eat? The endless choices  from franks to falafel to filet mignon  have bred a work force of epicures. “The majority of New Yorkers are foodies,” said Robert Angelone, board chairman of the Epicurus Group, consultants to the restaurant and hotel industries. “They don’t just eat it, they know it.” Over the past decade, several dozen national chains have established a new category in the mental “where-should-we-eat” list. Called fast-casual restaurants, they are a hybrid of the quick service restaurant industry, with aspects of fast-food chains like McDonald’s and casual chains like Applebee’s, generally serving fresh food made on the spot for takeout or sit-down dining. Though still a relatively small sector within the nation’s $350 billion restaurant industry, several fast-casual chains are showing success and growth in Manhattan, and industry experts say it could be a sign of the sector’s maturity and sustainability nationwide. Chipotle Mexican Grill, the nation’s third-highest-grossing fast-casual chain, according to Technomic, a restaurant industry consulting firm, opened six restaurants in Manhattan last year, more than in any of its other markets. Five Guys, a Virginia-based hamburger chain that boasts about fresh patties and potatoes, opened its first restaurant in Manhattan in November. The company has an eight-year plan to open 29 more in Manhattan. Hale and Hearty Soups, which opened its first store in Manhattan in 1996, has outgrown its production headquarters in the borough and hopes to complete a new 20,000-square-foot facility in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, by spring. Lenny’s, a sandwich shop that opened in Manhattan in 1989, has added eight locations in the city in the past five years and plans to open three more this year. The company is also hoping to open its first location outside Manhattan  in Jersey City or Hoboken, N.J.  and to begin marketing franchises by the end of the year. In last year’s Zagat nationwide survey of fast-food chains, three of the top five restaurants in the category of food quality were considered fast-casual: Panera Bread, Chipotle and Quizno’s (the other two were Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s). It is hard to completely quantify the growth or popularity of the fast-casual phenomenon in Manhattan, in part because by definition  fresh food prepared in minutes  it encompasses so many restaurants. Corner delis have been producing what might be called fast-casual food for decades, and street food is no longer just hot dogs. Nationwide, the top 49 fast-casual chains had $11 billion in sales in 2006, according to Technomic. Though revenues grew 12.6 percent from 2005, that was down from 15.3 percent and 14.6 percent growth the previous two years. The sector’s growth is expected to show more signs of slowing once sales figures for 2007 are compiled, said Darren Tristano, the executive vice president of Technomic, yet “it seems to have grown and evolved to a point where it’s here to stay.” In addition to taste and speed, fast-casual restaurants are successful in Manhattan, experts say, because New Yorkers are accustomed to paying higher prices for food. A fast-casual meal costs $2 to $3 more than ordinary fast food, according to Technomic. And some New Yorkers accustomed to more expensive meals are trying fast-casual restaurants to save money, experts said. “Fast-casual dining is perfectly suited to the fast-paced environment of New York,” Mr. Angelone said. Fast-casual chains that specialize in foods like burgers and sandwiches, of which there are endless options in Manhattan, must try to distinguish themselves to succeed. “In training the people, we tell them to make the sandwich like it’s for your girlfriend, to try and impress her, with care and love,” said Sei Hoon Chu, the founder of Lenny’s. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in New York Region »Amid the toe-to-toe traffic and camera-twirling tourists, people who work in Manhattan face an agreeable decision in the middle of each day: what to eat?

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Robert Sorbo/Reuters James Donald, left, is leaving Starbucks. Howard Schultz, who led the chains rise, will be chief and remain chairman. Add to Portfolio Starbucks Corp Go to your Portfolio » The chairman, Howard D. Schultz, who joined Starbucks in 1982 when it had just four stores and engineered the company’s rise, will immediately assume the additional role of chief executive. He takes over for James L. Donald, a grocery executive who joined Starbucks in 2002, who will leave the company. Mr. Schultz said he would bring a “laser-like focus” in making sure that the “Starbucks experience” is significantly different from rivals like McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts Coffee, which have lured away customers. While higher commodity costs and a slowing economy have hurt Starbucks in the United States, Mr. Schultz said the bigger problem was the company itself, by expanding too quickly and losing its coffee-shop cache. In short, he said, the company had gone from being “quintessentially entrepreneurial” to becoming “soft.” “Successful fast-growing businesses can sometimes find that their success had unintended consequences,” Mr. Schultz said in a conference call. “We lost the focus on what we once had, and that is the customer.” But Mr. Schultz reiterated that there was “no short-term fix, no silver bullet.” The announcement comes as shares of the company have fallen from $36.29 in January 2007 to $18.38 Monday, after more than a decade of nearly continual growth. Shares rose nearly 9 percent in after-hours trading. Starbucks has more than 15,000 stores in 43 countries and $9.4 billion in annual sales. It still plans to expand to 40,000 stores worldwide, though growth in the United States will be slowed. Mr. Schultz sounded both angry and exasperated Monday. For instance, he complained that the company had only produced variations of new products in recent years, rather than blockbuster new products, a problem he vowed to remedy. But he acknowledged that he played a role in the company’s current woes. The problems that Mr. Schultz laid out reflect many of the concerns that he outlined in a Feb. 14, 2007 memorandum to Mr. Donald that was leaked to the media. Titled “The Commoditization of the Starbucks Experience,” Mr. Schultz said that rapid growth had “led to the watering down of the Starbucks experience.” For instance, by moving toward flavor-lock bags for coffee, “we achieved fresh roasted coffee but at what cost? The loss of aroma  perhaps the most powerful nonverbal signal we had in our stores; the loss of our people scooping up fresh coffee from the bins and grinding it fresh in front of the customer, and once again stripping the store of tradition and our heritage?” Mr. Schultz said he would slow the growth of Starbucks in the United States and would close some underperforming restaurants, though he declined to provide more specifics. Some of the money slated for expansion in the United States would be shifted overseas, where store openings will be accelerated. Mr. Schultz said the company was not given enough credit by Wall Street for its success overseas, where it operates 5,000 restaurants and where the excitement reminded him of the early days in the United States. He said some of the practices that have succeeded in Britain and Canada would be brought back to the United States, though he would not elaborate. Though he acknowledged increased competition, he emphasized that the problem was with Starbucks itself. Everything else, he said, was “just noise.” “Starbucks is not a broken company,” he said. “Just as we created this problem, we will fix it.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on January 8, 2008, on page C4 of the New York edition.With the stock plummeting and competitors on the attack, Starbucks Coffee said Monday that it was bringing back its top barista to help turn the company around.

    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/24/us/24tomato.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Tomato Pickers’ Wages Fight Faces Obstacles<date>Published: December 24, 2007</date><text>IMMOKALEE, Fla.  In a colorful, often clamorous pressure campaign that has relied on support from college campuses and church groups, a group of farmworkers has persuaded McDonald’s and Taco Bell to have their tomato suppliers pay their pickers more. Skip to next paragraph Alex Quesada for The New York Times Lucas Benitez, a co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, said of the industry, The wages are so low that a lot of workers are just surviving. But the workers’ efforts have recently collided with two big obstacles. Burger King has rejected the demands to have its tomato suppliers pay higher wages, and the main group of Florida tomato growers  calling the farmworkers’ tactics “un-American”  has threatened a $100,000 fine against growers that cooperate with McDonald’s or Yum Brands, the parent of Taco Bell, to pay their pickers more. “The only way you can describe this industry is the way it was described 40 years ago: It’s a harvest of shame,” said Lucas Benitez, a co-founder of the farmworkers’ group, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. “The wages are so low that a lot of workers are just surviving.” Steve Grover, vice president for food safety and regulatory compliance at Burger King, said his company rejected the coalition’s demands because it did not employ the pickers directly and did not know how it would pay them, withhold their taxes or determine their immigration status. “We’re being asked to do something that we have legal questions about,” Mr. Grover said. “We want to find a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage.” Immokalee (which rhymes with broccoli) is 25 miles inland from Fort Myers and seems an unlikely place for a self-proclaimed “fair food movement” to begin. Its downtown is cluttered with rundown trailers and ramshackle shacks where immigrant field hands often sleep three or four to a room. The farmworkers’ coalition has garnered financial support from a dozen foundations and public support from former President Jimmy Carter; Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy’s widow; the National Council of Churches; and the Presbyterian Church. On Nov. 30, the coalition attracted more than 1,000 participants to a nine-mile march in Miami that began at the Goldman Sachs office  Goldman is one of Burger King’s largest shareholders  and ended at Burger King’s corporate headquarters. Many signs said, “End sweatshops in the fields,” and many marchers wore yellow T-shirts with the logo “Exploitation King.” They wanted Burger King to agree to pay pickers a penny more per pound  increasing their wage to 77 cents from 45 cents per 32-pound bucket of tomatoes, up from 40 cents in 1980. Professors at Florida International University estimated the state’s farm workers average $13,000 annually. A bigger obstacle to the coalition’s efforts is the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, a cooperative representing 90 percent of the state’s growers. It has threatened large “noncompliance penalties” for any growers that share information about wages or tonnage picked with third parties like McDonald’s. Florida grows 85 percent of the nation’s winter tomatoes. Reggie Brown, the exchange’s executive vice president, said his group’s lawyers said the Coalition of Immokalee Workers violated antitrust laws in joining with Yum Brands and McDonald’s to get tomato growers to pay higher wages. “I think it is un-American when you get people outside your business to dictate terms of business to you, to tell you to do something that your lawyers tell you is illegal,” Mr. Brown said. But Mark Barenberg, a law professor at Columbia University, said, “The only possible antitrust violation is by the growers since they seem to be conspiring among themselves to refuse to deal with fast-food companies that want to buy supplies made under certain specifications.” Mr. Brown disputed assertions that the tomato pickers were ill paid, saying that they averaged $12.46 an hour, and that did not include free transportation to the fields. Angel Aguilar, a 36-year-old picker from Mexico, said: “It’s a gigantic lie to say we earn $12.46 an hour. If they were to ask all of us, who earns $12.46 an hour, nobody would raise their hands.” He said he generally earned $40 to $50 a day for five to seven hours of picking, often taking home $200 to $250 a week. The pickers’ days often begin at 5 a.m. when they arrive at a downtown parking lot in the hope of being chosen for a crew. The labor contractors’ buses typically leave for the field at 6, arriving shortly before 7.

Skip to next paragraph Alex Quesada for The New York Times Lucas Benitez, a co-founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, said of the industry, The wages are so low that a lot of workers are just surviving. But the workers’ efforts have recently collided with two big obstacles. Burger King has rejected the demands to have its tomato suppliers pay higher wages, and the main group of Florida tomato growers  calling the farmworkers’ tactics “un-American”  has threatened a $100,000 fine against growers that cooperate with McDonald’s or Yum Brands, the parent of Taco Bell, to pay their pickers more. “The only way you can describe this industry is the way it was described 40 years ago: It’s a harvest of shame,” said Lucas Benitez, a co-founder of the farmworkers’ group, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. “The wages are so low that a lot of workers are just surviving.” Steve Grover, vice president for food safety and regulatory compliance at Burger King, said his company rejected the coalition’s demands because it did not employ the pickers directly and did not know how it would pay them, withhold their taxes or determine their immigration status. “We’re being asked to do something that we have legal questions about,” Mr. Grover said. “We want to find a way to make sure that workers are protected and receive a decent wage.” Immokalee (which rhymes with broccoli) is 25 miles inland from Fort Myers and seems an unlikely place for a self-proclaimed “fair food movement” to begin. Its downtown is cluttered with rundown trailers and ramshackle shacks where immigrant field hands often sleep three or four to a room. The farmworkers’ coalition has garnered financial support from a dozen foundations and public support from former President Jimmy Carter; Ethel Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy’s widow; the National Council of Churches; and the Presbyterian Church. On Nov. 30, the coalition attracted more than 1,000 participants to a nine-mile march in Miami that began at the Goldman Sachs office  Goldman is one of Burger King’s largest shareholders  and ended at Burger King’s corporate headquarters. Many signs said, “End sweatshops in the fields,” and many marchers wore yellow T-shirts with the logo “Exploitation King.” They wanted Burger King to agree to pay pickers a penny more per pound  increasing their wage to 77 cents from 45 cents per 32-pound bucket of tomatoes, up from 40 cents in 1980. Professors at Florida International University estimated the state’s farm workers average $13,000 annually. A bigger obstacle to the coalition’s efforts is the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, a cooperative representing 90 percent of the state’s growers. It has threatened large “noncompliance penalties” for any growers that share information about wages or tonnage picked with third parties like McDonald’s. Florida grows 85 percent of the nation’s winter tomatoes. Reggie Brown, the exchange’s executive vice president, said his group’s lawyers said the Coalition of Immokalee Workers violated antitrust laws in joining with Yum Brands and McDonald’s to get tomato growers to pay higher wages. “I think it is un-American when you get people outside your business to dictate terms of business to you, to tell you to do something that your lawyers tell you is illegal,” Mr. Brown said. But Mark Barenberg, a law professor at Columbia University, said, “The only possible antitrust violation is by the growers since they seem to be conspiring among themselves to refuse to deal with fast-food companies that want to buy supplies made under certain specifications.” Mr. Brown disputed assertions that the tomato pickers were ill paid, saying that they averaged $12.46 an hour, and that did not include free transportation to the fields. Angel Aguilar, a 36-year-old picker from Mexico, said: “It’s a gigantic lie to say we earn $12.46 an hour. If they were to ask all of us, who earns $12.46 an hour, nobody would raise their hands.” He said he generally earned $40 to $50 a day for five to seven hours of picking, often taking home $200 to $250 a week. The pickers’ days often begin at 5 a.m. when they arrive at a downtown parking lot in the hope of being chosen for a crew. The labor contractors’ buses typically leave for the field at 6, arriving shortly before 7. The workers often do not begin picking until 10 or 11 because they are required to wait for the dew to burn off. They usually arrive back at the parking lot at 5 or 6 p.m. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

The McDonald’s restaurants in Seminole County, Fla., and the Seminole County School Board have agreed to reward students for good grades and attendance during the 2007-8 school year with Happy Meals. The program replaces one that for the last 10 school years had been sponsored by local Pizza Hut restaurants, according to the school district. Students in kindergarten through fifth grade can now receive a Happy Meal from a local McDonald’s restaurant as a “food prize,” as it is described, for achievements like all A’s and B’s in academic subjects or two or fewer absences from school. The “report card incentive,” as the program is called, is a business partnership between the owners of the McDonald’s restaurants in Seminole County and the school board, according to information published on the jackets in which the children receive their report cards. The jackets are used throughout the school year. Teachers put report cards in them, and students take them home for their parents to sign to let the teachers know the report cards have been read. The jackets also bear a cartoon of Ronald McDonald, the chain’s brand mascot for children, and its Golden Arches logo.  The jackets also feature photographs of Happy Meal menu items like Chicken McNuggets. “Turning report cards into ads for McDonald’s undermines parents’ efforts to encourage healthy eating,” said Susan Linn, director of an advocacy organization in Boston, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. “It’s a terribly troubling trend,” Ms. Linn said, because “it really, clearly links doing well in school with getting a Happy Meal.” The commercialization of educational culture, particularly in elementary schools, has long been a contentious issue. It has become more clamorous in the last decade as hard-pressed school districts seek to raise money for academic programs, sports and extracurricular activities without raising taxes. Billboards advertising products and local merchants can be found on athletic fields outside schools and inside schools on gymnasium walls and scoreboards. In some districts, ads appear on the sides of school buses. And some districts play radio programs, with commercials, over the buses’ public-address system. The New York City Department of Education is considering a proposal to give all students free cellphones, which would use text messages  produced by an advertising agency, Droga5  to promote achievement. The plan includes sponsorship opportunities for cellphone makers, service providers and other marketers. In e-mail messages to reporters yesterday, Ms. Linn urged McDonald’s to “immediately stop advertising on children’s report cards” and attached an image of a report-card jacket sent home with Cathy Griffith, who attends fourth grade at Red Bug Elementary in Winter Springs, Fla.

For 10 to 12 hours a day, they pick tomatoes by hand, earning a piece-rate of about 45 cents for every 32-pound bucket. During a typical day each migrant picks, carries and unloads two tons of tomatoes. For their efforts, this holiday season many of them are about to get a 40 percent pay cut. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Anthony Russo Floridas tomato growers have long faced pressure to reduce operating costs; one way to do that is to keep migrant wages as low as possible. Although some of the pressure has come from increased competition with Mexican growers, most of it has been forcefully applied by the largest purchaser of Florida tomatoes: American fast food chains that want millions of pounds of cheap tomatoes as a garnish for their hamburgers, tacos and salads. In 2005, Florida tomato pickers gained their first significant pay raise since the late 1970s when Taco Bell ended a consumer boycott by agreeing to pay an extra penny per pound for its tomatoes, with the extra cent going directly to the farm workers. Last April, McDonalds agreed to a similar arrangement, increasing the wages of its tomato pickers to about 77 cents per bucket. But Burger King, whose headquarters are in Florida, has adamantly refused to pay the extra penny  and its refusal has encouraged tomato growers to cancel the deals already struck with Taco Bell and McDonalds. This month the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange, representing 90 percent of the states growers, announced that it will not allow any of its members to collect the extra penny for farm workers. Reggie Brown, the executive vice president of the group, described the surcharge for poor migrants as pretty much near un-American. Migrant farm laborers have long been among Americas most impoverished workers. Perhaps 80 percent of the migrants in Florida are illegal immigrants and thus especially vulnerable to abuse. During the past decade, the United States Justice Department has prosecuted half a dozen cases of slavery among farm workers in Florida. Migrants have been driven into debt, forced to work for nothing and kept in chained trailers at night. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers  a farm worker alliance based in Immokalee, Fla.  has done a heroic job improving the lives of migrants in the state, investigating slavery cases and negotiating the penny-per-pound surcharge with fast food chains. Now the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange has threatened a fine of $100,000 for any grower who accepts an extra penny per pound for migrant wages. The organization claims that such a surcharge would violate federal and state laws related to antitrust, labor and racketeering. It has not explained how that extra penny would break those laws; nor has it explained why other surcharges routinely imposed by the growers (for things like higher fuel costs) are perfectly legal. The prominent role that Burger King has played in rescinding the pay raise offers a spectacle of yuletide greed worthy of Charles Dickens. Burger King has justified its behavior by claiming that it has no control over the labor practices of its suppliers. Florida growers have a right to run their businesses how they see fit, a Burger King spokesman told The St. Petersburg Times. Yet the company has adopted a far more activist approach when the issue is the well-being of livestock. In March, Burger King announced strict new rules on how its meatpacking suppliers should treat chickens and hogs. As for human rights abuses, Burger King has suggested that if the poor farm workers of southern Florida need more money, they should apply for jobs at its restaurants. Three private equity firms  Bain Capital, the Texas Pacific Group and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners  control most of Burger Kings stock. Last year, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, earned the largest annual bonus in Wall Street history, and this year he stands to receive an even larger one. Goldman Sachs has served its investors well lately, avoiding the subprime mortgage meltdown and, according to Business Week, doubling the value of its Burger King investment within three years. Telling Burger King to pay an extra penny for tomatoes and provide a decent wage to migrant workers would hardly bankrupt the company. Indeed, it would cost Burger King only $250,000 a year. At Goldman Sachs, that sort of money shouldnt be too hard to find. In 2006, the bonuses of the top 12 Goldman Sachs executives exceeded $200 million  more than twice as much money as all of the roughly 10,000 tomato pickers in southern Florida earned that year.

Will they be pleased enough to look at ads before getting their broadband fix? AnchorFree, a company in Sunnyvale, Calif., that is two and a half years old, has introduced a service that lets merchants of any size  from a large bookstore chain to a mom-and-pop restaurant  offer free advertising-supported Wi-Fi to customers on the store premises. People who are shopping or eating in an AnchorFree location will see banner ads on their screens or short video spots or both before their browsing session. Among the major companies that have signed up to advertise are American Express, Circuit City, Clorox, Ford, Kaiser Permanente, McDonald’s, Toyota and Major League Baseball. Mark Smith, executive vice president for marketing and strategy at AnchorFree, said that advertisers could tailor their ads to reach people at specific locations in the network. For example, an ad for a Lexus might be shown to customers staying at a four-star hotel, but not to guests at an airport motel. “Advertisers could target airport travelers versus vehicle travelers, for instance,” he said. Considering the growing number of hand-held devices that offer Web browsing, Mr. Smith said he viewed the Wi-Fi network as an untapped market of virtual billboards. Controlling this valuable bit of real estate, he said, gives companies “the ability for them to have their own branded relationship” with people “while they are their point of consumption.”  Until recently, the two most widespread options people had for using wireless broadband at public hot spots have been either paying a subscription fee to their cellphone carrier or paying a daily or hourly rate to the retailer that is host of the site. AnchorFree is one of a handful of companies offering an alternative business model, one in which the advertiser pays but the retailer and the Web surfer do not. Businesses that traditionally offer Wi-Fi to customers  hotels, for example  can sign up with AnchorFree at no cost and collect a share of up to 50 percent of the advertising revenue. For small businesses, which might not be able to afford Wi-Fi service, AnchorFree will supply the necessary router and other technology at no cost. The retailer can then promote its free wireless service, which could prove to be a competitive advantage. Some hotels, for instance, charge guests $10 to $15 a night for Wi-Fi access. Mr. Smith said that AnchorFree’s technology created a “persistent messaging frame” by pushing down the Web page on a device’s screen and inserting a space for a banner ad. The space is independent of the Web pages being viewed and does not change based on where the user is surfing. AnchorFree offers several options to retailers and advertisers. With the open network option, a retailer agrees to run any ad from the AnchorFree rotation, and in the closed network option a company with multiple locations (like a bookstore chain or hotel) can run its own advertising or other messages within that network. Brad Agens, senior vice president for advertising sales at Gorilla Nation, a company that connects online advertisers to more than 500 Web sites, said that AnchorFree was the first network it was representing. He said that companies seeking to buy ad space online were “looking beyond the portals and the large, branded destinations, the ESPNs, the MTVs.”  AnchorFree is not the only company to offer an advertising network for mobile broadband. JiWire, based in San Francisco, has a similar system, though a different technological approach. Analysts in the wireless industry say they expect that this sector will evolve and mature along with the growth of wireless Internet use. “The real key is whether advertisers will embrace this model and drive online advertising revenue toward Wi-Fi hot spots,” said Berge Ayvazian, chief strategy officer with the Yankee Group, a technology research and consulting group. He said it was too early to evaluate whether wireless advertising would emerge as a distinct and robust market, separate from the more established realm of online advertising. “New economic models around advertising are disruptive,” Mr. Ayvazian said. “If companies like AnchorFree can add a new layer of innovation around free broadband access, they can be disruptive again and take market share.” More Articles in Business »PEOPLE who like to use their laptops, iPhones and other devices in public are always so delighted when they stumble on a wireless hot spot in an unexpected place.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/business/24farm.html?ref=mcdonaldscorporation">Deals to Pay Florida Tomato Pickers More May Fall Apart<date>Published: November 24, 2007</date><text>IMMOKALEE, Fla., Nov. 23 (AP)  Landmark deals to increase wages for Florida tomato pickers are in danger of collapsing under pressure from Burger King and a growers group. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers fought for years to persuade the fast-food giants McDonald’s and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, to pay a penny more a pound for Florida tomatoes, with their suppliers passing the money on to farm workers. The agreements were mostly symbolic, affecting only a fraction of Florida tomato pickers, but they paved the way for raising wages and strengthening farm worker rights across the industry. The coalition next set its sights on Burger King, but the Miami-based company has joined the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange in opposing such a deal. The growers exchange maintains the agreements may violate antitrust laws, though it has declined to offer specifics. What the growers say carries weight. Florida supplies 80 percent of the nation’s domestic fresh tomatoes between Thanksgiving and February. An exchange spokesman, Reggie Brown, called the coalition agreements “un-American,” saying they allowed a third party to set wages. Several antitrust experts say the growers association may be the one violating antitrust laws by banning its members’ participation. “This exchange is limiting one way in which these growers can compete for the business of these major fast-food contracts,” said Stephen F. Ross, a Pennsylvania State University law professor. Florida workers earn about 45 cents for filling a 32-pound bucket. That can mean upward of $11 an hour for those who hustle to fill more than 200 buckets a day. But work is not guaranteed, and tomato pickers get neither health insurance nor overtime. Most field workers are immigrants, many of them here illegally. If the McDonald’s and Yum Brands deals were adopted industrywide, worker wages would essentially double. Yum Brands says it is committed to the coalition, but after two successful seasons, its suppliers opted out this year. McDonald’s has yet to find any supplier who will participate, but says it will continue to buy Florida tomatoes either way. The Immokalee coalition is still aiming at Burger King. It is planning a nine-mile march on Friday from downtown Miami to the company’s headquarters. While wages have been stagnant for decades, so has the price of tomatoes. Tomato growers are facing tough times with competition from Mexico, stricter food and safety regulations and concerns about immigration raids. More Articles in Business »IMMOKALEE, Fla., Nov. 23 (AP)  Landmark deals to increase wages for Florida tomato pickers are in danger of collapsing under pressure from Burger King and a growers group. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers fought for years to persuade the fast-food giants McDonald’s and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, to pay a penny more a pound for Florida tomatoes, with their suppliers passing the money on to farm workers. The agreements were mostly symbolic, affecting only a fraction of Florida tomato pickers, but they paved the way for raising wages and strengthening farm worker rights across the industry. The coalition next set its sights on Burger King, but the Miami-based company has joined the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange in opposing such a deal. The growers exchange maintains the agreements may violate antitrust laws, though it has declined to offer specifics. What the growers say carries weight. Florida supplies 80 percent of the nation’s domestic fresh tomatoes between Thanksgiving and February. An exchange spokesman, Reggie Brown, called the coalition agreements “un-American,” saying they allowed a third party to set wages. Several antitrust experts say the growers association may be the one violating antitrust laws by banning its members’ participation. “This exchange is limiting one way in which these growers can compete for the business of these major fast-food contracts,” said Stephen F. Ross, a Pennsylvania State University law professor. Florida workers earn about 45 cents for filling a 32-pound bucket. That can mean upward of $11 an hour for those who hustle to fill more than 200 buckets a day. But work is not guaranteed, and tomato pickers get neither health insurance nor overtime. Most field workers are immigrants, many of them here illegally. If the McDonald’s and Yum Brands deals were adopted industrywide, worker wages would essentially double. Yum Brands says it is committed to the coalition, but after two successful seasons, its suppliers opted out this year. McDonald’s has yet to find any supplier who will participate, but says it will continue to buy Florida tomatoes either way. The Immokalee coalition is still aiming at Burger King. It is planning a nine-mile march on Friday from downtown Miami to the company’s headquarters. While wages have been stagnant for decades, so has the price of tomatoes. Tomato growers are facing tough times with competition from Mexico, stricter food and safety regulations and concerns about immigration raids.</text></article>

The shares fell more than 7 percent in after-hours trading. The forecast revisions suggested that Starbucks was losing customers to McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts, where a cup of coffee may cost $1 less. “Starbucks is saying what the rest of the U.S. is saying, that the consumer is getting hit,” said James Walsh, who helps invest $1.1 billion at Coldstream Capital Management in Bellevue, Wash. “They’re not immune.” Starbucks posted a quarterly profit that was up 35 percent on higher prices. But it lowered its sales and earnings forecasts after customer visits fell. The company said yesterday that earnings next year would be $1.02 to $1.05 a share, a gain of at most 21 percent but less than its previous forecast of a 22 percent increase. Analysts had been anticipating a profit of $1.05 a share. Starbucks lost customers after an increase in late July of 9 cents a cup caused some customers to go to competitors instead. Margins have also been hurt by higher dairy costs and the sales of less-profitable breakfast sandwiches and salads. The price increase was ”the right thing to do” because of the rising costs,” the chief executive, James L. Donald, said.. “Unbeknownst to us, we saw economic headwinds that quite frankly came up probably stronger than I thought,” Mr. Donald said. “The consumer is being faced with rising costs in every sector of their lives, and so part of that is reflecting on us.” Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $158.5 million, or 21 cents a share, from $117.3 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, the company, based in Seattle, said in a statement. The results matched analysts’ estimates. Revenue climbed 22 percent, to $2.44 billion. In trading yesterday, shares of Starbucks fell 15 cents, to $24.10, and then dropped $1.88, to $22.22 after hours. The stock price has declined 32 percent this year on investor concern that sales at stores open at least a year may slow as the company tries to reach a goal of 40,000 locations worldwide. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 4 percent in the quarter.
