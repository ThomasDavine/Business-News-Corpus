After throwing away a 2-0 halftime lead, the three-time champion United required Ashley Young’s 89th-minute header to recover a second successive draw in Group C. It was a worse night for its big-spending neighbor Manchester City, which lost at leader Bayern Munich, 2-0, and had its star striker Carlos Tévez refuse to come in as a substitute.Real Madrid swept aside visiting Ajax, 3-0, after goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaká and Karim Benzema in the Group D meeting of two teams with 13 European Cups between them. Inter Milan picked up its first points in Group B after Mauro Zarate clinched a 3-2 win at CSKA Moscow. ¶ Barcelona says it has recently met with Nike officials to complain about new shirts, which the team contends absorb so much moisture they take on added weight over the course of a game. The Spanish newspaper El Pais first reported claims from Barcelona players that the shirts more than doubled in weight by halftime. Nike said in a statement that it was “working to find a solution to the problem with the shirts along with the club.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/23/business/nikes-quarterly-profit-rises-15.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike’s Quarterly Profit Rises 15%<date>Published: September 22, 2011</date><text>BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) — Nike said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 15 percent as sales of its athletic gear rose faster than its costs.Nike, the world’s largest athletic shoe and clothing maker, reported after the market closed Thursday that it earned $645 million, or $1.36 a share, for the quarter, up from $559 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the first quarter of Nike’s fiscal year, rose 18 percent to $6.08 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, revenue rose 11 percent. That far exceeds the $1.21 a share and revenue of $5.75 billion that analysts polled by FactSet had expected on average. Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., said demand for its products remained strong around most of the globe. That helped make up for the higher prices it paid for raw materials and for selling more items at a discount, both of which hurt its profit margins during the period. The company said its orders for September through January were 16 percent higher than a year earlier. After falling $1.58 in regular trading to close at $84.18, Nike’s stock soared after hours.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/cleaning-up-brand-names-supply-chains/?ref=nikeinc">Cleaning Up Brand Names' Supply Chains<date>August 26, 2011, 12:02 pm</date><text>Competition is heating up among the world’s leading sportswear manufacturers, but not to see who can introduce the hottest new running shoe. Since the advocacy group Greenpeace released its “Dirty Laundry” report in July, Nike, Puma and Adidas have been racing to respond to charges that their suppliers are polluting Chinese waterways. The report found dangerous amounts of toxic chemicals released by Chinese textile manufacturers producing sportswear for these global brands, and it challenged these corporations to set a zero-discharge policy for their suppliers. Soon after the publication of “Dirty Laundry,” Puma was the first to take the leap, pledging to eliminate the discharge of hazardous chemicals in their production processes by 2020. Nike then made a similar commitment. Adidas responded to the Greenpeace report without committing to a deadline. But in an e-mail message, a corporate spokeswoman, Katja Schreiber, said Adidas had entered “into a dialogue with various brands from our industry” to develop an industry-wide solution. The Greenpeace report has certainly generated buzz, including a Detox video campaign which features a choreographed striptease in front of Adidas’s and Nike’s retail stores. But Eric Olson, a senior vice president at BSR, a nonprofit consultancy that advises businesses on sustainable practices, said that reports designed to shame companies are of limited usefulness. “Raising awareness to these issues is fine and having companies make pledges like this are important,” according to Mr. Olson, but developing durable solutions are much more complex and require involvement of local governments and non-profit or non-governmental organizations. “It’s very much a development issue,” he said, “you have to be careful not to dictate certain kinds of environmental improvement at the expense of the communities that rely on this economic activity.” Mr. Olson also points out that companies with lower profiles but greater environmental problems may escape notice in these campaigns, because they are not as useful in attracting attention. “The high profile brands attract the most scrutiny, but ironically, these are also the companies doing the best job at regulating their supply chains,” he said. Making progress on environmental issues will require all these companies to work with each other and with local N.G.O.’s and relevant government agencies, “to create joint codes of conduct and compliance mechanisms for shared suppliers,” he said. As a model for these joint efforts, Mr. Olson referred to groups like the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, a consortium of electronics manufacturers including Apple, IBM, Dell, and HP that has been effective in setting and enforcing standards for suppliers. Many of these are located in China. About 70 percent of China’s rivers, lakes and reservoirs are affected by pollution and 20 percent of the organic pollutants involved come from factory waste, according to Greenpeace. The group’s report said the factories working with the big brand-same sportswear companies comply with local regulations, but suggested that these regulations are lax and enforcement is indifferent. The “Dirty Laundry” report targets two Chinese facilities in particular: the Youngor Textile Complex, located on the Yangtze River delta, and the Well Dyeing Factory Limited, located on a tributary of the Pearl River. According to Greenpeace, both these companies are releasing “hazardous and persistent chemicals with hormone-disrupting properties” into the rivers. Many of these, which include alkylphenols and many of the perfluorinated chemicals (P.F.C.s) are regulated in places like the European Union, but lack oversight in China. Besides the top sportswear brands Nike, Adidas and Puma, the report chided major clothing retailers like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Calvin Klein for doing business with the companies that operate these two facilities.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/08/sports/basketball/maya-moores-deal-with-jordan-brand-could-be-breakthrough.html?ref=nikeinc">Maya Moore’s Deal With Jordan Brand Could Be Breakthrough<date>Published: August 7, 2011</date><text>To no one’s surprise, Maya Moore is having a standout rookie season in the W.N.B.A.A four-time first-team all-American at Connecticut, where she led the Huskies to a record 90 consecutive victories, Moore was the first overall selection in April’s draft. She started in the All-Star Game last month and is third on the first-place Minnesota Lynx in scoring at 12.9 points a game a season after the Lynx finished with one of the worst records in the league. But Moore had a notable impact as a professional before she played a minute in the W.N.B.A. In May, Moore became the first female basketball player to sign an endorsement deal with Jordan Brand, the popular sneaker company owned by Nike that is centered on Michael Jordan. The brand has deals with some of the best basketball players in the world, including Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony, as well as with baseball players like Derek Jeter and C. C. Sabathia; the football players Dwight Freeney and Andre Johnson; and the Nascar driver Denny Hamlin. April Holmes, an amputee runner, was the first woman to sign with the brand, in 2009. “When my agent told me that Jordan was on the table and was very interested in having me be a part of their team, that was one of those opportunities where you don’t really realize it until it kind of hits you moment by moment,” Moore said in a telephone interview. Although other W.N.B.A. stars like Lisa Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes and Candace Parker have signed endorsement deals with brands like Adidas and Nike, Jordan’s decision to sign Moore could be a breakthrough for female athletes looking to achieve greater marketability. “It’s definitely an accomplishment,” said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director for Baker Street Advertising. “It’s a coup for her. It is a prestigious brand. It certainly gives her a leg up in the marketability category among female athletes.” But for the former W.N.B.A. president Val Ackerman, the endorsement deal is not enough. She said the brand really needed to showcase Moore. “I think the thing to see will be the extent to which Nike activates against the relationship because to sign her is one thing, but then to really take advantage of the relationship — have her in the advertising campaigns or other programs around her — is really going to be the test,” Ackerman said. “The signing is really just the beginning.” So far, the deal has not gone beyond conversations in which the brand has “been able to tap into her mind-set and insight in terms of how she approaches the game,” said KeJuan Wilkins, Jordan Brand’s vice president. Jordan Brand would not provide details of Moore’s contract. Traditionally, female athletes in individual sports like tennis, track and golf have had much of the marketing success for women in terms of dollars and the number of endorsement deals. According to Forbes, the top 10 highest-paid female athletes in 2010 played individual sports. The tennis star Maria Sharapova was the highest-paid female athlete in the world and signed an eight-year extension with Nike reportedly worth as much as $70 million in 2010. Serena and Venus Williams were No. 2 and No. 3 on the list. Rarely, if ever, have women in team sports commanded similar fortune. The most prominent — and perhaps only — example of women in team sports finding significant marketing success were Mia Hamm and the 1999 United States women’s national soccer team, which won the World Cup. Hamm was the most prominent member of the team and had endorsement deals with Nike and Gatorade, which ran advertising campaigns featuring her, including one that put her alongside Michael Jordan. “I don’t think it’s the creation of superstardom,” Nova Lanktree, the marketing vice president of the sports entertainment marketing firm Octagon, said of Jordan’s decision to sign Moore. “We can look as far back as 1996 when women were just on fire in the Olympics and later when the women’s soccer team won the World Cup. They could not have had bigger, better news, but I don’t think they had great successes. I think they had good success, but not great.” This year’s United States Women’s World Cup team has generated some success with a Nike advertising campaign featuring several members of the team that was shown during the tournament. More endorsement deals are possible for the team’s prominent players. But the squad did not win the tournament, and the success will probably not be on the same level as that of Hamm and her teammates. And without a stable league to go back to — Women’s Professional Soccer is usually in flux with financial problems — the team’s stars will be at a disadvantage. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/02/sports/football/nike-re-signs-vick.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike Re-Signs Vick<date>Published: July 1, 2011</date><text>Nike re-signed Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick to an endorsement deal, nearly four years after dropping him amid his legal troubles.

Nike’s net income in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31, rose 14 percent to $594 million, or $1.24 a share. Net income for the year ago period was $522 million, or $1.06 a share. Nike was expected to earn $1.16 a share, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue for the quarter rose 14 percent, to $5.8 billion from $5.08 billion. Excluding currency movements, revenue climbed 11 percent. Nike was expected to generate $5.528 billion in revenue in the period, according to a Thomson Reuters analyst poll. Apparel retailers are struggling with higher material, labor and freight costs. But Nike was able to fend off such pressure because demand for its brand was so strong during the quarter, according to Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones. “The best way to offset higher costs is to generate strong demand growth, and Nike was able to do that,” Mr. Arnold said. Futures orders, excluding currency exchange rates — a closely watched measure of sales growth — came in ahead of Wall Street estimates. Orders for June through November increased 15 percent to $10.3 billion. Excluding currency effects, orders rose 12 percent, Nike said. Robert Drbul, an analyst at Barclays Capital, expected futures orders to be up 8 to 10 percent. Mr. Arnold, the analyst at Edward Jones, was expecting future orders to be up at least 8 percent. Strong futures orders suggest Nike will be able to raise prices later this year, he added. Shares of Nike rose 4.5 percent, to $85.25 in after-hours trading.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/business/media/02adco.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike’s New Campaign Focuses on Action Sports<date>Published: June 1, 2011</date><text>MOVE over, Michael Jordan: here comes P-Rod.In an attempt to leave no sport unmarketed, Nike, the sports apparel manufacturer, will begin the next phase of its current “Just Do It” campaign with a focus on action sports like skateboarding, snowboarding and surfing. The new campaign, called “The Chosen,” is Nike’s largest effort at moving into action sports, and will feature athletes like the skateboarder Paul Rodriguez (or P-Rod), the surfer Laura Enever and the snowboarder Danny Kass. “When we looked at action sports, we saw a unique consumer segment that was underserved in terms of product innovation,” Mark G. Parker, Nike’s chief executive and president, said at a shareholder meeting in May. Action sports are a $390 million business for Nike, and executives hope that figure doubles over the next five years. Nike’s biggest competitors in the youth-oriented action sports arena include brands like Quiksilver, O’Neill, Volcom and Billabong. Big brands that want to enter the action sports market have to contend with the somewhat insular culture of certain sports and with the athletes’ loyalty to smaller, edgier brands. For the last few years, Nike has been on a steady mission to penetrate the market by creating sub-brands like Nike 6.0 and buying smaller brands like Hurley. And they seem to be getting it right. “They did their homework,” said Bernie Baker, the former Hawaii editor at Surfer Magazine and the contest director for the Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, who cited Nike’s “relentless promotion of youth events” as one of the driving factors in the brand’s success. “When that logo is on the deck of a surfboard, from 200 yards away it’s the same as a Quiksilver logo. You recognize that design.” Nike began teasing the campaign in early May with a 30-second version of the commercial online. Viewers who watched the short could respond to a Facebook page for the campaign debut Thursday, when a three-minute and 30-second version of the commercial will be shown followed by a 23-minute behind-the-scenes film. The spot, which was created by the agency 72andSunny and directed by Lance Acord, shows the athletes performing at night in locations like Whistler, British Columbia; Bali, Indonesia; and New York City. “Facebook is the premier partner and platform to use globally that has the biggest global reach,” said Davide Grasso, the vice president for global brand marketing at Nike. Mr. Acord, who has worked with Nike for the last 15 years, described the filming as “pretty epic” and complex when the crew had to deal with shooting during a blizzard in Whistler, or was forced to improvise when a shipment of cables was not delivered in Bali. The video takes its creative cues from the idea of action sports as a music concert with the athletes lit by flood lights as they perform their sport at night. Mr. Acord said he took a theatrical approach to the lighting and incorporated elements from his experience producing music videos. For Mr. Rodriguez, the commercial was the largest production he had ever been part of. “It definitely was a little challenging,” he said of having to perform tricks like the varial heelflip and the switch hardflip while under a puffing smoke machine and bright lights. The campaign features a contest in which athletes can submit videos showing themselves in action. The videos will run on the campaign’s Facebook page, and visitors to the page will be able to vote on which video they like best. Some of the athletes, including Mr. Rodriguez, will help judge the entries. In addition to special features, Mr. Rodriguez said he would look for “the quality of the skills of course, the best maneuvers, creativity with the editing and the music that they choose.” Winners of the contest will be chosen at the U.S. Open of Surfing, which is held in Huntington Beach, Calif., and completely owned and sponsored by Nike. Nike will also release a 3-D version of the commercial that will be shown on the Fourth of July weekend in movie theaters before films like “Transformers 4.” That spot, at 90 seconds long, will be shown on television on Sunday during the third game of the National Basketball Association finals. According to Kantar Media, Nike spent $108 million in advertising in 2009 and $116 million in 2010. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: June 3, 2011 Because of an editing error, the Advertising column on Thursday about Nikeâs campaign for action sports, called âThe Chosen,â misstated its introduction date.

Analysts projected $1.12 a share. Nike is grappling with higher costs for cotton, labor and transportation, which the company projected may reduce profit margins this year. Gross margin, the difference between sales and cost of goods, narrowed 1.1 percentage points in the quarter. “Margins were softer than expected,” Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones &amp; Company said. “It’s surprising given the streak they had.” Shares of Nike fell as much as $4.71 to $80.70 in extended trading. They gained 59 cents to close at $85.41 in regular trading. Orders for the Nike brand from March to July increased 9 percent for a total of $7.9 billion, excluding currency fluctuations. That missed the average estimate of four analysts for a gain of 9.8 percent. Total revenue rose 7.3 percent to $5.08 billion.

A tailback for American Heritage in Plantation, Fla., Michel has rushed for 39 touchdowns and nearly 3,500 yards in two varsity seasons.“He’s on par to be Emmitt Smith, on par to be Deion Sanders, on par to be Jevon Kearse,” said Larry Blustein, a recruiting analyst for The Miami Herald who has covered the beat for 40 years. “He’ll be one of the legendary players in this state.” Michel’s recruitment will also be a test case for a rapidly evolving college football landscape. The proliferation of seven-on-seven nonscholastic football has transformed the high school game, once defined by local rivalries, state championships and the occasional all-star game, into a national enterprise. With Nike and Under Armour sponsoring teams and ESPNU providing coverage, seven-on-seven football, which is played with no helmets, pads or linemen, has grown quickly in the past three years. Michel plays for the South Florida Express, which attracted more than 190 players and about 40 reporters for its first day of tryouts in February. Seven-on-seven, once a niche off-season sport run by high schools to keep players in shape, concerns coaches who fear its potential to develop a recruiting culture similar to basketball’s. Many top basketball players are controlled by unscrupulous third parties and street agents. “Crossroads is probably an appropriate word,” Urban Meyer, the former University of Florida coach, said. “College football is doing great, and it’s the second-most-popular sport in the country, but there’s some things we have to get our arms around.” The main concern, shared by Meyer, Texas Coach Mack Brown, Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly and many prominent high school coaches, is the proliferation of third parties and street agents. Those third parties are showing up in the form of nonscholastic seven-on-seven teams and off-season trainers as football drifts from its high school roots. “The seven-on-seven stuff concerns me,” Kelly said. “It does have an appearance of separating from the high school coach. In football, the head football coach is still relevant. I don’t know if that’s the case in basketball.” The situation has also caught the attention of the N.C.A.A. “I think the outside third parties for both sports are a huge concern,” said Rachel Newman Baker, the N.C.A.A. director for agent, gambling and amateurism activities. “They really are the problem, from multiple levels. They have student-athletes’ and their families’ ears.” Those fears intensified last week when the University of Oregon admitted to paying $25,000 to Will Lyles, who runs a Houston-based scouting service. He essentially directed the recruitment of the freshman tailback Lache Seastrunk. The Ducks also paid $3,745 to Baron Flenory, who runs Badger Sports Elite seven-on-seven camps. The payments, first reported by Yahoo, were cleared by Oregon’s compliance department. Although technically within N.C.A.A. rules, the payments were seen as a sign that football’s recruiting model is becoming more like basketball’s, in which college coaches are beholden to third parties. “We’re starting to see the surgical removal of high school football coaches from recruiting,” said Chris Merritt, the coach at Columbus High School in Miami. “The sport of football is slowly turning into basketball, from the street agents to A.A.U.-type football.” That presents challenges for some college coaches. Lyles reportedly accompanied Seastrunk on some visits to colleges, including Texas. Brown declined to comment on Lyles but said he refused to deal with street agents. “I’m sure that it’s hurt us on some players,” Brown said. “But I also feel like until everything gets legitimized, I don’t want a player on our team who I don’t know who the parents are. I don’t know who he’s listening to. If you get an agent involved in your program, then he’s involved. That scares me. I worry some about the street agents.” Brown said he had seen cases in which a street agent who was involved with a high school player had ties to professional agents or tried to become the player’s agent. “I’ve seen it on three kids each of the last two years,” Brown said. “So far, that’s not a big enough impact on us to change our lives.” Before leaving Florida in December, Meyer said, he saw a change. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/15/sports/15espn.html?ref=nikeinc">Several ESPN On-Air Personalities Have Had Shoe Contracts<date>Published: February 14, 2011</date><text>Erin Andrews, who signed an endorsement deal with Reebok last month, is not the only ESPN personality or member of its “College GameDay” team to have a contract with a major shoe company. Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit and Lee Corso have deals with Nike that Corso described as a joint arrangement that largely involves speaking engagements for the athletic shoe and apparel company. After an inquiry to ESPN about the announcers’ Nike contracts, Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman, said that Fowler, the host of “GameDay,” is “ending his minor association” with Nike “to avoid any potential perception issues.” Fowler was not made available for an interview. In defending the announcers, Krulewitz said: “By any objective measure, Chris, Kirk and Lee’s on-air work is unassailable. Their content has not been compromised by this relationship.” Corso, Fowler and Herbstreit’s deals with Nike were never announced or disclosed to viewers. “We were unaware of these deals,” Krulewitz said. By comparison, Andrews’s deal to endorse Reebok’s ZigTech brand was announced in a news release from the shoe company, which is owned by Adidas. “College GameDay” won Sports Emmy awards for outstanding weekly studio show in 2008 and 2010 and is a major weekly showcase for college football. Fowler, Corso and Herbstreit, who also calls Saturday night games for ABC, are three of the sport’s best-known personalities; tens of thousands of fans surround them, as well as Andrews and the analyst Desmond Howard, on their set at a different campus each week. ESPN and Nike are major forces in college sports. ESPN has numerous contracts to carry games and Nike has sponsorship agreements with dozens of universities, to which it supplies shoes and apparel. So it is not a surprise that Nike has aligned itself with announcers from a marquee program like “GameDay.” Derek Kent, a Nike spokesman, confirmed the deals with Fowler, Corso and Herbstreit. “While we don’t disclose the specific nature of our contracts,” Kent said, “they have appeared as M.C.’s at various Nike events in the past.” Corso said his obligations to Nike were not burdensome and did not compromise his work. “We don’t do very much and they’re unbelievable to us,” Corso said Monday by telephone. “We wear their product, which is part of it.” But he said they were not obligated to tell viewers about the Nike connection. “I might have Nike shoes on, but it’s got nothing to do with ‘College GameDay.’ ” Still, Nike’s tie to the “GameDay” announcers creates potential conflicts of interest, said Bob Steele, the director of the Prindle Institute for Ethics and a journalism professor at DePauw University. “It’s not just what’s said or written but what stories are covered and the frame for the story,” he said. “It’s the questions that are asked and not asked in an interview, and who gets interviewed.” He added, “You do have to wonder why a sports journalist, or any journalist, would wander in this kind of ethical minefield without recognizing the consequences.” ESPN said that it allowed reporters and personalities to sign endorsement deals on a case-by-case basis. Krulewitz said that for former players like Herbstreit and former coaches like Corso, “it’s common for them to have endorsement deals” after they become analysts. ESPN approved Andrews’s deal with Reebok while saying it would inform the audience if a conflict arises between her commercial and reporting roles. But last year, Jenn Brown, a college sports reporter for ESPN, was prohibited from being in a MillerCoors ad for Icehouse beer. James Andrew Miller, the co-author, with Tom Shales, of the forthcoming book “Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN,” said that the network needed a consistent policy about which deals represent potential conflicts of interest and which do not. But he said: “ESPN is not well served when it says it doesn’t know what its employees are doing. That’s a little troubling. It suggests that a policy to address conflicts is not in effect or there isn’t an effective means of communicating with them about it.” Sportscasters have been in commercials since the early days of television. They are viewed as effective communicators if not outright entertainers; the current ranks of sportscasters who also endorse products include CBS’s Jim Nantz and Nick Faldo; ESPN’s Chris Berman; Fox’s Howie Long and Troy Aikman; NBC’s Johnny Miller; TNT’s Charles Barkley; and retired announcers like John Madden and Keith Jackson. In 2005, when Suzy Kolber, an ESPN reporter, was appearing in television ads for Chevrolet, ESPN’s ombudsman, George Solomon, wrote that she “does an excellent job” at both tasks, but “I just wish she would choose one of the two jobs.” He concluded by writing, “ESPN would be better served not permitting its on-air personnel to go outside the compound and do commercials.”</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/sports/30espn.html?ref=nikeinc">Erin Andrews Faces Questions About Reebok Deal<date>Published: January 29, 2011</date><text>When ESPN’s Erin Andrews reported that Texas Christian players were slipping in their new Nike cleats during the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day, the detail seemed typical of the colorful tidbits that sideline reporters often provide to viewers.Two weeks after the game, it was revealed that Andrews had signed a deal with a Nike rival, Reebok, to endorse a sneaker line. Now, experts in journalism ethics and others are raising questions about whether her comments — given that the deal may have been in negotiation — constituted a conflict of interest, and whether any journalist should endorse a commercial product. “I consider sports journalists and sports broadcasters to be ethically challenged in a lot of different ways, but even this has surpassed my wildest imagination,” said Joel Kaplan, an associate dean at S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. The potential conflict created by Andrews’s deal with Reebok and her comments during the Rose Bowl was first reported by The Oregonian. ESPN has said that Andrews rarely covers stories involving shoes, and that if she did, she would disclose her affiliation with Reebok. “We are confident in Erin’s reporting ability and journalistic role,” Josh Krulewitz, an ESPN spokesman, said Friday. He said the issue had been discussed with Andrews. “If an instance of inherent conflict arises, we would obviously be transparent with the audience,” he said. News organizations typically do not permit their reporters to sign endorsement deals, but figures in sports television are an exception, said Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. The CBS sportscaster Jim Nantz appears in an advertisement for Sony television with Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, even though Nantz calls games in which Manning plays. ESPN’s Chris Berman has done advertisements for Applebee’s and Nutrisystem. And several retired athletes, like the former Giants player Michael Strahan, continue to endorse products even as they have become sports analysts. But Rosenstiel said the Andrews case was different. “She is described as a sideline reporter, and she is not a former athlete sitting in a studio doing personal commentary,” he said. “So I think this is more unusual, but it is not without an uneasy precedent.” He added, “I think disclosure is certainly the minimum standard.” Rosenstiel noted that political reporters were not permitted to accept payment from political parties or other interest groups, for example. Krulewitz said ESPN reporters and personalities were permitted to sign endorsement deals on a case-by-case basis. Last year, ESPN did not allow a college sports reporter, Jenn Brown, to participate in an ad campaign for Icehouse beer by MillerCoors. “There are times when we’re fine with it, and there are times when we say that doesn’t make sense for reasons X, Y, or Z,” Krulewitz said. Since joining ESPN in 2004, Andrews has cultivated a public image that transcends that of a typical sports reporter. She is idolized by many male fans of college sports, who have long paid tribute to her on sports blogs and other Web sites. In 2008 and 2009, Playboy magazine named her the sexiest sportscaster. She gained wider recognition in the summer of 2009, when a stalker tried to sell the celebrity gossip site TMZ nude videos of Andrews that he had secretly taped through peepholes in hotels where she stayed. The man was arrested and later pleaded guilty to interstate stalking. Last year, she was a finalist on the television show “Dancing With the Stars.” Although ESPN describes her as a reporter, “I think Erin would be the first person to tell you that she’s an entertainer, and certainly everything in her career has been in the entertainment field,” said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director of Baker Street Advertising in San Francisco. He said Andrews served as a spokeswoman last year for Kraft, one of his clients, in its Huddle to Fight Hunger campaign. “She’s not a paragon of journalism,” he added. Dorfman said that sports television personalities could be attractive to companies because they had authority with viewers and were a safer bet than athletes, who can be prone to scandals. “It’s becoming more and more common,” he said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/business/global/19nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike Introduces New Look for French Soccer Team<date>Published: January 18, 2011</date><text>PARIS —After a disastrous 2010 World Cup, the French national soccer team made a symbolic break with the past this week, introducing a new uniform from a new sponsor, Nike. The outfit consists of an all-blue jersey and white shorts; the third color of the French flag, red, is revealed when players turn over the ends of their shirtsleeves.The new outfit is the centerpiece of Nike’s effort to recoup a more than 300 million euro ($400 million) investment, after it wrested the French soccer federation away from its longtime sponsor, Adidas. The deal, struck three years ago, before France’s soccer fortunes took a sharp turn for the worse, is by far the most lucrative sponsorship in the international game. “What Nike has now is a huge challenge,” said Henri de La Grandville, senior researcher at Sportcal, a firm in Lausanne. “The first thing they have to do is to sell a lot of shirts.” For Les Bleus, as the soccer team is known here, Nike chose a design that is radically different from the previous generation of jerseys. While Adidas stuck to a traditional soccer aesthetic, featuring the French red, white and blue and its own logo, the new jersey features a thin collar and a sleek, monochrome torso. Some said that the shirt appeared to be suited for almost any purpose other than soccer, but Nike, which introduced the top at a Paris site that often plays host to fashion shows, clearly designed it for an era when stars of the game have made the jump from the playing field to the runway. “I think you can wear it with jeans or a jacket,” said Laurent Blanc, the coach who replaced Raymond Domenech after the World Cup. Meanwhile, four French players, on a stage behind him, showed off the options for customizing their look — by buttoning the collar up or leaving the neck open, for example, or by revealing the red lining of the sleeves. Nike declined to say how many shirts it hoped to sell. Some European professional teams like Manchester United, which is sponsored by Nike, and Real Madrid, sponsored by Adidas, sell more than a million jerseys annually, analysts say. With a few exceptions, like Brazil and England, which is sponsored by a Nike subsidiary, Umbro, national teams do not enjoy similarly extensive worldwide support. In 2006, for example, Adidas sold about 500,000 French jerseys. Cyril du Cluzeau, Nike’s marketing director for France, said the goal was to broaden the French team’s international appeal, turning it into a European juggernaut like Brazil, or the New York Yankees. The new shirts and a range of other clothing, some of it with a logo incorporating the initials of the French soccer federation, will be sold in 900 stores in France and 400 more around the world. Nike hopes to rehabilitate the image of the federation and the national team with a marketing campaign that celebrates the country’s creative flair. A television spot features French players, from unknowns to stars on the national team, dribbling, passing and shooting past hapless opponents. The ad, created by a Paris agency called Leg, is set to a passage from Edmond Rostand’s play “Cyrano de Bergerac,” in which Cyrano defeats the Viscount de Valvert in a duel while composing a poem on the spot. The words are recited by Oxmo Puccino, a French hip-hop artist. The ad closes with the tag line, “Vive le football libre,” or “Long live free soccer.” Previous advertisements, from Adidas, emphasized team solidarity — an approach that turned unintentionally ironic amid the wreckage of France’s World Cup campaign. After a second-place finish in the 2006 World Cup, France failed to move beyond the first round of the tournament last summer, when tension between the team and Mr. Domenech escalated into a strike by several players. Shortly after the World Cup, two members of the team, Franck Ribéry and Karim Benzema, were placed under judicial investigation on suspicion of soliciting sex from a teenage prostitute. For Nike, these woes were merely the latest reminders of the risks of sports sponsorship. Nike also sponsors the golfer Tiger Woods and stuck with him after accusations of a series of extramarital affairs. Similarly, Nike is putting a brave face on its new relationship with the French soccer federation, which takes effect this year and is set to run through 2018. While Nike had previously signed Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands and the United States, among other national teams, France is the biggest catch in Europe for the company’s flagship brand. French players will wear the new uniforms for the first time when they face Brazil in a match on Feb. 9. “I’ve already sweated in this shirt, and it felt very comfortable,” said Florent Malouda, a midfielder. “It’s very different from the old shirt. Now we hope to get the result that comes with it.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/business/22nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike Profit Rises 22%<date>Published: December 21, 2010</date><text>Nike topped analysts’ expectations when it posted a 22 percent increase in quarterly income on Tuesday, but its disappointing future orders set off a decline of 5 percent in its share price.The company said future orders, excluding currency exchange rates, rose 11 percent. “They didn’t beat rising expectations for future orders and that’s why the stock’s down,” said Jon Fisher, portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management. He said that Wall Street expected orders growth of 12 to 13 percent. Profit rose to $457 million, or 94 cents a share, from $375 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 88 cents. Sales in the period, which ended Nov. 30 and was the second quarter of Nike’s fiscal year, rose 10 percent to $4.84 billion, above the $4.81 billion analysts had expected. Orders for Nike brand shoes and apparel scheduled for delivery from December 2010 through April 2011 totaled $7.7 billion, up 11 percent from a year ago. Shares fell to $87.38 in after-hours trading, down 5.3 percent from Tuesday’s closing price of $92.30. Nike shares hit a record high of $92.49 earlier in the day. The stock has risen almost 19 percent since the company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter results and surging consumer demand on Sept. 23.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://offthedribble.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/take-it-from-jordan-quick-works-in-ads-too/?ref=nikeinc">Take it From Jordan: Quick Works in Ads Too<date>December 22, 2010, 3:28 pm</date><text>Somewhere along the way, Adidas lost track of what it was trying to market with their signature sneakers for Dwight Howard and Derrick Rose. The slogan and commercial execution speak to the undying benefits of being “fast,” but an overwrought characterization by Ken Jeong is no way to achieve that end. Basketball is silly and frivolous and deserves to be poked fun at, but “Slim Chin” is at best a non sequitur that completely derails Adidas’s campaign. For contrast, take a look at Jordan Brand’s latest promotion, highlighting its latest Chris Paul product: If Nike’s slogan, “Quick Can’t Be Caught,” sounds familiar, it probably should. The common thread between both companies’ spots is obvious. Only rather than tacking on a celebrity and a pool of caviar for a few flat gags, these Paul-centric morsels provide a six-second lesson in effective marketing. The player. The product. The demonstration. The logo. Everything is in full view without a single word being spoken, much less sung. Jeong may have his absurdity, but his antics are no match for a few quick cuts, relevant product utilization, and clever sound effects. In just six seconds of footage from a pick-up game, the marketing folks at Nike’s Jordan Brand have created something memorable. With our attention spans whittled down to headlines, Tumblr feeds, and 140-character bursts of text, is it time that our advertisements are reduced to bite-sized form as well? If Chris Paul can sell you kicks in six seconds flat, is a 30-second window now overkill?

After four weeks, derivative videos were viewed 6.46 million times compared with 5.55 million for Nike’s. Ads like these are “a necessary step in the rehabilitation of an athlete whose reputation has been damaged — but it does illustrate that Nike has a lot of work to do,” Matt Cutler, chief marketing officer of Visible Measures, said. “Even if the benefits aren’t immediate for the athlete, they’re designed to be, in time — and you can bet the creative team is benefiting from the tidal wave of interest,” said Nancy Mauro, a former associate creative director for McCann Erickson who is now a freelance copywriter.

With an effort known as the Girl Effect, the Nike Foundation — supported by Nike and the NoVo Foundation — is trying to raise up adolescent girls in poverty-plagued, developing regions of the world. Helping those girls to become better educated, the Girl Effect’s Web site asserts, helps them as well as “their families, their communities and their nations.” Data on the site shows that positive changes can come in areas like health (the more schooling mothers get, the healthier their infants and children will be) and income (an additional year of secondary school will increase a girl’s wages by 15 to 25 percent). “Why girls?” the site asks. “Because when we all invest in girls, everyone wins.” The initiative is an example of what is called cause marketing or purpose marketing. The term refers to campaigns that assist what companies deem pro-social causes to improve the world — and, not incidentally, improve how current and prospective customers perceive them. “With the Girl Effect, we see the best of Nike” and the best of’ cause marketing, said Mike Swenson, president of Barkley, an agency in Kansas City, Mo., that is active in cause marketing but is not involved in the Nike effort. Nike is “using one of its greatest assets, global reach, to shine a light on a problem that nobody owns,” Mr. Swenson said. Likewise, Carol Cone, managing director for brand and corporate citizenship at the Edelman public relations agency, praises the Girl Effect. In the fourth annual global Good Purpose survey, which Edelman released last week, Nike was ranked third by Americans among companies they considered to be placing as much or more importance on supporting a good cause as they placed on profits — behind only Pepsi-Cola and the Newman’s Own line of food products. “The survey did not delve into specific brands with any further questions,” Ms. Cone said, “so we cannot comment explicitly on why this year’s respondents choose Nike in particular.” “However, Nike has always been a brand known for innovation and pushing the boundaries of design and performance,” she added. “Now, it’s applying this same expertise and pioneer attitude to the cause of women and girls around the world.” Ms. Cone, an expert in cause marketing, cited the “viral movement” created by the Girl Effect as evidence that it was “captivating consumers.” For instance, the video clips on the Web site have been watched more than 1.7 million times. One reason that the Girl Effect appears to resonate so strongly is that advertisements for Nike products have long portrayed the company as “a champion of human potential,” as the authors of the book “Good for Business: The Rise of the Conscious Corporation” (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) describe the company. Tackling the problems of poor girls in countries like Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Liberia appears congruent with that image, particularly as Nike has continued to champion the cause of women’s athletics through ad campaigns and Web sites like nikewomen.com. It is the “Nike way” to “pick some really big issue” to work on, said Leslie Lane, vice president and managing director of the Nike Foundation in Beaverton, Ore., which has about 25 staff members and spends about $30 million a year. Maria Eitel, president and chief executive of the foundation, along with Phil Knight, chairman of Nike, chose as their “best investment,” Mr. Lane said, an effort to “break the cycle of intergenerational poverty” in poor countries by focusing on “the future mother of every child born into poverty.” “Everything that happens to her in adolescence” will have a profound effect on her and her family’s future, he added, which led to the decision to concentrate on adolescent girls “versus a sector like health or a disease like H.I.V.” The Girl Effect is purposely “not branded as Nike,” Mr. Lane said, which could quell skeptics of the initiative who claim it has commercial intent. Another reason “not having the swoosh” is beneficial, he added, referring to the brand’s familiar symbol, is that the effort can more directly address issues of public policy without seeming to be directed by Nike’s business needs. (Nike has branded cause marketing campaigns; all profits from the sales of products in the Livestrong Collection are donated to Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong Foundation.) When it comes to the Girl Effect, “people do say, ‘What is in it for Nike?’ ” Mr. Lane acknowledged. “There’s obviously a benefit to the brand when people say Nike and the Nike Foundation is behind it.” “But we really do not have a commercial footprint in a significant way” in the countries at which the Girl Effect is aimed, he added. Nor is the initiative intended to “offset any issues” that come up between consumers and Nike in areas like labor, Mr. Lane said. “We don’t say, ‘It’s bad here, but look how good we are here,’ ” he added. “It’s just not the way we operate.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/10small.html?ref=nikeinc">Retailers Look to Small Stores for Bigger Profits<date>Published: November 9, 2010</date><text>SANTA ANA, Calif. — A temporary wall slices the Anchor Blue store here in half. On one side are abandoned dressing rooms, a few mannequins and no customers. On the other are racks jammed with clothing and accessories — and more customers than ever coming into the store.Tom Shaw, the head of Anchor Blue, a clothing chain for teenagers, looked with approval at the 2,500 square feet of empty space that his company still rents. Foot traffic is up more than 7 percent, the chain says, and sales have increased nearly 23 percent since the trial remodeling last year. “We don’t want a department-store feel,” Mr. Shaw said. “With that much product in that much space you can get lost, not know where to go.” Anchor Blue is among a growing number of retailers thinking small — chopping off big chunks of stores or moving to more efficient spaces. The change reflects two trends in the retail world: Chains looking for new ways to cut costs in the sour economy, and consumers demanding a less sprawling shopping experience as they spend with greater purpose. “The customer walks in the door, and often sees a huge selection of stuff in a multibrand store, and can’t figure out what to buy and ends up buying nothing,” said Paco Underhill, founder and chief executive of Envirosell, a Manhattan-based company that advises stores on shoppers’ behavior. “We have reached the apogee of the big box, meaning that we can’t grow the store or the shopping mall any bigger, or get any more time or money out of somebody’s pockets.” Big chains like Bloomingdale’s and Nike are trying smaller stores, as are specialty retailers like Charlotte Russe. Mr. Underhill said most of his clients are exploring the idea, which can require creative thinking. The new Bloomingdale’s in Santa Monica, Calif., for example, saves space with dressing rooms that retract into the ceiling. Charlotte Russe uses free-standing glass walls that can be rearranged. At Nike, the cash registers are wired into movable counters. The smaller stores help clean retailers’ balance sheets. Rents drop, and smaller amounts of inventory cost less. Retailers can also reduce payroll costs because fewer employees are needed. At the Anchor Blue store here in Santa Ana, three employees now work on the floor instead of four. Retail chains “saw their lives flash before their eyes in the financial crisis downturn,” said John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, a financial services provider. “When you’re looking at such a severe slowdown as they were in consumption, you worry about the commitment in real estate.” Mr. Shaw said he reduced the amount of clothing in the Santa Ana store by about 15 percent, removing many slower-moving items like unpopular sizes — and increasing profitability. As leases expire on its 118 stores, Anchor Blue is moving into spaces about half their size . “You’re placing a sizable bet when you’re buying a lot of inventory and filling up a 6,000-square-foot box,” he said. The financial success of many smaller stores is simple, retail analysts and the stores say: Smaller spaces are cheaper, and can be easily changed to carry the most profitable, fastest-selling inventory. The stepped-up foot traffic at the Anchor Blue store in Santa Ana, and the sales increase, for example, are both above the chain’s averages. “It certainly enhances the productivity,” Mr. Morris said of the smaller spaces. Bloomingdale’s store in Santa Monica, which opened this summer, is about 105,000 square feet on two floors, less than one-eighth the size of the chain’s Manhattan flagship store. The developer packaged in the third floor, but Bloomingdale’s declined the extra room, said Michael Gould, chairman and chief executive of Bloomingdale’s. Mr. Gould said he wanted a smaller store to move through inventory faster. The Santa Monica store dropped two slower-moving categories, home and children’s, that are often found in other Bloomingdale’s stores. It has also saved space with innovations like a mobile rack, that resembles those dry cleaners use, on the second floor ceiling that moves mannequins and clothes. “You have a store that’s turning very quickly,” he said. In addition, Mr. Gould said, many shoppers have responded to a more focused retail experience — stores that have been stripped of the distractions and temptations of unwanted merchandise — as the success of Bloomingdale’s smaller Manhattan store in SoHo, opened in 2004, has demonstrated. “We can be very specific to a customer and to a marketplace, and that’s what we need to do,” he said. Nike is also looking at flexible layouts as it experiments with smaller stores. The typical Niketown store is more than 50,000 square feet, while its prototype “brand experience” store, opened in Santa Monica in August, is just 22,000 square feet. Nike has no plans to open more Niketowns, opting instead for smaller options like the “brand experience” store. The driving force was to make shopping simple, said Tim Hershey, Nike’s vice president and general manager of North American retail. “Customers are always asking us to make it easy,” he said. Almost all the elements of the new Nike store can be rearranged at a moment’s notice. Each wall contains horizontal slats about six inches apart, and almost every piece of hardware — the circle of metal that holds a soccer ball, the wire cages that contain socks — can be hooked into the wall slats. Freestanding tables and locker-compartmentlike display cases are on wheels. A big orange station where the cash registers are housed looks like the only permanent fixture in the store — but it is not. “It’s wired to be relocated in multiple places,” Mr. Hershey said. “We like where it’s at but we haven’t been through a holiday. Live and learn.” Charlotte Russe, which has more than 500 outlets nationally, is also experimenting with a new concept store in Santa Monica that is about 25 percent smaller than the norm. Jenny Ming, the chief executive, ordered freestanding glass walls to distinguish between types of clothes. “It just makes it more shoppable,” she said. “So many stores now, it’s just big, you throw everything in there,” Ms. Ming said. For maximum versatility and efficiency, each fixture has been designed for multiple purposes. A metal rod that lies perpendicular to the wall can hold shoes on plastic hooks, underwear looped through a leg hole or hangers. Ms. Ming tried stacking shoe boxes on the selling floor so customers could select their sizes without waiting for a clerk. But that backfired, she said, as boxes were scattered, requiring extra staff (and money) for cleanup. The boxes are back in the storage area, the experience pointing to an axiom of the new smaller-is-better movement. “It’s building in as much flexibility as possible,” Ms. Ming said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/google-said-to-eye-2-billion-deal-for-n-y-c-building/?ref=nikeinc">Google Said Near $2 Billion Deal for N.Y.C.

Nike replaces Reebok, whose agreement is expiring.Terms of the deal were not announced. But the league said its contract with Nike was for five years and would begin in April 2012. Reebok has a 10-year contract with the N.F.L. that was originally worth at least $250 million to the league. Nike and Reebok are the two largest players in the sports-apparel market, and they have battled to secure licensing deals with various professional leagues and top players in tennis, golf and other sports. The deals to secure the licensing rights with the leagues are expensive. But they often pay for themselves because professional athletes are so ubiquitous that they effectively are billboards for the apparel makers who actively market high-performance gear to consumers. “It’s another opportunity to put the swoosh on world-class athletes, and that’s what they’re all about, and it’s how have they’ve operated for a long time,” said Matt Arnold, a consumer analyst at Edward Jones &amp; Company in St. Louis. The N.F.L. also extended agreements with Under Armour (sponsor of the N.F.L. Combine), GIII (outerwear), VF (T-shirts and fleeces) and Outerstuff (youth apparel). The league also signed agreements with New Era (hats for sideline personnel and fans) and ’47 Brand (hats for fans). Nearly half of the N.F.L.’s income from licensed goods comes from apparel and headwear, according to Ira Mayer, the editor of The Licensing Letter, an industry newsletter. Video games, trading cards and novelty goods make up the remainder. By comparison, apparel (including hats) and footwear make up 32 percent of the N.B.A. income from licensed goods. Mayer said there were risks for Nike, most notably the threat of a work stoppage, which would drastically cut into sales of licensed goods. A surge in counterfeit merchandise can also cut into profits. Nike, like Reebok, also operates in a faster-moving marketplace, where merchandise is requested almost overnight. For example, minutes after Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched a no-hitter in the first game of the National League division series last week, licensing officials from Major League Baseball were in talks with Majestic, which makes licensed T-shirts for the league. Commemorative T-shirts were on sale in time for Game 2, less than 48 hours later. “The biggest change is how event-oriented the licensing programs are now,” Mayer said. “That stuff happens much faster now.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E2DF1F39F933A0575AC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">GADGETWISE; An App Tracks Your Run With Maps and Times<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>Runners on a budget don't have to spend hundreds of dollars for a GPS unit or watch that will accurately record their distance and time on a run, provided they have already spent hundreds on an iPhone. A new $1.99 app from Nike uses the iPhone's GPS and mapping capabilities to track a runner's performance. To test the app, called Nike+ GPS, I enlisted devoted runner Barbara Scherr, who fired up the app at the same time she started her Garmin Forerunner 305, a GPS unit worn on the wrist with a suggested price of $200. ''It seemed to find the GPS pretty quickly, a little faster than my Garmin. It was fairly simple to navigate. Just press 'start run' and 'play,''' she said. Actually, it's just slightly more complicated due to the options you can choose. You pick a basic run indoors or outdoors, take your music and start your run. Or choose a challenge to go farther, longer, or faster than you have before. The run can be outdoors or indoors. When you are on a treadmill, the app uses the iPhone's motion sensor to estimate what your speed and distance would be if you were running on the road. You can listen to music while running, and you can set a ''power song'' which plays when you press the onscreen button. That assures you'll hear ''Eye of the Tiger''-or whatever your choice-on that final hill. The app also connects to Nike.com, which lets you share your routes and times with everyone or just select people and can even automatically post your run results to Facebook and Twitter. Ms. Scherr, particularly liked the map feature which marks your position each time you crossed a one-mile mark. ''It's neat to see where I am when at mile 4,'' she said. It can also show a route with the runner's path colored in green, yellow and red to show where the runner went the fastest and slowest. The major drawback that Ms. Scherr found were that while the app was as accurate as her Garmin GPS most of the time, it performed poorly in cloudy weather. ''I lost about three-quarters of a mile of data, so my pace reports were inaccurate,'' she said. ''That could be a deal-breaker for me.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But after Utah won the toss and elected to play defense, Blechen doused any hopes the Panthers had of completing the comeback when he grabbed Tino Sunseri’s pass at the sideline. RUTGERS 31, NORFOLK STATE 0 Joe Martinek carried 20 times for 109 yards and a touchdown and Tom Savage completed 10 of 19 passes for 148 yards and a score, leading Rutgers to a rout of Norfolk State in their season openers at Piscataway, N.J. Martinek’s 6-yard touchdown run in the third quarter enabled the Scarlet Knights to increase their 6-0 halftime lead after a sluggish first half. The sophomore quarterback Savage was unspectacular but effective. Savage hit Mohamed Sanu on a 29-yard pass to set up a field goal right before halftime, and they connected for a 10-yard score in the fourth quarter. OHIO STATE 42, MARSHALL 7 Terrelle Pryor tossed three touchdown passes, Brandon Saine rushed for 103 yards and two scores and No. 2 Ohio State rolled over error-prone Marshall in a tuneup for a big date with Miami.

The Buckeyes, who have not lost a home opener since 1978, next play on Sept. 11 against No. 13 Miami, which coasted past Florida A&amp;M, 45-0. MIAMI 45, FLORIDA A&amp;M 0 Jacory Harris completed 12 of 15 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns before sitting out the second half, and the 13th-ranked Hurricanes got their first shutout since 2006. Leonard Hankerson caught the first two of Harris’s touchdown passes and finished with 115 receiving yards, as the Hurricanes (1-0) ran out to a 35-0 lead in the first 25 minutes. S. CAROLINA 41, S. MISS 13 Quarterback Stephen Garcia and the freshman tailback Marcus Lattimore each ran for two touchdowns and South Carolina Coach Steve Spurrier won his 18th straight college opener. Garcia got things started with a 22-yard touchdown run and Lattimore followed with first-half scores of 3 and 7 yards to send the Gamecocks to an easy win against the Golden Eagles. BUFFALO 31, RHODE ISLAND 0 Jerry Davis threw for 302 yards and 4 touchdowns as Buffalo routed Rhode Island in Amherst, N.Y. Davis completed 21 of 35 passes with one interception. ALBANY 3, MAINE 0 Herb Glass kicked a field goal in the first quarter and two Albany (N.Y.) defensive stops in the fourth made it stand up for the Great Danes in a 3-0 season-opening win over host Maine. Glass’s 21-yard field goal completed an 11-play, 35-yard drive following an interception by Jake Ciccarello. ALABAMA STAR PENALIZED Alabama defensive end Marcell Dareus has been declared ineligible for two games for accepting nearly $2,000 in improper benefits during two trips to Miami. An N.C.A.A. ruling ordered Dareus, the defensive most valuable player of the national championship game, to pay $1,787 dollars to a charity of his choice before regaining eligibility. The top-ranked Crimson Tide opens Saturday against San Jose State and then hosts No. 19 Penn State. Coach Nick Saban said on his radio show that Alabama will appeal the N.C.A.A.’s penalty. FERENTZ TO GET EXTENSION Iowa says it is extending Coach Kirk Ferentz’s contract through 2020. His current deal runs through 2015 and pays him roughly $3 million per season. Ferentz’s new deal will total nearly $3.7 million a year. University officials expect the deal to be signed Friday. The ninth-ranked Hawkeyes are coming off an 11-2 season.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E3D91E39F936A2575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">T MAGAZINE; New York Kicks<date>Published: August 15, 2010</date><text>New Yorkers missed out on the basketball superstar LeBron James flaunting his Nikes for the Knicks or Nets when the signed with the Miami Heat last month. However, arm-chair athletes in Manhattan and Brooklyn (the future home of the Nets), the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island can flaunt their own moves in sneakers honoring the five boroughs. Nike's limited-edition Air Force 1 Borough Pack features different colors, logos and laces for each of the city's boroughs. The Manhattan model is a red, silver and white combination, while the Brooklyn edition is black, plum and white. All the versions have a shoelace tag with the number 1898, a reference to the year the boroughs were consolidated. (No, the date does not commemorate the last time the Knicks won a championship, which was in 1973. It only seems like that long ago.) The sneakers ($135) are designed to celebrate the World Basketball Festival, scheduled for Aug. 12 through Aug. 15. The event will feature appearances by star players (will LeBron show up and be booed?) and musical performances around the city.

The Adidas version, miCoach, is available for the BlackBerry, iPhone and iPod Touch, and offers a real-time coach that tracks speed and endurance through a phone's built-in GPS sensor. During each run a voice guides the athlete through a routine. If the pace is out of sync with the runner's stamina level, the voice says to speed up or slow down. The miCoach also offers a slick Web interface that allows a runner to specify if he or she is training for a variety of sports, including soccer, tennis or a marathon. The results can be shared with friends on Facebook. Adidas expects to offer an Android version in the coming months. Nike's application, Nike Boom, offers a similar experience but is a little more limiting. Available for the iPhone and iPod Touch, this app uses voices of ''elite athletes and coaches'' to help runners make it to the end of an exercise. Although the voices are meant to offer a motivational boost, they can be a little intimidating and jarring at times. Still, it is fun hearing from a sports celebrity during a run. The Nike application offers fewer types of workouts, with the sports limited to football, basketball and hockey. Nike also lets you alert friends on Facebook when you are working out, allowing them to share real-time motivational messages.

The University of Wisconsin, Madison terminated its licensing agreement with Nike over the Honduran dispute, and Cornell warned that it would do the same unless Nike resolved the matter. A Nike spokeswoman, Kate Meyers, said on Monday that the $1.54 million was for “a worker relief fund” and was not for severance. Nike also agreed to provide vocational training and finance health coverage for workers laid off by the two subcontractors. “This may be a watershed moment,” Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a group of 186 universities that monitors factories that make college-logo apparel, said. “Up until now, major apparel brands have steadfastly refused to take any direct financial responsibility for the obligations to the workers in their contractors’ factories. Now the most high-profile sports apparel firm has done just that.” The agreement is the latest involving overseas apparel factories in which an image-conscious brand like Nike shows its sensitivity — advocates might say vulnerability — to campaigns led by college students who often pressure universities to stand up to producers of college-logo apparel over workers’ rights. Nike issued a statement in conjunction with a Honduran labor federation, Central General de Trabajadores, saying it had “reached an agreement to help improve the lives of workers affected” by the plant closings. As part of the deal with the labor group, Nike pledged that other factories it used in Honduras would give priority to hiring workers laid off by the two subcontractors. “We were trying genuinely to find a way in which we can help set up a program that would be meaningful to workers on the ground,” Ms. Meyers said. The dispute began in January 2009, when Hugger and Vision Tex — two subcontractors that made T-shirts and sweatshirts for Nike in Honduras — closed their plants. After the workers complained, the Workers Rights Consortium gave more than 100 American universities a report it did finding that the subcontractors had failed to pay more than $2 million in severance owed under Honduran law. United Students Against Sweatshops mounted a pressure campaign, holding protests at dozens of Niketown stores and Nike retailers. The campaign adopted the slogan “Just Pay It.” At Cornell, 1,100 students petitioned the university to end its contracts with Nike. Thirty student groups, the student newspaper and the University Assembly also endorsed that idea. Mr. Nova of the Workers Rights Consortium said Nike at first claimed that the two subcontractors were not making college-logo apparel. On April 20, the company issued a statement saying it was disappointed that the subcontractors had not paid the severance, but added, “It remains Nike’s position that factories which directly employ workers are responsible for ensuring that their employees receive their correct entitlements, and as such Nike will not be paying severance to workers that were employed by Hugger and Vision Tex.” Alex Bores, president of the United Students Against Sweatshops chapter at Cornell, argued that it was only fair for Nike to make good on its subcontractors’ obligations. “Nike plays a key role in setting up the worldwide apparel system that its contractors and subcontractors work in,” Mr. Bores said. “Nike plays factory against factory, causing them to shave a penny here and a penny there, creating an ultra-competitive environment that drives down wages and gives factory owners virtually no choice but to disrespect workers’ basic rights.” United Students Against Sweatshops estimated that Nike’s total payments, including those for health coverage and training, would exceed $2 million. Even with Monday’s agreement, Ms. Meyers said her company would stick to its position that contractors and subcontractors were responsible for obligations like severance pay. Workers’ rights groups say that while many brands boast that they are complying with codes of conduct to protect workers, the brands at the same time balk at assuming responsibilities when contractors’ violate their obligations to their workers. Jane L. Collins, a University of Wisconsin sociology professor who is on the school’s licensing committee, which called on the university to end its licensing agreement with Nike, said, “If apparel companies can’t take responsibility for the factories where they have contracts, they can’t claim to be adhering to a code of conduct.” Officials at several universities had warned Nike that unless it settled the dispute, it would face larger protests once the fall semester began. Last November, the student movement against sweatshops got Russell Athletic to agree to rehire 1,200 workers in Honduras who lost their jobs when the company closed their factory soon after the workers had unionized. The students had persuaded 100 universities to sever or suspend their licensing agreements with Russell. Explaining Monday’s agreement, Jack Mahoney, national organizer for United Students Against Sweatshops, said, “After we got over 100 universities to boycott Russell, Nike understood the university pressure would not simply go away.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/sports/soccer/28rhoden.html?ref=nikeinc">U.S. Soccer Could Use Its Own Kobe Bryant<date>Published: June 27, 2010</date><text>SOWETO, South Africa — Kobe Bryant walked off the field Sunday afternoon, nearly 100 photographers shadowing every move.Bryant was here as part of an event to celebrate the completion of Nike’s community training center. The purpose of the facility is to develop soccer talent and promote H.I.V./AIDS education. Bryant was only 10 days removed from winning his fifth N.B.A. championship ring with the Los Angeles Lakers, and he was still on an emotional high. “Five was tough,” Bryant said. “Right now, six seems closer. If you ask me that next June, I might not have the same response, but I’m just very, very thankful.” Bryant arrived in South Africa on Saturday, took a helicopter to Rustenberg and was at Royal Bafokeng Stadium to watch the United States lose a 2-1 heartbreaker to Ghana in overtime. Much of Africa was happy on Sunday; Bryant was not. “I take it personally when we lose, when it comes to the U.S.A.,” he said. Referring to his sport’s world championship, Bryant added: “I wish I could physically be healthy to play in the world games and take the soccer team’s frustration out on these other countries in basketball. “Hopefully, we can carry this momentum into the States as it pertains to soccer in the future.” This, of course, becomes the million-dollar question each time the United States is bounced from a world competition. Can soccer in the United States successfully compete for the type of athletes who now play in the N.B.A. and the N.F.L.? How the United States could have used a Kobe Bryant — or two — on Saturday. “All it takes is one,” Bryant said Bryant might have been that person. He moved to Italy when he was 6. His father, Joe Bryant, was playing basketball in the Italian league. Bryant has often said that had he stayed in Italy, he might have tried professional soccer. Instead, he moved back to the United States when he was 13. “All it takes is one player, someone 6-foot-5, 6-6, who can move and do some other things,” Bryant said. “Someone who can come into the community, come into the league, really take it over and really capture the imagination of people.” As Bryant spoke, I thought about the decisive scoring play in Saturday’s match by Asamoah Gyan of Ghana. Gyan’s nickname is Baby Jet. Early in extra time, he took a long ball over the United States’ defense from his teammate André Ayew. He raced between the American captain Carlos Bocanegra and Jay DeMerit. Gyan fought off Bocanegra’s bumping challenge, let the ball bounce, took a touch with his chest, outran DeMerit and fired a left-footed shot over goalkeeper Tim Howard from 20 yards out. The play encapsulated what the United States needs — rather, whom it needs — to go beyond these baby steps and compete. But how? Bryant suggested an education blitz aimed at young people whose primary interest is football and basketball. “I don’t think kids really understand the creativity that you can have playing soccer,” Bryant said. “I think they think you just kick a ball around, but if you watch clips of Ronaldinho and see some of the things he can do with that ball if you have imagination. ...” Bryant said it was important for young people to see what they wanted to become. “I think it’s seeing the future,” he said. “Our youth, growing up, see the N.B.A. You say, ‘I can be that.’ N.F.L., ‘I can be that,’ because it’s easily accessible — not easily, but it’s a dream. In soccer, you don’t have that dream.” Bryant added: “You’ve got to go all the way out to Chelsea, you’ve got to go play in Italy. So it’s not something they can really sink their teeth into.” Bryant wrapped up his interviews, then went around to speak with some of the young soccer players assembled at the training facility about winning, getting the winning edge. He reminded them to be responsible about their health. Then he was off. He will leave South Africa on Wednesday. By the time the World Cup rolls into Brazil in 2014, or certainly by the time the 2018 edition rolls around, the United States will hopefully have found a Kobe Bryant clone — or two — to streak downfield past the defense, flick off a hard challenge and catapult the Americans into the final, finally. All it takes is one.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/arts/28iht-design28.html?ref=nikeinc">Design and the World Cup: Best and Worst<date>Published: June 27, 2010</date><text>LONDON — Rollercoaster though the results of the opening games in the 2010 World Cup have been, the winners and losers are now emerging both on the field and behind the scenes in an equally ferocious design contest.No sooner does one World Cup end, than the designers at sports brands like Adidas, Nike and Puma start to develop new boots, balls, shirts, socks, towels and whatever else might be needed for the next one. The investment is huge, but so are the rewards, though World Cup design flops can be equally spectacular. So what are the winning and losing designs in this tournament? 1. The boot Let’s kick off with a winner — the best-designed soccer boot. All of the boot manufacturers devote years of research and mountains of cash to trying to ensure that their World Cup designs will be lighter, stronger and so on than their competitors’. They then present the results in seemingly endless lists of technical specifications that make NASA’s safety manuals seem slack. Yet Nike carries off the boot trophy for the 2010 World Cup, not because its boots are any lighter or stronger than its nemesis, Adidas’s, but thanks to its cunning color strategy. Nike designed four boots for the tournament, each for a different type of player, but colored them all in specific shades of purple and orange, chosen to create maximum contrast. This helps the players spot their teammates’ positions, and to pass the ball more accurately. It also enhances Nike’s branding. “It seems that ‘everyone’ is wearing Nike boots, just because they’re so visible on television,” said the German designer Konstantin Grcic. 2. The shirt Nike again. Firstly, it scores eco-points for making its 2010 World Cup shirts from recycled polyester. Each shirt is made from up to eight plastic bottles, rescued from landfill sites in Japan and Taiwan, then melted down to produce polyester yarn. Nike claims that this will save as many as 13 million plastic bottles from clogging up landfill sites, as well as using 30 percent less energy. Secondly, Nike scoops my personal prize for designing the most stylish shirt. Infuriating though it was to see its wearer play quite so well in his team’s opening game against (my favorite) England, it goes to the graphically patterned orange and black shirt of the American goalkeeper, Tim Howard. Even the patterned sleeves have a practical purpose. The contrasting colors and shapes were designed to attract the attention of menacing strikes, and then to distract them, because the fragmented pattern distorts the goalie’s silhouette. This makes the striker — or so Nike’s color theory goes — likelier to kick the ball nearer to the keeper. Although Nike also wins the booby prize for lumbering the rest of the U.S. team with the ugliest shirts in the tournament — those dreary blue ones with white “sashes” that make the players look like wannabe cheerleaders. 3. The logo On to another loser. As a Londoner, I’m treading on thin ice here, given that my city is threatening to unleash one of the direst logos ever designed for the 2012 Olympic Games, but this loser is the official symbol of the 2010 World Cup. The designer — Gaby de Abreu of the Johannesburg design group Switch — did at least try to liven it up by depicting a map of Africa in the colors of the South African flag. But the end result is too fussy, and blunders by showing a soccer player doing an illegal “bicycle kick.” That said, this logo isn’t as bad as London 2012’s atrocity. It commits the lesser design crime of being as mediocre as its predecessors. Can you remember any of them? Thought not. Depressingly, it has been all of 40 years since the design of the most memorable World Cup logo — the deconstructed ball and trippily striped lettering of the emblem of the 1970 tournament in Mexico. 4. The ball Now for that ball. FIFA, the World Cup organizer, commissions a new ball for every tournament in return for a multimillion-dollar licensing fee from the manufacturer — usually Adidas. A blazing argument over the ball’s design has become a World Cup ritual as the players adjust to it. The loudest grumbles come from goalies, who usually complain that it swerves, spins or slips too much. That is exactly what happened in 2006, and has happened again with Adidas’s new Jabulani ball, though the criticism has been unusually fierce this time. That said, some experts believe that the problems stem not from the ball, but the dramatic difference in altitude between the South African cities where the games are played. “I’ve yet to see anything to suggest that the ball is behaving erratically, but the change in altitude and air density — 20 percent between Cape Town and Johannesburg — will make a difference,” said Steve Haake, professor of sports engineering at Sheffield Hallam University in England. “The ball is likely to swerve less in Johannesburg, fly higher. Its position could change by two diameters in a typical goal shot, which is confusing. We saw the same problems in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, the last one when altitude was a key factor.” Mr. Haake is confident that the players will adjust to the impact of changing altitude as the tournament continues. But it will take rather longer for sports scientists and designers to crack the underlying problem — the extreme complexity of the aerodynamics of spheres, including soccer balls. Brace yourself for another storm over ball design at the 2014 World Cup. Finally Any skeptics who’re wondering what design has to do with sport should consider the following. What was the best-designed World Cup? Mexico in 1970, not just because of the logo, but the Telstar ball that has been the default design for soccer balls ever since. And which World Cup treated us to the best soccer? Ditto.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/business/24nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike’s Quarterly Profit Rose 53%<date>Published: June 23, 2010</date><text>Nike posted quarterly profit on Wednesday that increased 53 percent to match Wall Street’s view, but shares fell in after-hours trading after revenue missed analysts’ estimates.Nike, the largest global player in the athletic shoe and clothing market, said profit rose to $521.9 million, or $1.06 a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended May 31, from $341.4 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Results from the latest quarter matched analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose almost 8 percent to $5.08 billion, but fell short of the analysts’ sales target of $5.15 billion. Excluding currency fluctuations, revenue rose 4 percent, Nike said. By region, revenue in Nike’s largest market of North America increased 4 percent to $1.8 billion. Revenue also gained around Europe and China, while sales in Japan declined. Revenue for non-Nike brands, which include Cole Haan, Converse, Hurley and Umbro, increased 9 percent to $714 million. Gross margins were 47.4 percent versus 43.4 percent a year ago. Orders for Nike brand shoes and apparel scheduled for delivery from June through November totaled $8.8 billion and were up 7 percent from a year earlier. Excluding currency changes, orders would have increased 10 percent, Nike said. Orders are a main gauge of demand and the company in the third quarter turned around a year-long string of forward order declines. Nine World Cup teams, including the United States and Brazil, are wearing Nike apparel as the company aggressively markets itself at the soccer championship, one of the world’s biggest sporting events. Shares of Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., fell to $70.95 in after-hours trading. They closed earlier at $72.52.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/business/energy-environment/12sustain.html?ref=nikeinc">Products That Are Earth-and-Profit Friendly<date>Published: June 11, 2010</date><text>As the world’s greatest soccer players take to the fields at the FIFA World Cup in South Africa, many are wearing jerseys made almost entirely from plastic bottles rescued from landfills in Japan and Taiwan.It is, if nothing else, good publicity for Nike, the maker of the jerseys and the official sponsor of nine teams, including the United States, Brazil and Portugal. Yet what many might view as a gimmick is also part of a broadening effort by the company to incorporate sustainability, or environmentally responsible practices, into its product design. Around the globe, a growing number of manufacturers are including more recyclable or biodegradable components into products. Companies making changes run the gamut — there are furniture makers, carpet manufacturers, clothing retailers and makers of shampoos and household cleaners. And with big-box retailers like Wal-Mart joining in, industry analysts say the sustainable philosophy is no longer viewed as the province of high-end sellers like Nike or Herman Miller, the furniture maker. In 2008 alone, American consumers doubled their spending on sustainable products and services to an estimated $500 billion, according to a survey that polled more than a 1,000 people by Penn Schoen Berland Associates, a market research firm that studies the green economy. The movement can be confusing to navigate and goes by many monikers — ”cradle to cradle,” eco-efficiency, life cycle improvement, closed-loop production. In its most utopian form, it envisions a world in which all products are made from natural materials and are 100 percent reusable, recyclable or biodegradable, never ending up in landfill. At its most pragmatic, it is mainly about cutting costs — by reducing waste, selling recyclable components and reusing byproducts like rubber or plastic to create a new product. For a large company, this can mean millions of dollars in annual savings. “When sustainability burst onto the scene, it was in the responsibility category, something that a company should do because it was the right thing to do,” said Beth Lester, a vice president at Penn Schoen Berland Associates. But now it is equally about saving money, she said. For example, Wal-Mart attributed more than $100 million of its 2009 revenue to a decision to switch to a recyclable variety of cardboard in shipments to its 4,300-plus stories in the United States. Now it sells the cardboard to a recycler rather than paying to ship the waste to a landfill. The company also sells photo frames made from its polystyrene waste and recycles plastic scraps leftover from producing Wal-Mart-brand diapers into material used in building new Wal-Mart stores. “It’s coming from economics,” said Marc Stoiber, vice president for green innovation at the Chicago-based business consultancy Maddock Douglas. “If you look at the big guys like Wal-Mart, they embrace green because it’s all about efficiency.” Matt Kistler, the senior vice president of sustainability at Wal-Mart, agreed. “If this was not financially viable, a company such as ours would not be doing it,” he said. In its most ambitious project, Wal-Mart, after surveying more than 100,000 suppliers worldwide, has embarked on a yearlong effort to tag every product it sells with information about its production and life cycle. Nike first dipped its toe into sustainability in 1993, when it began grinding up old shoes and donating the material and other manufacturing scraps to builders of sports surfaces, like tracks and basketball courts. That program continues, but the company has shifted gradually from one-of-a-kind initiatives to a long-term plan to “minimize or eliminate all substances known to be harmful to the health of biological or ecological systems.” In the last four years, the company’s sustainable design group, known as Nike Considered Design, has brought shoes and athletic clothing to market that incorporate waste from the factory floor and a less toxic type of rubber. Some of Nike’s clothing incorporates zippers and cords made from old shoes. The company has also reduced its use of solvents, the toxic glue used to cement soles to the bottom of shoes. ”Our customers expect this from us,” said Lorrie Vogel, general manager of Nike’s Considered group. “It’s not about two or three green shoes — it’s about changing the way our company does things in general.” As companies move to reduce waste and analyze the components of their products, many are turning to outside consultants for help. Among the most prominent is William McDonough, co-author of a 2002 book called “Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things.” He runs a consultancy that evaluates companies’ policies in areas like toxicity, renewable energy, water stewardship and sustainability and awards corporations Cradle to Cradle Certification if they make the necessary changes. His firm, McDonough Braungart Design Chemistry, has worked with Nike, Herman Miller and Shaw, the world’s largest carpet maker. Herman Miller says that 50 percent of its revenue now comes from products that are Cradle to Cradle-compliant, and it is aiming for 100 percent. Shaw has collected 300 million pounds of used carpet in the last three years and reused 85 percent of it. “I’ve never met one C.E.O. who said ‘Give me a toxic product,’ ” Mr. McDonough said. “But they need business models that are effective for them.” Still, companies can be reluctant to make trade-offs when performance or aesthetics suffers. Method, a maker of household cleaning products, shuns chemicals like ammonia, bleach and phthalates and maintains a list of earth-friendly ones. But when it came to the design of its bottles, the company stood firm, declining to reduce the plastic content beyond a certain point because it believed that it would make them less visually attractive, according to a recent report in The McKinsey Quarterly, an online business management journal. Companies may also have to weigh a product’s toxicity level against its longevity. The retailer Patagonia is viewed as environmentally conscious — 75 percent of the clothing it sells is recyclable — but it has had difficulty finding nontoxic dyes. For now, Patagonia prefers to stick with colorfast dyes, although not all are harmless to the earth. “It’s super-easy to find an environmentally friendly dye that will fade in three washes,” said Jenn Rapp, a spokeswoman. “But a garment that lasts 20 years is much more friendly than one that lasts five months.” Even champions of sustainability say that consumers should be wary of giving companies too much credit or accepting all of their claims. Makers of cleaning agents in particular may offer an expensive “green line” of offerings but leave the rest of their products untouched, some say. “I think the cradle-to-cradle concept is great,” said Wood Turner, executive director of Climate Counts, a nonprofit group that scores manufacturers of consumer products makers on their track records. “The problem is that most companies are not as inclined to push that into all their products and all their brands. “I have to ask, is this really just an example of green tokenism, or does it reflect deep thinking on a company’s part?”</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E4DE1131F934A35755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">ON PAR; When Thoughts Turn to Putters<date>Published: June 7, 2010</date><text>There is no piece of golf equipment more personal, more like a relationship, than the association of putter and golfer. Most people go through dozens of putters in a lifetime. Some pros go through hundreds. Some players are a little more faithful. My colleague Dave Anderson, who is a very good putter, has used the same flat stick for decades. ''We've had our arguments, but we've never broken up,'' he once told me after rolling in another putt that dashed my hopes of winning the hole. For most of us, there comes a time every few years or so that a new putter design or some new technology makes us stray from our old putters (even if we remain good friends). Here are two new putters getting a lot of recent attention. Since Lucas Glover used a prototype of the Nike Method Putter to win last year's United States Open and Stewart Cink used one to win the 2009 British Open, the 2010 models of the club were met with high anticipation. The five models of the Method Putter use what Nike calls a polymetal groove insert meant to reduce backspin and get putts rolling forward sooner. Nike says the combination of polymer and metal is more biting and effective than simple polymer inserts, which some consider soft and squishy. The putter is weighted, and if you choose one of the more popular blade models and have been using a mallet putter, it will be comforting to know that the Method plays heavier than its minimalist looks. You may miss the extra alignment aids of mallet putters, but then again, you may find the Nike Method Putter ($299.99) to be the start of a beautiful new relationship. The new Odyssey Backstryke Putter has had its professional advocates as well. Padraig Harrington, Tom Watson and others have used this unconventional putter with its shaft moved toward the back of the putter head. With the shaft out of the way, there is a clearer line of sight between ball, target and putter head. And the shaft position also promotes a hands-forward stance - an automatic forward press, if you will - without de-lofting the putter so an uplifting stroke is more likely. The Backstryke comes in three models, including a version of Odyssey's breakthrough 2-Ball Putter. It takes some getting used to, but the Backstryke ($199) has the fluid, on-path feel of most Odyssey putters, and in the cruel world of three-putted greens, that is a faithful ally. And it's all about faith. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Padraig Harrington with the Odyssey Backstryke.

It came when Nike, the American sports shoe and clothing maker, acquired Umbro, a British supplier of soccer gear that is a longtime sponsor of the English national team. The deal signaled a new determination by Nike to challenge Adidas, the German soccer apparel powerhouse, on its European home turf. Now the companies’ lineups in the international soccer sponsorship arena are more evenly matched than ever. At stake are hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of sales of World Cup replica shirts to fans around the world, as well as a claim on their loyalty when the time comes to buy a new pair of shoes. With 12 of the 32 teams — including Argentina, France, Germany, Spain and the host nation, South Africa — set to wear shirts with the Adidas logo on them, that company has a slightly broader World Cup presence than Nike. And unlike Nike, it is also an official sponsor of the event. But Nike, which planted itself firmly on the international soccer scene only in 1996, when it signed a landmark agreement with Brazil, includes several of the most prized teams among its 10 World Cup contenders. The deal between England and Umbro, which Nike maintains as a separate brand, is the most lucrative in international soccer, valued at €34 million, or $40.7 million, a year, according to Sport+Markt, a research firm. It is followed by Nike’s continuing relationship with Brazil, worth €22 million a year. “On awareness, Adidas is still slightly ahead of Nike,” said Hartmut Zastrow, executive director of Sport+Markt. “They have defended themselves well, but Nike is pushing aggressively.” Nike has already potentially bolstered its position for the next tournament, in 2014 in Brazil, by signing France to a seven-year deal in which it will pay the country’s soccer federation more than €40 million a year. The agreement will leapfrog France past England, making its shirts the most lavishly sponsored uniforms in international soccer. The deal more than quadruples the value of France’s existing sponsorship by Adidas. It is not the only inflationary effect of Nike’s push into Europe. Just before buying Umbro in 2007, Nike tried to snatch Germany away from Adidas. Nike reportedly offered almost as much as it will pay France, but the German national team eventually decided to stick with Adidas. In doing so, Germany settled for a mere doubling of its previous deal, to €20 million a year. The fat checks from Nike and Adidas have not entirely priced rivals out of the market. With Nike and Adidas playing the equivalent of a possession game, the third-biggest soccer sponsor, Puma, has exploited unexpected openings in its rivals’ defenses — an opportunistic strategy modeled on the playing style of Italy, Puma’s biggest sponsorship. Puma is spending an estimated €30 million this year to sponsor teams in the 2010 World Cup, compared with €104 million for Nike and Umbro together and €85 million for Adidas, according to Sport+Markt. But Puma gets good value out of these deals. Italy is the reigning World Cup champion, and the team has a strong international following. The body-hugging Azzurri shirts, popular with style-conscious fans, are consistent with Puma’s effort to transform itself from a pure supplier of gear into a “sports lifestyle” company. “With shirt deals, it’s all about picking a winner,” said Nigel Currie, director of brandRapport, a sponsorship agency in Guildford, England. Puma was also forward-looking in its recognition of the marketing potential of aligning itself with African national teams, long before South Africa was chosen, in 2004, as the first World Cup host on the continent. In 1997, Puma signed up Cameroon, and it has strengthened its ties to Africa since then. At the 2006 World Cup, Puma had all five of the African teams in the competition. This time, it has four of the six African countries involved; South Africa and Nigeria are with Adidas. While sponsorships of teams from Africa and other countries in the developing world have not yet generated bidding wars like those in Europe, the World Cup will provide a global showcase for several small brands lucky to have supported long-shot teams that qualified for the tournament. Equipment manufacturers’ logos are the only branding allowed on World Cup soccer jerseys, in contrast with professional club soccer shirts, which generally also include another prominent sponsor, like a gambling, electronics or car brand. That means even lesser known labels can stand out. Joma, a small Spanish provider of athletic gear, has high hopes for its sponsorship of a single World Cup participant, Honduras. The company expects its sales to rise 40 percent in that country this year and 15 percent in the United States, which has a large Honduran community, a spokeswoman said. Rounding out the roster of 2010 World Cup shirt sponsors are Brooks, a U.S. maker of running shoes, which is supporting Chile, and Legea, an Italian provider of sports equipment that is making its first World Cup appearance. Legea cleared up one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the tournament when it said last month that it had signed an agreement to supply uniforms to the North Korean team, which is in the World Cup for the first time since 1966. In pre-World Cup matches, the team had worn jerseys from a variety of brands, including Astore of Spain, Erke of China and Pirma of Mexico. In an away match against Venezuela in March, North Korea sported jerseys from Adidas, but it turned out that those had been borrowed from the home team after North Korea’s uniforms reportedly were lost in transit. Lorenzo Grimaldi, a spokesman for Legea, said the company had paid “a little less” than €4 million for the right to dress the North Korean team. Even though North Korea is one of the longest of World Cup long shots, it is likely to be seen by big international television audiences because its first-round opponents include Brazil and another perennial power, Portugal. Mr. Grimaldi said Legea had no qualms about associating itself with a team from a country whose foreign policy is often shrouded in even more intrigue than the North Korean soccer federation’s choice of shirt. “We are just a company that makes sportswear, and our goal is to grow and expand our image and our business worldwide,” he said.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html?ref=nikeinc">The Data-Driven Life<date>Published: April 28, 2010</date><text>Humans make errors. We make errors of fact and errors of judgment. We have blind spots in our field of vision and gaps in our stream of attention. Sometimes we can’t even answer the simplest questions. Where was I last week at this time? How long have I had this pain in my knee? How much money do I typically spend in a day? These weaknesses put us at a disadvantage. We make decisions with partial information. We are forced to steer by guesswork. We go with our gut.That is, some of us do. Others use data. A timer running on Robin Barooah’s computer tells him that he has been living in the United States for 8 years, 2 months and 10 days. At various times in his life, Barooah — a 38-year-old self-employed software designer from England who now lives in Oakland, Calif. — has also made careful records of his work, his sleep and his diet. A few months ago, Barooah began to wean himself from coffee. His method was precise. He made a large cup of coffee and removed 20 milliliters weekly. This went on for more than four months, until barely a sip remained in the cup. He drank it and called himself cured. Unlike his previous attempts to quit, this time there were no headaches, no extreme cravings. Still, he was tempted, and on Oct. 12 last year, while distracted at his desk, he told himself that he could probably concentrate better if he had a cup. Coffee may have been bad for his health, he thought, but perhaps it was good for his concentration. Barooah wasn’t about to try to answer a question like this with guesswork. He had a good data set that showed how many minutes he spent each day in focused work. With this, he could do an objective analysis. Barooah made a chart with dates on the bottom and his work time along the side. Running down the middle was a big black line labeled “Stopped drinking coffee.” On the left side of the line, low spikes and narrow columns. On the right side, high spikes and thick columns. The data had delivered their verdict, and coffee lost. He was sad but also thrilled. Instead of a stimulating cup of coffee, he got a bracing dose of truth. “People have such very poor sense of time,” Barooah says, and without good time calibration, it is much harder to see the consequences of your actions. If you want to replace the vagaries of intuition with something more reliable, you first need to gather data. Once you know the facts, you can live by them. Five years ago, Ben Lipkowitz, who is now 28, was living with some friends in Bloomington, Ind., and he found himself wondering how much time he spent doing one of his roommates’ dishes. Lipkowitz had a handheld electronic datebook that he purchased on a trip to Tokyo, and on May 11, 2005, at 2:20 p.m., he started using it to keep a record of his actions. Instead of entering his future appointments, he entered his past activities, creating a remarkably complete account of his life. In one sense this was just a normal personal journal, albeit in a digital format and unusually detailed. But the format and detail made all the difference. Lipkowitz eventually transferred the data to his computer, and now, using a few keyboard commands, he can call up his history. He knows how much he has eaten and how much he has spent. He knows what books he has read and what objects he has purchased. And of course, he knows the answer to his original question. “I was thinking I was spending an hour a day cleaning up after this person,” Lipkowitz says. He shrugs. “It turned out it was more like 20 minutes.” Another person I’m friendly with, Mark Carranza — he also makes his living with computers — has been keeping a detailed, searchable archive of all the ideas he has had since he was 21. That was in 1984. I realize that this seems impossible. But I have seen his archive, with its million plus entries, and observed him using it. He navigates smoothly between an interaction with somebody in the present moment and his digital record, bringing in associations to conversations that took place years earlier. Most thoughts are tagged with date, time and location. What for other people is an inchoate flow of mental life is broken up into elements and cross-referenced. These men all know that their behavior is abnormal. They are outliers. Geeks. But why does what they are doing seem so strange? In other contexts, it is normal to seek data. A fetish for numbers is the defining trait of the modern manager. Corporate executives facing down hostile shareholders load their pockets full of numbers. So do politicians on the hustings, doctors counseling patients and fans abusing their local sports franchise on talk radio. Charles Dickens was already making fun of this obsession in 1854, with his sketch of the fact-mad schoolmaster Gradgrind, who blasted his students with memorized trivia. But Dickens’s great caricature only proved the durability of the type. For another century and a half, it got worse.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/sports/football/14roethlisberger.html?ref=nikeinc">Roethlisberger Is Facing Fallout for His Behavior<date>Published: April 13, 2010</date><text>The fallout has begun for Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who met with Commissioner Roger Goodell for two hours Tuesday regarding his involvement last month with a 20-year-old college student in a Georgia bar.A Pittsburgh-based company, PLB Sports, that marketed Big Ben Beef Jerky — and made a sensation of Flutie Flakes — ended its five-year business relationship with Roethlisberger on Tuesday. The owner of the company, Ty Ballou, said he made the decision after hearing the lurid details of Roethlisberger’s encounter with the woman, which were revealed by a Georgia district attorney Monday. Roethlisberger was not charged with sexual assault. Ballou has worked with players like Doug Flutie, Terrell Owens, Hines Ward, Jerome Bettis and Dustin Pedroia, and it was the first time in 14 years that he ended such a relationship. Ballou would not disclose how much money Roethlisberger earned annually from the deal, although he said it was not in six figures. According to Sports Illustrated’s “Fortunate 50” list of highly paid athletes, Roethlisberger earned $2.5 million in endorsements in 2009. “I’m a father and as a father I hope the lesson is learned by Ben,” Ballou said in a telephone interview. “I can’t imagine anyone touching Ben Roethlisberger. Enough is enough. I hope there is a suspension. At some point in time, Ben has got to put himself in the right position and understand what it means to be a celebrity, a quarterback, a Steelers player.” The N.F.L. and the Steelers are expected to review Roethlisberger’s case and decide on a punishment, perhaps a multigame suspension. Roethlisberger’s lawyer, David Cornwell, who accompanied Roethlisberger to his meeting with Goodell, declined to comment on PLB Sports’s severing ties with Roethlisberger. Roethlisberger, his image tattered and his immediate playing future in doubt, apologized Monday night in a statement he read from the Steelers’ locker room. Notably absent were top Steelers officials, who had stood beside Roethlisberger a year ago when he proclaimed his innocence after a woman claimed he raped her in Lake Tahoe, Nev., in 2008. He was not charged in that case. Nike pays Roethlisberger to use his image, and in a statement Tuesday, it said he “continues to be part of Nike’s roster of athletes.” But Ballou, as a Steelers fan and local businessman, may be more representative of the backlash Roethlisberger is likely to face when he returns next week to Pittsburgh for workouts. Steelers fans are passionate and loyal to the team, not to any individual player, and Roethlisberger’s off-the-field behavior — including a motorcycle accident he had while not wearing a helmet — has rankled them. The Rooney family is said to be furious about the damage done to an organization that those who work for it think is bigger than any individual. The franchise takes pride in conducting itself with standards of conduct that, Coach Mike Tomlin said last month, they believe are above and beyond those of their N.F.L. peers. Ralph Cindrich, a longtime N.F.L. agent and sports consultant who lives in Pittsburgh, said fans he had heard from were furious with Roethlisberger. “The longtime supporters have turned against him,” Cindrich said. “I’m not saying it can’t be repaired, but there is no room for the slightest error now. I think the major concern with the city is for the Rooney family. The city is not accustomed to hearing any bashing of them.” It has been a long, uncomfortable off-season for the Steelers, who also dealt with accusations that their former receiver Santonio Holmes threw a drink at a woman. It was merely the latest brush with the law for Holmes; he has been suspended four games for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy. In a measure of how little patience the Steelers had for him, Holmes was traded him to the Jets on Sunday night for a fifth-round pick, a paltry compensation for a former first-round pick coming off his best season. But the Steelers were prepared to release Holmes if they had not found a trading partner. “The Steelers, there is probably no prouder organization,” Ballou said. “I feel for them right now. Players are part of the Steelers’ brand. If it’s not the biggest in the league, it’s well up there. This has diminished the brand.” Terry Bradshaw, a Hall of Fame quarterback who won four Super Bowl titles in Pittsburgh, blasted Roethlisberger on Monday night. Bradshaw, who was distant from the Steelers for several years after his retirement, told KTBS-TV in Louisiana that he rarely went to clubs when he played in Pittsburgh because he was petrified of the trouble he could get into. “He’s got an image problem right now,” Bradshaw said. “Best thing to do is don’t ever put yourself in that position again. When you’re through playing football, do whatever you want to do, but right now, stay clean. Stay out of trouble. Stay out of bars. Keep yourself clean.” Bradshaw also revealed that his relationship with Roethlisberger was strained. He said he once advised Roethlisberger not to ride his motorcycle. Roethlisberger, Bradshaw said, got mad. Then Roethlisberger had the off-season motorcycle accident. “He doesn’t like me, and I’m learning not to like him,” Bradshaw said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507EFDF123EF933A25757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">ON PAR; Nike Ad Uses Audio From Film On Woods<date>Published: April 10, 2010</date><text>The comments by Earl Woods used in a Nike ad and that gave the impression he was mildly lecturing his son about his scandal came from a 2004 documentary in which the elder Woods discussed his and his wife's parenting styles, ABCNews.com reported. In the ad, Tiger Woods stares mutely at the camera, while the voice of his father, who died in 2006, speaks as if he were obliquely addressing his son's infidelities. ''Tiger,'' Earl Woods says in the commercial, ''I am more prone to be inquisitive, to promote discussion. I want to find out what your thinking was. I want to find out what your feelings are. Did you learn anything?'' The audio was taken from a part of the three-disk ''Tiger: The Authorized DVD Collection,'' in which the golfer compares his parents' personalities, the Web site of ABC News said. His father is ''steely, cold, icy, never gets emotional'' and his mother is ''more fiery, more of an extrovert.'' In the documentary, Earl Woods says of his wife, Kultida, whose nickname is Tida: ''Authoritarian. Yes, Tida is very authoritative. She is very definitive. 'Yes' and 'No.' I am more prone to be inquisitive, to promote discussion, I want to find out what your thinking was. I want to find out what your feelings are and did you learn anything.'' Beth Gast, a Nike spokeswoman who on Wednesday refused to give the source of the Earl Woods audio, confirmed that the sound bite came from the three-disc DVD collection. ''In the video, Earl was referencing how he is as a parent to Tiger,'' she said. The ad made its debut on Wednesday on ESPN and the Golf Channel and was scheduled to stop running on Thursday. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E4D9133CF93BA35757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">ON PAR; Voice From Past In a Nike Ad Featuring Woods<date>Published: April 8, 2010</date><text>Nike, which stood by Tiger Woods when AT&amp;T and Accenture dropped him, began running a new 30-second commercial Wednesday that uses the recorded voice of his father, Earl, who died in 2006. In the commercial, Woods looks at the camera with a dour, unchanging expression as his father's resurrected voice says: ''Tiger, I am more prone to be inquisitive, to promote discussion. I want to find out what your thinking was. I want to find out what your feelings are. And did you learn anything?'' The remarks are clearly intended to sound as if Earl Woods is talking about the scandal created by his son's extramarital affairs. But Nike did not say what the original context of Earl Woods's comments were. The ad, which was broadcast on ESPN and the Golf Channel at 6 p.m., will run until Thursday afternoon. The Wall Street Journal first reported the content of the commercial earlier Wednesday and said that it had been shot at Isleworth Country Club, a golf course near Woods's home in Windermere, Fla. Last month, TMZ reported that the ad was filed March 25, and posted a photograph of the course set-up. In a statement, Nike said: ''We support Tiger and his family. As he returns to competitive golf, the ad addresses his time away from the game using the powerful words of his father.'' Bob Dorfman, the executive vice president of Baker Street Advertising, said that the timing and content of the ad was in keeping with Nike's deep relationship with Woods. ''They've been behind him all the way,'' he said. ''Nike's gained the most from his success, building an entire golf division on his back. Now, it seems like he's turned the corner with the last press conference pushing us back to Tiger the golfer.'' The tone of Nike's new ad -- meant to refer to the scandal and to herald Woods's return to golf after a five-month absence -- stands in contrast to that of the upbeat and socially aware one that Nike produced when Woods turned pro in 1996. ''Hello world,'' it said. It is also quite different from the notable one in which Woods juggled a ball on a club head. BUILDING ON THE PATCH Since 1928, Augusta Municipal Golf Course has been the affordable site for 18 holes in the host city of the Masters. Lovingly known as the Patch, it was the first course that allowed blacks to three-putt along with whites, and it remains the least expensive golf option in town. On Wednesday morning, a handful of golfers gathered for a round to raise funds for the First Tee of Augusta, the local chapter of an international initiative that offers youngsters a chance to develop ''life-enhancing values'' through golf. Organizers included Edward Wanambwa, senior editor of African American Golfer's Digest magazine, who said of the Patch, ''This is where the caddies at Augusta National used to play and was a stop on the black pro tour.'' ''We're hoping to build on that,'' he added. Less than five miles away, Masters patrons, many of whom pay for price-gouged hotel rooms and scalped tickets, find virtual throwback prices for sandwiches ($1.50 to $2.50), ice cream ($2), soda ($1.50) and fruit and other snacks ($1). A beer sells for $2.75 domestic, $3.50 imported. MIKE TIERNEY WHAT WINE GOES WITH GLANDS? The Masters champions gathered Tuesday in their green jackets inside the Augusta National Golf Club clubhouse for their annual dinner, a custom that was initiated by Ben Hogan in 1952. Sam Snead was known for delivering a long string of ribald jokes. In 1998, 22-year-old Tiger Woods and 96-year-old Gene Sarazen compared golf grips, using dinner knives as clubs. The most famed tradition is the selection of the food served, which is at the choice of the defending champion, who also picks up the tab for the dinner. The menu selected by the 2009 champion, Ángel Cabrera, was a source of amusement. Cabrera promised a ''good Argentine asado,'' which he described as a five-course barbeque of meat in various forms including blood sausage, pork sausage and beef ribs. Cabrera's swing coach and sometimes interpreter, Charlie Epps, listed another item, mollejas, which he said was the thymus gland of a bull. ''There won't be a lot of carbohydrates at this dinner,'' Epps said. Jack Nicklaus was asked about Cabrera's menu. ''I hope he enjoys it,'' Nicklaus said. Attendees at the dinner are allowed to select from the club's traditional menu of steaks, chicken and fish. Cabrera's food choices hardly stand out as eccentric over the years. Many champions have harked back to the popular culinary alternatives of their homeland. Sandy Lyle of Scotland served haggis. The 2009 champion, Trevor Immelman of South Africa, went for Bobotie, a spiced meat pie with an egg topping. The Canadian Mike Weir had elk, wild boar and Arctic char. Spain's José María Olazábal served paella, and Germany's Bernhard Langer wiener schnitzel. Cabrera on Tuesday morning seemed unworried about how his menu would go over. ''It will be good,'' he said. ''It will be liked. There will be lots of wine.'' BILL PENNINGTON PHOTO: A new Nike commercial uses the voice of Tiger Woods's father, Earl, who died in 2006.

Marketers are starting to disclose details of their ads or, in some instances, introducing elements of their soccer-centric campaigns. Among those marketers are Adidas, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Nike and Visa. The ardor for the World Cup is another example of how advertisers are stepping up support for marquee televised events, known as big event TV. Programs like the Grammy Awards, the Super Bowl, the Winter Olympics and the Oscars have set ratings records or attracted significantly more viewers than in recent years. The strategy is “big voices in big places,” said Christopher J. Perry, interim head of marketing at Hyundai Motor America in Fountain Valley, Calif., and “we feel we’re reaping a lot of benefits from it.” Hyundai, which sponsored the broadcasts of the Super Bowl, on CBS, and the Academy Awards, on ABC, has a deal to be the exclusive automotive sponsor of the ABC and ESPN coverage of the World Cup, Mr. Perry said, which will be extended into print, online and radio. This dovetails with a deal for the Hyundai Motor America parent in South Korea, the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, to become the exclusive automotive global sponsor of the event, which was struck with the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, or FIFA.  Powerade, sold by the Coca-Cola Company, is focusing its first worldwide integrated marketing campaign — for TV, print, online and outdoors — on the brand’s status as the official sports drink of the 2010 World Cup. The ads will even include a phrase proclaiming that Powerade was “chosen by FIFA to hydrate the 2010 FIFA World Cup players.” The campaign is to run in countries that account for more than 95 percent of Powerade’s sales volume, which include Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, South Korea and the United States. The campaign will also promote Powerade’s scheduled presence on the pitch — as they say in soccer — in the form of new squeeze bottles for the players at the 10 stadiums. And signs bearing the Powerade logo are to be posted around the stadiums. “Major sporting events, big-event television, are a wonderful platform,” said Mark Greatrex, senior vice president for global still beverages at Coca-Cola in Atlanta. They also can help “drive global scale for our big brands” as part of an initiative, called 2020 Vision, to more than double systemwide revenue, Mr. Greatrex said. “As we look at the sports-drink category out over the next 10 years,” he added, “there’s a lot of untapped potential” among dedicated athletes. “Part of the strategy is to build up the sports credentials of Powerade,” he said, which is where the FIFA relationship comes in. “We are making a big deal of the FIFA endorsement in every touch point,” he added, whether it is a sign in a convenience store, a Powerade channel on YouTube (youtube.com/powerade), a commercial or a poster. The campaign, which carries the theme “Keep playing,” is the first work for Powerade from the SapientNitro unit of the Sapient Corporation, which was recently named the worldwide digital agency for the brand. SapientNitro is also creating the nondigital elements of the campaign like the TV, print and outdoor ads. The ads present soccer as a game enjoyed around the clock and around the world by a gorgeous mosaic of players. “It doesn’t matter whether you have tons of money or play on a dirt pitch,” said Gaston Legorburu, worldwide creative officer at the Miami office of SapientNitro. “It’s kind of the neverending game.”The campaign aims to invoke the days “when you asked your mom to give you another 10 minutes to play outside,” he added. “There’s almost no light, but you still want to play.” Indeed, some scenes in the commercial and the video clips on the YouTube channel show games being played in the dark.  The Powerade push by Coca-Cola is coming as the brand’s far larger rival, Gatorade, sold by a unit of PepsiCo, is struggling with an unusual sales slump. Volume for Gatorade in the United States fell 15.5 percent last year compared with 2008, according to data from the Beverage Marketing Corporation. By comparison, volume for Powerade declined 1 percent, the data showed, and the sports-drink category fell 12.3 percent. Mr. Greatrex declined to discuss Powerade’s competitors. He did, however, contrast the Gatorade strategy of offering separate beverages to drink before, during and after athletic activity with the Powerade platform of providing consumers “one simple choice, to reach for one sports drink.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/sports/golf/21nike.html?ref=nikeinc">If Woods Plays Well, Retailers Will Smile<date>Published: March 20, 2010</date><text>Tiger Woods’s break from golf since late November could not have been timed better for golf retailers. His absence coincided with the months when clothing and equipment sales are slow and discounts move goods during the holidays.But news that he will return at the Masters comes at the start of the peak season. “Selfishly, this is perfect,” said Martin E. Hanaka, chairman and chief executive of Golfsmith, a 74-store golf and tennis retail chain. “The season’s kicking off. The Masters is the No. 1 event. Spring is blooming. People are itching to get out there.” Woods is the star of Nike Golf, which produces apparel including his high-end TW shirts, pants, sweaters, jackets and vests. Victory Red, which evokes the shirt color that Woods wears on Sundays, is a golf club brand within the broader Nike line. His presence has put a halo over the Nike line, golf retailing and golf as an industry. Nike has stood by Woods since his one-car accident on Thanksgiving weekend eventually led to a sex scandal. Accenture and AT&amp;T dropped him, and Gillette temporarily halted its use of him. Nike Golf’s Web site, which currently features Justin Leonard on its home page, seems to be using Woods sparingly. “Going forward, as he returns to golf, how Nike Golf positions him is going to be a very sensitive topic,” said Terry McAndrew, editor of the Web Street Golf Report. Retailers simply hope that he will play well once he returns and increase sales. “The day after he wins, our stores are packed,” Hanaka said. Golfsmith and the New York Golf Center say that, at worst, sales of Woods clothing have dipped a bit. “When it happened, we didn’t have deep inventories,” Hanaka said. “Then we went to 20 percent off, and his stuff moved pretty well.” Gary Lynch, a salesman at the New York Golf Center on West 35th Street near Broadway, said Woods’s clothing line was hurt because women were less eager to buy his $100 shirts or $130 pants for their golf-playing husbands. In addition, with Woods not playing, the store’s front display table could not lay out his popular Thursday-to-Sunday schedule of shirts. “We were still getting Nike inventory, but it wasn’t related to anything,” he said. The two retailers said Woods’s troubles had no discernible effect on Nike equipment sales, in particular the Victory Red club line, which includes an $899.99 iron. On Friday, Tom Gessner of East Rockaway, N.Y., was test-swinging irons at the golf center. He has long favored Mizunos and was swinging models of that brand, as well as Callaways and Nikes. He said he was considering Victory Red despite Woods’s transgressions. “That wouldn’t affect what the club does for me,” he said. “It only matters how it performs.” Nike would not offer any details about its golf apparel and equipment sales — or whether the Woods scandal affected them — during the three months ended Feb. 28. The third-quarter report, released last week, provided no results for Nike Golf. Analysts said that they did not think the scandal had hurt Nike’s golf sales. Tom Stine, a founder of Golf Datatech, said, “We know that he’s a positive in making consumers aware of the Nike brand, but we don’t have any evidence that people are going to be turned off to the brand because of him.” At the New York Golf Center, Frank Cole, a club salesman, said he had seen no diminution of interest in golfers looking at the broad Nike line or the Victory Reds. “Victory Red’s the best stuff Nike’s come out with,” he said and added that 12- to 18-year-olds were particularly devoted to Woods. “They want his shoes, they want his clubs.” The Golfsmith store, on the East Side of Manhattan, offers a glimpse of the retail life with Woods in hiatus. About 10 feet from a table of full-price and discounted Woods apparel is a large display that draws attention away from the his shirts and pants. It shows Phil Mickelson, the smiling face of Callaway, in a promotion offering full refunds to buyers of three new drivers, from March 12 to April 7, if he wins the Masters. “It’ll generate a lot of buzz if that happens,” said Chris Ferrara, the store’s senior general manager. “Without Tiger, he’s the most marketable player out there.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/sports/ncaabasketball/18morris.html?ref=nikeinc">An Apparel Underdog Outfits a No. 15 Seed<date>Published: March 17, 2010</date><text>PITTSBURGH — Amid the Nike swooshes and Adidas three stripes that dominate the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments, it may be hard to spot the logo of a little-known company that is squeezing its foot in the door of the $4 billion sports-apparel industry.Crons, which created its name as an acronym from the phrase “Come ready or never start,” is based in Pittsburgh and describes what it sells as “motivational apparel.” It is supplying the uniforms and practice gear for Robert Morris University, which is one of only six teams not wearing Nike or Adidas uniforms. Robert Morris, a small, private university of 5,000 students located just outside Pittsburgh, is seeded 15th in the South Region and plays No. 2 Villanova on Thursday. The Colonials are making their second straight appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament after again winning the Northeast Conference tournament and the automatic bid that went with it. Crons’s founder and owner is Pat Cavanaugh, 42, who played in the N.C.A.A. tournament three times as a walk-on starter at Pittsburgh in the late 1980s. He points out that Robert Morris’s run of success under Coach Mike Rice coincides with their relationship. “All I know is they’ve been making the tournament wearing our uniforms for the past two years,” Cavanaugh said. Cavanaugh may have a hard time proving a direct correlation between new uniforms and a team’s on-court success. But the surprising thing is that Crons — whose name Cavanaugh came up with 15 years ago — is supplying the uniforms and practice gear at all. Two years ago, the university went looking to buy new uniforms. It found that the bigger companies were not willing to do much more than give it different-colored models of uniforms they were already providing to larger programs — and wanted to charge Robert Morris about 30 percent more than Crons. “We get the booklets these other companies produce, and when you look for a new uniform, it’s usually a Syracuse or Kentucky style, and if you choose it, you’re basically wearing their uniform,” Rice said. It also did not hurt that in the intertwined world of college basketball, Rice had a tie to Cavanaugh. Rice was an assistant coach at Pittsburgh before going to Robert Morris three years ago, and had met Cavanaugh there and seen the line of clothing his company made for local Amateur Athletic Union teams. So when Rice asked him what he could do for Robert Morris, Cavanaugh offered a custom look that completely revamped the team’s red, white and blue tops and bottoms, and added red, white and blue horizontal stripes down the sides — a look the team’s players instantly liked. “The guys liked it and people have talked about it, so, yeah, it’s gotten some buzz,” said Rice, who points out that the team still wears Nike sneakers. All but 12 of the other 64 teams in the N.C.A.A. tournament are wearing sneakers from Nike or its Jordan division. And while it may be only anecdotal, other smaller programs also describe similar situations that demonstrate why companies like Crons — beyond its founder’s kinetic personality — are making inroads with teams that previously would have never considered going with anyone but Nike, Adidas, Russell Athletic or even Under Armour. “The landscape of uniforms and shoes is changing,” said Ryan Marks, the coach of Texas-Pan American, which last year became Crons’s second Division I basketball client. “Major schools are bound by the shoe contract of whether the coach is a Nike guy or an Adidas guy, and we never were. But schools like ours also don’t get the shoe allotments or discounts we used to on uniforms.” Rice said, “It’s kind of the haves and have-nots these days, and Crons is taking advantage of that, making quality apparel that’s affordable.” Both Nike and the universities peg that to the economy. In recent years, as the economy has constricted and budgets have become tighter at smaller places in particular, programs have started to look to save wherever they can. At the same time, companies like Nike are putting more emphasis on larger, more visible programs, while giving fewer free goods and smaller discounts to the smaller guys. “With the economy, we’re not immune to it like everyone else,” said Kejuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman. That is red meat to career salesmen and entrepreneurs like Cavanaugh, who started his first company when he was 21 while he was at Pitt, and has built the Cavanaugh Marketing Network into a $10-million-a-year company. He created Crons in 1996, and thought initially he would go straight into retail, so he offered his line to Dick’s Sporting Goods, which is based in a Pittsburgh suburb. “They said: ‘Pat, great product. But come back when you have a track record,’ ” Cavanaugh said. So, over the last four years, Cavanaugh has ignored retail sales and focused on selling to high schools, athletic organizations, then small colleges, smaller professional teams and now bigger colleges and conferences. Last fall, he secured a contract to provide league gear — though not individual team uniforms — for all of the teams in the Big South conference. In all, the company has gone from about 20 clients in 2006 to more than 400. It had revenue of more than $2 million last year, which Cavanaugh believes will grow to nearly $8 million this year. Should Nike ($19 billion in revenue last year) and Adidas ($15 billion) be worried? “Oh, no,” said Jim Hartford, chief executive of SportSourceOne, which publishes the trade journal SGB Update. “But then, Nike wasn’t worried about Under Armour until it was too late.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/apple-hires-wearable-computing-engineer/?ref=nikeinc">Apple Hires Wearable Computing Engineer<date>March 16, 2010, 9:36 am</date><text>U.S. Patent &amp; Trade Office An image from an Apple patent for a head-mounted display. Apple has hired Richard DeVaul, a veteran of the wearable computing field and co-founder of AWare Technologies, a technology company focused on creating products for the fitness and “wellness” markets. According to Computerworld, Mr. DeVaul will be a senior prototype scientist at Apple, presumably working on some of the technologies he discusses on his blog: I’m an expert in signal processing and real-time statistical classification techniques. This means that I know how to make tiny computers do “thin slicing,” as popularized in Malcolm Gladwell’s “Blink.” It’s all about extracting the small pieces of information that are most meaningful. What does this work mean for us mere mortals? According to Mr. DeVaul’s LinkedIn page, he received a Ph.D. in media arts and sciences from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and while there worked on a project called “The Memory Glasses,” which offered real-time memory support that could “improve your performance on a memory recall task by a factor of about 63 percent without distracting you.” In other words, these fancy glasses could probably help you remember where you left your car keys. While at M.I.T. he also worked directly with Professor Alex Pentland in the Human Dyanmics group. This group works on the intersection of humans and technology, and using sensors and the data that these wearable devices can share, to try to predict human behavior. Although wearable computers are not necessarily a new idea, Apple helped push the concept further into the mainstream in 2006 when it partnered with Nike to introduce the Nike+ line of sneakers. This product wirelessly connects to an iPod and tracks the distance and pace of a person’s run. There’s no telling what’s next for Apple and this market. Maybe we’ll finally see a pair of wearable iPod glasses based on a series of 2008 patents for head-mounted displays. Or maybe the company will try to create new additions to the iPhone by offering attachments and sensors. One thing’s for sure, these technologies will continue to spread into our clothing, sneakers and maybe even our glasses.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/lucid-imagination-takes-10-million/?ref=nikeinc">Lucid Imagination Takes $10 Million<date>March 11, 2010, 4:51 am</date><text>Lucid Imagination, a commercial vendor of open source search technologies, has landed $10 million in a second round of funding, VentureBeat reported.

Many companies take out death and disability insurance to cover themselves in the event that an athlete or celebrity endorser dies or is injured while under contract. In a new wrinkle, more companies are trying to insure against the potential loss of sales when an athlete product endorser is involved in a scandal. “Companies are saying if it could happen to Tiger Woods, it could happen to anyone,” said Brian Socolow, a lawyer who runs the sports practice at Loeb &amp; Loeb, which represents athletes and companies in sponsorship deals. “For some companies, it’s a tremendous investment, and when it goes bad, it is not only the loss of investment, it’s a black eye for the company.” Dan Trueman, who runs the enterprise risk department at R J Kiln &amp; Company, the managing agent for Lloyd’s, said his firm had seen an eightfold increase in inquiries into this type of insurance between September and December, the bulk from pharmaceutical and financial service companies. “It’s more than just the flavor of the week,” he said. Calculating the amount to insure against is not easy. Insurers said they based their assumptions on how much revenue grew after an athlete or celebrity became a company endorser. In some cases, the cause and effect is direct  for example, in the case of signature Tiger Woods golf shirts sold by Nike. But companies that employ athletes or celebrities for more generic brand building are now also looking for financial protection. Famous endorsers, according to Lori Shaw, the director of the sports and leisure practice at Aon, a leading sports insurance broker, “can have a significant impact on a corporation’s balance sheet, depending on how much revenue is tied to a specific celebrity.” Indeed, the stock prices of the seven publicly held companies that have or had sponsorship deals with Woods lost $12 billion in market value in the month after Woods’s statement in December that he was taking a leave from golf, according to a study by Chris Knittel, a professor of economics at the University of California at Davis. An increasingly common strategy for companies to better protect themselves is to change the language in their morals clauses to cover more contingencies. The more specific the language, the more expensive the insurance becomes, according to executives in the industry. Athletes usually prefer that a morals clause gives the company the right to terminate their agreement only when the player is convicted of a felony involving “moral turpitude” or worse, because a conviction could take years and the risk of conviction is relatively low. Companies, by contrast, want the broadest rights possible to cover “any occurrence” that involves “moral turpitude, or makes any statement or commits any act disparaging of, or reflecting unfavorably upon, the company’s reputation or the company’s products and services,” according to one type of morals clause. Companies struggle with this language because they can spend tens of millions of dollars on athletes’ contracts and advertising campaigns. Insurance policies can cover money paid to athletes as well as the cost of producing and booking television commercials, print advertisements and other promotions. Some insurers will also cover the costs of new commercials with replacement athletes. The recent scandal and the growing dollar value of athlete endorsement deals is going to lead more companies to pursue more insurance, said Phil de Picciotto, the president for athletes and personalities at the Octagon sports agency. Companies are also going to push for shorter-term contracts that push for a greater percentage of their money in the form of incentives payable when athletes meet certain on-field targets. Some companies may also stop using current athletes and opt instead for retired or deceased athletes. Other companies will vet athletes more carefully by hiring private detectives to do background checks, said Bill Duffy, the chairman of BDA Sports Management, which represents Steve Nash, Yao Ming and other basketball players. According to Trueman, the underwriter at Kiln: “Tiger Woods has made people think about their reputations. These days, people don’t worry about the office burning down, but about their intellectual property being damaged.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on February 1, 2010, on page D2 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E3D71330F933A05752C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">Nike Ad's Loaded Image Hits Raw Spot for the N.B.A.<date>Published: January 30, 2010</date><text>Just days after suspending Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton for the season for bringing pistols into the Washington Wizards' locker room, the N.B.A. is facing the handgun issue again because of Nike. The new issues of Sports Illustrated and ESPN the Magazine contain a two-page Nike ad with LeBron James and Kobe Bryant in dramatic black-and-white photos for the company's ''Prepare for Combat'' campaign. ''I'll do whatever it takes to win games,'' Bryant is portrayed as saying. ''I don't leave anything in the chamber.'' His agent, Rob Pelinka, did not return a call to respond to whether Bryant approved the language. Tim Frank, a league spokesman, said in an e-mail message: ''We had no prior notice of this ad. We think it is inappropriate.'' He would not elaborate, but he added that the league gets advance notice about ads, and approval rights, only if they contain the N.B.A.'s logo or trademarks. Nike did not directly address Frank's comments, but issued a statement that defended Bryant's quotation. The company said his comments were ''intended to illustrate his all-out play and commitment on the basketball court. It is a commonly used reference for shooting the basketball and no offense was intended.'' The language of weaponry and warfare is, of course, common in sports. And Bryant's reference to the part of a handgun where cartridges are loaded fits the combat-themed ad campaign. But his allusion to firearms appears untimely coming five weeks after the Arenas-Crittenton incident on Dec. 21 at Verizon Center in Washington. Nike, a league marketing partner, is known for its provocative advertising. It also exerts a large influence around the league through its deals with superstars like Bryant, James and nearly 200 other players, including Tony Parker, Chris Bosh, Kevin Durant, Pau Gasol, Dirk Nowitzki and O. J. Mayo. Scott Novak, a spokesman for Sports Illustrated, said the magazine had no obligation to tell Nike to alter the content of its ad. ''As a policy,'' he said, ''the magazine refrains from counseling our partners on their creative campaigns.'' According to the Sports Illustrated rate card, the ad cost Nike $811,400. It is likely that the ESPN ad cost Nike even more. An ESPN spokesman did not respond to questions. N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said on Wednesday that violations of the league's firearms policy would not be tolerated when he announced the suspension of Arenas and Crittenton without pay. ''If there's any doubt to any of our players about it in the future,'' he said, ''we will be dealing with this in an even more severe way.'' League rules prohibit players from carrying guns onto N.B.A. property or while on N.B.A. business. Arenas has pleaded guilty to a felony gun charge. Crittenton pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Nike Inc Go to your Portfolio » Nike has countered declines in consumer spending mainly by cutting costs, streamlining operations and reducing marketing. It has slashed 5 percent of its global workforce, or some 1,750 jobs. Orders for goods to be delivered from now until April fell 1 percent on a constant currency basis. That was better than some analysts had expected and an improvement from a 4 percent decline in the first quarter. A sampling of analysts had forecast a range of flat to down 6 percent in the second quarter for the gauge. Second-quarter net income fell 4 percent to $375 million, or 76 cents a share, from $391 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. That was better than analysts’ average forecast of earnings of 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue slipped 4 percent, to $4.4 billion, with sales down in every geographical area except for Nike’s emerging markets. Revenue slid 4 percent in North America, 6 percent in Western Europe and 24 percent in Central and Eastern Europe. In China, a market with double-digit growth last year, sales fell 3 percent. Revenues were up 1 percent in the historically fast-growing unit that sells non-Nike-branded goods. Gross margins fell to 44.5 percent from 44.7 percent in the year-ago quarter, caused by higher discounting and foreign exchange impacts. Nike’s sales have been under pressure in recent quarters as consumers in the United States and Europe have spent conservatively and mall-based retailers have cut back on orders and carry less inventory. Stock in Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., rose 3.3 percent to $65.33 a share after closing at $63.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Skip to next paragraph New York Times bloggers are following every serve, volley and replay challenge of the 2009 Grand Slam tournaments. Straight Sets RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Straight Sets Blog » Men Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders Women Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders First stop: Dubai for a rendezvous with Roger Federer at his training base. Next stop: Majorca for a get-acquainted chat with Rafael Nadal on his home island. Final stop: Monaco for a tête-à-tête with Novak Djokovic, the cosmopolitan Serb who resides in the low-tax, high-rent principality. “It was three places in I think three days, and it ended with dinner Christmas Eve,” said Helfant, the former Nike executive who soon agreed to become executive chairman and president of the men’s tennis tour. “I spent some time with each of the three guys, just hearing from them what their issues were and getting to know them a bit,” Helfant said. “I knew Roger from my Nike days. I didn’t really know Rafa. I had met him once before but certainly couldn’t claim to have had a relationship, and I didn’t know Novak at all. So it was instructive. Those issues didn’t go away. Those are issues that we have discussed since then and continue to discuss, because one of the things that impressed me in those conversations and made me feel particularly good about the decision I was making was how engaged the top guys were in the issues that are important to the tour and how deep their understanding is of those issues.” Eleven months into his new job, Helfant’s understanding of tennis’s fault lines has deepened considerably, too. It has not been without personal sacrifice for the measured, self-deprecating, 44-year-old New Yorker. Helfant’s wife and two young children live in Connecticut, but Helfant, eager to make connections and allay concerns about an American-centered approach, has spent much of the year traveling or based in London, where he will preside over the A.T.P. Tour World Finals that begin Sunday. “I’m not sure what it says about my marriage that my wife is happy for me to be on the road; it means I either have a very strong marriage or the opposite,” Helfant said with a laugh. He has kept a low public profile and seems in no hurry to embrace the role of talking head. That is a stylistic shift from recent tennis leaders, including Larry Scott, head of the women’s tour until leaving earlier this year, and Etienne de Villiers, the quotable and irreverent former Disney executive who, as Helfant’s predecessor, ran afoul of Federer, Nadal and other top players for some of his reforms and, in part, for allying himself with Andre Agassi’s former best friend and business partner, Perry Rogers. “Where is it in the job description that you have to keep a high profile?” said Tony Godsick, Federer’s agent. “This is a sport where the players are stars. Adam’s personality is, I think, perfect. I’ve heard people say, ‘He needs to be out there more.’ To do what? He’s out there enough. He’s here to do things behind the scenes.” Helfant, raised in Brooklyn, is a globalist even if he speaks just one language. He is not, by his own admission, much of a tennis player or a true tennis insider, but he is a sports insider. An M.I.T. graduate, he went on to Harvard Law School and later worked in the legal department at the National Hockey League. He eventually moved to Nike, where he became vice president in the global sports marketing division. “Which at Nike is different from traditional marketing,” he said. “We were the group which decided which individuals, colleges, teams, governing bodies, football clubs, sports marketing assets, we should pursue, sign and have integrated into the Nike machine to leverage from a product perspective and from a marketing perspective.” As lead negotiator before leaving the company in 2007, Helfant was part of hammering out Nike deals with F.C. Barcelona and Tiger Woods, as well as with Maria Sharapova shortly after she won Wimbledon in 2004. Direct negotiations with Federer and Godsick were less fruitful, but Godsick, along with Sharapova’s agent, Max Eisenbud, still proposed Helfant’s name to the A.T.P. Board of Directors after De Villiers announced plans to resign. “He’s hard and he’s fair, and when Adam says something he means it,” Eisenbud said. Helfant has spent some of his first year managing the change and frustration that De Villiers helped generate, including a revamped calendar that has reshuffled the top tier of tour events and left some directors of smaller tournaments wondering where the stars have gone. But apart from Shanghai last month, the top eight events, now branded “the A.T.P. World Tour Masters 1000s,” have enjoyed strong fields, with the world’s top four men — Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray — hoarding the trophies. “The fact our top players are showing up consistently on our biggest stages and performing well, by that measure alone I think our system is working,” said Helfant, who is, nonetheless, well aware of the complaints about the length of the season. “If there had been an easy fix, someone would have made it by now.” Helfant is open to reopening the near-eternal debate. And with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic all on the Players Council, the stars are now more involved in governance than at any time since the A.T.P. was formed in 1990. “We are serious about a lot of different issues, and of course the biggest issue is the length of the season,” said Djokovic, who expressed support for Helfant. “I think people have seen many top players getting injured, and I think that’s the big reason something isn’t working. So something has to be changed, and we’ll try to do it as soon as we possibly can.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on November 21, 2009, in The International Herald Tribune.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/business/01proto.html?ref=nikeinc">Everybody in the Pool of Green Innovation<date>Published: October 31, 2009</date><text>A POPULAR children’s song has a refrain  “the more we get together the happier we’ll be”  that may sound like a simplistic formula for solving the complex challenges of climate change and sustainability. But if any area is ripe for sharing and collaboration among organizations, it’s green innovation. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image From Top: I.B.M., Dupont, Nike, I.B.M. Companies are sharing environmentally friendly innovations. They include an I.B.M. method to clean semiconductor wafers, top, and a DuPont process, right, that uses microorganisms to identify pollutants. Others are water-based shoe adhesives from Nike and a packing insert from I.B.M. Add to Portfolio International Business Machines Corporation DuPont Company Nike Inc Best Buy Company Incorporated Go to your Portfolio » “We all want to save the planet, and the problems are bigger than any one firm, sector or country,” says Dr. Sarah Slaughter, coordinator of the M.I.T. Sloan Sustainability Initiative. In that spirit, several major corporations have taken inspiration from the open-source software movement and are experimenting with forums for sharing environmentally friendly innovations and building communities around them. The first such effort, the Eco-Patent Commons, was started in January 2008 by I.B.M., Nokia, Pitney Bowes and Sony in collaboration with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The concept is straightforward: Companies pledge environmental patents to the commons, and anyone can use them  free. Many patented environmental technologies are not strategic, so sharing maximizes the social benefit without sacrificing competitive advantage, says Wayne Balta, vice president of corporate environmental affairs and product safety at I.B.M. For instance, I.B.M. contributed a recyclable cardboard packaging insert that requires less fossil fuel to create and transport than the foam inserts that are now commonly used. Other examples include a DuPont method for better detecting pollution in soil, air or water by using a microorganism that produces light when exposed to a pollutant. There are also methods from Xerox for removing toxic waste from contaminated groundwater, as well as a cleaning technique for semiconductor wafers from I.B.M. that uses ozone gas and eliminates chemical contaminants that result from other processes. By assembling these patents in one easily accessible location  anyone can search through them on the council’s Web site  the hope is to encourage their widespread adoption, particularly in the developing world. Since its start, the commons has grown to 100 patents from 31, with 11 companies now participating. Although there are no formal mechanisms for tracking who has used the commons, participating companies are sometimes contacted by users. For instance, Mr. Balta said that Yale had put into effect an I.B.M. method for decreasing the use of hazardous solvents in its quantum computing device research. The Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that previously developed licensing programs to help in sharing creative and scientific content, is also planning to branch out into the environmental arena. In collaboration with Nike and Best Buy, it plans to start a sharing initiative, the Green Xchange, in early 2010. The program will include both patented technologies and forums for continuing exchange of innovations such as Best Buy’s system for rating the sustainability of a supply chain. Companies that contribute patents to the Green Xchange will have the option of charging users a fixed annual licensing fee and can also restrict any licensing by rivals or for competitive use. In addition, even if no annual fee is charged, patent users must register so there is a record of who is using what technology. Though more complex than that of Eco-Patent Commons, the structure of Green Xchange will yield greater numbers of high-quality inventions, says John Wilbanks, GreenXchange coordinator and vice president for science at Creative Commons. “We don’t depend on altruism,” Mr. Wilbanks says. “This system helps the environment while enabling a firm to make money from patents in applications outside its core business.” For instance, Nike’s air-bag patent for cushioning shoes is crucial to its core shoe business, but may have environmental benefits in other industries  perhaps in prolonging the useful life of tires. Green Xchange could enable Nike to license the air-bag technology selectively to noncompeting companies. ACCORDING to Kelly Lauber, a global director in Nike’s Sustainable Business and Innovation Lab, sharing technology can have tremendous environmental impact. By sharing its water-based adhesive technology and working with footwear makers, Ms. Lauber estimates that average levels of environmentally harmful solvents used by Nike’s suppliers have decreased to less than 15 grams per pair of shoes from 350 in 1997. Perhaps the biggest upside of Green Xchange may come from the development of communities that collaborate in innovation and the exchange of ideas. To encourage that kind of interaction, Salesforce.com will provide a search engine, making it easy to find patents. And collaboration platforms from companies like 2degrees and nGenera should make it easy to identify companies with common interests. Despite the obvious advantages, sharing patents isn’t as easy as it might sound. “Numerous features of the intellectual property system, particularly the ability of companies to claim large swaths of technology through patents, play havoc with collaborative efforts,” says Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School. Henry Chesbrough, the executive director of the Center for Open Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says it is surprisingly hard to give away technologies. “If it is not done carefully,” he said, “the companies that use a donated technology might find themselves liable for infringement of another company’s patent.” Both the Eco-Patent Commons and the Green Xchange pose organizational challenges for participating companies. “Deciding which patents to pledge or license to a commons,” says Andrew King, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, “requires that the legal counsel, R.&amp; D. staff, business unit and corporate sustainability groups all work together, and most organizations just aren’t set up for that.” Weaving corporate togetherness, it seems, isn’t so easy  though green innovations offer many more reasons to try. Mary Tripsas is an associate professor in the entrepreneurial management unit at the Harvard Business School.

ROUNDUP; Nike Denies Signing Vick To an Endorsement Deal<date>Published: October 2, 2009</date><text>In a signal that Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick still has a long way to go before attracting major endorsements, Nike on Thursday clarified reports that it had signed a contract with him, even as it acknowledged that it had agreed to give him free products. ''Nike does not have a contractual relationship with Michael Vick,'' KeJuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman, said in a statement. ''We have agreed to supply product to Michael Vick as we do a number of athletes who are not under contract with Nike.'' The company's statement came a day after news media outlets reported that an executive at Best, the agency that represents Vick, had announced news of a deal with Nike at a sports sponsorship meeting in New York. The Sports Business Journal quoted Vick's agent, Joel Segal, saying that Vick would receive shoes, gear and apparel from Nike, while declining to discuss terms. ''Mike has had a great relationship with Nike and is excited to be part of the Nike team again,'' Segal told The Sports Business Journal. Segal did not return calls for comment Thursday. Vick endorsed Nike from 2001, when he was the No. 1 overall pick in the N.F.L. draft, through 2007, after he was indicted on federal dogfighting charges. He served 18 months in prison and returned to football this season for the first time since 2006. Nike's denial of an endorsement deal indicates how far Vick still has to go to rebuild his reputation, said Bob Williams, the chief executive of Burns Sports and Entertainment and an expert on celebrity endorsements. ''More time needs to pass,'' he said. ''You want to be sure as an advertiser that Michael Vick is going to live by the new habits that he's created since leaving prison.'' Others questioned whether he would ever be able to attract major deals again. ''I don't see at a lot of options for him, endorsement-wise,'' said Bob Dorfman, the executive creative director of Baker Street Advertising and a sports marketing expert. Dorfman, who noted that Vick's performance was mediocre in his first game of the season Sunday, said advertisers were looking for proven winners in a recession. ''At this point, you could barely call him a B-level player. It just isn't worth it.'' Williams pointed out that Nike had provided Vick with free products, which could be construed as a low-level endorsement. ''Nike wants to maintain the relationship in case this is a great comeback story and he rehabilitates himself,'' Williams said. Dorfman and others were not so sure, saying it was more likely a sign of loyalty to one of their former stars. ''He was a fairly solid member of their roster, pre-dogfighting days, and did some very good advertising for them,'' Dorfman said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0DB1F38F932A35753C1A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">Nike Quits Board Of U.S. Chamber<date>Published: October 1, 2009</date><text>Nike announced Wednesday that it would resign from the board of the United States Chamber of Commerce, becoming the latest company to break with the group over climate policy. Nike said, however, that it would remain a member of the chamber, unlike three large utilities -- Pacific Gas and Electric, PNM Resources and Exelon -- which recently announced plans to pull out.

Donohue, the chamber's chief executive, said in a statement this week that the chamber ''continues to support strong federal legislation and a binding international agreement to reduce carbon emissions and address climate change.''</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E4D8123BF932A3575AC0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">Corrections<date>Published: September 1, 2009</date><text>An article in the special tennis section on Monday about the fashion marketing of Roger Federer and Nike misidentified the symbol used on designs by Lacoste, another company with deep ties to tennis.

When Roger Federer unveiled his monogram at Wimbledon in 2006, it was a gold crest embroidered on the breast pocket of the white blazer he wore to accept the trophy. From a distance, it might easily have been mistaken for a club’s insignia. And it did in fact proclaim his admission to a club, one with a membership of two: Federer had joined Tiger Woods as the only other Nike athlete to be marketed on the basis of his initials.

Straight Sets RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Straight Sets Blog » Men Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders Women Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders Enlarge This Image Clive Brunskill/Getty Images THE OUTFIT At the Wimbledon final this year, Roger Federers suit resembled a British Army uniform. By 2007, the filigreed scrollwork had morphed into stylized block capitals and had spread to his shoes. A year later, the new monogram turned up at Wimbledon, embroidered in gold on an ivory cardigan and framed by a shield, like a Swiss canton’s coat of arms. This summer, it’s back. It’s big  big enough to be legible in photographs. And it’s everywhere: on his shoes, on his belt tab, on his duffel, on his jackets, on the plastic bags his new rackets come in. Forget all the subtle functions a monogram used to perform  discreetly personalizing a gentleman’s wardrobe, helping the servants sort the shirts. What three years ago seemed a plausible, if affected, personal flourish on the part of an athlete whose style of dress and style of play had positioned him as the Fred Astaire of tennis  light on his feet, with a penchant for tuxedo black for night matches and a Rolex commercial in which he shows off his serve in a two-button suit  had somehow escalated into a master-of-all-he-surveys exercise in personal branding. Fans took note. Some took umbrage. Tennis bloggers had a field day, nicknaming him Monogram Man or Mr. Monogram or Monogram for short. No sooner had Federer defeated Andy Roddick in the 30th game of Wimbledon’s marathon fifth set than he put on a gold-monogrammed white warm-up jacket emblazoned with a “15” to commemorate his breaking Pete Sampras’s Grand Slam men’s victory record. That struck some viewers as tactless, at best, and worse, a shocking instance of gloating, a slap in Roddick’s face. Federer’s defenders argued that he was within his rights, like teams that win the Stanley Cup or the Super Bowl and are instantly provided with T-shirts and caps advertising their victory. Fair enough, although the aura of old-world politesse that surrounds tennis seems to set it apart from sports in which players routinely trash-talk and insult one another’s mothers. Federer later said that somebody handed him the jacket and he just put it on, and besides, he protested, he had worn a jacket with a “14” for his French Open victory and nobody seemed to care. Some fans speculated that the idea for the monogram had been his all along. Others insisted that Nike made him do it. “Well, I’m surprised to hear that, because I don’t have to wear anything or do anything anybody tells me,” Federer said during a recent interview in Switzerland. “I do everything myself. It’s really up to me. “ The idea for a monogram emerged from the logo that Mirka Vavrinec, now Federer’s wife, and her father developed for his fragrance, RF-Roger Federer, introduced in 2003. The result was a freehand squiggle. If you knew what you were looking at, you saw the R and the F; if you didn’t, you didn’t. (A three-letter monogram was apparently never an option because Federer has no middle name.) Federer liked the approach and suggested that Nike come up with a strategy along the same lines. “For me, it’s important that a fan can buy something that is related to me,” he said. “Like in soccer, you buy a shirt and it’s got somebody’s name on the back. That’s kind of a cool thing.” His intent was that a monogram would offer a connection as direct but not as literal as a team jersey. From their first, Ralph Lauren-like crest, Nike “evolved the concept and made it more relevant to performance products, very modern and very sleek,” said Janet Lucena, the design director for Nike global tennis apparel. Letters are laser-cut instead of embroidered, for a more contemporary look and a lighter weight. “They’ve eliminated the common element, the vertical stroke, so it’s only the horizontals that differentiate the two letters,” said Michael Bierut, a partner in the New York office of Pentagram, the international design consulting firm. “I think it’s a nice balancing act  the idea of tradition with this serif font and modernity with the missing parts of the letters, asking your mind’s eye to fill in what’s not there.” The Federer monogram, Bierut said, “is not particularly remarkable as a logo, but within its genre and the overall landscape of sports graphics, I think it’s quite distinctive.” “The ‘NY’ for the Yankees  that’s a monogram, too,” he continued. “But sports monograms are generally more forthright and blunt. The Federer monogram creates not a sports brand but a fashion brand.” The font  a slightly redrawn version of Bodoni, which with its cousin Didot has been the basis for logos for Vogue, Giorgio Armani and Louis Vuitton  is “a signifier of fashion at the high end,” Bierut said, adding, “With the sort of enigmatic way it’s been drawn, Federer’s monogram is partaking of the cues of high design.” No player on the men’s tour seems as intrigued by fashion as Federer, nor has any other player been so roundly criticized for his clothes. Case in point: his entrance for this year’s Wimbledon final, in a white suit that looked like the sort of uniform a British Army officer might have worn in India. “I thought the military jacket would be something completely different, something cool,” he said. “I knew it was going to be a bit more aggressive, either a love or hate thing. But that’s not bad. You can’t always be the nice guy, going through the middle, like, All right, I’m just wearing a cardigan again this year.” Then there was the gold. Gold, to match the Wimbledon trophy. Gold, the medal awarded to athletes who finish first. But also gold, the metal of unabashed fashionistas flaunting their money  an unfortunate choice for a multimillionaire with a Netjets commercial. 1 2 Next Page » Christopher Clarey contributed reporting from Feusisberg, Switzerland.

Straight Sets RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Straight Sets Blog » Men Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders Women Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders The process starts in the Nike Sports Research Lab, long before Federer ever laces up his signature shoe, the Lunarlite Vapor Tour. Federer asked for responsive shoes, and Nike provided him with Lunarlite foam, a light and resilient patented material. The foam is placed in the middle of the sole, along with a carbon-fiber shank that supports Federer’s arches. Nike also uses what it calls Flywire, which was first introduced during the 2008 Olympics in track spikes and borrows from suspension-bridge technology to stabilize the top part of Federer’s shoe and lock his foot in place. Nike also designs shoes for Rafael Nadal, Federer’s chief rival. The company focuses on power for Nadal and speed for Federer. A Nike representative explained the difference in an e-mail message: “Roger’s playing style consists of nimble footwork that is forefoot intensive, and a style of play that covers the entire court, while Rafa is a more explosive player with a more heel-focused game consisting of primarily lateral movements on the baseline.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on August 31, 2009, on page SPG3 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/media/20adco.html?ref=nikeinc">The Birth of ‘Just Do It’ and Other Magic Words<date>Correction: August 22, 2009Published: August 19, 2009</date><text>TO the list of great copy writers in advertising, add an unlikely name: Gary Gilmore. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia In order to view this feature, you must download the latest version of flash player here. Related ArtsBeat: Seeking the Truth in Advertising Movie Review | 'Art &amp; Copy': The Admen of the 70s: Bohemians Who Surf (August 21, 2009) Add to Portfolio Nike Inc Go to your Portfolio » Seventh Art Releasing At top, Jeff Goodby, of the firm that devised the Got Milk? campaign, and at center, an actors reaction to the question. At bottom, a scene from a Wheres the Beef? commercial for Wendys. Mr. Gilmore, the notorious spree-killer, uttered the words “Let’s do it” just before a firing squad executed him in Utah in 1977. Years later, the phrase became the inspiration for Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign. The episode might make you wonder about the genesis of some other offbeat ads over the years. Where does someone get the idea to write a jingle about Oscar Mayer wiener envy? And how exactly does one dream up a talking gecko selling car insurance? The revelation about the “Just Do It” slogan is one of many fly-on-the-wall anecdotes that the famous names of the advertising world share in a new documentary by the filmmaker Doug Pray called “Art &amp; Copy,” to be released in New York on Friday. The film takes some of advertising campaigns that are most indelibly seared into the American consciousness  “Got Milk?,” “I (Heart) NY,” “I Want My MTV,” to name a few  and examines their path from ad slogans to pop culture glory.  Liz Dolan, a former marketing chief at Nike, says in the film that the origins of “Just Do It” were not widely known or acknowledged. “That was not the version I heard when I arrived at Nike,” she said. “I’m sure they didn’t want anyone to really know.” Dan Wieden, who first realized that a slight tweaking of Mr. Gilmore’s last words might make a good slogan for athletic gear, said the resonance of “Just Do It” was completely inadvertent and unforeseen. “I like the ‘do it’ part of it,” Mr. Wieden, a co-founder of Wieden &amp; Kennedy, says in the film, recalling the moment it dawned on him to use the phrase. “None of us really paid that much attention. We thought, ‘Yeah. That’d work,’ ” he says, adding, “People started reading things into it much more than sport.” “Art &amp; Copy” not only examines how seminal campaigns were born, but also, in the case of “Got Milk” and others, how they almost died premature deaths. Jeff Goodby and Rich Silverstein of Goodby Silverstein &amp; Partners, the brains behind the milk ads and the Budweiser frogs, explain how both of those concepts almost never saw the light of day. In the case of the “Got Milk?” concept, people at Goodby, Silverstein thought it was lazy, not to mention grammatically incorrect. “It’s clunky. It’s not even English,” recalls Mr. Silverstein in the film, expressing his initial distaste for the idea. He later gleefully adds, “It worked!” Mr. Goodby tells how marketers at Anheuser Busch were ready to kill the frog campaign until August Busch III spoke up and said, “Those lizards are really funny.” The transcendent Wendy’s “Where’s the Beef?” ads were also initially written off and nearly killed a week before they were set to go on the air, says Cliff Freeman, the slogan’s creator. Mr. Pray, the film’s director, said part of his reason for doing the film was to shed light on the people behind ads that  for good or ill  have left a mark on American culture. “Whether we like it or not, they have shaped our culture to a huge degree. And nobody knows where they’re coming from,” Mr. Pray, a documentarian who has also directed commercials, said in a recent interview. “We know the captains of industry. We know the heads of G.M. But somehow that’s not true with advertising.” Shows like “Mad Men” on AMC and movies like “The Hucksters” are probably the closest most Americans have in the way of exposure to advertising executives. Some of the subjects interviewed or examined in Mr. Pray’s film  William Bernbach, George Lois, Mary Wells Lawrence  are the original mad men and women who shaped the era the television show depicts.  The characters in Mr. Pray’s film, however, are a far cry from the martini-swilling hedonists portrayed on AMC. “I don’t think anyone could confuse me with those guys on the ‘Mad Men’ show,” Mr. Lois said in a recent interview, using a more colorful word to describe the characters. The advertising world in New York in the 1960s, he said, “was intelligent. It was sharp. It was irascible. It was thrilling. It was cultural provocatism.” “Art &amp; Copy,” Mr. Lois added, is a nostalgic look back to a time when advertising had more cultural significance. “Back then, there was this driving need, this passion. It was like a crusade. Everybody knew something important was happening. We were changing the culture of America.” Mr. Pray said that the true believer, change-the-world outlook that Mr. Lois and others espoused about advertising initially escaped him. “I never really looked at it like that. I always saw it as just commerce,” he said. But by examining how resonant ads were made and seeing firsthand their cultural impact, Mr. Pray said he could appreciate them as more than just a way to move merchandise. “There’s a beauty to things like ‘Got Milk?’ or ‘Just Do It’ or ‘Where’s the Beef?’  this incredibly simple writing that seems to kind of say more,” he said. “They seem to work on some kind of a different level that has nothing to do with the product.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 22, 2009 The Advertising column on Thursday, about a new documentary on the advertising world, misspelled the surname of the filmmaker in one reference in some editions.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Basketball Hall of Fame An exhibit about Michael Jordan at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was designed, installed and paid for by a division of Nike. N.B.A. Live Scoreboard Teams | Player Stats Knicks Schedule/Results Roster | Player Stats Nets Schedule/Results Roster | Player Stats But “Becoming Legendary: The Story of Michael Jordan,” which recently opened at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in advance of Jordan’s induction on Sept. 11, is a soulless exercise in corporate worship that was designed, installed, written, curated and paid for by the Jordan Brand, a division of Nike. When baseball players are inducted into their hall of fame, they often lend artifacts of their time. Jordan did not. Those six Chicago Bulls championship rings encased in plexiglass? He doesn’t own any of them. The wall of Air Jordans that looks like a display at Foot Locker? Jordan didn’t soar in any of them. A short video of Jordan’s feats, accompanied by his reciting basketball-oriented descriptions of “What Is Love?” Well, that was a long Nike video from a few years ago that is easy to summon on YouTube. Not a jersey, a ball or a sneaker came straight from Jordan. “I was hopeful that the vault would be opened,” said Matt Zeysing, the hall’s historian and archivist, who is an exuberant fan of an exhibit that he said had already attracted additional visitors. “It would have made it more urgent for people to come to see,” he added. Nearly everything in the exhibit, save for a few of the hall’s things, comes from the Jordan Brand archive. The hall had editorial control over the final product, but didn’t seem to have exercised too much of it. Reggie Saunders, the director of influencer marketing at the Jordan Brand, said that Jordan and the company agreed that the artifacts from the corporate archive “were plentiful and enriching for the exhibit.” Walking around the exhibit, you never feel free of Nike’s vise. The theater-in-the-round, covered by a huge wraparound photograph of Jordan, offers a message from the Jordan Brand congratulating him on his induction. The video inside is a commercial. The written narrative above the sneakers (no pairs, just singles) quotes Jordan about not wanting to sign with Nike, then getting far more involved than the shoe company could imagine. But Jordan’s penchant for flight, part of his worldwide appeal, is unexamined. It is not unusual for museums to receive corporate or foundation support for exhibits. Ernst &amp; Young helped to underwrite the National Baseball Hall of Fame’s seven-year, 15-museum “Baseball as America” tour. The recent Francis Bacon exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art had Bank of America as a primary sponsor. But Harold Holzer, a spokesman for the Metropolitan, said that corporations must understand the difference between financial support and editorial input. “The line between curatorial imperative and sponsorship is impregnable,” he said. That line is looser, at least for the Jordan exhibit, at the basketball hall. The seven-year-old building exudes a noisy, Fan Fest-like atmosphere, with interactive displays and a basketball court on its lower floor. The museum dutifully honors its professional and college eminences, and has plenty of historic goodies. But it lacks the shrine-like, reverential, artifact-dense sensibility of the baseball hall by design. “We’re a lot more upbeat,” Zeysing said of the basketball hall. John Doleva, president of the hall, said he had no concerns about a corporation synonymous with Jordan bankrolling and installing an exhibit that the hall could not afford. Nike denied a report that the exhibit cost $250,000. Doleva wrote in an e-mail message that the tie between Jordan and Nike “is unique in my mind; it transcends a typical player/company relationship.” He said the Jordan Brand “wanted to honor Michael” and “we were pleased to get a well-designed exhibit.” Nike is certainly a major part of the Jordan story. No exhibit, wherever it might be, should undersell Jordan’s towering place at the intersection of sports and commerce. He changed everything. But the straight-out-of-Oregon exhibit feels so much less spectacular than its subject. The timeline of his 46 years is a basic, unilluminating recapitulation, with Nike as his co-star. The display cites the importance of Jordan’s signing with Nike; his TV ads with Spike Lee (“a ground-breaking moment in American culture”); notes the creation of the Jordan Brand and the introduction of the brand’s Jumpman logo; and shows the original Air Jordan I, whose design was rejected by the N.B.A. There are also nods to Jordan’s “Be Like Mike” Gatorade campaign and his appearance on the Wheaties box. There are events that a more independent designer might have chronicled: Jordan’s history with gambling and his mixed success as a team executive  the owner Abe Pollin’s firing of him as the Washington Wizards’ president of basketball operations is not noted but his clearing the team’s salary cap is. His place on the 1992 Dream Team at the Summer Olympics in Barcelona is recalled with a team-signed basketball but not by resurrecting the controversy about his covering up the Reebok logo on the warm-up suit he wore to accept a gold medal, a step back from his threat not to appear at all in a rival’s togs. The exhibit, then, is Nike’s story. And for the next year it’s the basketball hall of fame’s.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Follow the Clothing Script Related Shoes Designed to Improve Your Style, but Also to Improve Your Game (July 13, 2009) Off to Practice Before a Round? Think Again (July 13, 2009) Injury Rules of Thumb, and Back and Fingers (July 13, 2009) But there is one thing about Woods at the 138th British Open that has been set in stone for more than a year: the color and design of his shirt, pants and hat. For Thursday’s first round, his shirt will be navy and striped. It will be a bright coral color Friday and white with a stripe Saturday. And Sunday, Woods will wear a new, textured red argyle shirt with black pants. Golf is notoriously fickle, yet golf apparel manufacturers leave no marketing opportunity to chance. What Woods wears each day at every major championship this year has been scripted for him by his sponsor Nike since last summer. To ensure that retailers have a new design or color modeled by Woods on their shelves this weekend, Nike had its first meetings about Woods’s 2009 British Open wardrobe 17 months ago. It is the same for almost all the top golfers. No one knows what score Sergio García will shoot during Saturday’s third round at Turnberry in Scotland, but he will undoubtedly wear white pants and a blue shirt with a white piping stripe, according to the clothing script provided to him by his sponsor Adidas Golf. Kenny Perry will wear a navy plaid print shirt and light khaki pants. The reigning United States Open champion, Lucas Glover, will wear a bright yellow Nike shirt with gray pants. Top athletes in most sports wear uniforms, so orchestrating their attire to maximize sales is not an option. But in individual sports like golf and tennis, the playing fields of major championships are akin to a fashion week runway, only better. The winner in golf could be on television throughout the world for five consecutive hours. His face and clothes will appear on Web sites and in newspapers, and his winning outfit could surface again a month or a year later on magazine covers. “A single shirt worn by one of our athletes on a Sunday afternoon winning a tournament can raise sales 10 percent,” said Tiss Dahan, the senior director of global apparel at Adidas Golf. “We see the influx online, and our customer service phone line will get the calls from retailers who are reacting to requests from consumers. You get somebody playing well in clothes that look good, it really moves the needle for apparel.” No trade organization tracks golf apparel sales. Organizations that follow equipment sales estimate that market to be in the $4 billion to $5 billion range, and the apparel marketplace is widely evaluated as comparable, if not bigger. Golf Datatech, a Florida company that conducts research on eight golf product categories, intends to distribute its first retail apparel report this fall. Clothing manufacturers prepare wardrobes primarily for top-ranked players and only during the four major championships: the British Open, the United States Open, the Masters and the P.G.A. Championship. The history of this planning dates to the 1980s, though it was not nearly as structured. “Once upon a time, the pros were just happy to get a box of free clothes,” said Eddie Fadel, the vice president of Ashworth Golf. “But you had no control over how they would wear them or when. Then people started to realize they could involve the entire marketing, production and merchandising chain and make the most of the national exposure.” An explosive increase in the sponsorship dollars paid to professional golfers no doubt had an effect as well. Woods has been under contract to Nike since 1996, and the company has paid him nearly a quarter billion dollars. His contract is for more than clothing; Woods uses Nike golf clubs and balls. But he wears Nike apparel in most public appearances, including advertising for other sponsors. The scripting process begins for most companies with a design meeting about a year and a half before an event. New looks in stripes, plaids and prints are examined, as well as the technology of materials, like moisture-wicking fabrics. A color palette is chosen and a decision made on how the basic clothes will work with vests or pullovers. Woods meets with Nike’s apparel team three to four times a year. In the last of those meetings, he is shown prototype garments for his approval or rejection. “Tiger won’t wear white pants, for example,” said Doug Reed, Nike’s global director of golf apparel and accessories. “And he won’t wear green pants. One year, we proposed he wear a dark green shirt on a Saturday at the P.G.A. Championship. Tiger took one look at it and said: ‘The P.G.A. is in Oklahoma in August. There’s no way. I’m not wearing a dark shirt in that heat.’ So we took it out of the script.” Various pros have their own preferences. For a long time, Mike Weir would wear only black shoes. Anthony Kim likes to be daring  on Friday, for example, he is wearing blue plaid pants. Justin Leonard tends to be more conservative  he will wear solid black pants on Friday. And, of course, no two players should ever arrive at the course in the same outfit. A few years ago at the Masters, there was even consternation on the first tee when Phil Mickelson’s caddie arrived in the same shirt as the golfer Charles Howell III, who was playing in Mickelson’s group. Mickelson does not have a clothing contract this year, making him one of the few elite golfers to dress himself, which he does with the help of a London tailor. The companies script clothing for women as well, although Dahan said women’s golf clothing sales represent only 30 percent of Adidas Golf’s apparel business. The men sometimes accidentally go off the script or decide to wear a lucky hat or shoes from the day before. Then there is rain, which can throw off the best-laid plans. “We had that at Bethpage,” said Dahan, referring to the soaked site of this year’s United States Open. “But we do script for beyond the base layer. It’s a chance to show our training tops and technical outerwear.” When it all works as planned, company executives sit back at home and root for their clothes. “When someone has the lead and you see him on TV walking up to the final green, you can’t help but think back to a year ago when you first showed them that shirt and pants,” Reed said. “It’s a thrill when somebody wins wearing your stuff.” With some variations, Woods always wears red on Sunday. “We’ve tried shades of red that are a little more pink or more raspberry,” Reed said. “We go with stripes and patterns. We offer alternatives, and people notice. When Tiger debuts a new red shirt, it sells. Because let’s face it, everyone wants to play golf like Tiger.” More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on July 13, 2009, on page A1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/sports/cycling/01armstrong.html?ref=nikeinc">Once Again, Tour Could Define Armstrong<date>Published: June 30, 2009</date><text>After Lance Armstrong won the Nevada City Classic cycling race recently and rushed off without the trophy, race officials figured he would never have second thoughts about leaving it behind.

He will begin his quest for his eighth victory in the Tour de France on Saturday. “The guy’s won the Tour de France seven times, so we were thinking, why would he ever want the trophy from our little race?” said Duane Strawser, who directs the 49-year-old event held in California. “But wouldn’t you know it, the phone rang.” An Armstrong representative called and asked that the trophy be sent to his home in Texas. That was when the significance of it dawned on Strawser. “Of course, he would want the trophy,” Strawser said last week. “It’s evidence of his success since his comeback.” In September, Armstrong emerged from three and a half years of retirement, announcing that he would try to win his eighth Tour de France, a race that begins Saturday in Monaco. Aside from the winner’s trophy for the Nevada City Classic  his first win since the 2005 Tour  little has gone as expected for Armstrong in the reprise of his career. He broke his right collarbone in March, causing a major hiccup in his training. His team, Astana, has had financial problems and nearly lost its racing license. A protest he led at the Giro d’Italia over course conditions was met with harsh comments from fans and the race’s director, prompting Armstrong to stop talking to reporters for the final two weeks of the event. The personalized antidoping program he said would be led by the prominent scientist Don Catlin  which was to be the most extensive in sports history  fizzled out before it started. And an incident with French drug testers who knocked on his door threatened his eligibility for the Tour de France, his signature event. Although many Armstrong-watchers consider the philanthropic element of his comeback to be a success  a main thrust of his return was to raise awareness and funding for the battle against cancer  his competitive success is likely to be defined by his performance over the next three weeks. “I wouldn’t say that I’m not going for the victory,” Armstrong said in a phone interview on Sunday from France, where he was scouting several of the Tour’s Alpine stages. “I will say, full disclaimer, that it’s not been as easy as I thought. I think it’s also fair to say that I’m not as confident in winning as I was in other years.” The biggest obstacle before Armstrong, 37, may be his teammate and the race favorite, the 26-year-old Alberto Contador. “The trick is trying to be a responsible teammate and co-leader and understand that Alberto could not just be stronger, but could be a lot stronger,” Armstrong said of Contador, who won the 2007 Tour as well as last year’s Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España. Armstrong provided a few reasons, just in case Contador’s superiority turns out to be true. He said that his body had needed time to get back in the swing of serious cycling, and that his age and a midseason crash had slowed him. Lately, though, his training performances have shown him to be as fit as he used to be, Armstrong said. Still, he is heading into this Tour with a different state of mind. “I don’t feel the same sense of fear that I’ve felt before,” he said, referring to a fear of failure that fueled his drive to win. “Maybe that’s not ideal for me, but I’m comfortable with my record from before. I think I’ve proven my natural talents in 2009.” To start the year, Armstrong raced in Australia’s Tour Down Under and finished 29th. Then he was seventh at the Tour of California, riding in support of his teammate Levi Leipheimer, who went on to win. About five weeks after breaking his right collarbone, Armstrong competed in the Giro d’Italia, a grueling three-week race that began in Venice and ended in Rome. After starting slowly, he improved day by day to finish 12th. Phil Liggett, the longtime cycling race announcer, said in a teleconference Monday that Armstrong proved by the end of the Giro that he was “probably one of the best riders in the race.” Liggett added, “I think the riders are scared of Lance right now.” David Millar, a friend of Armstrong’s who rides for the Garmin-Slipstream team, said Armstrong could intimidate his competition, no matter his age or fitness level. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Sports » A version of this article appeared in print on July 1, 2009, on page B11 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/business/25nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike Reports Drop in Global Orders<date>Published: June 24, 2009</date><text>Nike reported a worse-than-expected global decline in forward orders, sending its shares down 4.6 percent. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Nike Inc Go to your Portfolio » Orders through November fell 12 percent from last year, or 5 percent excluding currency changes. Nike, the athletic shoe and clothing company, has been shedding 5 percent of its workers worldwide to reduce costs, but weak demand and currency fluctuations have hurt results. The company said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 31, was $341.4 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with $490.5 million, or 98 cents a share, a year ago. The results included a $144.5 million after-tax charge, or 29 cents a share, related to the job cuts and factory consolidation. Excluding those charges, Nike earned 99 cents a share; analysts had expected 96 cents. Revenue slid 7 percent in the quarter, to $4.7 billion. In forward orders by region, the Europe, Middle East and Africa unit had the greatest decline of 24 percent, while American future orders fell 4 percent. Shares of Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., fell as low as $50.58 in after-hours trading, after closing at $53.02, down 52 cents.

But besides the counterfeit Ralph Lauren shirts, Coach purses and other items found in rented storage spaces inside the warehouse, there were 17 pairs of fake Nike sneakers that bore not only the company’s swoosh logo, but also somber images of President Obama wearing a suit and tie. “It’s frankly just disrespectful to have the president of the United States depicted on these sneakers,” said District Attorney Charles J. Hynes, who held a news conference at the Stop and Store warehouse Friday morning. “Just absolutely disgraceful.” Mr. Hynes said arrests were made of six people who were involved in a counterfeiting ring that operated out of the storage warehouse. The authorities also confiscated $20 million worth of counterfeit merchandise from 118 rented spaces inside the warehouse. In addition to a likeness of the president, the fake Nike sneakers bore a round logo used by the Obama campaign as well as the words “change” and “yes we can.” Mr. Hynes said an undercover investigator working for his office rented a space a year ago at the storage building, on 63rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, posing as a dealer in counterfeit goods. Eventually that investigator was able to penetrate the ring, which was operating out of spaces in the same building. Officers from the State Police and the Waterfront Commission participated in the investigation. The fake items were made in China, Mr. Hynes said, and distributed from the warehouse, which he described as “a citywide hub” that provided bulk merchandise to retailers. Kai Fong Chen, 39, and Min Min Zheng, 24, were charged with second-degree trademark counterfeiting, a felony. Four other people were charged with counterfeiting misdemeanors. A table near Mr. Hynes was heaped with items that had been seized. There were knockoff Dooney &amp; Bourke wallets and T-shirts bearing tattoo designs. A pair of fake True Religion designer jeans, replete with a patch showing an image of a Buddha-like figure strumming a guitar, sat near a bright blue velour warm-up jacket bearing the Liberty Bell logo of the Philadelphia 76ers. There were foam baseball caps emblazoned with rhinestones and slogans like “eternal love,” and a pair of gold-striped black pants. A tour of some of the storage areas  ranging from about 5 feet by 5 feet in size to 10 feet by 30  revealed spaces where black plastic trash bags containing fake Gucci and Prada handbags were crammed onto floor-to-ceiling metal shelves. Other storage spaces were arranged more like showrooms, with luggage hanging from walls or sneakers arranged in careful rows atop cardboard boxes. Bits of metal locks, broken during a raid, were scattered on the cement floor. Mr. Hynes said the investigation into the counterfeit ring was continuing and would not be limited to the distributors. He said his office had seized business ledgers kept at the warehouse and warned that those who purchased the counterfeit goods there would not escape scrutiny. “This time we have books and records,” he said. “The people who have been dealing with this crowd are going to be at risk as well.” More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on April 25, 2009, on page A17 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/18nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Overseas Sales Give Nike a Lift in Quarter<date>Published: December 17, 2008</date><text>BEAVERTON, Ore.  The shoe and apparel company Nike said its profit grew 9 percent in the second quarter as strong sales overseas offset weak domestic sales. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Nike Inc Go to your Portfolio » The company said Wednesday that its net income rose to $391 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with net income of $359.4 million, or 71 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. The company said its revenue grew 6 percent, to $4.6 billion from $4.3 billion. Changes in currency exchange rates increased revenue by 1 percentage point for the quarter. Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, said the results demonstrate the strength of the brand. He said the current state of the industry and the world offer opportunities for Nike to become a stronger leader. The company had strong sales growth in Asia and other foreign markets. Revenue in Asia jumped 22 percent for the quarter. But domestic sales were weak. Total revenue in the United States decreased 1 percent, with significant drops in equipment sales. The company’s future orders, which are product scheduled to be delivered between December and April, fell 1 percent lower than such orders reported for the same period last year. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, reported orders grew 6 percent. Stock in Nike, which is based in Beaverton, rose $1, to $50.64 a share.

With a time of 2 hours 55 minutes 11 seconds, she had comfortably beaten her personal best. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Béatrice de Géa for The New York Times Arien OConnell had the top time in the Nike Womens Marathon despite not running in the elite field. As it turned out, she had also beaten every other runner. Still, she was not initially declared the winner because she had not run in the 19-woman elite field, starting instead 20 minutes later with the 20,000 other runners in the main pack. The title went to Nora Colligan, who ran about 11 minutes slower. In a reversal, race organizers said Wednesday morning that O’Connell and Colligan would both be considered winners of the marathon. Though there was no prize money awarded in the race, both will have first-place trophies. “She shattered her previous time and achieved an amazing accomplishment,” Nike said in a statement, later adding that, “Because of their earlier start time, the runners in the elite group had no knowledge of the outstanding race Arien was running and could not adjust their strategies accordingly.” Nike also announced that it would break with traditional standards and eliminate the elite running group from future Nike women’s marathons. “Next year, all runners will run in the same group and all will be eligible to win,” the statement said. O’Connell, 24, a fifth-grade teacher in Brooklyn, learned of the decision about noon on Wednesday. She is a graduate of Columbia University and rediscovered her high school passion for running in her three years since college. Before being informed that the result had been adjusted, she explained that she had not applied to start with the elites simply because she thought that the field would be stronger. “I was running 3:07 at the time,” she said Wednesday. “I assumed that the kind of people who were going to be there were running like 2:35 marathons.” Once she heard of the decision, O’Connell said she was pleased, although not entirely surprised. “I think there were a lot of things in this race that were not clarified in terms of what it meant to be elite,” she said. “I do think that what happened in this situation was fair. I had a great race and I ran faster than someone who had a 3:06.” A similar issue arose at the Chicago Marathon two weeks ago, when Wesley Korir of Kenya finished fourth, despite starting five minutes after the elite runners. Like O’Connell, his time was clear because of the electronic timing chips that are worn on each runner’s shoe. And, like O’Connell, his chip time was different from what is known as the gun time, measured from the moment of the starting signal to the instant the runner crosses the line, since he ran well behind the elites with the main pack. Ultimately, Korir was not awarded the fourth-place prize money, but he did receive an undisclosed bonus, which was “simply a recognition of an outstanding performance by a runner not in our elite field,” the Chicago Marathon spokeswoman Marianne Caponi told The Chicago Sun-Times on Tuesday. The Web site of track and field’s world governing body, IAAF.com, explained after Chicago that I.A.A.F. and USA Track and Field rules “state that only the gun time can be used to determine order of finish for awards, such as prize money, as is given out to the top finishers in many road races.” The rule is designed to preserve the impact of strategy, particularly with respect to pacing, since runners can make adjustments during the race if they know precisely where they are relative to their rivals. But O’Connell does not especially believe she drew an unfair advantage from sitting well behind the leaders. “I do think having people around you really drives competition more, so it may have contributed somewhat to the strategy,” she said. “But I think that looking at the times, people were pretty separated even in the elite group.” Nike’s decision to do away with elite starts altogether could affect strategy even further by forcing top runners to handle somewhat more crowded early stages. Those ripples might even spread to New York as early as next summer, because the New York City Half-Marathon, which annually draws about 10,000 competitors and a high-profile elite field, is co-hosted by Nike and the New York Road Runners. It is unclear whether Nike will bring about any change in that race.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Microsoft Corp Hewlett-Packard Co Nike Inc Go to your Portfolio » Microsoft said it would buy back $40 billion of its shares and raise its quarterly dividend by 2 cents, to 13 cents a share. Hewlett-Packard will repurchase $8 billion in shares, and Nike said it would buy back $5 billion. Repurchasing shares allows companies to reduce the number of shares available to the public. This causes the company’s earnings-per-share ratio, a common metric for financial performance, to rise, making the company appear more attractive. Buying back shares uses cash that could otherwise be invested in new products, innovation, marketing or other parts of the company meant to increase revenue. But it often leads to a rise in stock prices, which puts more money in the pocket of shareholders and company employees and executives whose compensation includes stock options. Stock prices, however, do not always increase. Both Hewlett and Nike are in the midst of a previous round of stock buybacks; at the end of July, Hewlett still had $3 billion left in a repurchasing plan announced in November 2007. During that period, the company’s stock lost about 13 percent of its value. Hewlett’s shares fell an additional 2.3 percent on Monday, to $47.16, amid a broad sell-off. Shares of Nike, which has $900 million remaining on a buyback plan, dropped 0.9 percent, to $63.15. “Companies may buy back stock if they think their stock is accessibly cheap and they see some bright new horizon,” said Bruce Bittles, the chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird &amp; Company. But, as is usually the case in the world of business, the motivations are not necessarily transparent. “They can also buy back stock if they’ve got nothing else to do with their money,” Mr. Bittles said. “If they’re going to put their money in Treasury bills earning zero, they might as well buy back their stocks.” Mr. Bittles was referring to the low yields on government notes, which plummeted last week amid the turmoil in the financial markets. Some investors, frightened about volatility, have preferred to put their money into government notes that yielded virtually no return rather than risk stocks. Microsoft’s buyback plan briefly buoyed the stock market as investors took the move as a positive sign for prospects of the technology sector. The company recently completed a previous $40 billion repurchase plan. The company’s stock rose 1 percent, to $25.40, down 28.7 percent since the start of the year. The company may believe its stock is undervalued, said Andy Miedler, an analyst at Edward Jones. “They feel their shares are depressed at these prices,” said Mr. Miedler, who has a buy rating on Microsoft. Claire Armstrong Gallacher, an analyst at Caris &amp; Company in San Francisco, said that Nike might have initiated the program to show potential investors that it had excess cash on hand, despite the economic downturn. “It’s a nice way to remind investors that when you’re looking at this crazy market, in crazy times, they are a company that is pretty solidly positioned,” said Ms. Gallacher, who has a buy rating on Nike.

They form a seemingly haphazard collection  some country names are written in English, some in other languages. But they are actually part of a grand design, regulated by a phone-book-sized set of International Olympic Committee rules. Skip to next paragraph Interactive Schedule Olympics Tracker Follow the schedules of your favorite sports, day by day and event by event. Times journalists and special contributors explore the Olympics in Beijing and on the Web from every angle  the politics, the culture and the competition. The Rings RSS Feed | Atom Go to the Rings Blog » Olympics 2008Go to Complete Coverage » Because country names on the front must be written in the Latin alphabet, countries like China compensate by using Chinese characters on the back. Flags and sponsor logos must be in a certain place and a certain size. The colors are regulated. And, perhaps surprisingly, teams from 44 countries turn to the same place for designs: Nike, the quintessential American company, has gradually taken on the role of making many countries feel special. “We start by talking to the athletes on what it means to represent your country,” said Scott Williams, Nike’s Olympic design director of global apparel. “That’s something that’s incredibly important to us. We take that as sort of our beginning point. There’s a tremendous amount of country pride that comes with representing those countries.” Germany, for example, used to use the English word on the front of its uniforms but switched for these Games to Deutschland: Latin alphabet, German word. Nike designed Germany’s switch. The company also outfits all of the American teams as the United States Olympic Committee’s official sponsor. It also made the uniforms for 23 of China’s 26 sports and outfits other countries, from Russia to Qatar. In China, a company founded by the Olympic gymnast Li Ning is trying to make inroads into the Olympic market and catch up with Nike and Adidas, the two biggest outfitters. Li Ning Company Ltd., snagged deals to outfit a handful of teams, including Spain and Sweden. It was a big business story in China when Li was hoisted to the Olympic stadium roof to light the caldron at the opening ceremony. Stock in his company jumped 5 percent on the Hong Kong exchange the next business day. The key to Olympic uniform regulations is making every country as identifiable as possible. Using the Latin alphabet is a nod to being the most recognizable to the most people, and the television rights that have earned the I.O.C. the most money are those in the United States. The official Olympic languages are English and French. The use of French is in deference to the man who revived the modern Olympics, Baron de Coubertin, but it has become largely ceremonial. English is the language of Olympic business. But in designing the uniforms, Williams said, Nike keeps more in mind than commerce. The company’s interviews with athletes revealed what makes uniforms inspiring. The design on the back of the Chinese uniforms is a motif taken from the terra cotta warriors. The back of the United States uniforms was designed by tattoo artists given the job of representing American ideals. “When we talked to our track and field athletes from the U.S.A., they said they put on these uniforms and feel like a superhero,” Williams said. “That was a great insight to extract. The creative vision of all of our apparel was the vision of a superhero.” The athletes are given several choices of styles, and one of the United States track and field choices has a lighter blue stretch of fabric on the shoulders that can, indeed, look like a cape.

He’s also looking for fresh talent for a new label financed by a company new to the music industry. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Rob Loud Photography The English electronic duo Groove Armada, in Miami at the Bacardi B-Live event, is being promoted by Bacardi. Ethan Miller/Getty Images for Prive Jermaine Dupri is working with Procter &amp; Gamble. The new player? Procter &amp; Gamble. The consumer goods giant is part of a wave of companies getting into the music business to promote their own products, essentially becoming record labels themselves. Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, is joining Island Def Jam in a joint venture called Tag Records, a label that will sign and release albums by new hip-hop acts. It is named after a brand of body spray that P.&amp; G. acquired when it bought Gillette. And Mr. Dupri, a music-industry veteran and the longtime partner of the singer Janet Jackson, sounds quite pleased with his new gig. “I’ve never seen someone wanting to devote this much money to breaking new artists,” said Mr. Dupri, who will serve as president of Tag Records while keeping his position at Island Def Jam. “Nobody in the music business has the marketing budget that I have.” At a time when online file-sharing is rampant, record stores are closing and consumers are buying singles instead of albums, getting into the music business might seem like running into a burning building. But as record labels struggle to adjust to a harsh new digital reality, other companies are stepping up their involvement in music, going far beyond standard endorsement contracts and the use of songs in commercials. These companies  like Procter &amp; Gamble, Red Bull and Nike  are stepping outside of their core businesses to promote, finance and even distribute music themselves. A few months ago, Bacardi announced that it would help the English electronic music duo Groove Armada pay for and promote its next release. Caress, the body-care line owned by Unilever, commissioned the Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger to record a version of Duran Duran’s “Rio” that it gave away on its Web site to promote its “Brazilian body wash” product. The energy drink company Red Bull is starting a label that is expected to release music before the end of the year. And at least some of this music is credible: a hip-hop song that Nike released by Kanye West, Nas, Rakim and KRS-One was nominated for a Grammy Award for best rap performance by a duo or group. Unlike Starbucks, which got into the music business to sell CDs at its stores, these companies want to use music to promote products they already sell. “It’s not about money,” said Sarah Tinsley, a global marketing manager at Bacardi. “It’s a branding exercise.” Unlike the exclusive album deals that Wal-Mart is striking with groups like the Eagles, these companies are attracting artists at the height of their relevance. Two weeks ago, Converse released a single by a combination of artists that The Times of London called “a three-headed Frankenstein’s monster of coolness”: the Strokes singer Julian Casablancas, the producer Pharrell Williams and the R&amp;B performer Santogold. Offered as a free download on Converse’s Web site, the song received mostly favorable reviews from both blogs and newspapers. “Our instructions to them were to have fun, as though they were doing any song,” said Jon Cohen, co-founder of Cornerstone, a music marketing company that has set up music deals for Converse, Nike, Caress and Smirnoff. “It doesn’t matter where the music comes from as long as it’s great.” A decade ago, signing a record contract with a body spray company would have been unthinkable for most artists. But at a time when labels’ promotion budgets are declining, consumer brands can offer valuable exposure in print and television ads. Jeff Straughn, Island Def Jam’s vice president for strategic marketing, said that Tag might spend seven times as much promoting a release as a traditional label. “When I started in this business 10 years ago, it was hard to get an artist to stand in front of a sign with a logo on it,” said David Caruso, the co-founder of Acme, the agency that negotiated the deal between Island Def Jam and Tag. “Now brands are engaging their audiences with content.” But the brands walk a fine line by making sure that consumers are aware that they financed a song without having it simply seem like a commercial. “We wanted it to be like they were making their own record,” said Rob Stone, a Cornerstone co-founder, referring to the song that Kanye West, Nas and KRS-One made for Nike with a celebrated producer, Rick Rubin. “None of them had to mention the Air Force 1,” a Nike shoe. Instead, Cornerstone asked the artists to write a track about the theme of timelessness and promoted it like any other song, making a video, promoting it to radio and selling it on iTunes. (Nike’s profits went to the Force4Change Fund, a charity for youth leadership programs.) As it turned out, the song, “Better Than I’ve Ever Been,” does mention the sneakers as well as “Nike’s straight classic.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/sports/playmagazine/601business.html?ref=nikeinc">These Games Brought to You by . . .<date>Published: June 1, 2008</date><text>In Beijing this spring, I was halfway through a tour of the spacious new headquarters of Li-Ning, China’s leading athletic-wear company, when a poster stopped me short. Li-Ning’s offices, like those of every other sporting goods company, starting with Nike and Adidas, are dominated by huge advertisements of athletes who wear its shoes and clothes, including Shaquille O’Neal. Skip to next paragraph Oliver Munday The New York Times Sports Magazine Go to Complete Coverage » But in this, the year of the Beijing Summer Olympics, Shaq isn’t exactly the focus of attention around Li-Ning. Instead, most of the posters feature Olympians who have endorsement deals with the company, including the United States table tennis team and dozens of Chinese athletes who will be hurdling and diving and somersaulting in Li-Ning gear during the Games. And there was that poster of . . . well, I couldn’t say. It showed a dozen or so people, some middle-aged, some sporting small paunches, standing in a semi-circle, modeling yellow sports jackets with the Li-Ning logo. They sure weren’t Olympic athletes. “They are the famous broadcasters for CCTV-5,” my tour guide, a young Li-Ning executive, told me. He was talking about the sports channel of China Central Television, the country’s state-run network; the people in the poster will be broadcasting the Olympic Games. Almost giddily, my guide explained that the company had cut a deal with CCTV-5 to dress its sportscasters for the Games. In other words, whenever Chinese viewers watch the Games on TV, they will be unable to avoid Li-Ning’s logo. “Pretty clever, isn’t it?” my guide said, breaking into a smile. It is, indeed, given that Li-Ning is not an official Olympic sponsor. That means, according to the rules of the International Olympic Committee, the company is not authorized to link itself explicitly to the Olympics. But if Li-Ning has a ways to go before competing head-to-head with the big Western brands, clearly the company has learned a thing or two about “ambush marketing”: skirting the rules to steal rivals’ thunder. Adidas, for example, reportedly had to pay up to $100 million over four years for the right to use the logo of the Beijing Olympic Organizing Committee within China and Hong Kong. Adidas is also responsible for outfitting all officials, staff and volunteers at the Games and in the Olympic Village. Then there’s Nike, which has no affiliation with the Beijing organizing committee. As an official sponsor of the United States Olympic Committee, however, it can use the U.S.O.C. logo in its ads  but only in the United States. Nonetheless, Nike has deals with dozens of Olympic teams worldwide, including 22 of China’s 28 teams. It will be hard to turn on the TV during the Beijing Games, either in China or in the United States, and not see Nike uniforms and athletic shoes. The people who run the Olympics like to talk about how they protect their big sponsors. For instance, the organizers, in their attempt to ensure that sponsors get the best advertising spots, buy up all the billboard space in the host city. They also try to fight off ambush marketers as best they can. They even ask spectators to remove (or at least hide the logo of) clothing from non-Olympic sponsors. But let’s be honest here: if the real point of sponsorship is to use the Olympics to reach potential customers  of which China has a staggering 1.3 billion  it’s hard to see what Adidas gets for its $100 million (besides a black eye in the West for refusing to speak out on Tibet). Nike and Li-Ning will be every bit as ubiquitous as Adidas. So I can’t say I was surprised when I heard, during my recent trip to China, whispers from marketing experts that expressed what no one dares say out loud: Olympic sponsorships may not be worth it. Olympic sponsorships came of age when Peter Ueberroth exploited them to subsidize the Los Angeles Games in 1984. Pre-Ueberroth, Olympics cost the host city hundreds of millions of dollars, which was paid mostly by taxpayers. Post-Ueberroth, the Games often turned a profit. (The Los Angeles Olympic Committee ended up with a surplus of more than $225 million.) According to Ed Hula of Around the Rings, a Web site about the business of the Olympics, the Chinese will spend $3 billion to $4 billion to stage the Summer Games in Beijing; almost all of that money will come from fees for television rights and sponsorships. Michael Payne, a former marketing director of the I.O.C. and now a sports-marketing consultant, estimates that Olympic sponsors will pay around $2.5 billion for their various rights. 1 2 Next Page » Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The New York Times.

His name is Charles Barkley. It is not that Sir Charles is embarrassed by his commercial work, past and present: the famous “I Am Not a Role Model” ad for Nike; his battle against Godzilla; the opera buffa “Barkley of Seville”; and, most recently, the series of T-Mobile ads co-starring Dwyane Wade that seem to appear at least 90 times during any N.B.A. telecast. No, it’s that for Barkley, there is something unnerving about being confronted with his commercial self. “I try to always look away or something like that,” Barkley told me recently. “I don’t want anyone to think I’m an egomaniac.” Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image John Hendrix The New York Times Sports Magazine Go to Complete Coverage » While Barkley looks away, the sports fan watches intently. Our brains now contain the residue of 40 years’ worth of sports commercials, from Mean Joe Greene sipping a can of Coke to “I Am Tiger Woods.” It is a strange highlight reel. The power of the sports commercial is that it conveys the illusion of intimacy with an athlete. It was from a commercial that we learned that Michael Jordan was jolly; that LeBron James could inhabit multiple characters with the aplomb of Alec Guinness in “Kind Hearts and Coronets” (or at least Eddie Murphy in “The Nutty Professor”); that Peyton Manning was a hipster ironist. In the span of a 30-second ad, the gulf between athlete and fan seems to close, at least a bit. Against all evidence to the contrary, Charles and Michael and Peyton and LeBron begin to feel like our old pals. It’s this feeling that has transfixed me lately as I watch sports commercials  that they are vivid psychological profiles of the sports fan, the needy creature sitting on the couch in his throwback jersey. By studying the sports commercial, we can see all of our secret desires about athletes playing out. Bo knows football, as the Nike ad had it. But what Bo really knows is us. Funny thing about sports fans: The personality we want an athlete to have on the field is usually the opposite of the one we want him to have off it. I speak of Jordan’s brutal disregard for his opponents or Tiger Woods’s childlike self-focus  these traits are no fun in real life. Some of the most successful sports commercials take well-known jocks and cast them in a new light. Take Mean Joe Greene’s 1979 ad for Coca-Cola, which was tapped by an ESPN panel as one of the greatest sports commercials of all time. Greene is hobbling toward the locker room when a kid hands him an ice-cold Coke. A small kindness, you might think, but the sugary drink taps some hidden reservoir of generosity in Greene  and as music swells, he tosses the kid his jersey. We appreciate the gesture, because no one wants to think that Mean Joe might actually be mean off the field. Indeed, the athlete in the sports commercial is nearly always a humble jock. It is a strategy of self-deprecation, says John Osborn, the president and C.E.O. of the advertising firm BBDO New York, “to show there’s another side to someone who seems anything but self-deprecating.” The Miller Lite ads that began airing in 1973  those of “Tastes great! Less filling!” fame  made humility into an art form. Miller feared its good-old-boy base would reject Lite, a new product, as too effeminate, not worthy of being chugged and then crushed against the forehead. So the company imported some tough guys to poke fun at their manhood. Bubba Smith went to the opera; Bob Uecker found himself forcibly relocated to the upper deck; Billy Martin was fired, again. “Name me one of them that could act,” says Bob Giraldi, who directed Lite All-Stars in several dozen commercials. The jocks’ woodenness, of course, was actually part of the effect. An adman given an athlete to work with has a problem. Most sports stars don’t have a verbal persona; in some cases, we may never have heard them speak. (Go on, give me one thing Bo Jackson said that wasn’t in a Nike commercial.) An entire personality, then, must often be created from scratch. For the first several years of his career, Peyton Manning was rarely seen on TV except in the context of a game. As a result, there was not much to Peyton beyond his familiar scowl, like the expression of a man waiting impatiently in a barbershop. Now, with a dozen commercials under his belt, Manning comes across as a mensch. In a series of MasterCard ads, Manning takes psychotic fan behavior and turns it back on the fans, exhorting butchers to “Cut! That! Meat!” For Sprint’s N.F.L. Mobile, Manning wears a silly mustache and talks about “Peyton Manning” in the third person. Manning’s commercials suggest not only a sense of humor but spiritual depth: in a Sprint ad, Manning has a dream in which he runs through a hotel out of “The Shining,” confronts a rampaging defensive end and evil dolphins and finally comes face to face with his preadolescent self. “Meeting your younger self suggests a desire for the security of your childhood years,” says one online dream dictionary; Archie, I think maybe you and Peyton need to have a talk. No consideration of the sports-commercial canon would be complete without chewing over the ways in which Nike has burrowed into our brains. Nike’s founder, Phil Knight, was once heard to say, “I hate advertising,” but his company’s classic ads, produced by the firm Wieden &amp; Kennedy of Portland, Ore., were the work of an all-star team. Actor: Michael Jordan, signed in 1984 to a then-massive $2.5 million endorsement deal. Writer: Jim Riswold, an ingenious sloganeer responsible for such catchphrases as “Bo Knows” and “I Am Tiger Woods.” Directors: Joe Pytka and Spike Lee, who also acted alongside Jordan, playing his Mars Blackmon character from his film “She’s Gotta Have It.” A Nike spokesman once told Entertainment Weekly that Mars Blackmon  an Air Jordan-wearing bike messenger who maintained a worshipful attitude around his “main man”  was a mirror image of the sports fan watching at home. For what Mars seeks is what we seek: a clue to the source of Jordan’s talents (“Is it the shoes?”), or some small sign that 1 2 Next Page » Bryan Curtis is Plays media columnist.

He showed up at a Longhorn Aquatics practice last week with two bags containing an assortment of Speedo swimsuits, including the hotter-than-a-jalapeño LZR Racer, the uniform of choice for swimmers who have accounted for 36 of the 40 world records set this year. Aaron Peirsol, a two-time Olympic backstroker and a four-time medalist, was summoned from the pool by his coach, Eddie Reese, to meet with the Speedo man. He picked out an LZR Racer and disappeared into the locker room to try it on. He was followed by the breaststroker Brendan Hansen, who won three medals at the 2004 Olympics. At an Olympic news media summit in Chicago in April, Hansen had begged to differ with Mark Schubert, the United States national team director, who has said that anybody not wearing the LZR Racer would be at a distinct competitive disadvantage at the Olympic trials this summer in Omaha. “I’ve looked at the research done on both suits, I’ve done testing on both suits, and I don’t see a difference,” Hansen said, referring to the Speedo and Nike brands. He added that the designers of the Nike suits were responsible for the racing uniform worn by the cyclist Lance Armstrong. And yet there was Hansen on the deck last week in his blue Nike practice suit pondering which Speedo suit to try  he eschewed the LZR Racer for the Fastskin Pro Male Legging  and quipping that what he was doing felt like someone cheating on his wife. In fact, the word on the pool deck was that Nike had given its athletes permission to wear another manufacturer’s suit if there was one more conducive to fast times than Nike’s Swift or Swift Amp’d. “I respect them for saying that,” Peirsol said. This open marriage between Nike and its swimwear endorsers came as news to Dean Stoyer, the company’s United States media relations director. “That’s actually the first I’ve heard that specifically,” he said when reached by telephone Tuesday. “I know some of our athletes have been approached by other companies. I haven’t actually gotten word that they had tried anyone else’s suits.” Stoyer said swimmers were naturally curious creatures keen on testing the latest innovation that promised fast swims, be it sugar-pill-popping routines that were all the rage in the 1970s or, more recently, the space-age goggles and suits. “It is certainly not uncommon in swimming in general, particularly when there is buzz about something new,” Stoyer said. “It’s pretty common that other athletes will want to try on something new really to appease their curiosity.” But Stoyer said swimmers under contract to Nike were expected to wear its swimwear at the Olympic trials and the Olympics. “Speaking in general,” Stoyer said, “if you break the contract, we certainly would have to have a discussion.” More Articles in Sports »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/sports/othersports/07cricket.html?ref=nikeinc">Bright Lights and Big Money in India’s New Cricket League<date>Published: May 7, 2008</date><text>NAVI MUMBAI, India  With an infusion of bling, Bollywood and go-go boots, a new cricket league is trying to spin off India’s colonial inheritance into a money-making symbol of a brash, emerging nation. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ruth Fremson/The New York Times A new cricket league in India has enlivened a traditional game with laser shows, movie stars and cheerleaders. Whether the Indian Premier League, as it is called, will ultimately succeed in cultivating a loyal fan base at home, challenging cricket’s world order and globalizing the game of the former British Empire remains to be seen. Already, it has upturned many conventions of an erstwhile gentleman’s game, drawn corporate sponsorships from multinational firms selling everything from cellphones to real estate and, with salaries comparable to the English Premier League of soccer, lured some of the top names in international cricket, including players from India’s traditional rivals, like Australia and even Pakistan. The game itself is a fast and furious brand of cricket called Twenty20  referring to 20 overs per team  in which games are played in about three hours. In contrast to the leisurely, ritualistic five-day matches played by men in white, this form of cricket is a loud and powerful display of batsmanship geared to grab eyeballs on prime-time television, and sponsored by Adidas (and Nike and Reebok). “Less time, more fun,” was the verdict of Harshal Kini, 20, at a Sunday night match pitting the Mumbai Indians against the Deccan Chargers of Hyderabad. Renuka Tahiliani, 49, seated in the front row with her husband and their 14-year-old son, said, “It’s too hot to sit out here for the whole day.” Cricket is only part of the spectacle. The 10 matches played so far have featured laser shows and stilt walkers, American-style cheerleaders and plenty of Bollywood stars blowing kisses from the stands. It is a coming of age for both the business of sports in India and for Indian billionaires, who for the first time are staking their prestige on sports teams. The league’s most expensive franchise, at nearly $111.9 million, is the Mumbai Indians, fittingly owned by India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The flamboyant liquor baron Vijay Mallya picked up the Bangalore-based Royal Challengers for $111.6 million, and the actor Shah Rukh Khan is backing the Kolkata Knight Riders for $75.09 million. “It is cricket’s version of tabloid journalism,” said Rajdeep Sardesai, the son of a professional Indian cricketer and editor in chief of CNN-IBN, a news channel. “It is much more now about glamour and entertainment than about what happens between the players.” (He said he was not yet a fan, but said it was the only kind of cricket that appealed to his son, now 14.) By upending convention, the league has also invited its share of controversy. Cheerleaders, including the squad belonging to the N.F.L.’s Washington Redskins, whom Mallya imported for the opening match in mid-April, have been greeted by a mixture of enthusiasm and lewd comments from the stands, and indignation from politicians who have found them obscene and in contravention of Indian tradition. “We live in India, where womanhood is worshipped,” said Siddharam Mehetre, a politician in Maharashtra state, where Mumbai and Navi Mumbai are located, according to the Press Trust of India. Local police were on the lookout here at Sunday’s match to see if obscenity laws were being violated. But by then the cheerleaders for the Deccan Chargers, who had worn tartan miniskirts, fishnet stockings and halter tops, were covered in short-sleeve T-shirts and black tights. On the steamy coast of the Arabian Sea, the cheerleaders, who had come from Australia, were drenched in sweat. Later in the week, the Delhi Daredevils took their cheerleaders away altogether. Another embarrassment arose after Harbhajan Singh, the acting captain of the Mumbai Indians and notorious bad boy of Indian cricket, was accused of having slapped S. Sreesanth of Kings XI, who immediately began bawling.The league swiftly fined and barred Singh. One of the most striking things about the new cricket is how patriotism has been scrubbed out of a game. “Cricket has been the major vehicle for Indian nationalism, of a special and aggressive kind,” said Ramachandra Guha, a historian and cricket writer. At a recent night match here, the Mumbai Indians were defeated by the Deccan Chargers, but fans in the packed 55,000-seat stadium kept cheering  for the away team, no less, and its star batsman, Adam Gilchrist, an Australian. “We still don’t have our loyalties set yet,” said Dhwani Karania, a 21-year-old college student. “Whoever wins, it’s O.K.” Karim Premji, walking out of a corporate box with his wife and three children, said: “I just appreciate good cricket. Gilchrist was hitting good sixes. I was happy for him and his team.” Sneha Jadav, 20, was riled by the whole concept. “Brothers  brothers are fighting,” she said. “They have divided our team.” Jadav said she preferred the cricket that she had grown up watching, where nations play each other. India versus Pakistan, she said, is her favorite. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Sports »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/books/review/Nocera-t.html?ref=nikeinc">Foot Soldiers<date>Published: April 27, 2008</date><text>Are there any two more overused words in the book business than “changed” and “forever”?

Skip to next paragraph Christoph Nieman SNEAKER WARS The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and Puma and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sports. By Barbara Smit. Illustrated. 384 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95. Related First Chapter: Sneaker Wars (April 27, 2008) Barbara Smit’s fundamental claim in “Sneaker Wars” is that the multigenerational feud involving members of the German Dassler family “forever changed the business of sports.” She says in her introduction that the feud “shaped the modern sports business, giving rise to corruption and ever increasing financial stakes.” Well, at least this isn’t complete hyperbole. Adi and Rudolf Dassler were brothers, based in the town of Herzogenaurach, who founded a small shoe company in the 1920s called Gebrüder Dassler. Adi Dassler was the visionary shoemaker, tinkering in his workshop as he churned out soccer and running shoes that were both lighter and sturdier than anything that had come before. His older brother Rudolf was the company’s chief salesman. The brothers Dassler were aided immensely by Hitler’s emphasis on sports; by the time of the Berlin Olympics in 1936, German athletes of all ages and skills were wearing the Dasslers’ “boots,” as Smit calls them. But Adi especially also had an understanding of the importance of getting top athletes, the ones who generated the most excitement and publicity, to wear his sneakers. He didn’t pay any money for endorsements back then  nobody did  but he did work to get his shoes to the athletes who mattered. Early on, he befriended the German track-and-field coach  and wound up outfitting many notable German athletes. And during the Olympics, he even managed to get a pair of his sneakers to Hitler’s nemesis, Jesse Owens, who won three gold medals wearing shoes made by Adi Dassler. After the war, however, the Dasslers, who lived under the same roof but hadn’t gotten along in years, split up. The parting was acrimonious in the extreme  among many other things, Rudolf felt that his brother’s family had betrayed him to the Allies. So he moved across town and started a competing shoe company named Puma. Adi’s company became Adidas. Smit’s essential point is that the feud between the Puma and Adidas branches of the family, which lasted for several generations, gave rise to payoffs and endorsements and the fact that modern sports, both professional and amateur, are now drenched in money. Without question, both Rudolf’s and Adi’s executives worked hard to get their shoes worn by prominent athletes, especially at the Olympics. And they were paying to do so, handing envelopes of cash to athletes at a time when the Olympic movement was still trying to resist commercialization. Smit, who has written for The Financial Times and The Economist, quotes an American sprinter who participated in the Tokyo Olympics of 1964: “I remember  like in the James Bond or mystery movies. In Tokyo, a shoe agent goes into the bathroom and leaves an envelope under the stall, and I go into the stall after him.” But you can take a thesis like this only so far; the truth is almost always more complex than a book jacket suggests. It is plain that in many cases, the athletes themselves, bitter that they were not being paid for their Olympic toils, were playing Puma against Adidas, demanding cash from reluctant shoe marketers. What’s more, after 100 pages of “Sneaker Wars,” the Puma cousins have become bit players, overshadowed by Adidas, which had both better products and a stronger business. Indeed, what really drove the corruption of the Olympic movement was a very different Dassler family feud, the one between Adi and his son, Horst. This, in fact, is the crucial subplot of Smit’s book: Horst Dassler was sent to Alsace to set up a division of Adidas that was not supposed to sell beyond France. But he was a supremely ambitious man, not content to wait quietly for his turn, so he turned his corner of the company into a kind of secret empire that acted against the express wishes of his parents. He started shadow companies to hide certain product lines from them. He befriended all the top officials in sports, including those in charge of the Olympics. He knew how to wine and dine them  and how to bribe them. He understood, early on, that owning the rights to sports events could be a multimillion-dollar business. When he died in 1987, at the age of 51, the unraveling of his secrets almost brought Adidas down. There is also a second, and much larger, problem with Smit’s thesis. Hovering like a dark cloud over her narrative is a little running shoe company in Oregon started by Phil Knight, a man every bit as ambitious as Horst Dassler. That company, originally named Blue Ribbon Sports, is now known as Nike. Far more than Adidas or Puma, Nike helped transform sneakers into shoes that everybody, not just athletes, wore  and wore all the time. It understood marketing far better than its European rivals did, and eventually it overtook them. Even when Adidas bought Reebok a few years ago, the combined company was still smaller than Nike. As for the transformation of sports, few moments are more important, for better or worse, than Nike’s decision to sign up Michael Jordan as an endorser right out of college, pay him millions to wear its shoes  and put out a brand with his name on it that would one day cost kids more than $100 a pair. The line from that moment to the era of stars like LeBron James getting giant endorsement deals right out of high school is a straight one, and it seems hard to make the case that anything the Dasslers did changed the business of sports more profoundly. The last part of “Sneaker Wars” is a recounting of the financial troubles suffered by both Adidas and Puma  troubles due in part to their own insularity but also due to Nike, which took over markets almost at will. Both companies have since righted themselves, but Puma is unlikely to be a major force ever again, while Adidas is still playing catch-up against its American rival. Nike, meanwhile, remains a juggernaut, still changing the business of sports. Forever. Joe Nocera is a business columnist for The Times.

Related Talking Business: Seeing the Sights of Industrial China: 2 Factories, 2 Futures (April 5, 2008) Enlarge This Image Du Bin for The New York Times A corner of the Li-Ning campus in Beijing. The athletic wear company is trying to compete with better-known global brands. We were sitting in a small conference room in Li-Ning’s Beijing headquarters, Guo Jianxin and I, talking about the importance of brands in China. In case you’ve never heard of it  and I’d be a little surprised if you had  Li-Ning is a Chinese sneaker and athletic wear company named for its founder, Li Ning, a Michael Jordanesque figure in China who won three gold medals in gymnastics during the 1984 Olympics. Six years later, realizing that China lacked a high-end high-quality sneaker, Mr. Li started his company, where he remains chairman of the board. Mr. Guo, a pleasant, earnest 38-year-old, is Li-Ning’s chief operating officer, and he was dressed exactly the way you’d expect a sneaker executive to dress: a polo shirt with the Li-Ning logo, blue jeans and a pair of Li-Ning sneakers. Then again, almost everything about Li-Ning feels like your basic modern sneaker company: the airy, wide-open campus; the casually dressed young executives bustling about; the rows of basketball and tennis courts under construction; the huge posters everywhere of Chinese Olympians and other athletes who have endorsed Li-Ning shoes and clothing, like the tennis player Ivan Ljubicic and, believe it or not, Shaquille O’Neal. On a large grassy area stood the letters, in English, of Li-Ning’s slogan: “Anything Is Possible.” Do you hear in that slogan the echo of Nike (“Just Do It”) and Adidas (“Nothing Is Impossible”)? I certainly did. Although Mr. Guo, like many Chinese executives I interviewed, spoke proudly of his company’s research and development efforts, Li-Ning sneakers certainly don’t look any different from those you’d find in a Nike or Adidas store. The Shaq figure stamped on his branded line of Li-Ning sneakers looked an awful lot like Nike’s Air Jordan figure. As for the Li-Ning logo, it bore a remarkable resemblance to Nike’s swoosh, except with a checkmark stuck at the front of it. Mr. Guo and the other Li-Ning executives have big plans for Li-Ning sneakers. Although they are currently serving the domestic market almost exclusively, they want to begin exporting to Europe and the United States  and go toe to toe abroad with Nike and Adidas, as it is currently trying to do in China. Mr. Guo told me the company now generates only 1 percent of its $700 million in revenue abroad; by 2013  when it hopes to be generating over $2 billion in revenue  it expects 20 percent to come from exports. But to get there, Li-Ning will have to become a brand like Nike and Adidas. As Chiang Jeongwen, a Chinese marketing professor at the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business, said, “When you get right down to it, Nike is a branding company”; to compete, Li-Ning would have to become one as well. There is no question that Mr. Guo  and everyone else at Li-Ning  is aware of this, and is trying hard to figure out how to make the kind of branding splash that comes so naturally to Nike and Adidas. “Branding is a necessity for our company,” Mr. Guo said. But the more he spoke about branding, the more I began to have my doubts that Li-Ning was ready for the big leagues. “In the coming years, we are going to have to find a Jordan for Li-Ning,” he told me through a translator. “Nike had Jordan. Where is our Jordan?” I pointed to a pair of the Shaq sneakers that had been brought into the conference room for my inspection. The sneaker cost around $120. How much of that price could be attributed to Shaq’s endorsement? I asked him. (Shaq signed with Li-Ning in 2005.) Mr. Guo hemmed and hawed, but then finally coughed up his opinion. “My personal belief is that it doesn’t make all that much difference,” he said. “It is probably not more than 10 percent. What the consumer cares about is the design, material and professional performance.” I thought to myself: that’s not what they believe at Nike. Then he told me something else. Li-Ning shoes were purposely priced 20 percent below their Nike and Adidas equivalent. He didn’t explain why, but he didn’t have to. Li-Ning is simply not confident that its current brand can stand up to its big Western competitors. Truth to tell, neither is just about any other big consumer company in China.  It is easy when you live in the West to take brands  their power, their ability to conjure up feelings of status among consumers, the loyalty they can generate  completely for granted. Brands are almost part of the air we breathe. But go to China, and you get a whole new appreciation for brands. One afternoon, for instance, I went to a big five-story mart called the Silk Market, which was lined with tiny retail outlets all selling “branded” goods of every sort  watches and purses, shirts and suits, you name it. As I walked down a crowded aisle, I was inundated with sellers grabbing and clutching me, while pushing their goods under my nose. But they didn’t say, “Do you want a purse?” They shouted: “Louis Vuitton! Gucci! Armani!” All the goods were knock-offs, of course. But it certainly spoke to the power of brands  a fake Louis Vuitton was somehow “better” than a better-made unbranded purse. You notice it everywhere in China. What is the car of choice in China if you have some money? Surprisingly, an Audi. Why? Because Audi got here early and did the best job among foreign car manufacturers of persuading the Chinese that an Audi is a symbol that you’ve made it. Everybody wants an iPhone  even though they are not even sold yet in China. Stroll down a fancy mall in Shanghai or Beijing and they’re all cluttered with the familiar Western brands. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: April 19, 2008 The Talking Business column last Saturday, about China’s efforts to develop popular brands, referred incorrectly in one instance to Chiang Jeongwen, a marketing professor who commented on the effort.

Related Managing Globalization Blog (IHT) An Olympic Boost for BeijingGo to Blog » Barton Silverman/The New York Times Theres a time and place for the issues and causes. The Olympic Games and politics dont go together well. GARY HALL JR. Three-time member of U.S. Olympic swim team But Ms. Mendoza stops short of publicly condemning China, which has close ties to the government of Sudan, because she says it is impolite to criticize her Olympic hosts and because one of her sponsors, Nike, has a major marketing presence in China. With growing protests in Tibet and pressure mounting on Olympic sponsors to denounce China for its policy on Darfur, socially conscious athletes said they were struggling to figure out how to honor their beliefs while also respecting the purpose of the Olympic Games  the celebration of athletic excellence. “I feel like there’s no one out there who would think that it’s a controversial issue to talk about 400,000 people being killed in Darfur right now,” said Ms. Mendoza, who helped the American team win a gold medal in Athens in 2004. “But I’m not about to go into China and tell their government what to do.” This week, Ms. Mendoza said she would let her Nike representatives know about her participation in Team Darfur, a coalition of more than 200 athletes seeking to raise awareness about what Congress and President Bush consider genocide in Darfur. “I want them to know what my role is,” she said. When she is not in uniform competing, Ms. Mendoza plans to wear her Team Darfur wristbands around Beijing, and she hopes to visit the Darfur region after the Olympics. Brad Greiner, the cofounder of Washington-based Team Darfur and a former water polo player for U.C.L.A., said these personal and business considerations had kept some well-known athletes from joining the coalition. Many are wary of speaking out, he said. Last year, the basketball star LeBron James, of the Cleveland Cavaliers, would not sign a letter written by a teammate, Ira Newble, criticizing China for its Darfur policy, according to news reports. Mr. James, who is expected to play for the United States team in Beijing, said at the time that he needed more information. He has a $90 million endorsement contract with Nike. The decision of whether to be an advocate carries risks for lesser-known athletes as well. “This is their one time every four years to make money for a lot of sports,” said Mr. Greiner, 24, who added that the group would intensify its push to sign up top athletes in the months leading up to the Summer Games. “So they need to take that into consideration when making a decision about whether or not to speak about Darfur.” Athletes have few formal guidelines to follow when deciding whether to take a public stand while in Beijing. Rule 51 of the Olympic charter, the constitution of the Olympic movement, forbids athletes from participating in a “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda” at Olympic sites. When the International Olympic Committee identifies a possible violation of Rule 51, it asks the Olympic Committee of the athlete’s country to investigate. Depending on the outcome, Olympians can be disqualified or sent home. The question of whether Olympic athletes will have the right to express political views in Beijing erupted in February, after news that Britain and New Zealand were planning to require that athletes sign contracts barring them from speaking about politically sensitive issues. Both countries quickly reversed course. The United States Olympic Committee permits athletes to express their opinions, provided they do not violate the charter, according to Darryl Seibel, a U.S.O.C. spokesman. Gary Hall Jr., who is trying to reach his fourth Olympics in swimming, said the U.S.O.C. would send subtle messages about avoiding controversial subjects during athlete media and cultural training for the Games. “It’s discouraged, that’s clearly understood,” Mr. Hall said. A 10-medal winner, Mr. Hall said he avoided speaking about politics, but he has been outspoken on subjects related to doping in sports. “There’s a time and place for the issues and causes,” he said. “The Olympic Games and politics don’t go together well.” Giselle Davies, a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee, said athletes would not be punished for answering reporters’ questions honestly. Some athletes said they were willing to do whatever it took to draw attention to their cause, even if it meant getting expelled from the Olympics. Emanuel Neto, who expects to make the Angolan national basketball team, said he grew up surrounded by war and famine and, as a result, has empathy for the people of Darfur. “I’ve seen what those kids are going through and it’s really, really bad,” said Mr. Neto, 23, a senior at Stony Brook University and a member of Team Darfur. “It doesn’t matter at this point what will happen to me. What matters to me the most is that something has to be done.” 1 2 Next Page » Karen Crouse and Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

Skip to next paragraph Related Managing Globalization Blog (IHT) An Olympic Boost for BeijingGo to Blog » Even as its economy surged in recent years, Beijing, China’s capital, still lagged behind business centers like Shanghai and Guangzhou in commercial development. Roads and public transit were outmoded, developers said, and companies that wanted to expand there had limited options for office or retail space. But with the Olympic Games as a catalyst, government authorities undertook a vast makeover of the city. Since its selection in 2001 as the host city, it has poured $40 billion into infrastructure projects and Olympics venues while encouraging the development of glittering office, hotel and retail centers. Entire neighborhoods are being renovated. In 2007, four new shopping centers added nearly 1.2 million square feet of retail space, office space expanded by more than 14 million square feet, and 2,500 new hotel rooms came onto the market, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate services and money management company. And that was just last year. In 2008, an additional 11 shopping centers totaling more than 11 million square feet are scheduled to open, along with 15 million square feet of office space and more than 11,000 hotel rooms, Jones Lang LaSalle said. With the new supply of high-quality real estate, more American companies have been heading into Beijing, seeking to expand their presence in one of the world’s fastest-growing markets. A less-stringent regulatory environment for business is also helping to clear the path; there are fewer ownership restrictions, for example, for foreign businesses in certain industries. “The city is expanding at such a pace, it’s creating new opportunities every day,” said Edwin Fuller, the president and managing director of international lodging for Marriott International, whose hotel brands include JW Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts, Ritz-Carlton and Renaissance Hotels. In the two years leading up to the start of the Games, Marriott International will have opened eight new hotels, totaling 3,000 rooms, including a JW Marriott and Beijing’s second Ritz-Carlton. Both the JW Marriott and the Ritz opened late last year in China Central Place, a new mixed-use development in the Central Business District. Companies already established in China are expanding in Beijing, including McDonald’s, Staples, Starbucks and Nike, while others are entering for the first time, or venturing into more direct investments. Apple plans to open its first Chinese store in Beijing this summer. The store, with 30,000 square feet of space, will be on Qianmen Street, a historic but neglected commercial district at the south end of Tiananmen Square that is being remade into a pedestrian shopping and dining corridor. Last August, Nike, which is sponsoring several Olympic teams, opened a flagship store on the busy Wangfujing Street in the city’s center. At 12,000 square feet, the store is the company’s largest in China, and the first in the country that Nike directly owns and operates. The company says sales have been brisk. (There are some 3,500 Nike stores throughout China, though they are owned and operated by franchisees or other partners.) The Fatburger restaurant chain, owned by the Fog Cutter Capital Group, also plans to open an outlet in Beijing before the Olympics, after the opening last fall of its first Chinese venture in Macao. And Auntie Anne’s Pretzels plans to open three outlets in Beijing in the coming months, in its first foray into China. “We’re using the Olympics as a catalyst to expose people to our brand,” said Mike McCoy, the director of franchise development and international operations at Auntie Anne’s. He said the company had long considered expanding into China but only recently found the right licensee with whom to form a partnership. “With the Olympics, the timing couldn’t be better,” he said. Even celebrity chefs are getting in on the action. Daniel Boulud, who owns high-profile restaurants in New York and Las Vegas, plans to have a restaurant in Legation Quarter, a luxury development that will open this spring in the former American Embassy near Tiananmen Square, next to the mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The appeal, of course, is easy to see: China’s economy has been growing by double-digits annually, and its 1.3 billion or so citizens are becoming more affluent. Yet few Chinese brands compete in the luxury categories. “The consumer market is a blank canvas in China, to a certain degree,” said Benjamin Christensen, the research manager of Jones Lang LaSalle Beijing. It was only in 2001 that the first modern shopping mall opened in Beijing. But the concept has caught on with consumers and retailers alike. The advent of a global event like the Olympics, expected to draw some two million foreign and domestic visitors, has been a strong springboard. Still, some people wonder what will happen when the athletes and the spectators go home, and Beijing is left to absorb an enormous increase in hotel rooms, shops and office space, some in unproven neighborhoods. Many Olympic host cities, like Montreal in 1976 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, experienced economic slumps after the Games as they struggled to recoup their costly investments. In recent months, some new retail centers have had trouble lining up tenants, according to leasing agents. Similarly, hotel occupancy rates in Beijing are likely to drop, at least temporarily, after the Games, said Andreas Flaig, an executive vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels in China. But hotels may partially offset that with higher prices, he said, noting that average room rates for luxury hotels in Beijing nearly doubled from 1999 to 2007, to roughly $200. These hotels “are built for the long term, not for a 16-day event in August,” Mr. Flaig said. “They want to participate in the long-term growth of Beijing.” Indeed, few companies coming into Beijing seem worried. For one thing, hotels groups like Marriott International tend to operate hotels for local business people who develop the properties, so they are more insulated from real estate costs and risks. Similarly, most retail outlets have a local partner or franchisee, although direct investment has been growing. MOREOVER, China’s long-term growth prospects and Beijing’s healthy mix of tourists and business travelers bode well for the long term. Past Olympic host cities have largely been in developed countries. Beijing, by contrast, is experiencing breathtaking growth, and the investments made for the Olympics, largely centered on improving transportation and infrastructure, will only help its future growth, according to Michael Thompson, the president of Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Asia unit. Mr. Fuller of Marriott agreed. “You’ve watched every city that has ever hosted the Olympics go into oversupply mode,” he said. In Beijing, he said, “I suspect it will be relatively short-lived.” More Articles in Real Estate »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/business/20shoe.html?ref=nikeinc">International Sales Help Lift Nike’s Profit<date>Published: March 20, 2008</date><text>LOS ANGELES (Reuters)  Nike, the world’s largest maker of athletic footwear and apparel, said on Wednesday that its third-quarter net profit rose, helped by strong international sales of shoes and clothing that were buoyed by a weak dollar. Net profit increased to $463.8 million, or 92 cents a share, from $350.8 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Total sales jumped 16 percent, to $4.5 billion. The company’s growth in emerging markets for its Nike footwear has been rapid as it prepares for the Beijing Olympics, and demand is robust for its smaller non-Nike brands. Even though Nike has said that sports items are relatively immune to economic downturns, it has been controlling inventory in a challenging United States marketplace as athletic shoe retailers struggle. Nike’s shares rose 16 cents, to $61.83, on Wednesday before its earnings were reported, and rose several dollars a share in after-hours trading.

Graeme Roustan regularly received hand-me-down Bauer hockey skates from his older brother, and he has continued to buy Bauer Supreme skates ever since. But on Thursday, Mr. Roustan, now a private equity investor in Florida, made a bigger purchase, buying the Bauer operation from Nike for $200 million. Mr. Roustan, whose holdings include companies that make ice rink equipment, spoke of his passion for the Bauer name on Thursday, but there was much less excitement for Nike shareholders. The price paid by Mr. Roustan and Kohlberg &amp; Company, an investment firm based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., is well below the $395 million Nike paid for Bauer in 1994. With revenue of about $160 million a year, Nike Bauer Hockey is a sliver of Nike’s $16.3 billion operation. But the discounted sale price was the final humiliation in Nike’s failed effort to use its marketing muscle to raise the profile of hockey in the United States. When Nike acquired Bauer, inline skating was at its faddish peak in the United States. A critical component of the company’s strategy was to transform that into a following for hockey played on concrete using inline skates. But inline hockey did not develop as anticipated. More important, Nike learned that performance was more important than styling flair in hockey gear. Eventually Nike corrected its product missteps and maintained Bauer’s lead in the skate market. But its early products made the Nike brand the hockey industry’s rough equivalent of the Edsel. Eventually Nike was killed as a stand-alone hockey brand; only its swoosh logo now appears next to Bauer’s name on products. A Nike spokesman, Derek Kent, declined to comment on the sale price. Unlike Nike, which put the unit up for sale last autumn, and many others in the hockey equipment business, Mr. Roustan is optimistic. “Growing up in the game,” he said, “I know the future of hockey is very bright.” Mr. Roustan, who will become chairman, offered no details about how Bauer may change its approach. He will retain the current management, including the chief executive, Mark Duggan. Mr. Duggan said Bauer would be able to phase out Nike’s logo over two years. As for inline hockey, Mr. Roustan suggested that Bauer would never again chase that elusive market. “I really didn’t understand the inline skating business, being a blade guy,” he said.

Adidas, based in Bavaria, makes only 5 percent of its sales in Germany and uses English as its official language. Mr. Hainer was interviewed in New York. Here are excerpts from the conversation: Skip to next paragraph Herbert Hainer Q. What was at stake for you in an event like the Super Bowl? A. With our Reebok brand, we are the exclusive supplier of jerseys for the whole National Football League. So both teams played in our shirts. We also had a lot of activities around the Super Bowl. We had a television advertising campaign. We had a booth where we hosted key retailers, and a lot of our N.F.L. players were there giving autograph sessions and giving interviews to the media in support of our new products. The Super Bowl is definitely a huge event for us. Q. Isn’t your No. 1 marketing and branding challenge competing against Nike? A. This is correct. When you look around the world, I think it’s fair to say that it’s becoming more and more a two-horse race. Nike is doing around $16 billion in sales, and we are doing around $14 billion. The No. 3 player, Puma, is doing around $4 billion a year in sales. You can see the difference between the two giants and the rest of the pack. Q. What is it like to compete against Nike, whose “swoosh” logo must be one of the most recognized symbols on the planet? A. Around the world, the Adidas brand name and brand mark are more recognizable than Nike because our brand has existed for 70 years and Nike has been around for 30 years. Especially in Europe and Asia, the Adidas trademark and brand name are more known than Nike’s. In the United States, it’s a little bit different. But over all, we have a fairly good chance to fulfill our mission to become the leading sports company in the world. Q. Why are events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics so important in creating a brand? A. Because there are so many people watching. I read that more than one billion viewers around the world would watch the Super Bowl. And some 40 billion viewers, on an accumulated basis, are expected for the Olympics, meaning many people watch many separate events. There is no better place to showcase your brand. Q. Are the investments you make in these events cost-effective? A. Most every event is cost-effective, which means it is profitable for us in immediate terms. When you look to the Olympics, however, that’s a huge window to showcase a brand, but you don’t make immediate sales out of the Olympics. No viewer is going to go to the store after watching a 5,000-meter runner. But it has a long-term effect. Q. Are you concerned about air quality in Beijing for the Olympics? A. We all know that there is pollution in Beijing and that the air is not the cleanest. I do believe the government will take a lot of actions. Four weeks before the Games start, they will shut down all the factories within a 50-kilometer circle of Beijing. They will limit car traffic. I believe the government is taking the right actions. I have been in China 10 times in the past three or four years. There is pollution, no doubt. But you have a lot of other cities around the world where pollution is just as bad. Q. And what about the newspaper columnists and human rights activists who say the Olympics should be used to force China to improve its human rights conditions? A. I believe there will definitely be human rights organizations which will use this platform because the exposure is as valuable for them as it is for us. So many visitors will see their activities. But I don’t think it will influence the Games negatively. I believe the best way going forward on human rights and pollution issues is to work cooperatively with the Chinese government and the Chinese people instead of permanently confronting them. Complaining and trying to nail them to the wall aren’t effective. We have a lot of factories in China, and that’s what we’re trying to do to achieve progress  we are working together with local communities and local factories to put in our standards, in terms of fair wages, social standards and working hours. Q. Do you feel you and Nike have taken the necessary steps to address the concerns of critics about sweatshop labor? A. I do believe so. I can only speak for our company. We are more or less in the same places as Nike  China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. When you look back over the past 24 months, there was hardly any article criticizing the Adidas Group for not conforming to the standards we have set. We have the Standards of Engagement, where we clearly and contractually commit every supplier to certain standards, such as minimum wages, no child labor, no forced labor, social standards and working hours. We are in all the big indices such as the Dow Jones sustainability index and the Financial Times Stock Exchange 4Good index. And we are working with a lot of nongovernmental organizations in individual countries. We have a lot of people who are dedicated to this. Q. Are your sourcing patterns now identical to Nike’s around the world? A. I don’t know Nike’s patterns exactly, but we are more or less in the same areas, not always in the same factories. I believe Nike is trying to tackle the social and environmental critiques they get in a professional way as well.

But when Nike added its logo to gear by Bauer, a longtime Canadian maker of hockey equipment, “there was resistance,” said Terry Bovair, owner of the Fontaine Source for Sports in Peterborough, Ontario. “Some people did not buy the product.” Skip to next paragraph Steve Payne for The New York Times Enlarge This Image Steve Payne for The New York Times Terry Bovair, a onetime hockey professional, faults Nike for ill-fitting designs. He owns a shop in Peterborough, Ontario. Apparently, that kind of reaction was not confined to Peterborough, a small city northeast of Toronto that is something of a hockey hot spot. Thirteen years after acquiring Bauer, and making bold promises that it would transform the business of hockey, Nike has put its Nike Bauer unit up for sale, a rare bit of comeuppance for one of the world’s powerful brands. Though Nike Bauer remains a market leader, many analysts predict that the company will find it hard to recover even half the $395 million it paid for Canstar Sports, Bauer’s Montreal-based parent, in December 1994. “It was one of Phil Knight’s ideas,” said Brady Lemos, an analyst with Morningstar, referring to Nike’s chairman. “Perhaps they were too optimistic.” The shedding of Nike Bauer, with annual sales around $160 million, is not expected to affect Nike’s financial reports significantly. The company posted revenue of $16.3 billion last year; it does not break out profit by unit. But Nike’s decision to step away from hockey at the same time it is increasing its presence in soccer shows that financial muscle and marketing power do not always give it the ability to dominate the field, or the ice. “Nike has been a good competitor,” said Denis Drolet, president of Groupe Drolet, which owns Sher-Wood, a hockey-stick maker in Sherbrooke, Quebec. “Bauer is a great name, they have a great line of skates. But the hockey market is not growing.” Mr. Drolet’s pessimism about the potential for his industry is widely shared. But that was not the case when Nike entered the hockey business. Hockey participation in the United States, the world’s second-largest market, after Canada, was then rising. An expansion by the National Hockey League into several American cities had fueled expectations. Perhaps most attractive to Nike was the popularity of in-line skating in the mid-1990s. The company hoped that by promoting hockey played on rollerblades rather than skates, it could overcome a significant obstacle to the sport’s development in the United States: a lack of ice rinks. After buying Canstar, Nike followed a pattern that had brought it success in other sports. It sponsored prominent players and became the official jersey supplier to the N.H.L. It closed Bauer factories in Ontario and moved their production to Asia, while the unit’s head office left Canada for New Hampshire. While the Bauer name was retained, Nike used its own for the unit’s premium products. In a sport where skates come in pretty much any color provided they were predominantly black, Nike introduced models with white boots and bold graphics. The vivid styling that had worked for Nike in basketball did not score on the ice. Players, other than those sponsored by Nike, shunned the white boots, a color associated with women’s figure skates. And unlike sneakers, Mr. Lemos of Morningstar said, boldly styled hockey skates were never purchased by the fashion-conscious as casual footwear. Critics also say that Nike’s attention to product design did not extend to the performance of the skates, which were priced at a premium of several hundred dollars, and were unusually sized for North American feet. “Their high-end skate was cutting people’s heels and causing blisters,” said Mr. Bovair, a former professional player. “It was a bad, bad launch.” Even Nike competitors acknowledge that the company eventually sorted out the performance issues, and toned down its styling. “They brought in new materials and new processes for manufacturing,” said John Pagotto, president of TPS Hockey, a Canadian maker of sticks and protective gear. But it came too late to save Nike as a stand-alone hockey brand, forcing the compromise that resulted in a logo with Nike’s swoosh but Bauer’s name. Not all American newcomers to hockey have been humbled in such ways. Easton, a maker of aluminum baseball bats, came to dominate the hockey stick market by introducing models made from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic rather than wood. With their emphasis on exotic materials, Nike Bauer and Easton succeeded in raising prices for hockey equipment. While $400 had once seemed the limit for skates, Nike Bauer managed to find a market for $750 pairs by using lightweight, high-performance material. Spokesmen for Nike declined to make anyone available to speak about the company’s decision to sell the hockey unit, which it calls profitable. In a quarterly conference call with analysts in September, Nike’s chief executive, Mark Parker, said, “We felt that there’s other entities within the portfolio that need yet more focus and can deliver more longer-term growth potential.” Indeed, some analysts look toward a decline in equipment sales. Player registrations for USA Hockey, the governing body, rose last season by 3.3 percent over the previous period. But the increase was largely caused by previously unregistered adult players who joined for insurance reasons. Youth memberships, the indicator of the sport’s future, fell 0.5 percent. Mr. Drolet, the stick maker, traces the lack of growth largely to the premium prices Nike and others achieved. “The price of equipment keeps going up, making it hard for families,” he said. Yet most analysts expect Nike to find a buyer, if at a fire sale price, before its self-imposed deadline of the end of May. Reebok, which is owned by the rival Adidas, has been mentioned. But such a deal might raise antitrust issues because its Reebok-CCM Hockey unit is a major force in the market. A spokeswoman for Reebok declined to comment.

Skip to next paragraph Related National Labor Committee Report on Wal-Mart Christmas (www.nlcnet.org) China Labor Watch (www.chinalaborwatch.org) Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior (www.sacom.hk) Report: Chinas Factory Floors (International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health) Enlarge This Image Chang W. Lee/The New York Times A dormitory at a steel company in the provinces. The groups say some Chinese companies routinely shortchange their employees on wages, withhold health benefits and expose their workers to dangerous machinery and harmful chemicals, like lead, cadmium and mercury. “If these things are so dangerous for the consumer, then how about the workers?” said Anita Chan, a labor rights advocate who teaches at the Australian National University. “We may be dealing with these things for a short time, but they deal with them every day.” And so while American and European consumers worry about exposing their children to Chinese-made toys coated in lead, Chinese workers, often as young as 16, face far more serious hazards. Here in the Pearl River Delta region near Hong Kong, for example, factory workers lose or break about 40,000 fingers on the job every year, according to a study published a few years ago by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Pushing to keep big corporations honest, labor groups regularly smuggle photographs, videos, pay stubs, shipping records and other evidence out of factories that they say violate local law and international worker standards. In 2007, factories that supplied more than a dozen corporations, including Wal-Mart, Disney and Dell, were accused of unfair labor practices, including using child labor, forcing employees to work 16-hour days on fast-moving assembly lines, and paying workers less than minimum wage. (Minimum wage in this part of China is about 55 cents an hour.) In recent weeks, a flood of reports detailing labor abuse have been released, at a time when China is still coping with last year’s wave of product safety recalls of goods made in China, and as it tries to change workplace rules with a new labor law that took effect on Jan. 1. No company has come under as harsh a spotlight as Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, which sourced about $9 billion in goods from China in 2006, everything from hammers and toys to high-definition televisions. In December, two nongovernmental organizations, or NGOs, documented what they said were abuse and labor violations at 15 factories that produce or supply goods for Wal-Mart  including the use of child labor at Huanya Gifts, a factory here in Guangzhou that makes Christmas tree ornaments. Wal-Mart officials say they are investigating the allegations, which were in a report issued three weeks ago by the National Labor Committee, a New York-based NGO. Guangzhou labor bureau officials said they recently fined Huanya for wage violations, but also said they found no evidence of child labor. A spokesman for Huanya, which employs 8,000 workers, denied that the company broke any labor laws. But two workers interviewed outside Huanya’s huge complex in late December said that they were forced to work long hours to meet production quotas in harsh conditions. “I work on the plastic molding machine from 6 in the morning to 6 at night,” said Xu Wenquan, a tiny, baby-faced 16-year-old whose hands were covered with blisters. Asked what had happened to his hands, he replied, the machines are “quite hot, so I’ve burned my hands.” His brother, Xu Wenjie, 18, said the two young men left their small village in impoverished Guizhou Province four months ago and traveled more than 500 miles to find work at Huanya. The brothers said they worked 12 hours a day, six days a week, for $120 to $200 a month, far less than they are required to be paid by law. When government inspectors visit the factory, the young brothers are given the day off, they said. A former Huanya employee who was reached by telephone gave a similar account of working conditions, saying many workers suffered from skin rashes after working with gold powders and that others were forced to sign papers “volunteering” to work overtime. “It’s quite noisy, and you stand up all day, 12 hours, and there’s no air-conditioning,” he said. “We get paid by the piece we make but they never told us how much. Sometimes I got $110, sometimes I got $150 a month.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/sports/23shoe.html?ref=nikeinc">The Nike Air Force 1 Sneaker Turns 25 Years Old<date>Published: December 23, 2007</date><text>In 1982, Nike released the Air Force 1, a basketball shoe that featured a revolutionary technological innovation: a pocket of air in the heel for cushioning and support. The shoe, although expensive at $89.95, was an immediate hit among players, from the N.B.A. to the playground, with professionals like Moses Malone and Michael Cooper endorsing them and wearing them during games. Skip to next paragraph Nike Nike released the Air Force 1 in 1982. The sneaker comes in more than 1,800 color combinations and can cost thousands of dollars. Rusty Kennedy/Associated Press Moses Malone was an early adopter. Jeffrey Neira/UPN The rapper Nelly recorded an ode titled Air Force Ones. Twenty-five years later, only Pistons forward Rasheed Wallace still wears the shoe in the N.B.A. But the Air Force 1, now priced at $80 for the basic white-on-white, is a far better seller than when it was introduced. Largely because of its popularity off the court, it has become the best-selling sneaker ever with more than 1,800 color combinations, many in limited editions that can cost thousands of dollars. “It’s the No. 1 seller in the history of athletic footwear,” said Matt Powell, an analyst at SportsOneSource, a research and data firm in Charlotte, N.C., that follows the sporting-goods industry. Nike declined to release sales figures, but Powell estimated that about 12 million pairs of the Air Force 1 were sold at its peak in 2005, and 10 million to 11 million were sold last year. The shoe was originally popular in the East, and Nike is giving loyalists in Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York the chance to choose 1 of 25 of the most popular models to be re-released in those cities in the summer. Baltimore voted last month, and the Philadelphia balloting ends Wednesday. Voting in New York will take place Jan. 2-31. (Polling locations and the winning models are at nike.com/af1.) That a 25-year-old sneaker was the best-selling athletic shoe last year reflects a change in an industry whose product is becoming valued more for its fashion relevance than for its performance. Few people buy Air Force 1s to wear on a basketball court, and many collectors keep several pairs in pristine condition to protect their value. Yet people are still unable to describe what has made the shoe so popular. “People want to analyze it death, but it’s really just that it looks great on your foot,” said Bobbito Garcia, a sneaker and hip-hop expert who wrote the book “Where’d You Get Those? New York City’s Sneaker Culture: 1960-1987.” Rare Air Force 1s like the Entourage Edition (in honor of the HBO show) and a crocodile-skin 25th anniversary edition cost more than $2,000 at Flight Club New York, a consignment sneaker store in Lower Manhattan. “The shoe is just an excellent shoe,” said Esteban Padilla, the director of consignment at Flight Club, who was wearing a pair of burnt orange canvas Air Force 1s. “It’s classic.” One of the keys to the Air Force 1’s popularity is that it comes in so many color combinations. “It takes color very well,” KeJuan Wilkens, a Nike spokesman, said. “That’s the unique thing about the shoe, different colors  to some people  make it feel like a completely different shoe.” Yet the white-on-white is the most popular model, although many people also own other colors to complement an outfit or to achieve a different look. Nike often produces limited runs of various colors, and their scarcity makes them more desirable  and more expensive. For many collectors, the ultimate goal is to be the only one wearing a particular sneaker. Garcia was hand-painting his Air Force 1s in the mid-1980s, well before Nike started producing different colors. “I didn’t want to wear the same colors that everyone else has,” he said. Until the mid-1990s, the Air Force 1 was a hit in some Eastern cities. But their popularity among influential rappers of that era helped them to sell across the country and across the globe. “A lot of that had to do with the huge increase in the shoe’s exposure not entirely due to sports, but now due to the culture,” Garcia said. “A lot of the artists from the Eastern Seaboard who were really killing them  particularly Jay-Z with all the influence he had globally and him wearing Air Force 1 on stage and videos and concert appearances really, really pushed the shoe. Had that not happened, the shoe would have still been selling in New York, Philly and Baltimore; it still would have been that hot shoe. But once all the recording artists started talking about them, then it just went crazy.” The shoes were popular across the country in 2002, when Nelly, a rapper from St. Louis, recorded “Air Force Ones” with a chorus that includes the lines, “I said give me two pair/I need two pair.” As more colors became available starting in the mid-1990s, Nike began releasing limited-edition models and collaborations with artists that became collectors’ items. The company managed sales by regularly releasing models in fewer numbers than the market demanded. Nike also gave select vendors more exclusive products. “That phenomenon is going on across the whole industry where the kid really wants to have a unique product, he wants to have a one of one if he can,” Powell said. “I think Nike is feeding that interest on the part of the consumer by keeping supply tight.” The sneaker’s history and original purpose are lost on today’s youth. “There are new generations coming into it that have no idea that it was a basketball shoe when it came out,” Garcia said. “No idea. So in another 10 or 20 years, they won’t even know that Jay-Z wore them. They won’t have any idea. They’ll just keep wearing them cause it’s a cool shoe.” More Articles in Sports »</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/business/20nike.html?ref=nikeinc">Nike Profit Up 10%, Pushed by Overseas Sales<date>Published: December 20, 2007</date><text>LOS ANGELES (Reuters)  Nike, the world’s largest maker of athletic footwear and apparel, said Wednesday that its quarterly net profit jumped 10 percent, helped by strong international demand. The company, known for its “swoosh” logo as well as brands like Converse, Hurley and Cole Haan, said net profit in the fiscal second quarter of 2008 rose to $359.4 million, or 71 cents a share, from $325.6 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 14 percent, to $4.34 billion. Wall Street, on average, expected the company, based in Beaverton, Ore., to report earnings of 66 cents on revenue of $4.22 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Nike, which recently announced it would buy the British soccer brand Umbro, has managed to largely remain unaffected by a slump among American mall-based retailers for athletic shoes. The company’s diversification helps it manage during periods of slower spending, according to analysts.

If Not, Design One That Does.<date>Published: December 2, 2007</date><text>EVEN for the most dedicated shopper, finding just the right pair of shoes can be elusive. A store-to-store search  whether on the Web or at the mall  can take hours. Shoppers may think theyve found the perfect pair, only to be stymied by a problem with fit, style or color. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image If you dont like the shoes you find in the stores, you can go to a Web site like Stevemadden.com and choose your own color, pattern, style and size. Its not that retailers dont try, as the huge shoe sections in department stores like Saks and Nordstrom, and Web sites like Zappos and Shoes.com, attest. But for those with very individual or exacting tastes  and with money to spare  some Internet retailers offer design-it-yourself options in footwear. Customization is more common with athletic shoes, but fashion footwear is beginning to catch up. Makers like Vans and Nike are among the companies that offer customized shoes, allowing both women and men to create their own look from existing styles, colors and materials. Cale Valdez, a college student in Huntington, Calif., went to vans.com to find a memorable look for his wedding last month. He designed some red and black canvas slip-ons for the wedding party, including matching lace-ups for his father-in-law. My groomsmen had black tuxes and red vests, so we thought it would look great to have red shoes, he said of the slip-ons, which cost $40 a pair. Nikeid.com, which attracts almost as many women as men, has customers who order hundreds of pairs. The hip-hop disc jockey known as Clark Kent, of Brooklyn, has designed 350 pairs of shoes on the site, including his favorite, a pair of purple, black and teal Air Force 1s, which cost him about $275. The biggest attraction is the ability to shock, he said. You want a pair that people notice so they ask you: Where did you get those? While customized sneakers are available on many athletic shoe Web sites, fashion shoes are harder, although not impossible, to find. For women who are willing to spend a hefty sum, there is Tupli, started three years ago by two women who were leaving careers in banking. This is ideal for the woman who can imagine the perfect shoe but cant find it, said Kathy Myczowski, 34. She went into the individual shoe design business with Tamara Chubinidze, 26, who is from the Republic of Georgia, where such shoemaking is more prevalent and where Tuplis shoes are made. Clients can browse tupli.com for ideas and then send in their measurements, or be measured personally in New York. Tupli had a by-appointment shop in Manhattan for a couple of years, but switched to online last year because its customers were far flung, Ms. Myczowski said. Amolyn Peart, a banking manager who has purchased three pairs of shoes from the company, became intrigued with the idea after spotting a woman wearing Tupli footwear (a name derived from the Russian word for shoe) at a business gathering. The shoes were so gorgeous and unusual, so I immediately asked her where she got them, said Ms. Peart, of West Orange, N.J. Like many people, she is hard to fit: her shoe size is between 8 1/2 and 9, and ready-made shoes are often too tight in the toe. Tuplis clients  who include the actress Susan Sarandon  have a choice of leather and suede, as well as embellishments like rhinestones and personal logos, and initials on the upper or even on the sole, said Ms. Myczowski. The first made-to-measure Tupli shoe that Ms. Peart designed for herself was a black and red pump for an event at work. Everyone noticed it, especially because they were all wearing black shoes, she recalled. Since then, she has ordered another pair of shoes and a pair of boots. Prices for Tupli shoes start at a hefty $750 for shoes and $1,450 for boots, and customers must wait six to eight weeks for them. Those who want a less expensive made-to-order shoe that wont take as long to arrive can turn to Stevemadden.com. Steven Madden, founder of the company, says more than 100,000 pairs of design-your-own shoes have been sold through the site, where the prices range from $90 to $170. Thats what Robert Klemm, 27, a loan officer in Bethpage, N.Y., did last summer after he learned about Steve Madden Ltd.s Design Your Own Collection. A shoe aficionado  he owns 60 pairs  he wanted to create some shoes to surprise his girlfriend, Kate Feehan, for her birthday. Starting with her size, 9, he clicked through the site to select a style, heel and color, putting together a navy gingham open-toe pump with a cork heel and sole that Mr. Klemm thought would look good with everything from jeans to dresses. He spent $150 plus shipping and tax. The site charges a 20 percent premium for made-to-order shoes, which are assembled in China and are not returnable. The turnaround time is three weeks, according to the site. RIGHT now, Stevemadden.com has almost no online competition. But Jeffrey Van Sinderen, apparel analyst for B. Riley &amp; Company in Los Angeles, predicted that other makers would not be far behind, despite the large investment needed to set up a factory to make the shoes and a system to distribute them. Made-to-order shoes are profitable, he said, and it answers the question of how you make the product more compelling to the consumer, and thats to give them the power to design it. In shoes, passion often trumps the practical. To Mary A. Johnson, 22, online design is about owning something unique. Ms. Johnson, a student at West Los Angeles College, owns 200 pairs of shoes, but that didnt stop her from going to Stevemadden.com recently to design some ballet flats in a purple shade and trimming them in red. This is something you make yourself, she said, instead of settling for whats out there. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/sports/playmagazine/28nash.html?ref=nikeinc">Not to Get Too Mystical About It<date>Published: October 28, 2007</date><text>Steve Nash sat down on a playground bench in Washington Market park, like all the other tired Manhattan fathers. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times Sports Magazine Go to Complete Coverage » Enlarge This Image Finlay MacKay for The New York Times The Man with the Ball Steve Nash, aka the Canadian Jesus. It was a summer evening, late in August, and somewhere in the scrum of kids roiling under the monkey bars was one of his 3-year-old twin girls, Lola, and her nanny. A rubber ball came bounding by with a pre-K hotshot in hot pursuit. He seemed like the sort of kid who in a few years would be shooting baskets behind a school, pretending he was Steve Nash. Nash from the corner! Nash driving the lane! Nash in the media room talking to a reporter! At the sight of the kid, the wariness melted out of Nashs blue eyes. It was easy to imagine the N.B.A. star himself at that age, before he had his paper route, before the local newspaper clips began to trickle in, and the trophies, and the fans, and the Sports Illustrated covers, and the instructional DVDs, and the $11-million-a-year contract and now the 11 seasons as a pro in which he has enjoyed every success but a championship, his one remaining goal as a professional athlete. The hint of sweetness that crossed his stoic face said he knew how joyful and profound the rapport of a boy and a ball could be. Nearly all the canonical stories of Nashs ascent to the pantheon of N.B.A. point guards feature some kind of ball, whether it is the round mound of wadded-up tape he and his younger brother Martin used to play hall-hockey with, or the basketball he took out to shoot on Christmas Eve in the rain at the junior-high-school court behind his parents house in Victoria, British Columbia, or the tennis ball he once dribbled around Santa Clara University on his way to class, or the soccer ball he once kept aloft for 600 consecutive kicks until he collapsed. A ball had been the talisman of what he called my dream. Then again, maybe what the ball-crazed kid provoked had as much to do with the fact that Nash often found himself in the position of pretending to be Steve Nash, too: Steve Nash the brand pushing the ball up court on the Wheaties box or hawking watches and sneakers and bottles of Clearly Canadian water; Steve Nash the white, non-dunking, four-time all-star whose back-to-back Most Valuable Player Awards won him the unwanted role of minority-race champion in a predominantly black league; Steve Nash the self-effacing Canadian long shot whose life story had been puréed into an edifying fable about Chasing Your Dreams and Working Hard and Always Giving Back, and in some parts of his home country had been polished to such a saintly sheen that people called him Can-Je, short for Canadian Jesus. Nash himself sometimes seemed flustered by this double team of person and persona, struggling to reconcile his sardonic sense of humor and lethal competitive instincts with the humanitarian concerns that obliged him to ladle out all kinds of canned corn at charity events and celebrity appearances. What can you say without playing yourself false, or leaving your body completely, when zoo officials who have paid you the compliment of naming a 12-pound female Bengal tiger cub in your honor put the razor-clawed kitty-cat in your arms and stick a microphone in your face? (Shrewdly, Nash channeled Tiger Woods: Its pretty special.) Or for that matter, what about the play-killing questions routinely lobbed by sportswriters after the game? Its always the same three questions, Nash said.  What do you think about the game tonight? How do you feel about the game tomorrow night? What do you think youll have to do differently next time? I started off trying to answer honestly, and then I tried being ironic, but that didnt really work either. . . .  In the park, a stranger approached, hand extended. Steve Nash! the man said. Hey, man, Nash said, shaking his hand after a quick assessment. I love your game. Thanks. Nashs game had been on the shelf for three months, since the Phoenix Suns were muscled out of the second round of the Western Conference playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs, who went on to win the N.B.A. championship against the overmatched Cleveland Cavaliers. It was a bitter end for the Suns championship hopes, and for Nash especially. A Game 1 collision with Spurs guard Tony Parker had split his nose so badly that Nash had to leave the court at a crucial moment in the fourth quarter. It took six stitches to close the bloody gash. In Game 4 the Spurs forward Robert Horry forechecked him into the scorers table, and the ensuing melee cost the Suns their big men when Amare Stoudemire and Boris Diaw were suspended one game each for leaving the bench. Losing the series 4-2 was a defeat that would forever haunt us, Nash said at the time. In the months since, hed consoled himself with the distractions of New York, the adopted off-season city where he has spent the last three summers with his wife, Alejandra, and their twins, Lola and Bella. Ive had a great summer, he was saying now as he stretched out on the bench. He was wearing cargo shorts, a gray T-shirt and laceless black Converse sneakers. I watched Tiger Woods and Roger Federer. I went to movies and restaurants. I had great conversations. He stayed in shape mainly by working out with a trainer and playing soccer at Pier 40 off the Hudson River with a team sponsored by Phebes Tavern &amp; Grill in the East Village. When he took up basketball in the eighth grade it was for social reasons, a means of hanging out with his friends. Being able to use his hands felt almost like cheating, because the sport he loved best was soccer.  Goal was my first word, he told me, a vintage Nash brand detail found in nearly every profile of him. Nashs English father, John, played soccer professionally in South Africa, where Nash was born; his Welsh mother, Jean, had various careers as an airline ticket agent, secretary and special-education teacher. Sickened by apartheid, they emigrated to Canada when Steve was one, eventually settling in Victoria. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next Page » Chip Brown is the author of Good Morning Midnight and Afterwards, Youre a Genius. His last article for Play was on skiing in the Italian Alps.

He has also done work for Mercedes and Rolex, projects that suggest how important the small screen is becoming to filmmakers. As the Internet becomes the medium, normal TV programming will be streamed with commercials, Mr. Mann said in a telephone interview. How are you going to arrest attention? Hollywood directors have been doing commercial work for decades  usually to bring in extra cash, turn a project around quickly and show the range of their talent. These days, however, there are new reasons people with boldface names make ads: to keep up in a multimedia world where the ability to master various platforms is at a premium and where consumers are as likely to see their work on YouTube or TiVo as at the multiplex.  Moviemakers are in demand among advertisers, who have a growing appetite for cinema-quality video that can run on television, online and in theaters. The advent of high-definition television means commercials must be expertly filmed, advertisers say, and the rise of DVRs means people need compelling reasons to watch ads rather than skip them. Hollywood and the advertising world have been connected for a long time. Whats different is that consumers are in a different place, said Diego Scotti, vice president for global advertising at American Express. In the age of outtakes and extra footage on DVDs, consumers want to see not just a single video, but also all the behind-the-scenes material, even for commercials, he said. Wes Anderson, director of the new movie The Darjeeling Limited, is behind some fast-paced spots now running for AT&amp;T, while David Mamet made his first television commercials in April for Ford. Ben Affleck, the actor whose first project as a movie director, Gone Baby Gone, came out on Friday, has just signed a contract with a company in Santa Monica that produces commercials; he has also been looking at storyboards for AT&amp;T. American Express uses Hollywood personalities both behind the cameras and in front of them: Martin Scorsese, M. Night Shyamalan and Mr. Anderson have all appeared in its ads. We want the best creative minds in the world thinking about our brand, Mr. Scotti said. Its about creating a piece thats going to be both art and commerce. Phil Joanou, who directs films and television shows, says there is zero stigma about making commercials  if anything, there is an element of prestige. In the filmmaking world, theyre very excited to see your commercial reel, he says. Sometimes, he says, it is the first thing a studio chief asks for. (Demonstrating the lack of stigma, some directors, like Ridley Scott, started out in commercials and moved on to movies.) Mr. Joanou, whose movies have included Gridiron Gang and Heavens Prisoners, says that advertising projects are a pleasant change of pace. I can do comedy for Budweiser, action for Allstate Insurance, he said. I can show the breadth of my work, and that generates interest. With broadcasters scheduled to switch completely to digital television in 2009, networks are pressuring advertisers to ratchet up their commitments to filming in high definition. Mike Shaw, president for sales and marketing at ABC, said he was seeing results. Spots are definitely looking better. David Lubars, the chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO North America, said not all movie directors are able to switch nimbly from three-hour epics to 30-second spots, but those who can are eager to pick up the work. Movies take months. Its a big long slog, he said. With commercials, theyre getting in and out in three days, and it exists in a few weeks. From an agencys perspective, moviemakers bring freshness to a campaign, Mr. Lubars said: Working with Hollywood gives you new colors to paint with. Paying for prominent creative talent is a trickier business. A director without big-screen credits typically earns a fixed fee, perhaps $3,000 a day or $30,000 for a project, said Wayne Best, executive creative director at the New York office of Taxi, an advertising agency. For bigger-name talent, however, the size of the fee may depend on how strongly the client wants the director, and it is a gamble whether the money ends up on screen or simply to pay for creative vision.  As advertisers do more with interactive ad campaigns that play well online, animation and special-effects companies are also getting more work. Stan Winston Studios, which handled special effects for movies like Jurassic Park and Pearl Harbor, has seen a big jump in commercial work. J. Alan Scott, an effects supervisor at Winston, said his company handled 123 spots last year, up from 17 in 2002. He said he now spends most of his time on advertising projects. This year, Winston has worked on spots for Circuit City, Sears, Applebees and Burger King, as well as on the 700 figurines in a Microsoft commercial for the video game Halo 3. To put their signature on a spot, moviemakers sometimes borrow from their films. Mr. Anderson, for instance, used actors from his Royal Tenenbaums from 2001 in his recent AT&amp;T ads, while Mr. Mann used the theme music from The Last of the Mohicans in a Nike spot, which features professional football players. Mr. Mann describes his spots for Nike as short films. The decision to make commercials, Mr. Mann said, is a function of something that comes along thats a great idea. He added, A two-hour movie and a spot  I dont make a distinction. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/business/media/14ad.html?ref=nikeinc">The New Advertising Outlet: Your Life<date>Published: October 14, 2007</date><text>STEVE SAENZ used to run a 10K race in 36 minutes.

Since April, Mr. Saenz, 53, has been running with a Nike+, a small sensor in his running shoes that tracks his progress on an Apple iPod he carries. After each run near his home in Louisville, Ky., he docks the iPod into his computer and posts details of his run on the Nike+ Web site. There, he has made friends with other runners around the world who post running routes, meet up in the real world and encourage one another on the site. Nikes famous swoosh is there all along. For Nike, this is advertising. Its a very different way to connect with consumers, says Trevor Edwards, Nikes corporate vice president for global brand and category management. People are coming into it on average three times a week. So were not having to go to them. The success of Nike+ is bad news for the traditional media companies that have long made money from Nikes television commercials and glossy magazine ads. Last year, Nike spent just 33 percent of its $678 million United States advertising budget on ads with television networks and other traditional media companies. Thats down from 55 percent 10 years ago, according to the trade publication Advertising Age. Were not in the business of keeping the media companies alive, Mr. Edwards says he tells many media executives. Were in the business of connecting with consumers. Mr. Edwards may be more blunt than most. But many large marketers are taking huge chunks of money out of their budgets for traditional media and using the funds to develop new, more direct interactions with consumers  not only on the Internet, but also through in-person events. Adventurous companies like Nike have been experimenting with these alternatives since the 1990s. But now, even the most conventional marketers are making these alternatives a permanent  and ever bigger  part of their advertising budgets. Last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson decided to boycott the so-called upfronts, an annual event when advertisers get together with television executives to negotiate for commercial time. In August, General Motors said that 2008 would be the last year for its longtime sponsorship of the Olympics. In May, A. G. Lafley, the chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, told financial analysts that the company would spend less on traditional media and more on its Web site, in-store advertising and promotional events. If you step back and look at our mix across most of the major brands, Mr. Lafley said, it is clearly shifting. Add it up, and the money flowing out of the traditional media is huge  even at a time when ad budgets in general are growing, advertising research shows. The 25 companies that spent the most on advertising over the last five years cut their spending last year in traditional media by about $767 million, according to Advertising Age and TNS Media Intelligence. And in the first half of this year, those companies decreased their media spending an additional 3 percent, or $446 million, to $14.53 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence. True, Nike increased its spending on traditional media in the United States by 3 percent from 2003 to 2006, to $220.5 million. But in the same period, it increased its nonmedia ad spending 33 percent, to $457.9 million, according to the Advertising Age data. Behind the shift is a fundamental change in Nikes view of the role of advertising. No longer are ads primarily meant to grab a persons attention while theyre trying to do something else  like reading an article. Nike executives say that much of the companys future advertising spending will take the form of services for consumers, like workout advice, online communities and local sports competitions. We want to find a way to enhance the experience and services, rather than looking for a way to interrupt people from getting to where they want to go, said Stefan Olander, global director for brand connections at Nike. How can we provide a service that the consumer goes, Wow, you really made this easier for me? BUT media companies rely on advertising to pay the bulk of their programming and newsroom costs. Traditionally, the service provided by advertising was cheaper media content for consumers. But the services of the future may be virtual workout coaches, map applications for cellphones, health advice and matchmaking services. Nike executives portray the shift in strategy as a return to the companys roots in the 1970s, when, in the words of an early magazine ad, Nike grew through word-of-foot marketing. In the early days, Nike displayed posters from local races in stores and was host for local runs on the West Coast. Most early employees at Nike were runners themselves, often disciples of Bill Bowerman, the former college track coach, who founded Nike with Phil Knight, the companys current chairman. In the 1980s, Nike began the large television campaigns that propelled the brand to global fame. Early ones included ads starring Michael Jordan and Spike Lee. Its Revolution ad in 1987 featured the Beatles song of the same name to introduce the Air Max shoe. And the Just Do It series in 1988 showcased images of athletes, including a wheelchair racer and a runner who was 80. In the 1990s, Nike ran ads with Tiger Woods and the United States womens soccer team that inspired fans and became part of sports culture. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E7DA173EF93BA35753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=nikeinc">Corrections: For the Record<date>Published: October 8, 2007</date><text>An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a Nike shoe designed for American Indians misidentified the cities in Oregon that are home to the company's headquarters and to an alternative weekly newspaper that reported on the shoes.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Don Ryan/Associated Press Sam McCracken, a Nike manager, with the Air Native N7. A podiatrists prompting helped spur the development of the shoe. But along with its trademark swoosh, the Nike Air Native N7 features feathers and arrowheads, which bloggers have found off-putting. If this isnt an example of corporate manipulation of race, I dont know what is, wrote one of about 200 readers commenting online about an article that appeared in The Rapid City Journal in South Dakota. There, the response to the article was split. What makes this a ridiculously bad move is decorating it Native American style, added a reader identified as la foi, on the Web site of The Portland Mercury, an alternative weekly. Nike headquarters are seven miles west of Portland, in Beaverton, Ore. They probably brought in a Native consultant and heard what they wanted to hear, which is that Native Americans like sunrises and rainbows and feel real connected to the earth and the night sky and stuff. But one of those consultants, Rodney Stapp, a podiatrist and a member of the Comanche Nation of Oklahoma, begs to differ. There are always going to be negative comments, said Mr. Stapp, who is director of the Dallas Urban Indian Health Center, but most of them are saying that because they are not really familiar with the whole process that Nike went through. Mr. Stapp first contacted Nike several years ago, he recalled, after he discovered that a Nike crosstraining shoe, the Air Monarch, was well suited for his diabetic patients, who had turned up their noses at those big ugly black shoes made specifically for diabetics. (American Indians are more than twice as likely to be diabetic as non-Hispanic whites, according to the Centers for Disease Control.) Mr. Stapp contacted the company, which agreed to provide the shoes to him at their wholesale price of $27.50 rather than the retail price of $60. The clinic, which was financed by the federal government, in turn agreed to provide the sneakers to patients free. Three years ago, Nike approached Mr. Stapp about being part of a team of consultants to design a shoe from scratch. Indians tend to have a wider forefoot, he said, but their heels are about average, which means that when shoes fit in the front, there can be heel slippage in the back. Of course, the shoes will fit many who are not Indians perfectly well, but it is unlikely that they will be able to get their hands (or feet) on them. According to a Nike spokesman, the shoes, which will be shipped starting Nov. 1, will not be available at conventional retail outlets but only through Nikes Native American business program, which distributes through Indian clinics and businesses, many on reservations. Doctors who serve American Indians may have even more cause to nag their patients to exercise than doctors elsewhere. Along with a higher incidence of diabetes, deaths from heart disease are 20 percent higher than in the American population over all, while deaths from strokes are 14 percent higher, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The shoes have an $80 suggested retail price and will be sold to the Native American groups for $42.80. The company says its first run of the shoes, which come in mens and womens models, will be about 10,000 pairs, and that all profits from those sales  estimated at $200,000 at first  will be put into American Indian communities through a Nike athletic program called Let Me Play. While some have taken umbrage at the idea of designing shoes for a specific ethnic group, others take this all less seriously. When I heard it, the first thing I did is I laughed until I cried, because I just though it was hilarious, said Sherman Alexie, a Spokane/Coeur dAlene Indian and a novelist, who is on a book tour for The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, a young adult novel. The day it was announced, I thought: Are they going to have dream catchers on them? Are they going to be beaded? Will they have native bumper stickers on them that say, Custer had it coming? Correction: October 8, 2007 An article in Business Day on Wednesday about a Nike shoe designed for American Indians misidentified the cities in Oregon that are home to the companys headquarters and to an alternative weekly newspaper that reported on the shoes.

Nikes amplified voice has shouted for Michael Jordan but has fallen silent in the service of Michael Vick, who has agreed to plead guilty to dogfighting charges. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Nike The tennis star Serena Williams is one of the women in Nikes new campaign. VideoMore Video » In a campaign that will make its debut Saturday, 18 women step up to a 15-foot-long megaphone with a 3-foot-wide mouthpiece to deliver a unified message: Were athletes, so ditch the female modifier. Are boys bigger, stronger, faster? Yes, says Gabrielle Reece, the beach volleyball player, in the commercial, which was shot in a high school gym in Los Angeles. Is that all that has to do with being an athlete? No. Gretchen Bleiler, the Olympic snowboarder, follows Reece by saying, The halfpipe doesnt care that Im a girl. Alvina Carroll, a streetballer, adds: Its not a girl thing. Its not a boy thing. Its a skills thing. The group commercial will be accompanied on ESPN, MTV and other networks by individual ads starring four athletes (Bleiler, Carroll, Picabo Street and Mia Hamm) and one man (Bill Ressler, a high school girls basketball coach). Eleven more spots, which will include other athletes from the group, will appear in the coming weeks on television and on various Web sites. In her commercial, Street, a gold medalist in skiing at the 1998 Olympics, evokes Doves Real Beauty campaign, which celebrates the shapes of everyday women.  I started building this body when I was 13, she says. I did it on purpose. Mass times velocity equals momentum. When I look in the mirror, I see an athlete. Mass is an advantage. And Im proud of that athlete. A billboard showing two pictures of Serena Williams from the waist up will also be unveiled Tuesday at West 34th Street and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. Between the images, a question is posed: Are you looking at my titles? The campaign is rolling out at the start of the W.N.B.A. playoffs and the United States Open, and in advance of the kickoff of the Womens World Cup in China on Sept. 10. Its time to nudge the conversation, Reece said in an interview. Womens professional sports have plateaued. Ive seen it in beach volleyball; as a league, its been in the same place for a long time. At the grass roots, theyre taking physical education out of schools. The ads were created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy but are unscripted; the athletes were briefed on the broad themes but ad-libbed their parts. Diana Taurasi, a guard for the Phoenix Mercury, said by telephone: They threw us topics about racism, sexism  all the things that are a backlash to womens sports. We freelanced, and I guess it came out powerfully.  Sarah Reinertsen, a triathlete who has worn a prosthetic left leg since she was 7, said the campaign resonated with her. Ive always been fighting to be seen as an athlete but also as a disabled woman, she said in an interview. For so long, I wasnt included in sports, so I feel every person, regardless of gender or disability, has a right to be an athlete. Some of the themes raised in the ads emerged in Nikes interviews with 175 teenage female athletes in major markets around the country this year. They think of themselves as competitors first and want to win as much as their male counterparts, Nancy Monsarrat, Nikes United States brand marketing director, said. But as strong as they are, they had issues about sexism and inequities in the sports they play compared with the males. A campaign aimed at teenage girls is a strategy that helps Nike maintain its hold on female consumers, and comes shortly after Under Armour began a marketing push aimed at the team girls niche. Nike says it has 19 percent of the combined United States and European footwear and apparel markets for women; John Horan, the publisher of the newsletter Sporting Goods Intelligence, said that Nike was far ahead of any of its competitors. Last year, in a whimsical vein, Nike cast Maria Sharapova in a TV ad in which everyone she passed on her way to the United States Open sang I Feel Pretty. But in April, after Don Imuss remarks about the Rutgers womens basketball team, which Nike sponsors, were viewed as racist, the company ran a full-age ad in The New York Times with 10 lines that began, Thank you, ignorance, and continued, Thank you for unintentionally moving womens sport forward. The new campaign broadly continues the debate sparked by Imuss poorly chosen words. The Imus incident was key, Taurasi said. A lot of people still think that way about women athletes. Notes Faith Hill will replace Pink as the singer of Waiting All Day for Sunday Night, which opens NBCs Sunday Night Football. ...

Skip to next paragraph Related Thinking of Joining the Race? (August 9, 2007) Enlarge This Image James Mandolini DASH AND CRASH The Cirrus relay race team comes with a well-appointed camp. Enlarge This Image James Mandolini The Cirrus relay team's camp. Matt DUrso These endurance events also require competitors to be prepared for long stretches in the dark. Her main criteria? Whether or not she wanted to spend an entire day huddled in a van with them, catching up on whos dating whom and lending clean togs to forgetful teammates. Thats because an endurance running relay is a road trip punctuated by bursts of racing, including at least one middle-of-the-night effort. Ms. Ruotolo and her crew of 11 took turns tackling 36 legs, ranging in length from 3.5 to 7.5 miles each, so the bulk of their day was spent in two support vans they rode in between exchange points. Ample time to share tips for running in the dark: follow the bobbing headlamps. It takes a certain kind of person who wants to run through the night, and after 30 hours together you know who you can be lifelong friends with, said Ms. Ruotolo, 29, a graduate student in Manhattan who has done the Hood to Coast twice. Relays, a staple of track and field, are no longer just the province of collegiate speedsters. Now that relays have been expanded to include hundreds of miles and 24-hour time frames, a growing number of runners and mountain bikers are planning vacations around these races. Part of the draw is the relatively short mileage of individual legs, not to mention the bragging rights of racing overnight. Add beer at the finish line, bonfires and live music and its not hard to see why endurance relays have become crowd pleasers. The 12,000 spots for the Hood to Coast event later this month, the largest running relay in the country, filled up in a day. The MyoMed Ragnar Relay race series now involves more than 6,600 runners in four events nationwide, up from 264 at their inaugural 2004 relay through the Wasatch Mountains in Utah. Because of demand, organizers of the Reach the Beach Relay modified the 203-mile course through the White Mountains of New Hampshire this year to accommodate roughly 650 more competitors, bringing the total number of participants to 4,320. Ten 24-hour mountain biking relays, which entail doing laps on a fixed loop, have been sanctioned by USA Cycling this year, but there are dozens more that the governing body doesnt oversee. One is the popular EAS 24 Hours of Moab in Utah, which draws more than 1,400 mountain bikers (and thousands more spectators) each October. Laird Knight, the founder of the Association of Mountainbike Team Relays International, estimates that 20,000 riders will be participating in 24-hour relays this year, up from 12,000 in 2003. In an age when local marathons and century rides are a dime a dozen, destination relay races set in picturesque deserts or mountain ranges are a fresh way for old friends to reunite annually. Youre getting exercise, going on vacation and being social all at the same time, said Don Allison, the editor and publisher of UltraRunning magazine, who has run nine relay races. Besides, misery loves company. Why compete alone when you could be nursing blisters with an old pal? Beyond all the body odor, aching muscles, blisters and sleep deprivation is a genuine sense of community, said Noel Rix, 55, of Hampton, N.H., a relay veteran who helped persuade his employer, Timberland, to sponsor Reach the Beach after running the race. Having teammates also shores up the resolve of competitors. Mr. Knight, president of Granny Gear Productions, the organizer of six mountain biking relays, got two flat tires near the end of a race in West Virginia. All out of tire patches, he said, I ran three miles with the bike, which I never would have done if it was just me in a solo event. Some races double as reunions for college alumni, such as former track and cross-country team members from Bucknell who regularly place in the top 10 at Hood to Coast and Reach the Beach. But even co-workers who share cubicles like to sign up for another 24 hours together. Matt Blair, 32, said mountain biking with colleagues to train for a relay relieved stress at the Tucson design and printing firm where he is the sales director. Different teammates were in charge of bringing alcohol to weekly practice rides on the course itself in the Arizona desert. Some of us were truly riding to get to the beer, he said. Knowing the course (and its pitfalls) is a good strategy, but the real hazard of a relay is the multiple legs. Its not the same as running three short races because you do not recover between your runs, said Warren Finke, 65, a running coach in Tualatin, Ore., who has completed seven relays. The former Olympian Jeff Galloway, a marathon coach with two relays under his belt, cautioned that marathoners would need one to two weeks to recover after a relay, and that it could compromise marathon preparation. Still, bored marathoners love the novelty of a relay, and its comparative ease. Training for a relay, they say, is less taxing than logging miles for an upcoming marathon. After running 15 miles in three legs over 24 hours recently, Marie-Pierre St-Onge, a 32-year-old assistant professor at Columbia University, said it certainly was not as hard as running 15 miles straight. But come race day, cyclists have it tougher. Because their teams usually comprise four to six people (compared with 12 for runners), rest periods are shorter. For me its an endurance game, said Alexandria Fabbro, 43, from Mammoth Lakes, Calif. She prevailed in June, setting a womans course record on her second of four 12.8-mile loops at the 24 Hours of Big Bear in West Virginia. Most participants want to finish quickly for a more tangible reward: beer. Some 90,000 people attend Hood to Coasts party in Seaside, Ore., where exhausted racers dip in the ocean, drink craft brews and listen to live 50s rock music. We share funny stories from the race over a cold beer, Ms. Ruotolo said. And then we all pass out. More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style »</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/sports/football/01sandomir.html?ref=nikeinc">In Endorsements, No Athlete Is a Sure Thing<date>Published: August 1, 2007</date><text>Michael Vick lost another endorsement yesterday because of the dogfighting charges against him. In its divorce petition, Rawlings said everything it needed to about how it weighed jurisprudence against its corporate image. Skip to next paragraph N.F.L. A.F.C. Schedule | N.F.C. Teams | Statistics Transactions A.F.C. Injuries | N.F.C. Discuss the N.F.L. Giants Schedule/Results Statistics | Roster Depth Chart | History Jets Schedule/Results Statistics | Roster Depth Chart | History The company said in a statement that it recognizes that Vick has been convicted of nothing, but “we have determined that ending our relationship with Mr. Vick at this time is necessary.” Translation: There is no “till death do us part” in marriages by endorsement, only “till you doth embarrass us.” Vick, once the Atlanta Falcons’ star quarterback around whom the team was built and whom the owner Arthur Blank adored, has lost his sponsors with stunning alacrity. Nike started the groundswell on July 19, two days after Vick was indicted, vowing not to roll out his Air Zoom Vick V shoe. Then, emboldened by N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell’s telling Vick not to report to training camp on July 23, Nike suspended his deal without pay; Reebok pulled Vick jerseys from retail shelves; Donruss said it would cut Vick from all future trading card products; and Upper Deck removed his autographed memorabilia from its online store and banished him from this season’s card sets. That wasn’t all. In May, during the investigation of dogfighting on his property, AirTran Airways cut him. “Sponsors have almost no choice in this case,” Frank Vuono, a partner in 16W Marketing, a sports marketing company, said. “In the endorsement world, a lot of times, perception is reality.”  But the Vick reality is unlike that of any other misbehaving athlete, and that is the key. He is accused of sponsoring dogfighting and authorizing acts of cruelty against dogs, prompting anger from advocacy groups and pet lovers, and sparking protests at the Falcons’ training camp. More than 165,000 messages were sent to Nike through the Humane Society of the United States to persuade the shoe and apparel company to suspend Vick. Should it surprise anyone that dogfighting is the new taboo? Those who own pets spend billions of dollars on their care. They also give the USA network stellar ratings for the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Can anyone imagine abusing their pets, or those show dogs, for sport? “This is a first so it carries a lot of attention,” said David Carter, principal of the Sports Business Group, a sports marketing consulting company based in Los Angeles. “What gets lost in the concern about a rush to judgment is that while there may be legal concerns, marketing-wise, you have to shoot first and ask questions later. You have to build a moat around your brand.” The reaction to Vick’s dogfighting indictment stuns Don Yaeger, co-author of the book, “Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the N.F.L.” Much of the book focused on domestic abuse by players. “The N.F.L. might suspend them for a game or two, but they’re always welcomed back with open arms,” Yaeger said. “A lot of groups protest violence against women, but they didn’t gather outside camps when the players came back.” Athlete misbehavior informs company decisions. Kobe Bryant lost nearly all his sponsors (Nike put him in a deep freeze) well before the sexual assault charge against him was dropped because the accuser refused to testify. Three years later, he hasn’t recovered his near-Jordanesque marketing profile. His endorsement portfolio is “a fraction of what it should have been now,” Bob Williams, the president of Burns Sports and Entertainment, said. Ray Lewis was accused of murdering two men outside an Atlanta nightclub in 2000 but the Baltimore Ravens’ linebacker received the full support of then-owner Art Modell, who testified to his good character at his bail hearing. The murder charges against Lewis fell apart when witnesses could not tie him to the murder weapon, a knife, and he pleaded guilty to obstructing justice. Paul Tagliabue, then the commissioner, waited two months after the charges were dropped to fine him $250,000.  Lewis had no major endorsements at the time, only a shoe deal and some local contracts. “He wasn’t the face of the league, the way Michael Vick is,” said Lewis’s agent, Roosevelt Barnes. But for a while, he noted, “Ray’s situation was more serious than Vick’s is; human lives were involved.” The next season, Lewis felt the lingering effect of the case; he was the M.V.P. of the Super Bowl, but didn’t get the traditional postgame Disney ad, and was not one of five Ravens on a Wheaties box. Still, he recovered nicely, getting EA Sports and Reebok deals and became a face of the league. Still, had the murder case never happened, Lewis’s marketing appeal would be much stronger. Williams said: “You’d be mentioning him in the same breath as Peyton Manning and Brett Favre.” If Vick manages to beat the charges against him, his marketing revival will rely on whether wary sponsors can forget the indictment’s grisly images of animal abuse. If they can’t, well, there will always be another quarterback.

Yesterday, Nike announced that it had suspended Vicks endorsement contract without pay and would not sell any more Vick-branded products. Vick, who has been indicted in federal court on charges of running a dogfighting ring, has had an endorsement deal with Nike since entering the National Football League as the first overall draft pick in 2001. While Vicks name will all but disappear from the shoe racks, his contract has not been terminated because, a statement released by Nike said, Vick should be afforded the same due process as any citizen in the United States. The Nike statement also said, Nike is concerned by the serious and highly disturbing allegations made against Michael Vick, and we consider any cruelty to animals inhumane and abhorrent. Nike has refused to discuss how much money it pays Vick, although the amount is believed to be considerable. Also yesterday, The Associated Press reported that one of Vicks co-defendants, Tony Taylor, scheduled a plea agreement hearing Monday in federal court in Richmond, Va. Even as Vicks case remains in the public eye  he pleaded not guilty Thursday and his trial is set for Nov. 26  his image will disappear almost entirely from sporting goods stores. Reebok, the maker of the official N.F.L. jersey, said Friday that it would pull Vicks jersey from shelves, a step the Reebok spokeswoman Denise Kaigler told the A.P. that the company had never taken before. Donruss, a major trading card company, has removed Vick from all future 2007 releases. One big reason for Donrusss decision: its owner, Ann Powell, brings her five Labrador Retrievers to the office every day. Sporting goods companies, especially Nike, have come under enormous pressure from animal rights organizations to stop doing business with Vick since he was indicted last week for his suspected role in a dogfighting enterprise based at property he owned in Virginia. Last week, Nike said it would not release Vicks next signature shoe, the Air Zoom Vick V, which was due out in August. But as Vicks case has generated widespread media coverage and the N.F.L. has grappled with whether to discipline him, the Humane Society of the United States said that more than 165,000 messages were sent to Nike through the Humane Societys Web site in the last week asking Nike to sever its relationship with Vick. We are very pleased that Nike has today signaled it has a zero tolerance policy for athletes who may be involved with staged animal fights and other forms of malicious animal cruelty, Wayne Pacelle, the Humane Societys president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. On Thursday, Vick was arraigned in Richmond around the same time the Falcons opened training camp outside Atlanta. Vick had been ordered by Commissioner Roger Goodell to stay away from training camp while the league conducted its investigation. While Vicks playing career is in jeopardy, his once-sterling marketability might be even harder to repair. On Thursday, fewer than a dozen supporters of Vick showed up for the first day of Falcons practice, and they were far outnumbered by his critics. It is possible that Vick will not play at all this season. If convicted, he faces prison time and a lengthy suspension from the N.F.L. Vick was so popular last season that Donruss used his image on its boxes and packaging. The value of his card has frequently ranked among the top N.F.L. players, according to a Donruss spokesman. Now, his card will no longer be contained in the Donruss sets. Earlier in the year, we had an industry trade conference and we were asked whether we would continue to put Pacman Jones and Chris Henry in our set, the Donruss spokesman Scott Prusha said of two N.F.L. players who have been suspended for off-the-field misconduct. Our response was if you dont want to collect those types of people, we wont put them in our set. This was the same situation. Kids collect trading cards of their favorite heroes. We want to send them the right message. The Associated Press contributed reporting.

Blank is so fond of Vick that he once pushed an injured Vicks wheelchair along the sideline. Vicks legal troubles prompted Nike to suspend the release of its latest product line named after Vick. Nike has told retailers it will not release a fifth signature shoe, the Air Zoom Vick V, this summer. Dean Stoyer, a Nike spokesman, said the four shoe products and three shirts that bear Vicks name will remain in stores. Stoyer said that Nike still has a contract with Vick, but declined to speculate on Vicks future with the company. Stoyer, who declined to discuss terms of Vicks contract, indicated the company had no commercials or documentaries planned with Vick, a three-time Pro Bowl selection. A statement released by Nike said the company is concerned by the serious and highly disturbing allegations made against Michael Vick, and we consider any cruelty to animals inhumane and abhorrent. We do believe that Michael Vick should be afforded the same due process as any citizen; therefore, we have not terminated our relationship. The N.F.L. will probably wait for Vicks case to make its way through the legal system before determining what it will do under the leagues personal-conduct policy. Vick will be arraigned on the charges next week in federal court in Richmond, Va. This is an emotionally charged and complicated matter, Blanks statement said. There are a wide range of interests and legal issues that need to be carefully considered as we move ahead, including our need to respect the due process that Michael is entitled to. Also, this situation affects everyone  our club, our players and associates, our sponsors, our fans and the Atlanta community among them  so we must consider all of our customers in making any decisions. Given the differing perspectives and strong feelings around this issue, we probably wont make everyone happy, but we are committed to doing the right thing. As the owner of this club, thats ultimately my responsibility. In the meantime, know that Im saddened and distressed about this not for myself, but for our fans and community who have been so loyal to us. We will do our very best to continue to earn your support. The Associated Press contributed reporting.

The results, which were announced after the close of regular trading, exceeded analysts expectations. Nikes shares, which were up a penny in regular trading, rose as much as $2.78, or 5.2 percent, to $56.60, in after-hours trading. The company, the worlds top maker of athletic shoes and apparel, said quarterly net profit was $437.9 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $332.8 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent, to $4.38 billion. Excluding items, earnings were 90 cents a share. That beat analysts average expectations of earnings of 86 cents, excluding items, on revenue of $4.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sluggishness in the athletic shoe market has been a worry on Wall Street since last year, with Nikes two largest United States customers, Foot Locker and Finish Line, experiencing weakness in same-store sales. Nike has been working on initiatives to help its retail partners and has offered shoes in a broader range of prices to appeal to cost-conscious shoppers.

He is closing his ABCD Camp, the signature summer showcase for high school basketball players that he has run since 1984. The move will have a far-reaching impact on college recruiting this summer and beyond. Skip to next paragraph Ever since Vaccaro, 67, started running high school all-star games in 1965 and later made his name by signing Michael Jordan to Nike in the early 1980s, he has emerged as one of the more controversial and polarizing figures in college athletics. But no one can argue his impact. Vaccaro’s summer camps, created to give talented players widespread exposure, helped jump-start the careers and marketing viability of LeBron James, Tracy McGrady and Kobe Bryant. He has run ABCD with support at one time or another from all three of his former employers and even received support from Converse one year. Since 1991, he has run ABCD out of Hackensack, N.J. “If ever there was a summer to back away, this was the best summer to back away,” said Vaccaro, citing what many believe to be a lackluster class of high school players who will graduate next year. Vaccaro’s camp stressed individual matchups over team play, with games like the one in 2001 featuring James and the former New York City phenom Lenny Cooke that rocketed James to superstardom and spiraled Cooke downward to obscurity. “Sonny being out is a big difference,” Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. “Nike is a bigger and more powerful player,” he added, referring to a rival camp, “but Sonny has been able to overcome that with his personality. I would expect that to change with him out of the picture.” The absence of ABCD Camp during its traditional slot in early July will be the most significant change in a summer filled with them. The camps of three of the major shoe companies say they will emphasize skills and education, a familiar refrain since the United States began struggling in international competition. Nike is moving its July camp from Indianapolis to James’s hometown, Akron, Ohio, and renaming it the LeBron James Skills Academy. Adidas will no longer be holding its showcase camp in Atlanta, but will introduce a team camp in Cincinnati. Reebok, the most recent sponsor of ABCD, will be holding a camp at Philadelphia University known as Rbk U, which will have a decidedly lower emphasis on starmaking than ABCD did. “With the success, the phenomenon, that ABCD had become, we did this in order for us to create our own identity and get out of that shadow,” said Chris Rivers, Reebok’s director of basketball marketing. The reality faced by the camps is that the United States has been falling further behind its counterparts around the world in the game it invented. Whether it is fair or not, summer camps, with their emphasis on individual performance over team play, are frequently cited as a cause for the decline of fundamentals among young players. “I basically did it for the exposure of the kids and allowed the betterment of basketball to conduct its own self,” Vaccaro said of his approach. The former St. John’s coach Fran Fraschilla, now an analyst for ESPN, traveled to Italy earlier this month to work at Reebok’s Euro Camp, a gathering of the top players outside the United States. He said that after seeing the top Europeans play, he returned depressed every year watching American summer basketball because the American players were more concerned with their individual rankings than actually getting better. “Hopefully, those people that wield power in the summer will understand that our game at the moment is broken at the grass-roots level,” Fraschilla said. “If we get more kids worried about improving and less about where they rank, it will filter up the N.B.A. ranks.” Along with being a summer of transition, it will also be one with little star power because of the lackluster class of high school players graduating in 2008. The past two classes have had megawatt players, from the 2006 class of Greg Oden and Kevin Durant to last year’s class, which included the Southern California-bound O. J. Mayo, the Kansas State-bound Michael Beasley and the U.C.L.A.-bound Kevin Love. The most talented high school player in the country may be Renardo Sidney, a 6-foot-9 power forward from the class of 2009. Although he will be attending the Rbk U Camp, the well-established Nike camp is expected to benefit most from Vaccaro’s departure and should attract more talented players. Because of the changes in the camp landscape, college coaches accustomed to shuffling from Northern New Jersey to Atlanta to Indianapolis will now have drastically different itineraries. “There’s still going to be camps,” U.C.L.A. Coach Ben Howland said. “Although the venue has changed somewhat in terms of what they’re doing, there’s still kids being profiled and getting exposure.” It is also not known whether Adidas, which bought Reebok in 2005, will team up with Reebok in its effort to take on Nike. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see in 2008 if you saw some co-branding going on at the grass-roots level,” Rivers said.

ROUNDUP; Humane Society Asks Nike to Drop Vick<date>Published: June 20, 2007</date><text>Nike said it had no plans to drop Michael Vick from its roster of endorsers, despite a request from the national Humane Society to cut ties with Vick over his suspected involvement in dogfighting. Wayne Pacelle, the president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States, yesterday released a letter that he sent to Nike. ''We trust that Nike does not want to be associated with any celebrity who is linked to this odious form of animal cruelty,'' he wrote. Dean Stoyer, a spokesman for Nike, said the company planned to honor its contract with Vick, the Atlanta Falcons' quarterback, who worked with the company to design a line of athletic shoes and has been used prominently in advertising campaigns. EAGLES' LONG SNAPPER RETIRES Mike Bartrum, a tight end and long snapper for the Philadelphia Eagles, retired yesterday, ending a 13-year career that included appearances in the Pro Bowl and the Super Bowl. Bartrum, 36, spent the last seven years of his career with the Eagles after signing with them as a free agent in 2000. He played in 107 games for the Eagles and made the Pro Bowl in 2005 as a special teams selection. Bartrum signed as an undrafted free agent with Kansas City in 1993 and played 188 games with the Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots and the Eagles. He played in Super Bowls with the Patriots and the Eagles. Six of Bartrum's 11 career receptions were touchdowns. Only one other player in N.F.L. history, Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, has as many touchdowns with fewer than 15 career receptions.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31ROW.html?ref=nikeinc">From Nike, Beat-Up Chic<date>Published: May 31, 2007</date><text>THE prevailing mentality among sneaker enthusiasts, which doesnt seem like a lot of fun, is never to wear the most coveted shoes for fear of a smudge. So a new collection of Nikes that look intentionally distressed could be seen as a reaction against the cult of the pristine. Last year, for Junya Watanabes Spring 2007 show in Paris, Nike recreated its classic running shoes from the 1970s to look as if they actually had been made in the 1970s  with yellowed mid-soles and washed-out suede patches. Now the box-fresh, predistressed shoes are going on sale for $220 at Comme des Garçons stores next week. A broader release of $120 styles will reach Barneys New York, Urban Outfitters and Scoop stores in July. A lot of the shoes are inconsistent, so no two pairs are identical, said Jesse Leyva, a product director for Nike. A self-respecting sneakerhead would have to buy them all.  GOODBYE TO BLASS You have to admire a designer like Michael Vollbracht. No matter how little the critics cared for his backward-looking Bill Blass collections, he stuck to his nostalgic vision, even bringing back to the runway 1970s models like Pat Cleveland and Karen Bjornson. But on Friday, after four years of pushing gray flannel pantsuits and gardenia-print chiffon dresses, Mr. Vollbracht folded. I had an epiphany recently, he said. I realized I am the old guard. So Mr. Vollbracht resigned after protracted disagreements with management. He was the third designer to lead the house after Mr. Blass retired in 1999. The labels owners, a brand-management company, had continued to finance a runway collection for the prestige it lent to more lucrative licensed products like eyeglasses and fragrance. Mr. Vollbracht said that he did not understand the new rules of the industry, adding, Im not whats happening. I know I was disliked, but I have no bones to pick with the press, he said. Though my youth is gone and my beauty is gone, my character remains intact. Was he being sarcastic? Oh, I used to turn heads, he said. Ill be 60 in November. For a gay man, thats a huge thing. We become trolls at 45. Uh-oh. Actually, Mr. Vollbracht said, he felt rejuvenated by retirement, most notably by the prospect of having a social life. Ill be ubiquitous, he said. Ill be everywhere. And dont call me just for obituaries, O.K.? More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/24/sports/baseball/24socks.html?ref=nikeinc">With a New Sock, the Red Sox Add Some Distance<date>Published: May 24, 2007</date><text>In 2004 Curt Schillings bloodied socks  the ones he wore that October while he conquered the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals on the way to Bostons first World Series championship in 86 seasons  were the symbol of the Red Sox.

Wild Card Standings Stats: A.L. | N.L. Team Reports Yankees Schedule/Results Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Yankees Mets Schedule/Results Individual Stats | Team History Times Topics: The Mets Now the Red Sox are riding high again, far ahead of the Yankees in the American League East. Appropriately enough, a sock is the team symbol again. Only this time it is a five-toed version popularized by their two new Japanese pitchers  Daisuke Matsuzaka and Hideki Okajima. The socks, which fit like a glove with each toe individually encased, were met with curiosity in Bostons clubhouse during spring training. Before long, Matsuzaka began offering pairs to anyone who expressed an interest. And a number of players did, including Mike Lowell, Álex Cora and Doug Mirabelli, who are now playing in them regularly. Looking for a reason for Bostons great start to the season? Maybe it is the socks. At first they feel kind of weird, Mirabelli said. They got some sticky things on the bottom, like little kids would have on the bottom of their socks. But you get used to them. The socks that Matsuzaka wears are covered with hundreds of tiny rubbery beads on the sole for better traction. As for Okajima, the individual toe slots help with his balance because he can firmly grip each toe, he said. Before the Red Sox played the Yankees on Monday, Matsuzaka ran in the outfield wearing his five-toed socks and no cleats. The pitching coach, John Farrell, could not figure out why, so he asked Matsuzakas interpreter, Masa Hoshino, for an explanation. He likes the feel of the grass on his feet, Hoshino said with a smile. Matsuzaka later said that he runs in socks, without cleats, to improve his balance and footwork. They give me a better feel and perception of the ground, a sensitivity similar to bare feet, Matsuzaka said through Hoshino. Matsuzaka has been wearing the five-toed socks since he signed his first professional contract in 1999, with the Seibu Lions of Japans Pacific League. The socks are popular among professional baseball players in Japan, and versions of them are also common among the general public there. Okajima, who wears only five-toed socks while playing baseball, said they are available in Japanese department stores. Joe Cochran, who has been Bostons equipment and home clubhouse manager since 1992, said he had never seen five-toed socks before this season. Mirabelli, however, recalled seeing Hideo Nomo of Japan wear them when they both played for the Red Sox in 2001. Before each game, Cochran has a clubhouse attendant place a pair of red socks in each players locker. The Red Sox, like every major league team, provide socks, no extra toes, to all players, Cochran said. Players who prefer five-toed socks must make their own arrangements, he added. So far, Matsuzaka appears to be the main distributor of five-toed socks in Bostons clubhouse. His socks are individually made and shipped to him from Japan by his sponsor, Nike. Okajimas socks are supplied by his sponsor, Rawlings. Both sponsors make sure the socks match the teams colors. A Nike spokesman based in Beaverton, Ore., said that Matsuzaka had requested at least a few dozen pairs of socks in various sizes this season, presumably to accommodate his interested teammates. According to Susan Goodenow, a spokeswoman for Major League Baseball, the licenses for official caps, uniforms, undergarments and socks for all 30 teams are held by four sports apparel companies. But players on any team can veer from the official socks, made by Twin City Knitting, and wear a different version as long as the color of the socks conforms to what the team wears and the socks have no visible logos that would contrast with the official sponsor, Goodenow said. Cora had a pair of five-toed socks (red with gray tips) hanging in his locker before Tuesdays game against the Yankees. Each sock included a Nike swoosh that would have been covered by his uniform. The Yankees are not completely sockless in this battle. Hideki Matsui has been wearing five-toed socks for more than 10 years and gets his supply from his sponsor, Mizuno. He has introduced them from time to time to some of his teammates, including Gary Sheffield, now with the Detroit Tigers, and Jason Giambi. Sheff was very curious about it, Matsui said through an interpreter in the Yankees clubhouse Tuesday. He tried some on, and he actually liked it. He still wears it. But looking around here, I dont see anybody wearing it now. Matsui and Okajima played a combined 21 seasons in Japan for the Yomiuri Giants. According to Okajima, the Giants made their players run on a beach during spring training while wearing tabi, which are traditional Japanese socks that separate the big toe from the other toes. Tabi are frequently worn in formal settings like tea ceremonies. Matsuzaka was just getting to know his teammates when he began sharing his socks. So his inspiration was probably to foster camaraderie. Still, his own catcher is a holdout. Jason Varitek said he has never worn five-toed socks and sees no reason to try them now. I dont know why, Varitek said with a shrug. I just dont like the toes separated. But like every other player on the Red Sox, he is happy with the distance between New York and Boston in the standings, currently measured by five toes and 9 ½ games.

The shift of the assignments had been expected since last month, when Nike said it wanted to look beyond its primary creative agency, Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Nike spends about $220 million a year on ads in major media. Crispin Porter, which works for brands like Burger King, Coke Zero and Volkswagen, will create campaigns for Nike shoes as well as for the Nike ID Web site and the Nike Plus shoe. Wieden &amp; Kennedy, which produced campaigns for Nike like ''Just do it,'' will continue as the main agency.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://select.nytimes.com/2007/04/07/business/07nocera.html?ref=nikeinc">Well-Meaning but Misguided Stock Screens<date>Published: April 7, 2007</date><text>In a small, packed meeting room at the Manhattan headquarters of TIAA-CREF, an earnest man named James W. Keady rose to make a speech. TIAA-CREF, as you probably know, is a huge financial services firm, with more than $400 billion in assets. Mr. Keady, 35, a former college soccer player with a master’s degree in theology, is the founder of a group called Educating for Justice, which consists, essentially, of himself and his wife. It has a budget of $80,000. TIAA-CREF’s primary mission is to manage the retirement accounts for over three million academics, researchers, hospital workers and other members of the nonprofit universe. (The initials stand for Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund.) Educating for Justice’s mission is narrower: Mr. Keady wants to bring the giant Nike Corporation to its knees. Or at least to force Nike to drastically improve the pay and working conditions of the thousands of people in developing countries who work in the factories that produce its footwear. In 1997, Mr. Keady was forced off the St. John’s University soccer coaching staff because he objected so strenuously to a multimillion-dollar deal the school was negotiating with Nike. He has made Nike his life’s work ever since, even living in Indonesia for a while to better understand the working conditions of the factory employees. “Nike executives feel certain that the wages earned by people producing Nike products are sufficient for meeting an individual’s basic needs in the local towns where goods are produced,” he said Tuesday at the TIAA-CREF mutual funds shareholder meeting, his eyes ablaze with passion. “Unfortunately, based on Educating for Justice’s ongoing research of the same, we are not as convinced.” Like many activists, Mr. Keady was making his complaint to TIAA-CREF largely because of the firm’s reputation for a kind of genteel activism. It also supports what’s called socially responsible investing: that is, investing in companies that have strong records in areas like the environment and human rights, and avoiding companies with poor records. In 1990, in response to complaints by some of its academic clients who wanted to avoid investing in mutual funds that held oil, tobacco, military and other “bad” stocks, TIAA-CREF began offering its first “socially screened” investment product. It currently has two; one of them, the CREF Social Choice Account, is the largest socially responsible investing vehicle in the country, with $9 billion in assets. And it clearly plans to do more. A few weeks ago, TIAA-CREF came out with an updated policy statement on corporate governance that stressed its desire to “engage with companies on governance, environmental, social and performance issues.” One of its executives, John Wilcox, does nothing but manage the firm’s work in this area. Indeed, after the meeting, Mr. Wilcox approached Mr. Keady, and they huddled for about 10 minutes. Mr. Wilcox listened respectfully, and offered to meet with Mr. Keady for a longer discussion. But then I spoke to Mr. Wilcox, and discovered something that surprised me. Nike, which had been kicked out of TIAA-CREF’s socially responsible funds back when it was first engulfed in controversy over the treatment of workers in overseas factories, was reinstated in the summer of 2005. Which means that TIAA-CREF had come to the view that Nike had earned the right to rejoin the ranks of socially responsible companies. But what, exactly, was that judgment based on? I should concede right here that I’ve always harbored some suspicion about socially responsible investing. The longstanding complaint from skeptics is that it forces investors to accept lower returns — because lots of rising stocks are excluded — for dubious social good. But performance isn’t really the problem. A number of socially screened mutual funds have done just fine, and the benchmark Domini 400 index, which is made up entirely of companies viewed as socially responsible, has actually outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index over the course of its 16-year existence. Besides, most mainstream mutual fund managers don’t consistently beat the market, so why should socially responsible fund managers be held to a higher standard? No, my problem is that socially responsible investing oversimplifies the world, and in so doing distorts reality. It allows investors to believe that their money is only being invested in “good companies,” and they take foolish comfort in that belief. Rare is the company, after all, that is either all good or all bad. To put it another way, socially responsible investing creates the illusion that the world is black and white, when its real color is gray. Take oil companies. It’s fair to say that the socially responsible crowd has no use for energy companies. For years, the only oil company such funds would even consider was BP, because of its early warnings about global warming and its embrace of environmental values. But in 2005, a BP refinery in Texas had a major explosion, killing 15 workers and injuring more than 100 others. And last year, the company spilled oil in the North Slope of Alaska. The world woke up to the fact that BP had a pretty shoddy safety and maintenance record.</text></article></page></root>
