In a year in which NBC’s new corporate owner, Comcast, significantly increased the budget for fall shows, the ratings have continued to slide even as competitors have had success. How bad are NBC’s prime-time ratings? Bad enough that most of the hours on NBC’s schedule, other than the potent “Sunday Night Football” package, have regressed in ratings this season. While every other network has generated a new hit, NBC, which needs hits the most, has not. The already fourth-place rating in the financially crucial area of viewers ages 18 to 49 has dropped on average 11 percent, to a 2.5 (3.1 million) this year, from 2.8 (3.57 million viewers) last year. NBC has also lost more than 800,000 total viewers from last season. Several new shows never got off the ground, like “The Playboy Club” and “Free Agents,” both of which have been canceled. It’s bad enough that without the big ratings supplied by the N.F.L. (which costs NBC more than $600 million a year to buy) NBC would be struggling to stay out of fifth place in the ratings. Without football, NBC is now tied with the Spanish-language network Univision in those 18-49 ratings. To make the grim matters even worse, the only prime-time shows NBC previously owned that posted consistently good numbers, the comedy “The Office,” the drama “Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit” and the reality show “The Biggest Loser” are all down significantly this season. Not coincidentally, important cast members have left all three shows. NBC was not the crown jewel in Comcast’s $13.75 billion purchase of NBC Universal early this year, but there were hopes inside the company and among investors that the new owners might begin to revive the once-mighty network’s moribund prime-time schedule and attract more ad dollars. So far at least, the opposite has happened. In September, the new chief executive of NBC, Stephen B. Burke, told a media conference in California, “No network has ever been as far behind financially as NBC is,” citing prices for prime-time commercials that are consistently 20 percent less than what its competitors can charge advertisers. Comcast’s chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, did not even mention the network on Comcast’s earnings call with investors last week. Instead he raved about the health of the NBC Universal cable channels, which drive the profitability of the division. Those cable assets increased revenues by 12 percent, to $2.1 billion. Robert Seidman, the co-editor of TV by the Numbers, a ratings Web site, said Comcast “knew what it was buying and knew what it was getting with the broadcast network.” But the network Comcast bought had several pillars outside of prime time — the “Today” show, “The Tonight Show” and “Nightly News” — that had weathered the storm. Lately, there have been concerns inside the network that even those stalwarts might finally be subject to fallout from prime time’s underperformance. One senior news executive, who asked not to be identified commenting on the entertainment division, said, “Prime time is painful.” But for the moment at least, those concerns are more about shrinking leads over competitors than shrinking audiences. “Today,” which hasn’t lost a week in the ratings in almost 16 years, has maintained its audience (even adding to it slightly) this season, though the No. 2 show, ABC’s “Good Morning America” had added more viewers and closed what was once a yawning gap to just a sizable one. ABC has also inched closer in the evening news ratings, though NBC has added viewers to that top-rated program as well. In late night, which traditionally has a closer relationship to prime-time ratings, some impact is noticeable. “The Tonight Show” with Jay Leno, which enjoyed more than 15 years of dominance over CBS’s “Late Show With David Letterman” (not counting the period of upheaval when Conan O’Brien replaced Mr. Leno), has fallen behind CBS four weeks out of the first six this season in those 18-49 ratings — the first time that has happened since 1994. 1 2 Next Page »Coming into a new television season, about the only solace for the new management regime at NBC was that the network’s prime-time fortunes had been so bad for so long, things could not get much worse.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/business/media/internet-customers-and-advertising-sales-bolster-comcasts-profits.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Internet Customers and Advertising Sales Bolster Comcast’s Profits<date>Published: November 2, 2011</date><text>Increases in high-speed Internet customers and advertising sales at NBCUniversal’s trove of profitable cable networks helped increase third-quarter profits at the Comcast Corporation, the company said Wednesday.Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator, reported $14.3 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, a 51 percent increase over the same period last year. Net income rose 4.7 percent to $908 million and operating income rose 35 percent to $2.6 billion, driven by 261,000 new high-speed Internet subscribers. The company reported earnings of 33 cents a share. The company said 165,000 customers cut their pay television service, a 40 percent improvement from the 275,000 customers Comcast lost in the third quarter of 2010. Comcast executives said the numbers were proof that viewers were not “cord cutting” and watching television entirely online. Nine months after Comcast took over majority ownership in NBC Universal from General Electric, renaming it NBCUniversal, the acquisition appears to have had mixed impact on earnings. Over all, the division had $5.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 4.6 percent increase, with cable companies like USA, Syfy, CNBC and Bravo providing profit. Revenue at NBCUniversal’s cable division rose 12 percent, to $2.1 billion, while advertising revenue at those networks grew 9.5 percent to $803 million, compared with flat advertising revenue at the broadcast network. The results were not as buoying at NBC, which despite an aggressive fall slate of new shows still ranks as the fourth-most-watched broadcast network in total prime-time viewers. Its revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $1.5 billion. But operating cash flow at NBC, which spent heavily on new shows like the 1960s period drama “The Playboy Club,” dropped 75 percent to $17 million. A Comcast spokeswoman said the drop was because of a bigger investment in prime-time shows, news and local television stations. Comcast’s film unit, Universal Studios, also suffered in the third quarter. Weak box-office sales led to a 7.8 percent decrease in revenue and a 17 percent drop in operating cash flow. Time Warner, which also posted earnings on Wednesday, had better news to report on the film front. The final installment of “Harry Potter” helped the company report a sharp rise in quarterly earnings. In the third quarter of the year, Time Warner’s net income was $822 million, or 78 cents a share, a 57 percent increase over the same quarter last year, when it was $522 million, or 46 cents a share. Total revenue rose 11 percent to $7.07 billion, from $6.38 billion, which the company said represented its highest rate of growth in four years. The July release of “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” the highest-grossing film of the year and one of the highest on record, received much of the credit for the gains. The film was the last of eight in the “Harry Potter” series, which Time Warner’s chief executive, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, said had enjoyed an “unprecedented franchise run.” Warner Brothers reported a 19 percent overall rise in revenue, to $3.3 billion, over the same quarter last year. The unit also includes television production. In a conference call with investors on Wednesday, Time Warner executives singled out the sitcom “The Big Bang Theory,” produced by Warner Brothers and televised by CBS, as a profit center. In September, the show started replaying in syndication on Time Warner’s comedy-oriented cable channel TBS and performed solidly. “We expect it’ll be a strong contributor to the profitability of the division for years to come,” said John K. Martin, the chief financial officer of Time Warner, referring to the Warner Brothers division. The television networks unit, normally the company’s biggest, reported a 7 percent increase in revenue, to $3.2 billion. But operating income dipped 4 percent in the quarter, in part because the company spent more on new shows, on sports rights and on marketing. The company’s smaller publishing unit, Time Inc., reported a 1 percent decline in revenue, to $889 million. The print ad market “appears to have stabilized,” Mr. Martin said. Underperformers in the quarter included the big cable channels TNT and TBS, and the film “Green Lantern.” Despite a dour economic backdrop, the company raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. In August, it projected that adjusted earnings, $2.41 a share last year, would grow by “at least low teens;” on Wednesday it said those earnings would grow by the “high teens.” Analysts expect 15 percent growth, to $2.78 a share.Increases in high-speed Internet customers and advertising sales at NBCUniversal’s trove of profitable cable networks helped increase third-quarter profits at the Comcast Corporation, the company said Wednesday.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/comcast-posts-4-7-profit-with-mixed-results-from-nbcuniversal-acquisition/?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Posts 4.7% Profit, With Mixed Results From NBCUniversal Acquisition<date>November 2, 2011, 7:27 am</date><text>4:51 p.m. | Updated An increase in high-speed Internet customers and NBCUniversal’s trove of profitable cable networks helped increase third-quarter profits at the Comcast Corporation, the company announced Wednesday. Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator, reported $14.3 billion in revenue in the quarter that ended in October, a 51 percent increase over the same period last year. Net income rose 4.7 percent to $908 million and operating income rose 35 percent to $2.6 billion, driven by 261,000 new high-speed internet subscribers. The company reported that 165,000 customers cut their pay-television service, a 40 percent improvement from the 275,000 customers Comcast lost in the third quarter of 2010. The company reported earnings of 33 cents a share.

Over all, the division had $5.2 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 4.6 percent increase, with cable companies like USA, Syfy, CNBC and Bravo driving profit. Revenue at NBCUniversal’s cable division rose 12 percent, to $2.1 billion. Advertising revenue at those networks grew 10 percent to $803 million, compared with flat advertising revenue at the broadcast network. The results were more sobering at NBC, which despite an aggressive fall slate of new television shows still ranks as the fourth-most watched broadcast network in total prime-time viewers. Its revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $1.5 billion. But operating cash flow at NBC, which spent heavily on expensive new dramas like the 1960s period drama “The Playboy Club,” — canceled after three episodes — dropped 75 percent to $17 million. A Comcast spokeswoman said the drop was because of a bigger investment in prime-time shows, news and local television stations. The unit’s Universal Studios also suffered in the third quarter. Weak box office sales led to a 7.8 percent decrease in revenue and a 72 percent drop in operating cash flow. In the third-quarter last year, Universal had the hit “Despicable Me,” which grossed $543 million worldwide, according to the Web site Box Office Mojo. Universal Studios theme parks got a lift because of the new “Wizarding World of Harry Potter” park in Orlando park and a 3-D King Kong attraction at the Universal City, Calif. location, the company said. The average Comcast cable subscriber paid $138.58 per month in the third quarter, up 8 percent from last year. Customers continue to cut their basic cable subscriptions, but at a slower rate than last year. Comcast executives said the numbers were proof that viewers were not “cord cutting” and watching television entirely online. Comcast shares were up 33 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.30 in midday trading.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/us/comcast-offers-low-cost-internet-access-to-poor-families.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Offers Low-Cost Internet Access to Poor Families<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>As public schools in Chicago have shifted their focus to online learning, the benefits have been blunted by the fact that home access to the Internet costs too much for some students, leading districts to look for different approaches to bring Internet access to the city’s poorest families.“We believe many of our students have computers at home, but that doesn’t mean anything if they don’t have Internet,” said Todd Yarch, principal of Voise Academy High School. “The whole idea for online blended learning” — with the curriculum online, students on computers in the classroom, and teachers serving as coaches — “is to allow students to continue at their own pace,” he said. “If you give them that ability to move at their own pace at home, that would be huge.” Voise Academy, in the Austin neighborhood, is the district’s first high school to use this blended model. Each student has a laptop, but the computers are kept at Voise Academy because of concerns that they will be stolen by thieves outside of the school. But even if they were taken home, the laptops would be useless for many of the Voise Academy students. More than 95 percent of them qualify for the federal free-lunch program, and Mr. Yarch estimates that only half of the school’s 500 students have Internet access at home. Some possible help emerged in May when Comcast, the phone, cable television and Internet provider, began offering low-cost broadband service to every family with children in Chicago public schools who qualify for the federal lunch program and who have not recently subscribed to the company’s Web service. Families who qualify get Internet access for $9.95 per month, roughly one-fifth the cost of Comcast’s basic Internet-only plan. They can also buy a computer from Comcast for $149.95. Comcast would not say how many families had taken advantage of the offer, citing potential competition. The company began offering the program across the nation in July. A phone survey commissioned by the City of Chicago in 2008 found that home broadband use in wealthier North Side neighborhoods often exceeded 80 percent, but that in many areas on the South and West Sides, fewer than half the homes had broadband service. Results of a similar survey taken this year have not been released. Amelia Tsang, who works on such issues for the Gads Hill Center, a community group in the Pilsen neighborhood, said the so-called digital divide is a significant problem for schools that rely on technology to educate students. “It is apparent in the communities that we serve that a lack of access to technology hurts families,” Ms. Tsang said. “Without Internet access, these families don’t have access to basic services, don’t have ways to find jobs or help their children with education.” Teachers at Voise Academy and other schools where technology is central to the curriculum said the Comcast plan is a way to help remove a family’s low income as a barrier to educational success. Brenda Alexander, whose son and granddaughter attend Voise, said the offer helps level the playing field. Her son has Internet access at home; she made it a priority and pays full price. Her granddaughter, who lives with Ms. Alexander’s daughter, does not yet have access. “It’s about breaking down the dollars,” Ms. Alexander said. “Families always have to decide what is more important. Of course, this program will help my family.” Sharnell Jackson, an online-education consultant who formerly led such efforts for Chicago’s public schools and helped found Voise Academy, says it is important that the Comcast program seeks to address the digital divide by making home Internet affordable but not free. “It’s a better opportunity because people have to have skin in the game,” Ms. Jackson said. “If you give people Internet for free, they will never get a sense of a return for investment.” Some people, though, are concerned that a corporation is playing such a large role in providing a basic tool of the public school curriculum. “We don’t want corporations to be filling in the gaps for what should be provided by local, state and federal governments,” said Jackson Potter, staff coordinator of the Chicago Teachers Union. Comcast’s promotion of the initiative, he said, turns students into tools of the company’s marketing campaign. “We don’t want to brand students,” Mr. Potter said. But Ms. Jackson said having Internet access “opens up educational opportunities, giving students access to classes they wouldn’t otherwise have.” “It would better differentiate instruction for each individual student,” she said.

The plan would have offered the film on Comcast digital services in Atlanta and Portland, Ore., just three weeks after its Nov. 4 theatrical release, for a premium price of $59.99. But it drew immediate objections from exhibitors, who have fiercely resisted studio attempts to put some films on satellite and cable services while they are still in theaters. Several chains, including Cinemark, one of the country's largest, had said they would not book ''Tower Heist'' if Universal went ahead with the test. In a statement on Wednesday, Universal said that it was delaying what it called an on-demand ''experiment,'' but that it continued to believe that theatrical viewing and premium on-demand services ''are business models that can coincide and thrive.'' The high price of on-demand shows suggests they are aimed at group viewing at home. John Fithian, the president of the National Association of Theater Owners, thanked Universal in a statement ''for responding to various theater owners' concerns and canceling'' the test. The trade association is barred by law from coordinating business decisions among its members, but it has made clear its intention to protect the exclusive window of about 120 days in which theaters typically show a movie without competition from other media. Comcast, a cable giant that took control of NBC Universal earlier this year, has been closely watched as a potential leader in moving film studios toward more aggressive use of online and cable outlets. Even before Comcast assumed control, however, Adam Fogelson, Universal's chairman, had been exploring the early release of films to on-demand services. Earlier this year, Universal joined Sony Pictures Entertainment, 20th Century Fox and Warner Brothers in striking an arrangement under which DirectTV was to release some films two months after their theatrical release, for about $30 a showing. A handful of movies, like Sony's ''Just Go With It,'' with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler, were selected for a first, largely experimental round of premium showings. It remains unclear whether any substantial revenue was raised by them. ''Tower Heist'' stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy, among others, and is directed by Brett Ratner. Already, it has attracted more than its share of attention, as Mr. Murphy was recently named the host of next year's Oscar broadcast, and Mr. Ratner is one of its producers. But the Universal on-demand plan, word of which surfaced in press reports earlier this month, brought more resistance among exhibitors. In his statement, Mr. Fithian said his organization recognized that studios needed to find new ways to shore up a sagging home entertainment market, and would work with distributors and exhibitors ''for their mutual benefit.'' Universal stressed that it still expected to work out a viable on-demand plan with the help of theater owners. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/universal-delays-on-demand-test-plan/?ref=comcastcorporation">Universal Delays On-Demand Test Plan<date>October 12, 2011, 3:03 pm</date><text>9:27 p.m. | Updated LOS ANGELES — For Comcast, it was a hard lesson in movie industry politics: on Wednesday its Universal Studios unit, under severe pressure from theater owners, suddenly tabled a plan to allow the early release on video-on-demand of its forthcoming film “Tower Heist” in two test markets.

Roberts says he continues to believe that “our timing was just right.” In part because of the acquisition, Comcast’s revenues for the second quarter rose 51 percent, to $14.3 billion, the company said on Wednesday. Cable and Internet subscribers are responsible for the bulk of the company’s revenue and cash flow, but the new NBC businesses showed a faster rate of growth than the subscription businesses in the quarter. Comcast’s net income rose to $1.02 billion, or 37 cents a share, from $884 million, or 31 cents a share, in the same quarter last year. Excluding costs related to the NBC deal and a one-time tax charge, the earnings were 42 cents a share. Mr. Roberts said that the cable company was benefiting from the “continuing strength of many of their businesses, particularly the cable channels with their wonderful brands.”  Comcast, which is the nation’s biggest cable television distributor, posted a 1.3 percent increase in cable subscription revenue for the quarter, thanks to higher monthly rates and a higher number of customers who are opting for more expensive packages. Still, the company lost 238,000 cable subscribers, continuing a cable industry trend as customers gravitate instead to satellite and telecommunications distributors. The company noted that the subscriber loss has been slowing down for the better part of a year. The company continued to add customers, however, on the high-speed Internet side of the business, with 144,000 added in the quarter.  Michael McCormack, an analyst at Nomura, said Comcast’s customer metrics “should be a relief given the recent softness” in the metrics reported by a competitor, Time Warner Cable, last week.  On the NBC side, both Mr. Roberts and the NBCUniversal chief executive Stephen B. Burke characterized this year as an investment year.  “We think the business, particularly on the broadcast side, has not gotten the investment necessary to really compete,” Mr. Burke told analysts Wednesday morning. “So I think our focus right now is on product and making sure that we have a competitive NBC primetime schedule; making sure that the stations have the right kind of resources to be competitive in the local markets.”  Mr. Burke cited the success of the NBC reality show “The Voice” as a case where increased investment paid off.  Comcast’s main interest in NBCUniversal is in its cable channels like USA and Bravo, which have been profit centers for years now. Mr. Burke noted that two USA shows that were green-lighted for production after the acquisition closed in January, “Suits” and “Necessary Roughness,” had become “top 10 cable shows” this summer. It has been six months since Comcast gained control of NBCUniversal from General Electric, and the Comcast chief executive Brian L. Roberts says he continues to believe that “our timing was just right.” </text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/sports/versus-renamed-again.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Versus Renamed Again<date>Published: August 1, 2011</date><text>First, the channel was called the Outdoor Life Network; then it turned into OLN and then it became Versus.

Al Sharpton to lobby for its bid for NBCUniversal. This year, the cable news channel owned by NBCUniversal, MSNBC, is weighing whether to make him a daily television host.The possible transition for Mr. Sharpton — from political influencer to television talent — highlights the complex relationships that can arise when cable news channels employ activists who take sides instead of journalists who don’t. Mr. Sharpton, the president of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization, was one of the many activists and boldface names who agreed to support Comcast as it sought government approval for its takeover of NBCUniversal. The Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, and the head of the company’s lobbying effort, David L. Cohen, met with Mr. Sharpton and other representatives of minority groups to talk about their bid early last year. That meeting, Mr. Sharpton said later, was the most important factor in his decision to support Comcast and urge the Federal Communications Commission to approve the NBC deal. Comcast then used the support of Mr. Sharpton and other civil rights activists to promote the proposed merger to government officials. Rarely, if ever, has a cable news channel employed a host who has previously campaigned for the business goals of the channel’s parent company. But as channels like MSNBC have moved to more opinionated formats, they have exposed themselves to potential conflicts. (The hosts Keith Olbermann, before he left MSNBC, and Joe Scarborough were briefly suspended in 2010 when it was reported that they had made political donations.) MSNBC said in a statement this week, “There is no agreement with Mr. Sharpton to host a program; however, it is important to note that Comcast plays no role in either the independent editorial decision-making of MSNBC or the selection of its hosts.” Separately, Comcast said in a statement, “Comcast pledged from the day we announced the transaction that we would not interfere with NBCUniversal’s news operations, including at MSNBC. We have not and we will not.” Mr. Sharpton has been a guest host for the 6 p.m. hour on MSNBC for most of the last month, effectively replacing Cenk Uygur, who confirmed last week that the channel had decided not to give him the time slot permanently. Executives at MSNBC say they believe that Mr. Sharpton, a regular guest on the channel for years, may shore up the ratings at 6 p.m., a crucial hour that helps to set up the channel’s prime-time programming. But they emphasized that no decision had been made on hiring Mr. Sharpton. He said he had not been paid for his role as a guest host. Mr. Sharpton threw his organizational weight behind the Comcast bid for NBC twice, first in his letter to the F.C.C. in May 2010, which said that his group had “for several years” had a “productive, honest and open dialogue at the highest levels of the company,” referring to Comcast, “and we are confident that this positive relationship will continue to prosper after the joint venture is approved.” In December 2010, in the final stretch of the merger review, Mr. Sharpton reaffirmed his support when the National Action Network and other African-American leadership groups signed on to a diversity action plan with Comcast. The plan included a commitment by Comcast to seek “the expanded participation of minorities on its news and public affairs programming.” To that end, Comcast said it would consider suggestions from its newly established diversity councils, including the National African American Diversity Council. That council includes Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the chairman of the National Action Network, but not Mr. Sharpton. In a telephone interview this week, Mr. Sharpton said there was no connection between his past support for Comcast and his current role as a host for MSNBC. “How could there be a connection?” he asked, noting that at the time of the merger review, there were no open time slots on the channel. In April, Mr. Sharpton presented a National Action Network award to Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. Mr. Sharpton dismissed any connection there, too: “The year before, we honored Jeff Zucker,” he said, referring to the former chief executive of NBCUniversal. “Did Zucker give me ‘S.N.L.’?” Mr. Sharpton said that if he were to join MSNBC, he would not leave the National Action Network, but would abstain from decisions that conflicted with his position in television. Reports last week about Mr. Sharpton’s impending hiring created a stir among some black journalists who say that cable news channels had shortchanged minorities for many years. On its Web site last week, the National Association of Black Journalists wrote that while Mr. Sharpton was about to advance to a permanent position, “there are no black journalists who can tout a similar promotion.”Last year, Comcast was lining up the Rev. Al Sharpton to lobby for its bid for NBCUniversal. This year, the cable news channel owned by NBCUniversal, MSNBC, is weighing whether to make him a daily television host.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/22/opinion/22fri2.html?ref=comcastcorporation">To Cap Broadband, or Not<date>Published: July 21, 2011</date><text>As people do more with their broadband connections — streaming movies, downloading music, moving files to and from the cloud — it might seem natural for Internet service providers to impose data caps on users to manage their networks and deal with congestion.

This strategy follows closely the path of wireless broadband, where both Verizon and AT&amp;T have replaced unlimited data plans with tiered offerings. But wireline data caps warrant a close look by federal regulators. They are billed as a way to manage traffic, but they could also hamstring the user’s experience, blunt competition online and stymie innovation on the Internet.

Some users have a choice between a cable company and a phone company. In many areas they have no choice. Caps should not just be a way for Internet providers to extract monopoly rents.

Suzanne Plunkett/Bloomberg NewsDavid Blitzer. A group led by Joshua Harris, a co-founder of the private equity firm Apollo Global Management, announced late on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement to buy the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team from the sports company Comcast-Spectacor. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but Mr. Harris and his partners will pay about $280 million for the 76ers, according to a person briefed on the deal who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss it publicly. The deal is subject to approval by the National Basketball Association board of commissioners. “We are honored to have the opportunity to be affiliated with this storied franchise,” Mr. Harris said in a statement. “As a basketball fan who attended college in Philadelphia, and with family roots here, I have always felt a strong connection to this city and the 76ers.” The 76ers purchase comes as the N.B.A. lockout enters its third week with the league unable to reach a new collective bargaining agreement with its players. Mr. Harris’s group includes a large investment from David Blitzer, a senior executive at the private equity firm Blackstone Group. Both graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and have long rooted for the 76ers. Mr. Harris, 46, grew up in Chevy Chase, Md.; Mr. Blitzer, 41, in Scotch Plains, N.J. Mr. Harris now resides in Manhattan and Mr. Blitzer, who has lived in London for several years, is moving back to New York later this summer. Each is making a personal investment; their firms, which are both based in New York, are not involved in the transaction. Other members of Mr. Harris’s group include Art Wrubel, also a Wharton graduate and a portfolio manager at Wesley Capital, a real-estate focused hedge fund; and Jason Levien, a former agent for N.B.A. players and an executive with the Sacramento Kings. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink The acquisition does not include the Wells Fargo Center or the Philadelphia Flyers, which will still be owned by Comcast-Spectacor. The transaction is just the latest in which a private equity or hedge fund player has purchased a professional sports team. Tom Gores, the head of Platinum Equity, bought the Detroit Pistons basketball team last month for about $325 million. (Platinum is involved in that investment.) And David Einhorn, the head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, is buying a minority stake in the New York Mets baseball club. These owners join a handful of other money men that own teams. The Boston Celtics ownership group consists mostly of private equity and venture capital executives, many of them from Bain Capital. And the Boston Red Sox principal owner is the hedge fund manager John Henry. Both Mr. Harris and Mr. Blitzer are athletes in their own right. Mr. Harris ran in last year’s New York City Marathon, finishing the race in 3:53. Mr. Blitzer, for his part, is one of the best all-around athletes at Blackstone, a fact this reporter can verify based on personal experience.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/14/business/media/14comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast and Skype to Offer Video Calls on TV<date>Published: June 13, 2011</date><text>In the cable television industry’s latest extension into home communication, Comcast and Skype announced on Monday that some Comcast customers would soon be able to video chat on their TV sets from the comfort of their living rooms.Comcast will conduct a trial of the Skype service this year and make it widely available to its customers sometime next year. The companies said the Skype-on-TV feature was part of a “strategic partnership,” but did not share further details or pricing information. New features like video chatting and on-screen apps are expected to be talked about at the cable industry’s annual conference in Chicago this week. For Comcast, the deal is a way to stay current with viewers’ behavior as they use their TV sets for much more than passive TV watching. For Skype, the deal is a foothold in the millions of homes that are served by Comcast, the nation’s largest cable provider. Skype and Microsoft, which said last month it had agreed to acquire Skype, are said to be interested in further expanding Skype’s presence in homes. “By combining Comcast’s broad living room reach with Skype’s innovative communications platform and worldwide community of users, we can bring video calling into the heart of the home, allowing people to share life’s experiences both big and small,” Tony Bates, the chief executive of Skype, said in a statement. Many cable companies have promoted digital phone call functionality and features that show caller ID information on the TV screen. But the Comcast-Skype deal is one of the first forays into video calls. For customers with Comcast’s phone service, their address books could potentially be moved into the Skype-on-TV service. In a nod to the viewers who might want to chat while they watch TV, Comcast customers would be able to make Skype calls and send instant messages while watching TV. Cable companies like Comcast have been trying to figure out how to make it easier to chat while watching shows. Comcast will provide a video camera to Skype-on-TV customers, but it will not be necessary to use that camera. Skype is already embedded in some state-of-the-art television sets. The company says it will also be possible to switch Skype conversations from one screen, like a cellphone, to another screen, like a television or tablet computer.In the cable television industry’s latest extension into home communication, Comcast and Skype announced on Monday that some Comcast customers would soon be able to video chat on their TV sets from the comfort of their living rooms.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/media/09comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Said to Be In Talks to Sell G4 Cable Channel<date>Published: June 8, 2011</date><text>Comcast is in talks to sell a controlling interest in the G4 cable channel to the Ultimate Fighting Championship.It is unclear how close the parties are to a deal, but representatives of the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Comcast’s NBCUniversal division were said to have met in New York on Wednesday, according to three people with knowledge of the talks.

In 1992, an NBC Sports executive named Terry O’Neil coined the term “plausibly live,” a dastardly euphemism for tape delay — a policy that soon showed cracks in its video foundation. Now, NBC must live by its live Olympics vow — without exploiting loopholes or making any platform, especially online, difficult for fans to gain access to. And it should jump-start that plan next year at the Summer Games in London, which, because of its time zone, is ripe for tape delay. Imagine vowing all-live in 2014, but not doing it in 2012? Going live was an inevitable decision the day Comcast, NBC’s new owner, successfully bid $4.38 billion to acquire the rights to each Olympic Games from 2014 to 2020. NBC had not promised in advance of the Olympic auction that it would go live as ESPN and Fox had promised. Perhaps Comcast needed its rivals to end the era of tape delay. But more likely, Comcast looked at its existing assets (broadcast and cable channels and streaming video) and wondered why NBC had so long resisted the live Olympics. “Live comes across as more honest, with blemishes and mistakes,” said Mike Weisman, who produced NBC’s nearly all-live 1988 Summer Games from Seoul, South Korea, at a time when the network had no cable partners and there was no Internet to stream video. “Taped comes off as flawless,” said Weisman, who was the executive producer of NBC Sports in the 1980s. “If you make a mistake in production, you can correct it; announcers have time to prepare comments; sloppy camera shots can be eliminated.” Tape-delaying the Olympics became standard procedure, especially from European cities. During his 22 years running NBC Sports, Dick Ebersol adopted and adapted the formula he learned at ABC Sports under Roone Arledge (in the pre-cable era), and it often generated spectacular viewership. If people complained more and more in recent years, he reasoned, it was a small minority who probably watched anyway. If true, that was because fans could not see the highlights anywhere else. He was sensitive to media criticism that Canadian viewers could watch the Olympics live on the CBC. One day in 2000, I recall Ebersol taking a break from the control room at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. He was exhausted and angry as he defended a tenet of televising the Olympics that he felt he understood better than anyone: saving the best for prime time. “I don’t gain anything by criticizing CBC,” he said, but he added that articles about CBC’s live broadcasts “don’t follow up with its business results, which are a disaster. When 100,000 people out of 32 million people watch, it’s a disaster.” Eleven years later, Comcast figures that in the post-Ebersol era, the population of core Olympic sports viewers who watch figure skating at 9 a.m. Eastern from Sochi, Russia, at the 2014 Winter Games will not cannibalize viewership for the prime-time taped recap where advertisers spend the most. Comcast has also determined that viewers in the Pacific and Mountain time zones have suffered enough. In the past, they knew that whatever NBC carried live in prime time to the Eastern and Central time zones was tape-delayed to them. While they watched it all on tape, it was never fair, simply because prime time in New York is just 5 p.m. in San Diego. We call this progress, albeit delayed by a decade or more. If the era of tape delay is over, it is worth recalling an incident from the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. “The Picabo Street thing haunts me,” said Rick Gentile, who ran CBS Sports’s Olympic unit that year. Street’s gold-medal super-G race was starting at about the time CBS’s late-night Olympics show was ending. “I had a conscious decision,” he said. “I could put it on the network, but who was going to watch at 2:30 in the morning? We didn’t, and I didn’t air it until nearly 24 hours after it happened. In the meantime, she’d done every show in America, holding her skis and gold medal.” Weisman said the live treatment can be thrilling to a producer and to a viewer. In Seoul, a melee broke out after a boxing match. He recalled: “My boxing producer, David Neal, says, ‘We’ve got to go to boxing, there’s a riot.’ So in the middle of what we’re doing, we go there, and it was terrible. I heard Marv Albert say: ‘They’re throwing things. We are underneath the ring.’ It’s live, and it’s scary. If it was a taped Olympics, we would have handled it as a report. You’d do it for a minute and said it lasted longer. But we didn’t know if it was going to end in three minutes or an hour. We took the audience along.” E-mail: sandor@nytimes.comThe pledge offered by NBC on Tuesday was that in 2014 it will carry the Olympics live.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/ufc-holds-talks-for-g4-cable-channel/?ref=comcastcorporation">UFC Holds Talks for G4 Cable Channel<date>June 8, 2011, 8:09 pm</date><text>Comcast is in talks to sell a controlling interest in its low-rated G4 cable channel to the Ultimate Fighting Championship, Brian Stelter reports on Media Decoder.

But he has been best known for his work with the Olympics, and his departure could significantly change what is expected to be a vigorous battle for the television rights for the next two Games. On June 6, he was to lead a contingent of executives from NBC and its parent company, Comcast, to Lausanne, Switzerland, for an auction for the 2014 and 2016 Olympics. He will not be making that trip. “If I wasn’t going to produce them,” he said Thursday, “I wasn’t going to be part of the process.” This will be Comcast’s first Olympic bid since the company took over NBC Universal earlier this year. No executive since Roone Arledge of ABC Sports, once Mr. Ebersol’s mentor, has been more closely identified with the Olympics than Mr. Ebersol. He developed a close friendship with Juan Antonio Samaranch, the former president of the International Olympic Committee. He controlled the Games’ production, oversaw their storytelling and expanded on Arledge’s tape-delay approach of showing major Olympic sports to get the highest ratings in prime time — the subject of some of the most vocal criticism of his career. He usually ignored the complaints because the practice was good business. He followed Mr. Arledge’s lead in personalizing Olympic athletes, believing that viewers would be attracted to stories about competitors from around the world. He had led the bidding for the Olympics since he acquired the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. In 1995, he made a stealthy trip to see Samaranch in Sweden to grab the 2000 and 2002 Summer and Winter Games, and just months later, orchestrated a pre-emptive bid for three more Olympics through 2008. He spent billions in the service of beating the competition in prime time. The effect of Mr. Ebersol’s resignation on Comcast’s ardor for the Olympics is not yet clear. It will compete with ESPN, a unit of the Walt Disney Company, and Fox Sports, part of News. Corp., at the auction. Both lost in 2003 when NBC lavishly outbid them with a $2.2 billion offer for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games and 2012 London Summer Games. Comcast heads into the auction a little cautious; NBC lost $223 million on the Vancouver broadcast. “Look, we’re not crazy about the timing,” said Richard Carrion, the I.O.C. member who is in charge of the bidding. “I’m a little saddened by the news. I can’t tell you I’m happy. Dick is a great friend of the Olympic movement; he understands it, and knows how to tell the stories.” But David Hill, chairman of the Fox Sports Media Group, said: “I love Dick to death, but I don’t think his absence will make a skerrick of difference. They have a natural leader in Mark Lazarus; he’s smart, savvy and experienced.” Mr. Lazarus was named to replace Mr. Ebersol as chairman of the NBC Sports Group. Mr. Ebersol’s career began at ABC Sports, where he met Mr. Arledge. He joined NBC in 1975 as an entertainment executive. He was charged with creating a program to fill the late-night hours, which became “Saturday Night Live.” His biggest contribution was to hire Lorne Michaels to produce it. When Mr. Michaels briefly left the show in the 1980s and the show teetered close to cancellation, Mr. Ebersol became its producer. He left NBC to create an independent production company that produced, among other programs, “Friday Night Videos,” and “Later,” a talk show with Bob Costas. Mr. Ebersol returned to NBC to run its sports division in 1989. He acquired the rights to the N.B.A. to make up, in part, for the loss of Major League Baseball, a former mainstay at the network. Over his 22-year tenure, he eventually dropped N.B.A. rights; retained, dropped, then reacquired the rights to the N.F.L.; ventured into a money-losing partnership with World Wrestling Entertainment on the XFL, a bizarre football league; brought baseball back to NBC, then got out; and dove into Nascar before dropping the sport. 1 2 Next Page »Dick Ebersol, who had defined NBC’s formidable Olympic presence since the mid-1990s and who was the last of the high-profile TV sports impresarios, resigned abruptly on Thursday after negotiations on a four-year contract collapsed.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/nyregion/bombfest-music-festival-moves-to-comcast-theater.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Bombfest Music Festival Moves to Comcast Theater<date>Published: May 14, 2011</date><text>MEMORIAL DAY weekend will bring the third installment of Bombfest — an acronym for Bring Our Music Back Festival. But instead of bringing the music back to Durham, where the multigenre festival was held last year, the event’s founders, Frank Bombaci and his son, also named Frank Bombaci, will be delivering headliners like Weezer, Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg to Hartford.Specifically, to the Comcast Theater, which can accommodate 18,000 people, or about 8,000 more than the Bombacis, whose nonprofit festival drew 7,000 to the Durham Fairgrounds last year, are expecting. “Basically we were looking for places to expand after last year’s festival,” said the elder Mr. Bombaci, 58, “and back in November or December we found Western Connecticut State University in Danbury. But as things evolved, they decided they no longer wanted to host this event” because of traffic and capacity concerns. That decision was made on March 31. By mid-April — “after the most stressful two and a half weeks of my life,” he said — they had secured the Comcast Theater. The larger site has brought about some growing pains, Mr. Bombaci acknowledged. “It’s not a traditional festival site, and we want to make sure we maintain a festival feel,” he said. To that end, “they’re letting us bring in additional food vendors, and we’ll have crafters and artisans to give it that kind of vibe.” But more than making up for any lapses in vibe, Mr. Bombaci said, will be the music: In addition to well-known acts like the New Pornographers, Coheed and Cambria, and George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, Bombfest will host 25 local bands, also representing a jumble of genres, on four stages. “The second we heard they were looking for local bands, we put an application in and crossed our fingers,” said Jesse Stanford, the front man for Heirlooms, a six-piece folk-rock band from Hartford. “They’ve done something really amazing by bringing national acts to an area like Hartford, which unfortunately doesn’t get to see a lot of these bands. They bring people out to hear music, which is a great opportunity for bands like ours.” “The lineup is all Frankie,” Mr. Bombaci said, referring to his son, a 19-year-old student at Loyola University in New Orleans majoring in music business. The younger Mr. Bombaci explained that he and his father put together the BOMB concept when he was a student at Lyme-Old Lyme High School. “Kids didn’t have much to do in Connecticut, and I thought for at least two days out of the year we should provide something fun to get their minds off their troubles,” he said. “Then it kind of evolved to where we wanted to make a mark and put Connecticut on the national festival scene.” “There’s so much incredible young talent,” he said. “They just need the chance to perform.” Nor are emerging bands the only ones to benefit from the event. The Bombacis plan to donate the festival’s proceeds to several charities based in Connecticut, including the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford, founded by Paul Newman for children with cancer, and the Connecticut Children’s Medical Center in Hartford. Bombfest, May 28 and 29 at Comcast Theater, 61 Savitt Way, Hartford; single-day passes are $60 or $70; two-day passes are $89 or $99; V.I.P. passes (meals, snacks, drinks and access to special viewing and parking areas) are $199 for one day or $349 for two days.

Meredith Attwell Baker, a former Commerce Department official who worked on telecommunications issues in George W. Bush's administration, announced that she would leave the F.C.C. when her term expires at the end of June. At Comcast, she will serve as senior vice president for government affairs for NBC Universal, which Comcast acquired in January. The announcement drew immediate criticism from some groups that had opposed the Comcast-NBC merger. They said the move was indicative of an ethically questionable revolving door between regulatory agencies and the companies they oversee. The revolving door between government and the lobbyists who seek to influence public policy and legislation on behalf of companies or other organizations was a target of reform by President Obama even before he took office. During the 2008 campaign, he vowed to ''close the revolving door'' and ''clean up both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue'' with ''the most sweeping ethics reform in history.'' Though Ms. Baker was appointed to what is considered an independent regulatory agency, she signed the administration's ethics pledge upon taking office in July 2009. Under the pledge, she will not be allowed to lobby anyone at the F.C.C. for two years after her departure. In addition, Ms. Baker will not be able to lobby other political appointees at the F.C.C., including other commissioners, for the remainder of the Obama administration, including a second term if the president is re-elected. She faces a lifetime ban on lobbying any executive branch agency, including the F.C.C., on the agreement that Comcast made with the commission as a condition of its approval of the merger with NBC Universal. Ms. Baker can lobby members of Congress immediately upon beginning her new job. ''I am privileged to have had the opportunity to serve the country at a time of critical transformation in the telecommunications industry,'' Ms. Baker said in a statement. ''The continued deployment of our broadband infrastructures will meaningfully impact the lives of all Americans. I am happy to have played a small part in the success.'' Ms. Baker, one of two Republicans on the five-member commission, recently criticized the speed of the commission's review of the Comcast-NBC merger, which took 355 days. The F.C.C. voted 4-1 in January for approval, subject to several conditions. ''The NBC/Comcast merger took too long, in my view,'' Ms. Baker said on March 2 in a speech to a communications industry group. Noting that that time was similar to the length of other major merger reviews at the commission, she asked whether those reviews were preventing companies from trying to grow through acquisition. ''My concern is that you might walk away,'' she told the communications executives, ''and how many other consumer-enhancing and job-creating deals are not getting done today.'' Her route of departure was harshly criticized by Craig Aaron, the president and chief executive of Free Press, a media interest group that had opposed the Comcast-NBC merger. Mr. Aaron called the move ''just the latest, though perhaps most blatant, example of a so-called public servant cashing in at a company she is supposed to be regulating.'' ''No wonder the public is so nauseated by business as usual in Washington, where the complete capture of government by industry barely raises any eyebrows,'' Mr. Aaron said. ''The continuously revolving door at the F.C.C. continues to erode any prospects for good public policy.'' Ms. Baker issued statements about her departure through both the F.C.C. and Comcast, but she did not address the revolving door issue in those statements. She did not return a phone call to her F.C.C. office seeking comment. Other interest groups were less vehement in their objections, in part because they viewed Ms. Baker as likely to have voted to approve the Comcast-NBC merger regardless of where her next job would be. Most of her colleagues on the commission wished Ms. Baker well in official statements. ''She's made our decisions smarter and our policies better,'' Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the F.C.C., said. ''I wish her well in her new role at NBC Universal.'' Only one F.C.C. commissioner, Michael J. Copps, who voted against the Comcast-NBC merger, expressed surprise at her departure.

That compared to a decrease in earnings for the same quarter last year, attributed to debt reduction. Adjusted earnings last year for the quarter were $34 million or 5 cents a share. Comcast reported net income of $943 million up 9 percent, or 34 cents a share, up from $866 million, or 31 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. CBS’s earnings expanded sharply in the quarter thanks mostly to its network programming, as well as a new deal for the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament that made a losing property a profitable one. The company’s chief executive, Leslie Moonves, announced that the company’s quarterly dividend would be doubled to 10 cents a share. In a discussion with analysts on Tuesday, Mr. Moonves called it a “strong fundamental performance” that he predicted the company would be able to sustain through this year and next. He cited the recent syndication sale of the CBS drama “Hawaii Five-0” for $2 million an episode and predicted the show would become “the next billion-dollar franchise” for CBS. Mr. Moonves addressed one potential problem area for CBS, saying he did not yet know what the resolution would be for the comedy “Two and a Half Men,” which was suspended after the show’s studio, Warner Brothers, fired the star, Charlie Sheen. “There are a lot of moving pieces,” Mr. Moonves said, addressing rumors that efforts are being made to continue the show in some fashion. “Warner Brothers is exploring different ideas on how to do the show,” he said. “It’s an important show to us.”  Mr. Moonves also pointed to the coming upfront sales period, when broadcast networks sell advertising in advance of the next prime-time season. He cited continuing strong ad sales in the quarter — up 40 percent — as evidence that CBS should gain “solid double-digit increases” in its upfront sales. Comcast became a direct competitor of CBS in January with its acquisition of NBC Universal. Comcast executives have made a point of describing the deep hole that they must pull the NBC broadcast operations out of and how difficult they expect that to be. In the first report of the combined company, the NBCUniversal assets turned in a positive performance, largely because of its cable networks, like USA and Bravo. That segment, which Comcast broke out for the first time, showed an increase in cash flow of 7 percent to $817 million, on revenue of $2 billion. Even the beleaguered NBC broadcast division managed to eke out cash flow of $20 million, which was up from a loss of $182 million last year, one that was almost entirely due to the cost of broadcasting the Winter Olympics. But cable remained the strength of Comcast’s earnings. The cable systems part of the company was responsible for 90 percent of the company’s overall cash flow. Total revenue for the company grew to $13.3 billion, from $12.5 billion, excluding losses from the 2010 Winter Olympics. Comcast also reported much stronger results than recent years in terms of loss of customers for video services. The company dropped only 39,000 customers in the quarter this year as opposed to 82,000 last year and 78,000 in the first quarter of 2009.Both Comcast and the CBS Corporation reported strongly positive first-quarter earnings Tuesday, in one case reflecting largely the strength of its cable television holdings, in the other its strength in advertising sales for its broadcasting operations.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/comcast-bolsters-its-on-demand-roster/?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Bolsters Its On-Demand Roster<date>April 27, 2011, 12:35 pm</date><text>Comcast said Wednesday that it had become the first cable or satellite provider to have TV shows from each of the four major networks on its video-on-demand service. While the selection is still incomplete — hit shows like “Modern Family” and “The Big Bang Theory” are missing — the deals represent progress for the television industry. Both network owners and cable providers know that they have to provide more shows on demand to keep consumers happy. Making more programming available on the cable platform could be perceived as an alternative to online streaming and digital video recording. Marcien Jenckes, a senior vice president at Comcast who oversees video-on-demand, said the deals were about reinventing television “in a way that’s friendly to the ecosystem.” Through video-on-demand, Comcast can insert fresh commercials during each break of a show; eventually, it says, it will be able to focus those commercials to specific customers. Mr. Jenckes said Comcast’s video-on-demand strategy was to be as flexible as possible so that the networks would feel comfortable experimenting with different advertising strategies. For instance, some shows on video-on-demand will have the fast-forward function enabled; others will have it disabled, to make sure viewers cannot skip ads. Historically, on-demand offerings through cable operators have seemed haphazard, but the offerings are gradually getting better as the operators try to retain customers. Previously, Comcast had NBC and CBS shows available; starting Thursday, it will also have ABC and Fox shows. Some networks are providing more than others; ABC will offer only six, while NBC, which is now controlled by Comcast, will offer 20. Of course, the success of the advertising strategies is dependent on customers choosing video-on-demand instead of a DVR copy of a show or Hulu, a Web site partly owned by NBC, ABC and Fox that plays back shows from those networks and others. Separately, Comcast, which is the largest cable operator in the United States, said that it was in active talks with movie studios to offer feature films through video-on-demand in the same time frame as DirecTV, the largest satellite operator. The so-called premium on-demand service by DirecTV, which allows customers to pay $30 to watch films two months after their theatrical release, has been vehemently opposed by theater owners. It is unclear when Comcast will introduce such a service.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/qa-setting-the-dvr-to-record-from-afar/?ref=comcastcorporation">Q&amp;A: Setting the DVR to Record From Afar<date>April 21, 2011, 6:34 pm</date><text>Q. How can I program a Comcast DVR over the Web? A. If you do not have one already, start by signing up for a Comcast.net User ID. You also need to have the correct version of Comcast’s on-screen program guide, which should display options for recording programs and managing your DVR; contact Comcast if you do not see these options on screen. Once you have your Comcast ID, sign in with it on the company’s DVR Manager Web site. Once you log into the site, search the program grid for the programs you wish the DVR to snag and click the button for recording the episode or series you want. The DVR Manager page also has a How-To Guide with detailed instructions for scheduling recordings and watching recorded shows. If you are not around your computer and want to schedule a recording, Comcast also has a smartphone app called Xfinity TV that works on Android and iOS devices. Other cable companies also offer remote DVR management to their customers in some areas. Time Warner Cable’s version of the service is called Remote DVR Manager and Cablevision’s iO TV has a similar feature for its digital video recorders. Owners of certain TiVo recorder models can schedule recordings remotely from the Web or a mobile phone as well.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/holocaust-memories-via-cable/?ref=comcastcorporation">Holocaust Memories, via Cable<date>April 10, 2011, 7:28 pm</date><text>Ten films about the Holocaust will be made available to Comcast customers and others on Monday. Comcast, the nation’s top cable company, is distributing 10 films about the Holocaust in a public service project it is calling “Days of Remembrance.” And it started with an unrelated telephone call to the director Steven Spielberg. The person calling Mr. Spielberg last year was Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, which was acquiring NBCUniversal. Mr. Roberts had visited the Universal Studio lot, the location of Mr. Spielberg’s office, but had not had a chance to see him. “I just decided to call him to tell him what a shame it was to be there and not see Steven Spielberg,” Mr. Roberts said. He said Mr. Spielberg responded: “Funny you should say that. We just sent you a letter.” The USC Shoah Foundation Institute, which Mr. Spielberg began in 1994, had just approached Mr. Roberts about giving him an award and holding a fund-raiser. Mr. Spielberg suggested during the call that Mr. Roberts visit the institute, which records and preserves tens of thousands of Holocaust testimonies. “What I saw there was fascinating,” Mr. Roberts said in an interview. “The stories were very in-depth,” he said. “Some were incredibly depressing. Some were incredibly uplifting.” The institute is careful about how it shares the testimonies, he said. Comcast arranged for its customers to be able to watch 10 films, some in English and some in other languages, through video-on-demand and an iPad app. Others will be able to stream the films at XfinityTV.com. The film distribution is pegged to Holocaust Remembrance Day on May 1, and will start Monday and last through May 25. The partnership may be, in part, a way for Comcast to please Mr. Spielberg. But it also shows Comcast’s desire to use video-on-demand and the Web as outlets for public service projects. In January, for instance, the company worked with the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum to distribute videos about the Kennedy presidency. Mr. Roberts said one of his goals for the merged Comcast and NBCUniversal was to “do some things that we can be very proud of.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/29/business/media/29ipad.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Time Warner Cable Defends Streaming to iPad<date>Published: March 28, 2011</date><text>Companies like Time Warner Cable and Cablevision buy the rights to beam channels to customers’ television sets. But do those rights extend to iPads?That question has divided the television industry in recent weeks, ever since Time Warner Cable started streaming several dozen TV channels to customers’ iPads. Immediately, channel owners like Viacom and Scripps Networks seized on the streaming capability as a contract violation — in part because they want cable companies to pay them more for the privilege to stream. Legal threats were made last week, and the dispute was brought into public view on Monday when Time Warner Cable introduced a Web campaign that promoted “more freedom to watch on more screens” and asked, “Why do some TV networks want to take it away?” The television industry is, in effect, joining book publishers in being unsettled by the iPad and the new era of tablets. There is little doubt that people will be watching more TV on tablets in the future. (Imagine a son watching “SpongeBob SquarePants” on an iPad while his father watches basketball on the big-screen TV.) What is undetermined is whether people will be watching through an application provided by their cable company, an individual channel’s app, or through a paid service like Netflix. To stream programs from Time Warner Cable, customers download an iPad app through the Apple iTunes store, log in to verify their account, and choose from a selection of live channels like CNN and Comedy Central. The iPad app only works inside the home, and only for customers who receive both television and Internet from the operator. Other cable television operators say they are coming out with their own streaming apps soon. Cablevision’s app could come out this week. But some channel owners say that companies like Time Warner Cable should be consulting with them more closely before introducing new products. “Portability is a different business proposition,” said an executive at one of the major channel owners, suggesting that there should be a premium paid for the ability to take a TV show into bed or into the bathtub. One commercial for Time Warner Cable’s app actually shows a person watching TV on a tablet while taking a bath. The executive said Time Warner Cable should have “worked out the business issues” with channel owners before coming out with the app. The chief issue is counting the audience: another executive said there had been a “stampede” of channel owners asking the Nielsen Company to include iPad streaming in its ratings of programs. The channel executives spoke only on condition of anonymity because their parent companies had refused to comment on the dispute. But Scripps, the owner of HGTV and the Food Network, said earlier this month that it “has not granted iPad video streaming rights to any distributor and is actively addressing any misunderstandings on this issue.” Melinda Witmer, an executive vice president at Time Warner Cable, said in an interview last week that she thought the current dispute was “fundamentally about money and leverage,” not about the language of contracts. “I already bought these rights,” she said. Ms. Witmer compared the complaints of channel owners to a person who waves a gun around and winds up shooting themselves in the foot. For distributors that depend on monthly subscription checks from customers, new products like iPad apps are ways to keep the payments coming — and that revenue, of course, is ultimately shared with the channel owners. Some channel executives said Viacom, the owner of MTV, VH1 and other channels, is taking the most aggressive stance against the streaming app. One of the complaints is that the app now includes only a portion of all the channels that are available through the traditional set-top box. Time Warner Cable is offering 32 channels for the iPad. Cablevision is expected to change that. Its app will transplant every existing channel and video-on-demand option to the iPad, literally making it into a TV set. The company declined to comment Monday. Verizon and Comcast have said that they were also working on streaming apps for iPads. But for now, the Time Warner Cable skirmish may make other cable companies or distributors think twice about replicating TV on tablets. Comcast, for instance, has not added live streaming to its iPad app yet; instead, it has focused on adding on-demand programming. Comcast is the nation’s largest cable company; Time Warner Cable is No. 2. The cable distributors have trod lightly into an area that will most likely prompt more fighting with channel owners: out-of-home viewing by customers. Not every channel owner is arguing against the streaming notion, however. Time Warner, which was separated from Time Warner Cable two years ago, is comfortable with the current app, and its recent contract renegotiation with Comcast specifically included tablet streaming rights. Ms. Witmer of Time Warner Cable said she thought some of the resistance by channel owners stemmed from a lack of understanding of the technology. “In fairness, truthfully, to all the executives in this industry that are trying to run businesses that are part of this ecosystem, it is exhausting — exhausting — keeping up with everything that is changing rapidly,” she said.Companies like Time Warner Cable and Cablevision buy the rights to beam channels to customers’ television sets.

At that time, she was promoted to chairwoman of NBCUniversal’s cable entertainment and cable studios. For several years, Mr. Wachtel has been the chief of original programming for USA, and Mr. McCumber has been the chief marketer there. “Their collaborative style is a critical part of USA’s DNA and a key component of the network’s success,” Ms. Hammer said in a statement. The two men will jointly oversee all aspects of the channel. The appointments were made as USA, known mainly for dramas and wrestling, is preparing to add mini-series, half-hour comedies and reality shows to its schedule. USA attracts about 3.1 million viewers each evening, making it more popular than any other cable channel, a title it has held for five years. But its prime-time audience dipped slightly last year from the previous year. The channel is preparing new episodes of continuing series like “Burn Notice,” and has two new dramas in the works for the summer. One, “A Legal Mind,” is about two lawyers, one of whom is a college dropout. The other new drama, “Necessary Roughness,” is about a therapist to the stars. The channel is also adding a reality TV division. As the appointments of Mr. Wachtel and Mr. McCumber indicate, Comcast is shoring up the executive structure of NBCUniversal. Ms. Hammer is searching for a new president for the E! channel, replacing Ted Harbert, who was named chairman of NBC Broadcasting in January.Comcast’s NBCUniversal division is promoting two executives, Jeff Wachtel and Chris McCumber, to be the co-presidents of USA, the most-watched channel on cable television.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/technology/personaltech/03pogue.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Cable TV Moves Toward Tablets and Apps<date>Published: March 2, 2011</date><text>FOR INTERNAL COMCAST USE ONLY. DO NOT LEAK.Destroy this top-secret strategy document after reading. It could be devastating to our business interests if it fell into the wrong hands — like The New York Times or something. Fellow Comcastians, this is a difficult time for the cable TV business. We’ve been losing subscribers. These young people today, with their loud hair and long music! They don’t watch TV on TV sets anymore. They watch it online! Free episodes on Hulu.com. Ad-free episodes from iTunes. Unlimited past seasons on Netflix. These people are actually proud to cancel their cable TV service. Not a healthy trend. We’re not going to sit here watching the Internet nibble away at our very existence, people. We’re not going to behave like the music industry, either. We won’t start suing people for going with the technological flow. We need to work with the changing times instead of fighting them. We may be the most hated cable company, but we’re also the biggest. We can do pretty much anything we want. So for the last few years, we’ve been fighting technology with technology. We started by creating xfinitytv.com, a Web site that acts like the world’s biggest TiVo. We let Comcast subscribers with a plan costing more than $58 a month watch recent shows online, whenever they want, most at no extra charge. We have 150,000 TV shows and movies available. Kind of like Hulu, actually, except that we have all the major networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and 85 others) and Hulu is missing some big ones, like CBS and PBS. That’s enormous. People don’t want to watch a certain show by tuning in at 8 p.m. on Thursday on CBS anymore. People want on-demand, people. Our customers watch 350 million shows a month on our site. And that’s only one of the Big Three Internet/TV Synergies. A second one is remote DVR programming. That is, you can program your Comcast cable box to record shows using the mouse and keyboard, in a Web browser, as TiVo owners have been able to do for years. And the third synergy is remote control: changing the channel on your TV, using your laptop. (It’s loads of fun when your spouse is downstairs trying to watch “The Bachelor.”) But the Web browser was only the beginning. The new frontier is the tablet, people. Imagine using your iPad or Android tablet as the world’s thinnest, lightest, most portable wireless TV. Park it on the kitchen table while you’re chopping salad. Park it on the bathroom counter while you’re washing up. Let your children clutch it in bed when they’re home sick. Well, you can stop imagining. Our new Xfinity app for iPad is a thing of beauty. Frankly, it’s a lot smoother, better-looking and easy to understand than the Web site. Drag your finger vertically on the TV guide to scroll through your channels. Drag horizontally to slide later in the day’s schedule. It’s a touch-screen remote, too. Tap a network’s name to change channels on your TV — a lot more fun, and more comprehensible, than hitting numbers on a traditional remote. Or use the iPad to program your DVR. Tap a show’s name to reveal a Record button (and a Record Series button). Beats the heck out of painstakingly clicking out a show’s name using an onscreen alphabet. Our iPad app also does that on-demand thing, and here’s where things get confusing. Tap OnDemand to view a list of 25,000 TV shows and movies, mostly free, that you can play instantly — on your TV. Once again, you’re using the iPad only as a remote control, not as a TV. But if you tap Play Now, you taste the honey. You can browse or search 3,000 hours of recent TV shows and movies, and begin playing them instantly on the iPad. It’s a fantastic experience, with good picture and sound quality. Yes, our iPad app is not perfect. It has some bugs, for one thing. Furthermore, the shows are depicted as thumbnail rectangles, often with truncated titles (want to watch “Monsters vs...”?). You really ache for a simple list. When you choose an On Demand show on the iPad, the TV first shows a confirmation screen, requiring your O.K. You shouldn’t have to hunt for a second remote to get the show going. And above all, we need to beef up that catalog of iPad-playable shows. That 3,000 hours isn’t really very much — in fact, at the moment, it’s almost exclusively movies and premium channels (HBO, Showtime and so on). You’re not going to find “60 Minutes” or “Glee” or “Nova.” But our negotiating teams are going nonstop, and our C.E.O. has said he won’t quit until every show in your Comcast package is available to watch online or on your gadgets. You should also know that we’re working on the ultimate: live TV on the iPad within your home. All your channels, real time, in your hand. Can you imagine? Well, we can, because we have it working in our labs in Philadelphia. We’ll have it ready by the end of the year. But let’s face it, people: that’s not good enough. We’re not the only cable operators in town, and our competitors are breathing down our necks. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comFOR INTERNAL COMCAST USE ONLY.

Its earnings rose to $1.02 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $955 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, said that the strong performance last year and its acquisition of the NBC stake last month “points to an exciting new beginning for our company.” After a prolonged regulatory process, Comcast gained control of NBC Universal at the end of January as the cable company expanded its push into content. Comcast said Wednesday that it had spent $80 million last year in pursuing a majority stake in what is now known as NBCUniversal. (Among Comcast’s first changes was to remove the space between NBC and Universal in the name.) In a conference call Wednesday, the new chief executive of NBCUniversal, Stephen B. Burke, praised NBC’s hugely profitable cable channels, like USA and Bravo. “These are fantastic businesses,” he said, “and those businesses can do even better than they are doing right now if they get the right investment and the right cross promotion.” Mr. Roberts pointed to the NBC broadcast network as the place where he saw the “biggest opportunity” in the next three to five years. Comcast would like to engineer a turnaround of the network, which has spent several years in ratings purgatory. “We think we can make progress, and we are doing a variety of things — putting a variety of things in place to get that progress. But I don’t think we’re going to see anything for a while,” he said. For now, almost 95 percent of Comcast’s revenue comes from distribution. But its content arm, which includes cable channels like E!, is growing nearly twice as fast as its distribution arm. In its fourth-quarter earnings, Comcast continued to show some losses of basic cable customers, but it more than made it up for that by showing increases in spending by other customers — the ones that opt for multiple products and packages. Rate increases also helped. Cable companies like Comcast have attributed their cable subscriber losses to stiff competition from satellite and telecommunications companies like DirecTV and Verizon, and from a dour housing market. David Joyce, an analyst for Miller Tabak &amp; Company, said Comcast’s losses in the quarter — 135,000 — were not as steep as predicted. More important, the “triple play” packages kept reaping rewards. Comcast continued to add more broadband customers — 292,000 in the quarter — and voice customers — 257,000 — which increased its overall revenue per cable customer by 10.6 percent, it said. About one in three Comcast customers opt for the “triple play” package. Cablevision, which has about 3.3 million customers, reported a similar subscriber situation. Excluding its purchase last quarter of a cable company in the Western part of the country, Cablevision lost 35,000 basic cable customers in the fourth quarter of the year, but added some broadband and voice customers, and posted a 5.7 percent gain in revenue for the quarter, to $1.9 billion. Cablevision also said Wednesday that it would repurchase an additional $500 million in stock, bringing the total value of its stock repurchase program to $1 billion.The Comcast Corporation, the largest cable company in the United States, reported Wednesday that its revenue rose 7 percent in the fourth quarter, its last before taking control of NBC Universal.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/ebersol-starts-to-reshape-sports-at-comcast/?ref=comcastcorporation">Ebersol Starts to Reshape Sports at Comcast<date>February 2, 2011, 6:33 pm</date><text>Dick Ebersol, who has run NBC Sports for nearly 22 years, is wasting little time putting his personal stamp on the sports properties of Comcast, which include the Golf Channel and Versus, and 11 regional sports networks. NBC executives with long connections to Ebersol are adding new roles at the Comcast units five days after Comcast took control of NBC Universal. Some Versus officials lost their jobs. “Our great strength is the programming, production, marketing and relationship orientation of NBC Sports,” Ebersol said on Wednesday after the appointments were announced. “The people being moved into all these roles are people who have had great success at that.” In addition to the executive changes, NBC Sports’s golf programming will be rebranded “The Golf Channel on NBC,” and some of its on-air talent will appear on the Golf Channel. “It’ll take 18 months to two years to blend more and more talent across the two,” Ebersol said. Also, Versus might be renamed “somewhere down the road,” he said. He named Mike McCarley, a former NBC Sports publicist who is now senior vice president of strategic marketing at NBC Sports, to run the Golf Channel. At Versus, he installed a three-man group: as president, Jon Litner, who will continue to oversee Comcast’s regonal sports networks; as executive producer, Sam Flood, who will retain the same position at NBC Sports, and as president of programming, Jon Miller, who was elevated to the same title at NBC Sports. Jamie Davis lost his job as president of Versus, but will work with Mark Lazarus, a former Turner sports and entertainment executive, who was named president of the NBC Sports Cable Group to oversee the Golf Channel, Versus and the regional sports networks. Lazarus and Ebersol have known each other since the 1990s. Ebersol said that Lazarus understands aspects of cable television “that are not replicated in our business.” And he said that McCarley, who has not run a network before, has the marketing skills “to make the Golf Channel go pop.” Among others dismissed at Versus were Leon Schweir, the executive producer; Mike Baker, the coordinating producer for N.H.L. games; and Neal Scarborough, Versus’s vice president of digital media. Moving in to take over all studio operations will be Michael Bass, the former producer of NBC’s “Today” show and CBS’s “Early Show.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/media/02cable.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Deal and Amazon Speculation Stir Talk on Online Streaming<date>Published: February 1, 2011</date><text>The increasing importance of Internet rights for television channels and shows has been vividly demonstrated twice in the last few days.Comcast and Time Warner announced an unusually comprehensive pact on Tuesday that covers the online streaming of channels like TNT, TBS, CNN and the Cartoon Network. Meanwhile, media analysts were aflutter about the possibility of Amazon’s starting an online video subscription service that could rival Netflix. Amazon has declined to comment. The blog Engadget published an Amazon.com screen capture on Saturday that suggested that Amazon was preparing an all-you-can-eat video streaming service, which like Netflix could give customers access to a variety of TV shows and films. Barclays analysts said in a note to investors on Monday that they anticipated a service “similar to Netflix’s current platform.” “While its content portfolio would initially likely be less robust than Netflix’s licensed content, we believe Amazon has the scale to become a viable over-the-top distributor over time,” the note stated, before reiterating that such services were largely supplemental to entrenched cable and satellite distributors. Deals like the one between Comcast and Time Warner are devised in part to blunt online upstarts. The companies said the contract was a step forward for their vision of “TV Everywhere,” a concept that holds that people who pay for a cable television subscription once should be able to watch television on any screen, be it a big-screen TV or an iPad. But that concept requires complicated new contracts between programmers like Time Warner and distributors like Comcast. “TV Everywhere” has been slow to materialize, so the announcement on Tuesday was a breakthrough of sorts. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said the agreement “really solidifies our partnership in this effort and really pushes forward the concept of giving consumers more access to quality on-demand content on any device they choose.” The rights for online streaming were part of a larger agreement between the companies. Details were not disclosed, but the agreement also renews Comcast’s traditional carriage of some of Time Warner’s channels. Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, said the contract was for multiple years. On the on-demand side, the agreement covers many of Turner’s TV shows and movies in a variety of places, including Comcast’s streaming Web site, Comcast’s on-demand system on television sets, Turner’s own Web sites, and on tablets and mobile phone screens. Significantly, the contract will cover out-of-home streaming of Turner channels and TV shows by Comcast customers in the future. Comcast already has similar pacts for streaming content with HBO, another part of Time Warner. A Comcast app that allows customers to stream certain TV shows was already visible in the iPad app store on Tuesday night. What remained unknown on Tuesday was whether Comcast was paying a substantial amount for the streaming rights. “They haven’t wanted to pay substantially more for television video-on-demand rights in the past,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst for BTIG. He said of Comcast, “Have they had a change of perspective on paying for additional on-demand rights? Or is this deal about Time Warner just wanting to seed the market because it’s been 18 months and ‘TV Everywhere’ has moved more slowly than investors had hoped?”The increasing importance of Internet rights for television channels and shows has been vividly demonstrated twice in the last few days.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/shake-up-at-network-carrying-n-h-l-games/?ref=comcastcorporation">Shake-Up at Network Carrying N.H.L.

The contract demonstrates that Internet rights for TV shows and channels are becoming increasingly important to distributors as they try to keep up with consumers’ changing habits. Comcast and Time Warner said the contract was a step forward for their vision of “TV Everywhere,” a concept that holds that people who pay for a television subscription once should be able to watch television on any screen, be it a big-screen TV or an iPad. But that concept requires complicated new contracts between programmers like Time Warner and distributors like Comcast. TV Everywhere has been slow to materialize, disappointing some consumers and investors. That’s why the joint announcement on Tuesday is a breakthrough of sorts. Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, said in a statement Tuesday, “When we first announced the TV Everywhere initiative with Comcast and Brian Roberts 18 months ago, it was an untested idea facing technical doubts and competitive pressures — but already more than 50 million consumers can experience some form of it from a wide range of content providers and distributors. This landmark agreement between Turner and Comcast, along with our separate recent deal between Comcast and HBO, really solidifies our partnership in this effort and really pushes forward the concept of giving consumers more access to quality on-demand content on any device they choose.” The rights for online streaming were part of a larger agreement between the two companies. Details were not disclosed, but the new agreement also renews Comcast’s traditional carriage of some of Time Warner’s channels.

Those places include Comcast’s streaming Web site, Comcast’s on-demand system on television sets, Turner’s own Web sites, and on tablets and mobile phone screens. Significantly, the contract will cover out-of-home streaming of Turner channels and TV shows by Comcast customers sometime in the future. The companies characterized the contract as “multiyear.” Comcast already has similar pacts for streaming content with HBO, another part of Time Warner. What remained unknown Tuesday was whether Comcast was paying a substantial amount for the streaming rights. “They haven’t wanted to pay substantially more for television video-on-demand rights in the past,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst for BTIG. He asked of Comcast, “Have they had a change of perspective on paying for incremental on-demand rights? Or is this deal about Time Warner just wanting to seed the market because it’s been 18 months and ‘TV Everywhere’ has moved more slowly than investors had hoped?”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/business/media/30comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Takes Control of NBC Universal<date>Published: January 29, 2011</date><text>Comcast, the nation’s largest cable TV company, took control of NBC Universal late on Friday, making it the first cable company to own a major broadcast network.The takeover gave the cable distributor a 51 percent control of NBC Universal, which owns the nation’s fourth-ranked broadcaster, NBC; the Universal Pictures movie studio and related theme parks; and a bevy of cable channels including Bravo, E and USA. The deal had raised fears that Comcast might abuse its control of NBC Universal to favor the 23 million who rely on it for cable TV service and the 17 million who pay for Internet connections. But the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission forced Comcast to make the full suite of NBC Universal content available as a single package to online competitors on terms comparable to those reached with more established rivals, like Dish Network and DirecTV. NBC Universal is also expected to match new deals for smaller chunks of programming between other media firms and online video providers if it has comparable programming on hand. As an example, NBC Universal might have to make “The Real Housewives of New York City” from Bravo available to Netflix if Viacom makes a similar deal for “Jersey Shore,” the MTV show. The company also had to give up the decision-making power associated with its 32 percent share of Hulu, the online video service it co-owns with the Walt Disney Company, the News Corporation and Providence Equity Partners. Hulu is one of the services that makes viewing shows like “30 Rock” possible online. The rules highlight the new battleground for entertainment in the home between traditional power players like Comcast, which has lost subscribers in the economic downturn, and companies like Netflix, which added them with its cheap service and compatibility with a range of devices. In the deal, Comcast paid General Electric just under $6.2 billion in cash and contributed its pay TV channels like E Entertainment Television and the Golf Channel, worth $7.25 billion, to NBC Universal. G.E.’s stake in NBC Universal fell to 49 percent from 80 percent, but G.E. plans to diminish that to zero by being paid out from the venture over about seven years. This week, G.E. bought out the 20 percent stake held by Vivendi of France for $5.8 billion in order to complete the deal.Comcast, the nation’s largest cable TV company, took control of NBC Universal late on Friday, making it the first cable company to own a major broadcast network.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/business/media/27nbc.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Stephen B. Burke Taking Reins at Ailing NBC<date>Published: January 26, 2011</date><text>On Thursday, from Studio 6B in Rockefeller Center, home of “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,” the NBC anchor Brian Williams will officially introduce the network’s newest boss, Stephen B. Burke, in a closed-circuit presentation to the entire company.Every one of the company’s 27,000 employees will also be given a coffee table book, “NBCUniversal and Comcast: A Century in the Making,” that interweaves the companies’ histories. Yet Mr. Burke’s real “welcome to NBC” moment came six days ago with the ouster of the MSNBC anchor Keith Olbermann, a classic NBC episode of infighting, secret negotiations and the splashing of internal gossip across the press. For years, NBC’s own internal dramas were often more compelling than anything it offered viewers — from the Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien fiasco to Mr. Olbermann’s famous temper to the hard-partying antics of the former entertainment boss, Ben Silverman, to the prime-time travails of Mr. Burke’s predecessor, Jeff Zucker. It now falls to Mr. Burke, who for 12 years has been far from the media glare as the No. 2 executive at Comcast in Philadelphia, to revitalize the ailing network as the new chief executive of NBC Universal. His experience and personality are the antithesis of what NBC represents: he is not a programmer, has no experience in news and avoids playing corporate feuds in the press. A slightly patrician Republican with a Harvard M.B.A., he is so averse to playing internal politics that he recently held meetings with executives at a Midtown Manhattan coffee shop rather than his temporary office in Rockefeller Center to avoid prompting office gossip. Can someone who relishes none of the forces that have defined NBC’s culture, and who displays no desire to push his own agenda in the media, succeed at the helm of one of America’s biggest media companies? Over all, the company is doing well — its last quarter under General Electric’s ownership was its most profitable, thanks to its big cable channels like USA Network and Bravo — but Mr. Burke will have his hands full trying to revive NBC’s moribund prime-time schedule, particularly since his new employees regard him with suspicion, and many consider him reserved to the point of coldness. Longtime associates say Mr. Burke simply takes time to warm up to others. “He’s not shy, he’s not reticent, he’s just not voluble like me,” is how Warren E. Buffett, a longtime friend of Mr. Burke’s family, put it. “He’s going to be under more pressure than he should be because of the broadcast network,” said Bob Wright, the former chief executive of NBC Universal who met with Mr. Burke several times over the last year. Mr. Burke, 52, declined to speak on the record for this article. But in numerous interviews with executives who know him well and with several longtime NBC executives who spoke anonymously because they did not want to jeopardize future relations with the new boss, a portrait of Mr. Burke’s personality and style as an executive emerges, as well as a sense of how NBC Universal’s culture may change under his leadership. For nearly a decade, Mr. Burke and the Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, annually had dinner in New York City with Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. At each meal, Mr. Burke pressed him to sell NBC Universal. Mr. Immelt’s answer was always no, until the financial crisis came in 2008, and then the answer was yes. In the wake of the resignation of Mr. Olbermann, the left-leaning face of MSNBC, some critics have speculated in the press that the move was a politically motivated decision by Comcast. While most of Mr. Burke’s political donations have been to Republicans, Mr. Burke describes himself to associates as a “soft Republican,” and he voted for Barack Obama for president, even though he contributed to John McCain’s campaign, in 2008. For the last 13 months, Mr. Burke spent each Tuesday and Wednesday in either New York or Los Angeles, meeting with NBC Universal executives. He held many meetings at a Midtown outpost of Le Pain Quotidien, a chain of cafes. Mr. Burke, according to those who have spoken to him, came to believe the culture inside NBC Universal was driven by internal politics, press reaction and pleasing G.E. overlords. “My expectation is, if there were to be a change, there would be a much more open environment with the free flow of information,” said Michael Lynton, the chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment, who worked for Mr. Burke in the 1990s at Disney. “He’s very direct. There’s very little beating around the bush.” For someone with a long pedigree in television, Mr. Burke seems remarkably uninterested in the attendant glamour of the media business. His father, Daniel B. Burke, had been the president of Capital Cities Communications, which eventually acquired the ABC Network. Still, “it was far from a family in which we were groomed for the business,” said Bill Burke, Mr. Burke’s younger brother. “He was not always the top of his class, or Mr. Perfect, that sort of thing,” he said. “He probably started applying himself more in college.” Mr. Burke, who is Irish Catholic, attended Colgate University, then applied to Harvard Divinity School, but ultimately chose Harvard Business School. After business school, he worked at General Foods in a job that bored him, and took long lunches to train for marathons. His big career move was joining Disney in 1986, after his father’s partner at Capital Cities, Tom Murphy, phoned Michael D. Eisner, who led Disney at the time, Mr. Eisner recalled. When Disney acquired Mr. Burke’s father’s company, Capital Cities/ABC, in 1995, Mr. Burke, who by then had run Disney’s retail stores and Euro Disney in Paris, helped integrate the two companies. He was extremely close to his father, who was the best man at his wedding. Today the elder Mr. Burke suffers from dementia and is unaware of his son’s new job. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: January 29, 2011 Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about Stephen B.

''This is a proud and exciting day for Comcast,'' Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, said in a statement that thanked the government agencies for their hard work. The approval has been expected for at least the last few weeks. It has been the subject of intense lobbying both by Comcast and by opponents of the deal, who fear that Comcast will restrict access to NBC programming. Comcast says the deal will help achieve its vision of anytime, anywhere access to content.As is normal in media mergers, the F.C.C. imposed a long list of conditions on the deal. They were outlined in an F.C.C. news release on Tuesday. The conditions are intended to ensure that Comcast plays fair when dealing with rival programmers, cable providers and broadband Internet providers. Many of the conditions are intended to remain in place for seven years, an unusually long period of time. The F.C.C. vote was 4 to 1, with the senior Democratic commissioner, Michael J. Copps, casting the dissenting vote. Mr. Copps, who had expressed doubt in the past about whether the combination would benefit consumers, said in a statement Tuesday that it ''confers too much power in one company's hands.'' Mr. Copps also said, ''The Comcast-NBCU joint venture opens the door to the cable-ization of the open Internet. The potential for walled gardens, toll booths, content prioritization, access fees to reach end users, and a stake in the heart of independent content production is now very real.'' Seeming to temper that concern, Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chair, said in his own statement that the conditions imposed by the F.C.C. ''include carefully considered steps to ensure that competition drives innovation in the emerging online video marketplace.'' He continued, ''Our approval is also structured to spur broadband adoption among underserved communities; to increase broadband access to schools and libraries; and to increase news coverage, children's television, and Spanish-language programming.'' In coordination with the F.C.C., the Justice Department's antitrust division said it would not block the deal, but like the F.C.C. it put a number of conditions in place. Notably, Comcast is being required to give up NBC Universal's management stake in Hulu, the premier online TV Web site. ''Without such a remedy, Comcast could, through its seats on Hulu's board of directors, interfere with the management of Hulu, and, in particular, the development of products that compete with Comcast's video service,'' the Justice Department stated in a news release. NBC and the owners of ABC and Fox all have minority stakes in Hulu. Comcast said it would retain an economic stake in Hulu, and would continue to provide TV shows and movies to Hulu the same way that Hulu's other minority owners do.

Broadly, the Federal Communication Commission said that Comcast must not favor its own content over competitors’ content on its cable systems. Specifically, the commission said that “if Comcast neighborhoods its news (including business news) channels, it must include all unaffiliated news (or business news) channels in that neighborhood.” In the deal, Comcast will own CNBC, a rival to Bloomberg TV. Essentially, Bloomberg wanted to make sure that if Comcast clusters together news channels, Comcast won’t leave Bloomberg TV out of that group. “In today’s order, the F.C.C. has taken strong action to preserve independent news programming, and protect competitors against discrimination,” Dan Doctoroff, the president of Bloomberg L.P., said in a statement. “The F.C.C. has recognized the critical importance of neighborhooding and ensuring that independent channels are treated fairly and consumers are protected.” Bloomberg had lobbied hard for the condition for the better part of a year.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/f-c-c-approves-comcast-nbc-deal/?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast-NBC Deal Wins Federal Approval<date>January 18, 2011, 2:03 pm</date><text>6:00 p.m. | Updated The proposed combination of Comcast and NBC Universal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department on Tuesday, smoothing the way for the deal to close by the end of January.

To that end, the deal to acquire NBC Universal will give Comcast a significant role in the future of online television viewing. The F.C.C. acknowledged Tuesday that the deal could create risks “to the development of innovative online video distribution services.” So, in certain cases, Comcast may be required to distribute certain programming on the Internet — if one of its rivals does so first. Susan Crawford, a professor who is writing a book, “The Big Squeeze,” about the Comcast deal, said that the government was giving online video upstarts several ways to challenge Comcast to gain access to its programming. “As at many junctures in the history of telecommunications policy, government intervention has made it possible for new media distributors to exist,” she said. “This is the latest intervention to provide daylight — just to open up enough daylight to give this nascent online marketplace a chance to take off.” Among the other conditions is an arbitration process in the event of disputes between Comcast and other cable providers over access to any of NBC Universal’s cable channels. “We will be good to our word — and we will be respectful stewards of the strong and iconic assets of NBC Universal, particularly NBC News,” said David L. Cohen, an executive vice president at Comcast, in a letter about the regulatory approvals. The Consumer Federation of America, which initially opposed the merger, said Tuesday that it thought the government conditions and enforcement measures would protect consumers and provide “additional momentum for the development of the Internet as a platform for video competition.” Other public interest groups were much more critical. Free Press said the approval failed to live up to “Barack Obama’s promise to promote media diversity and prevent excessive media concentration.” With the government approvals in hand, Comcast executives can now participate in management decisions at NBC Universal — which they have been champing at the bit to do — though they can not formally lead the company until the deal closes, according to an executive involved in the process. The deal’s closing will happen after the end of the company’s next pay cycle, which is Jan. 28.

The company will start streaming live channels to both iPads and Android-powered tablets this year, said Brian Roberts, Comcast’s chief executive. He did not specify a start date. But within a few weeks, he said, a selection of almost 3,000 on-demand programs will be available on iPads. The live and on-demand streaming to tablets will be available only in the homes of Comcast subscribers, though, in part because of rights issues with networks and cable channels. “Live streaming and the Play Now feature on our Xfinity TV app are two important pieces of our strategy to deliver any content to any device anytime,” Mr. Roberts said in a statement. Cable operators like Comcast are scurrying to support television and film viewing on tablets, lest customers be enticed to cut the cord and sign up for online upstarts. Verizon and Cablevision are also working on similar TV apps for tablets. Those apps, though, are still largely being tested. Cable operators are also eager to figure out how tablets can be used as remote controls and television guides.

The partnerships will be modeled on an existing relationship between KNSD, the NBC-owned station in San Diego, and voiceofsandiego.org, an innovative news organization that relies on donations from foundations, corporations and readers. Comcast’s embrace of what it calls “hyperlocalism” may be an advantage to nonprofits that are gathering news in metropolitan areas. Independent newsrooms like voiceofsandiego.org have sprung up in several cities, and in some cases they have filled gaps left by downsized newspaper newsrooms. The partnership plan was outlined in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission on Dec. 23, the same day that Julius Genachowski, the commission chairman, indicated that he would support the combination of Comcast and NBC Universal as long as a number of conditions were attached. The F.C.C. is expected to approve the takeover in January. In the letter, Comcast also agreed to provide $10-a-month broadband Internet access in some low-income areas. Comcast had already pledged to preserve the news and public affairs programming on the NBC stations, and to increase the output of such programming by 1,000 hours a year, mostly through online and on-demand extensions. The commitment about the news nonprofits, however, is new. Analysts say commitments like these are intended to smooth the way to approval for such a deal. In San Diego, KNSD and voiceofsandiego.org have been sharing content, fact-checking politicians and promoting each other’s Web sites. “Some of our bigger investigative pieces have a lot more impact when we are able to pair them with a broadcast version,” said Scott Lewis, the chief executive of voiceofsandiego.org. KNSD pays the nonprofit a monthly fee. “It’s been a huge deal,” Mr. Lewis said. In the letter to the F.C.C., Comcast said the KNSD model “can and should be expanded.” It did not identify where it would set up partnerships, but along with San Diego, NBC operates stations in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, San Jose, Calif., Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington and West Hartford, Conn. “Cooperative arrangements such as this advance the commission’s interest in ensuring that all Americans have access to vibrant, diverse sources of news and information as well as promoting the positive effects of the digital revolution on news-gathering, journalism and information dissemination,” the company stated in the letter. It said it would keep the arrangements with the nonprofits in place for at least three years.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/29/sports/29olympics.html?ref=comcastcorporation">In NBC’s Shadow, Comcast Must Ponder Taking Olympic Plunge<date>Published: December 28, 2010</date><text>Does Comcast cherish the Olympics with the same fervor as did General Electric, which has paid billions to make NBC the network of the Summer and the Winter Games for a generation?The question arises because Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, is close to regulatory approval to buy control of NBC Universal from G.E. in a deal valued at $30 billion — and because the Olympics are near-certain guarantees of prime-time dominance for 17 nights every two years. As early as next spring, Comcast will face ESPN, Fox and a possible CBS-Turner Sports bid at the International Olympic Committee’s auction for the media rights to the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro. “I don’t think Comcast wants its first move with its new partner to be a negative one and to lose something NBC has had for years,” said Barry Frank, an executive vice president of IMG who has negotiated Olympic deals in the past. Comcast, which serves 22.9 million of the nation’s 100 million pay-television subscribers, according to SNL Kagan, has done little to tip its Olympic intentions. But it understands the effect of sports through its ownership of Versus, the Golf Channel, 11 regional sports networks, the Philadelphia Flyers and the 76ers. And its chairman, Brian Roberts, who has won four silver medals and one gold in team squash at the Maccabiah Games, attended the 2010 Vancouver Games. But Comcast has reason to be cautious about plunging into Olympic economics, where the cost of buying media rights in the United States has soared almost without a dip since CBS paid $50,000 for the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Calif. NBC lost $223 million on the 2010 Games because of the recession and the steep price it paid to carry them; the network could lose more on the 2012 Olympics in London on its highest-ever $1.18 billion rights fee. “They’re eager to show they can make money running NBC, and the Olympics may not be a way of doing it,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. The I.O.C.’s auction for the 2014 and ’16 rights, which has been delayed to avoid the worst of the recession, will test the networks’ desires to demonstrate financial prudence. Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, said recently that he wanted more than $2.2 billion, which G.E. paid for the 2010 and ’12 rights and for a global sponsorship. But Comcast, without international interests like G.E.’s, has no reason to buy such a sponsorship. G.E. said in 2008 that its sponsorship was paying off with $700 million in contracts for 400 Olympic projects in and around Beijing. Privately, the I.O.C. thinks the Sochi-Rio media rights could be worth as much as $2.7 billion. But, Moffett said, “It’s a stretch to imagine making money at $2 billion.” Network executives say they think that Sochi is less valuable than Vancouver (cost: $820 million) because of its relatively warm winter climate and that Rio should not bring as large a rights fee as a domestic Olympics would have in Chicago, one of the losing bidders in the election to host the 2016 Games. But Richard Carrion, the I.O.C. member handling the auction, said in an interview, “I think there are plenty of things to make Sochi an exciting place, and Rio is a good summer site.” Last month, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS, mindful of NBC’s losses and what the I.O.C. is seeking, seemed to indicate he would bow out of the auction if he could not get a bargain. “We don’t need to invest in something to lose money,” Moonves told an industry conference, “or just to help the prestige of the network. I think we’re already there.” Despite its ability to acquire much of what it wants, ESPN has signaled that it will not be profligate in its Olympic bidding, which acts as a preauction brake on the I.O.C.’s optimism. Last April, ESPN was outbid for the rights to the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament by the combined forces of CBS and Turner, which are paying $10.8 billion over 14 years. ESPN offered 10 percent less than CBS and Turner. “The N.C.A.A. is instructive,” said John Skipper, ESPN’s executive vice president for content. “We felt we had the best plan. I’m confident we’ll have an excellent Olympic plan, but, like the N.C.A.A., we expect to be aggressive and prudent.” NBC and Comcast officials declined to comment. Acquiring the rights to the Olympics is often a case of want, not need. They provide 17 days of highly rated programming and blanket the Internet. But they lack the week-to-week power of N.F.L. games like those that NBC carries on Sunday nights, which is the network’s highest-rated program. Dick Ebersol, who has run NBC’s sports division since 1989, adores the Olympics, produces them and would probably have left if another network had acquired them. He is part of the Olympic movement, was a close friend of the former I.O.C. president Juan Antonio Samaranch and is a recipient of the committee’s highest honor, the Olympic Order.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9501E0DD1239F937A15751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=comcastcorporation">F.C.C. Is Said to Give Nod To Comcast-NBC Takeover<date>Published: December 24, 2010</date><text>7:26 p.m. | Updated The Federal Communications Commission chairman, Julius Genachowski, signaled his approval of Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal on Thursday, but that approval will come with conditions. Among the anticipated stipulations is that Comcast not withhold NBC programming from its competitors in the online video market and that it allow rival distributors to have reasonable access to NBC Universal programming. Details about the proposed conditions started to trickle out Thursday after the F.C.C. started to share its order for the deal internally. Essentially, the order is a draft of the rules that Comcast and NBC will have to operate under. Citing normal procedure, the F.C.C. did not release the order or characterize it in detail, but people with knowledge of the draft spoke on condition of anonymity. F.C.C. officials said that the proposed conditions were intended to ease harm to consumers, and they emphasized that they were not treating the deal as an opportunity to affect industrywide policy. They did not say how long the conditions would be in effect. Mr. Genachowski has concluded that the pending combination of NBC and Comcast meets the so-called public interest standards that the F.C.C. is charged with upholding, as long as the conditions are imposed, the officials said. Mr. Genachowski and the four other F.C.C. commissioners will vote on the deal at some point, most likely in early January. In a statement, Comcast said it was ''gratified'' that Mr. Genachowski's office had taken the step forward. ''Starting on the day of the deal's announcement, we have emphasized that this transaction is pro-competitive, pro-consumer, and will deliver real public interest benefits,'' the company said. The deal is being closely watched because of its sheer size - it would bring together the NBC network and cable channels like Bravo and MSNBC with Comcast's giant cable and Internet systems - and its possible effects on the online video market. Regulators have worried that Comcast and NBC together could harm the developing market for video viewed on the Internet, in part because NBC owns a stake in Hulu. There are indications that the other government agency reviewing the deal, the Justice Department, is preparing to approve it. A person with knowledge of the Justice Department's approach said that talks continued with Comcast about a consent decree, which is commonly issued when companies merge. The department declined to comment. In reviewing the Comcast-NBC Universal deal, the Justice Department has primarily assessed whether the acquisition will be anticompetitive, and the F.C.C. has assessed whether it is in the public interest. The two agencies have worked closely on the review, even holding a joint meeting with Comcast representatives earlier in the month. Other conditions expected to be imposed by the F.C.C. involve access to Comcast's systems by rival programmers, some protections for over-the-air television and commitments to diversity and local news programming. On Wednesday, the companies said they expected regulatory approval to come in January. They had previously expected the deal to be approved by the end of 2010.

The companies said Wednesday that full regulatory approval of the deal, under which Comcast would initially acquire 51 percent of NBC Universal from General Electric, would not be completed by the end of December, as Comcast executives had hoped. The news is a setback for Comcast, which said all year that it expected the deal - announced in December 2009 - to close by the end of 2010.

The F.C.C. is preparing to circulate its order for the deal, perhaps as early as Thursday. Representatives for both agencies declined to comment on Wednesday. According to filings before the F.C.C., online video has been a focus of discussions with Comcast. Accordingly, the agency is likely to impose strong conditions on the deal that would affect the online video market. There have been no indications that the agencies would block the deal outright. Jeffrey Zucker, the outgoing NBC Universal chief executive, said in a memo to staff members Wednesday that ''we have made substantial progress this month with both the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice, and expect that we will get a 'green light' in January.'' Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokeswoman, concurred in a statement, which read, ''We are appreciative of the hard work by the F.C.C. and D.O.J. staff and by our own transition teams, and look forward to completing the process early next year.''

Some of those critics are on Capitol Hill. Senator John D. Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia who is chairman of the Senate committee on commerce, science and transportation, wrote to the F.C.C. on Dec. 10 to convey his concerns that ''a media merger of this size has the potential to leave consumers with lesser programming and higher rates.'' In a letter to the F.C.C. chairman, Julius Genachowski, Mr. Rockefeller singled out the nascent online video market as an area where Comcast could cause harm by favoring its own content. Once regulatory approval is obtained, there are other complications for Comcast and NBC, some of which are tied to bookkeeping. ''The official close of the transaction would happen shortly after government approval,'' Mr. Zucker said in the memo. ''Until then, of course, business continues as normal.''

Is Focus Features on the block? Officially, no. Universal Studios, which owns the specialty film company, denied a report in The Los Angeles Times that it was in talks to sell Focus to Alec and Tom Gores, independent investors who have interests in the entertainment industry. “We often receive interest in Focus Features, which is an attractive asset. But we are not in active negotiations to sell Focus,” a spokeswoman said on Friday. Still, there have been flirtations between Universal and the Gores camp about a potential sale, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked for anonymity because the conversations were private. Other entertainment companies, including Relativity Media, have kicked Focus’s tires in recent months. Focus, perhaps best known for releasing “Brokeback Mountain,” has been valued at around $300 million. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink A spokesman for the Gores declined comment. The two men, advised by their brother Sam Gores, founder of the Paradigm talent agency, made an unsuccessful run at Miramax Films earlier this year. (The Walt Disney Company ultimately sold Miramax to an investor group for $663 million.) Any sale of Focus would need the blessing of Comcast, whose purchase of NBC Universal, the parent company of Universal Studios, is pending regulatory approval. The art house business has become increasingly difficult in recent years as a result of a glut of specialty films in the marketplace and spiking marketing costs. Disney, Paramount Pictures and Warner Brothers have already shuttered, sold or downsized their art house units. Focus is profitable, but significantly less so than in past years, when hits like “Brokeback Mountain,” which sold over $178 million at the global box office in 2005, buoyed the bottom line. “The Kids Are All Right,” the most recent release of significance by Focus, sold $28.7 million worldwide, a fine result but one that fell short of industry expectations.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/opinion/06mon2.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast and NBC<date>Published: December 6, 2010</date><text>Television is undergoing a wrenching change. Companies like Netflix and Google TV are lining up to offer movies and TV online. Cable systems are developing online bundles as they add broadband customers but lose TV subscribers. Broadcast networks are still figuring out how to sell their shows online, and charging cable systems more as ad money moves to the Internet. Amid this change, Comcast, the biggest cable system in the country, proposed last year to buy NBC Universal, which controls Universal Studios, cable channels like Bravo and USA, and the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks. It is eager to get approval from the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice’s antitrust division this year. Regulators do not need to rush. The combined company would have the ability, and the incentive, to hamstring online innovation. The F.C.C. and the Justice Department must carefully assess potential threats to the new competition and put precise conditions on a merger to prevent the new media goliath from stamping it out. This is not the classic “horizontal merger” between two companies that do the same thing. Comcast produces little television and NBC does not own cable. The issue is that the merged company would own both a major producer of TV and movies and the dominant distributor of TV and movies in big media markets. It would have about a quarter of the multichannel market and about a fifth of broadband subscribers. Online TV is particularly vulnerable. Unlike cable, online providers are not covered by program access rules that force networks to provide their programs on reasonable terms. Companies like Netflix and Hulu — which is owned by several TV networks, including NBC — get shows from TV networks and movie studios and distribute them on somebody else’s broadband. This platform could one day allow viewers to buy whatever show they wanted, on any broadband service provider or cable TV plan, anywhere in the country. To Comcast, this prospect is fairly threatening. It would undermine its ability to keep customers inside its ecosystem of cable and broadband, where it has control over its bundles and has more pricing power. In combination with NBC Universal, it could do a lot to stop or slow the online revolution. What if the combined company limited access to its shows online to subscribers of its broadband service or cable packages? Or if it refused to provide NBC Universal content to rival online services? It could degrade the online signal of rivals, or charge through the roof to transmit their content to its broadband subscribers. Recently, Level 3 Communications, which operates a broadband backbone that interconnects content suppliers and service providers, revealed that shortly after it cut a deal with Netflix to carry its movies, Comcast demanded an extra toll to pipe its content to subscribers. If the merger between Comcast and NBC is to be approved, these tactics must be put off limits. The merged company must be made to provide content not only to rival cable systems but also to Internet-only rivals, on reasonable terms. And it should also commit, in a legally binding way, to offer reasonably priced broadband subscriptions independent of its TV bundles.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/technology/personaltech/03SERVICE.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Streaming Movie Services Create Niche Industry<date>Published: December 2, 2010</date><text>STREAMING movies on household TV offers vast amounts of appeal. It’s why hardware manufacturers are devoting so much energy to the proposition. They are not alone. An entire industry geared toward establishing a foothold in this nascent market has cropped up, streaming movies, TV and other content in both standard and high definition, and offering subscription models. Netflix has augmented its DVD subscription model with streaming videos, allowing users unlimited access to its online library, which, while hardly as robust as its physical counterpart, is consistently growing. The company recently announced plans for a streaming-only plan for $8 a month. Per-movie rental fees can be found from other providers. Vudu looks to differentiate itself from Netflix by the quality of its streams (many of which are available in HD) and the newness of its releases (many titles arrive at the same time they are released in video stores). Its titles are rentable on an individual basis. “If you talk to people who are getting $100,000 media rooms, those people aren’t going to be too psyched to stream Netflix movies, but they’ll be pretty happy to stream Vudu HDX movies,” said Edward Lichty, Vudu’s general manager, describing the company’s 1080p streaming format, optimized for screens 40 inches and larger. Amazon on Demand also offers individual rentals, but users download the movies instead of streaming them. (In many instances, they have a fixed amount of time to watch them after first pressing play.) In March, Wal-Mart Stores bought Vudu, spurring cross-platform promotions. Those who bought a physical copy of “Toy Story 3” at Wal-Mart, for example, have access to the movie in the so-called cloud, giving them the ability to stream it to any connected device. A number of companies have cropped up to present specialized streaming options. Comcast offers free streaming for most shows on its network to paid subscribers through its Xfinity program. Those who get HBO, for example, can stream this season’s episodes of “Boardwalk Empire” at no additional charge; some complete back episodes for series like “Dexter” are similarly available. Further offerings can be had on an à la carte basis for rental. GreenCine focuses on independent, international and documentary films. (Its sex-oriented division, AdultCine, is self-explanatory.) VOD.com sells minutes of viewing time, which can then be spent on its catalog. Crackle streams Sony movies and some TV shows free, with commercial interruption. Hulu, a joint venture of NBC, ABC and Fox, is free but also offers a subscription version, which for a monthly fee allows users to see every episode from the current season of a host of shows and offers increased access to older shows. This is just the beginning. Time Warner recently announced a plan to stream HD and 3-D movies shortly after they hit theaters. Other companies have similar plans. For consumers holding off on streaming movies because the desired selection or quality isn’t available yet, give it a minute. It’ll be here soon.

Level 3, which helps to deliver Netflix's streaming movies, said Comcast had effectively erected a tollbooth that ''threatens the open Internet,'' and indicated that it would seek government intervention. Comcast quickly denied that the clash had anything to do with network neutrality, instead calling it ''a simple commercial dispute.'' The dispute highlighted the growing importance of Internet video delivery - an area that some people say needs to be monitored more closely by regulators. Net neutrality, which posits that Internet traffic should be free of any interference from network operators like Comcast, is thought to be on the December agenda of the Federal Communications Commission. ''With this action, Comcast demonstrates the risk of a 'closed' Internet, where a retail broadband Internet access provider decides whether and how their subscribers interact with content,'' Thomas C. Stortz, the chief legal officer for Level 3, said in a statement Monday. Those issues cut to the heart of Comcast's imminent acquisition of NBC Universal, which is in the final stages of review by the F.C.C. and the Justice Department. The F.C.C. is considering attaching a condition to the merger that would aim to keep Comcast's Internet network open to competitors, according to public filings this month. In theory, without government action, Comcast could speed up streams of NBC programs and slow down streams of its rivals' programs. ''This may be one of those teaching moments for consumers to understand what's at stake,'' said Michael McGuire, a media analyst for Gartner. There is no known case of Comcast ever slowing the traffic to one of its direct competitors, but it did delay some peer-to-peer file traffic in a much-litigated case several years ago. Comcast says it supports an open Internet - but also says that it needs to be able to manage its expensive and still-evolving networks, which are essentially on- and off-ramps to the Internet. Level 3 in essence operates a highway that connects to those ramps and handles traffic to and from individual Web sites. Comcast customers rely on the company's on- and off-ramps from that highway. With nearly 17 million broadband Internet customers, Comcast is the nation's largest such service provider. The scuffle between the two started on Nov. 19, when Level 3 says Comcast demanded a recurring fee to ''transmit Internet online movies and other content to Comcast's customers who request such content.'' Three days later, under pressure from Comcast, ''Level 3 agreed to the terms, under protest, in order to ensure customers did not experience any disruptions,'' Mr. Stortz said. Mr. Stortz did not cite Netflix in his statement. But just a week before Comcast's demand, Level 3 announced a multiyear deal to support Netflix's rapidly growing streaming service. A recent study found that at peak times, Netflix represented 20 percent of Internet download traffic in the United States. That makes it a de facto competitor for incumbent distributors like Comcast and Time Warner Cable, which are eager to protect both the subscription television business and the emerging video-on-demand business. Mr. Stortz implied that Comcast was taking the action to impair companies that compete with its own cable and Internet services. A spokesman for Netflix declined to comment Monday. Netflix, which announced a new pricing structure last week, is gradually weaning its customers from DVDs by mail in favor of online streaming, making any new costs a serious concern. Comcast on Monday rebuffed the notion that the new fees were related to Netflix by saying that the type of traffic distributed by Level 3 was irrelevant. Joe Waz, a senior vice president at Comcast, says it has had a peering agreement with Level 3 to swap traffic fairly evenly. Now Level 3 is sharply increasing its traffic, he said, while resisting a commercial agreement to pay for that. Comcast is ''already carrying huge amounts of video to our high-speed Internet customers every day through commercial arrangements, and it seems to be working for everybody else,'' Mr. Waz said. ''Level 3 is trying to change the rules of the game.'' If nothing else, the dispute demonstrates that consumers have little, if any, idea how convoluted it can be to transmit video to a computer or mobile phone. Nonetheless, on Monday night, public interest groups that have steadfastly opposed the combination of Comcast and NBC Universal argued that the Level 3 case proved that Comcast would discriminate against competitors if it could. ''On its face, this is the sort of toll booth between residential subscribers and the content of their choice that a net neutrality rule is supposed to prohibit,'' said Harold Feld, legal director of one such group, Public Knowledge, in a statement. Mr. Stortz said Level 3 would be approaching government regulators this week and ''asking them to take quick action to ensure that a fair, open and innovative Internet does not become a closed network controlled by a few institutions with dominant market power that have the means, motive and opportunity to economically discriminate between favored and disfavored content.'' Mr. McGuire, of Gartner, said, ''There is no law here. There are only guiding principles. F.C.C. clarity on this kind of thing is going to be required.''

In September, the companies said in a statement that they would make no further personnel announcements “until the deal-closing process and timing is certain.” “For a deal this large, and one that hasn’t been approved, Comcast’s behavior is presumptuous and arrogant,” one of the officials said. Those officials did not want to be identified commenting on the negotiations. But the episode encapsulates what seems to be the differing attitude of Comcast on one side, and the Federal Communications Commission and Justice Department on the other: Comcast believes the proposed merger is an all-but-foregone conclusion, while the government is saying “just hold on a minute.” Comcast, the nation’s largest cable television provider, is acquiring a majority stake in NBC Universal, the owner of the NBC broadcast network and cable channels like USA and Bravo. Comcast says the merger will provide consumers with a greater quantity of anytime, anywhere programming. Its executives expect to win approval by the end of the year. The government is expected to impose conditions to protect against anti-competitive behavior by the combined entity. Conditions are a common feature of mergers, but they are especially significant in this case because the Comcast-NBC merger comes at a time of intense focus on online video. Regulators have repeatedly asked the companies for additional information about online video, in part because NBC owns a stake in Hulu, the streaming TV and film Web site. According to filings before the F.C.C., officials there are considering imposing conditions on the Internet distribution of video. One condition could be to apply to the Internet “program access” rules that prohibit distributors like Comcast from withholding programming they own from traditional competitors. Such a condition could make it easier for entrepreneurs to distribute channels on the Internet, bypassing cable. Because Comcast is a major supplier of broadband Internet, the F.C.C. appears to be concerned about bottlenecks in the delivery of video to consumers. Accordingly, it is also considering a net neutrality condition to the deal. In a meeting last Monday, Comcast stressed that online video distribution was a “nascent and rapidly evolving market,” one of the company’s F.C.C. filings indicates, implying that it should be free of regulation. Apart from online video, in a meeting last Wednesday F.C.C. officials discussed conditions relating to disputes between Comcast and other programmers and distributors. Regulators may require arbitration in some such disputes, but Comcast said in a meeting that judgments about channel carriage “should not be subject to second-guessing by a private arbitrator,” according to another of the filings. Comcast and the government agencies all declined to comment on the status of the merger review. “The matter is pending,” a Justice Department spokeswoman said on Sunday. Since August, Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, has been meeting about the merger twice a week with John Flynn, his senior adviser for transactions, and senior aides. The F.C.C. tries to complete merger reviews within 180 days whenever possible, and that so-called merger clock runs out on Wednesday.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/media/22nbc.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast’s Plans for NBC Are Evident in New Executive Lineup<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>Comcast did not initiate a broad Sherman’s March through the management of NBC Universal last week when it announced its new executive lineup in anticipation of the government’s approval of its takeover. The move was more surgical than scorched-earth.The result confirms the accepted wisdom about the deal: that the cable division was “clearly the crown jewel asset” as James Ratcliffe, a cable and satellite television analyst for Barclays Capital, put it. But the changes could also increase the uncertainty at the struggling NBC network. The top cable executives, Bonnie Hammer and Lauren Zalaznick, saw their portfolios expanded, as did Dick Ebersol, NBC’s top sports executive. Ms. Hammer added the E Channel, Ms. Zalaznick now will run the Style Channel, and Mr. Ebersol will get a major expansion of his sports empire by adding the Golf Channel and Versus, another sports cable channel. Those exiting include some of the biggest names at the company, headed by the chief executive, Jeff Zucker, whose departure was already announced, and Jeff Gaspin, the latest programmer assigned to repair the chronic sinkhole of the company, the entertainment division of the NBC network. “Certainly Comcast looked at areas where they had a lot less expertise and there they were going to be a lot more cautious about bringing new people in,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. But there was no caution about trying to rebuild NBC Entertainment. Mr. Gaspin, who also supervised the cable business (Ms. Hammer and Ms. Zalaznick reported to him), had only one cycle of developing programs for the network under his command. But that was apparently enough to convince Comcast executives they needed yet another new approach to find some solution to the long run of failure at NBC in prime time. NBC executives have privately estimated that the entertainment division is losing $300 million a year or more. One senior Hollywood executive, who asked not to be identified because his company must negotiate deals with the new management, said: “The thing that gets all the attention is the network, and the thing that makes all the money is the cable business. I’m not really sure how much they care about the network anymore.” Mr. Gaspin had managed to impress some on the Hollywood creative side with his commitment to the job and his business acumen. One production studio executive said Mr. Gaspin had brought stability to a situation that ranked as “maybe the biggest mess in the history of television.” Steve Burke, the chief operating officer of Comcast who will become the chief executive of NBC Universal, handed the job of fixing that mess to Robert Greenblatt, who most recently ran Showtime. In doing so, Comcast was essentially shrugging off another year of new program development. The television calendar demands that virtually all new ideas for programs be rejected or bought by late fall. NBC has ordered about 125 scripts for new series. Mr. Greenblatt may be able to push through a few projects early in the new year, but he will largely be working from the roster left behind by Mr. Gaspin. Mr. Greenblatt will be in charge of selecting the 19 or so of those 125 scripts that are produced as pilots and whichever of that group is finally put on the air. This latest upheaval will be taking place in a financial atmosphere dominated by sharply diminishing returns. Of the four big networks, only CBS is expected to make a significant profit this year from its prime-time shows. Mr. Gaspin, who declined to comment for this article, has made it clear in previous interviews that a breakout hit — or two or three — would certainly help morale at NBC and might pull in $100 million more a year in revenue. But no such breakout hit has emerged from the batch Mr. Gaspin introduced this fall. NBC spent heavily to acquire shows from A-list program creators like J. J. Abrams (“Undercovers”) and Jerry Bruckheimer (“Chase”), but neither of their efforts grabbed public favor. “Undercovers” has been canceled. “Chase” has already been moved once and appears to be on life support. Those failures mean that Comcast will keep tinkering with NBC Universal. As Craig Moffett, a media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, put it, “Really this is the job that Steve Burke was born to take on.” Mr. Burke is the son of Daniel B. Burke, one of the founders of Capital Cities Communications, which owned ABC. “This is a first step,” Mr. Ratcliffe of Barclays said. “You need a team in place on Day 1. But if Comcast thinks things aren’t working, or things can work better, they will continue making changes. They made it clear: They are not going to be partial participants. They view this as their baby now, and they’re going to run with it.” The cost of settling out the contracts of those top executives is difficult to estimate because the terms are private. One executive with knowledge of the plans to restructure the NBC management said the departing NBC managers were likely to be asked to stay on one day into the new joint venture between Comcast and NBC’s former controlling owner, General Electric. The payouts would then be made by the new entity, which means Comcast would be accountable according to its share in the new ownership, which will be 51 percent, with G.E. on the hook for the other 49 percent. “The dollars involved, while real money, are not the kind of level that’s going to move the needle for investors,” Mr. Ratcliffe said. “It’s Comcast’s project now, and if they want to bring in their own management team, to have their own management in place, given how important this effort is going to be for Comcast, another $20 million to $30 million out of pocket is kind of the cost of doing business.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/business/19views.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Fed’s Stress Tests' Shortcoming - Breakingviews<date>Published: November 18, 2010</date><text>The newly powerful Federal Reserve may have missed a trick. The central bank, charged under the Dodd-Frank overhaul bill with broad oversight of the banking system, is asking the 19 biggest American financial institutions to submit to a series of stress tests. That’s a good thing. The trouble is the regulator plans to keep the results and the criteria used in the tests private.That’s a shame. The stress tests the Fed ran in early 2009 were critical to drawing a line under the financial crisis. By coordinating with fellow banking regulators, the Fed minimized banks’ ability to game the system. More important, it published worst cases and base cases for the economy and various asset classes. And at the end of the exercise, the Fed revealed the financial versions of electrocardiograms for all the institutions it deemed big enough to create havoc in the system if they failed. That convinced investors that the Fed’s diagnosis of the firms’ health — or treatment needed — was appropriate, and bolstered confidence in the system more broadly. Companies raised nearly $200 billion, some easily and cheaply, and others with great difficulty, to shore up their capital and comply with the Fed’s requirements. The process helped end the panic that began in 2008. Now, the Fed is putting banks back on the treadmill to evaluate their desire to begin increasing dividends, buying back stock or expanding. That’s unequivocally a good thing. But by keeping investors at large in the dark on the results, the Fed cannot hope to truly increase confidence in the same way it did a year ago. Banks may feel that divulging so much information would be burdensome. But their too-big-to-fail status has conferred benefits, especially cheap financing. So some additional disclosure obligation seems fair. The lack of transparency may not be entirely the Fed’s fault. It could be as much a flaw of the financial law, which mandates regular reviews of this kind but doesn’t detail their scope or require public disclosure. This may just be one of the first obvious defects in the law to come to light. Mixed Media The courage of Comcast’s conviction will now be on full display. Even the most idiosyncratic American cable television owners, the Dolan family, have decided that separating content from distribution is an idea worth exploring for their company, Cablevision. That makes the decision by Comcast’s boss, Brian Roberts, to move in the other direction by acquiring NBC Universal stand out even more. Though it struck a good deal, Comcast will need to execute impeccably to satisfy investors. Cablevision considered the idea of spinning off networks like AMC and Sundance Channel five years ago as part of a more sweeping proposal for the company. Though the plan flopped and James and Charles Dolan could easily be dismissed as industry wild cards, Cablevision turned out to be ahead of its time. Since then, Time Warner disconnected cable from its media operations, Cox Communications unloaded the Travel Channel, and Rupert Murdoch invested billions to buy more content but parted with his controlling stake in the DirecTV satellite broadcaster to reclaim News Corporation shares from John Malone. Now Cablevision is following the pack, hoping to structure a detachment of Rainbow Media as a tax-free pro rata distribution to shareholders. On the same day that Cablevision announced its fragmentation analysis, Comcast laid the groundwork for taking control of NBC Universal, with its TV channels and movie studio, from General Electric. The deal still awaits regulatory approval, but Comcast unveiled a new executive lineup for NBC’s divisions under Stephen Burke, the cable operator’s chief operating officer. They’ll be under pressure to deliver on what will now be a unique business model with cable and programming housed under one roof. Other companies have unwound the structure for a variety of reasons. Yet all of them, at one time or another, met with unhappy investors who found value trapped inside the mixed media. Comcast’s shareholders will have no easy comparison to make, meaning managers, however good they may be, will struggle each quarter to showcase how and why it all works together. The battle already looks uphill. Comcast, at 16 times estimated earnings, is a slight discount to Time Warner Cable, according to Thomson Reuters data — and a long way from the 22 multiple at which Cablevision trades.

But at least one senator says strongly that the deal should be blocked by the Federal Communications Commission, which must officially sanction the merger before it can be consummated. Senator Bernie Sanders, the Independent from Vermont, wrote a letter to the five F.C.C. commissioners, to be delivered Tuesday, in which he denounces the deal. “The sale of NBCU to Comcast would create an enormously powerful, vertically integrated media conglomerate, causing irreparable damage to the American media landscape and ultimately to society as a whole,” he wrote. Mr. Sanders said the deal would lead to higher costs to consumers, would damage competition and would  limit the diversity of voices in the media. He suggested that Comcast had doubled its campaign contributions to politicians in order help influence Congressional support for the merger. Many of his charges echo complaints about the proposed deal by consumer advocates. Congress has no direct authority over approval of the deal, which is in the hands of the F.C.C. and the Justice Department. The deal is expected to win approval, though regulators may impose some conditions. One of the points raised by Mr. Sanders went directly to the issue of Comcast’s imminent naming of a new management team for NBC Universal. In the letter, he wrote: “Although Comcast has done little to prove that the proposed merger is in the public interest, it has been busy measuring the drapes at NBC. Despite ongoing review, Comcast has on several occasions announced plans for replacing NBCU’s executives with Comcast staff and restructuring of NBCU’s senior leadership. These actions suggest a disregard for the important and ongoing agency reviews of the merger—or worse, a belief that Comcast has successfully controlled the federal review process.” On Monday night, Jeff Gaspin, the chief entertainment executive at NBC Universal, told his staff that he would leave after the company merged with Comcast. Mr. Gaspin said in a note that he could not reach an agreement with Stephen B. Burke, the incoming chief executive. Mr. Burke “has determined that he wants to move in a different direction” and “we could not agree on an appropriate role for me in the new company,” Mr. Gaspin said. Comcast is expected to name the former entertainment chief of the Showtime channel, Robert Greenblatt, as its top entertainment executive. Mr. Gaspin’s announcement comes on the heels of the departure of Jeff Zucker, who had been serving as chief executive. Mr. Gaspin has been in charge of NBC’s entertainment division since June 2008. He also supervised NBC’s cable channels. Mr. Gaspin had been thought for a time to be close to securing a role in the revamped NBC management structure under Comcast. But as details of the new executive lineup have leaked out in recent weeks his name did not appear.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/28/business/media/28comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Loses Viewers, but Earnings Beat Forecasts<date>Published: October 27, 2010</date><text>Is it the economy, competition or the Internet that has consumers cutting their cable television service?That was the underlying question about Comcast’s third-quarter earnings, in which an overall strong performance was clouded by the loss of 275,000 basic cable television subscribers. The subscriber losses were greater than most analysts expected, but Comcast, which is on the verge of acquiring NBC Universal, was able to exceed Wall Street’s earnings and revenue forecasts because it added high-speed Internet and voice customers, and charged its television customers more. The average cable television bill at Comcast is now $129.75 a month, up from $107.20 in 2008. Over all, the company reported net income of $867 million, down from $944 million a year ago. Some of the decline was because of higher expenses related to the acquisition of NBC Universal, which executives in a conference call said was expected to win regulatory approval by the end of the year. Excluding those expenses, the company reported earnings of 32 cents a share, better than the 30 cents forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue in the quarter grew 7.3 percent, to $9.5 billion. Comcast executives said the subscriber losses did not reflect customers canceling cable to watch programming on the Internet — the so-called cord-cutting phenomenon. Instead, they blamed the weak economy for the losses and said that many who cut service did not flee to a competitor — like Verizon or DirecTV — but instead opted for free, over-the-air television. That is a much more palatable explanation for the company, and the media industry at large, because it implies that once the economy improves, subscribers will return. “The customers they are losing tend to be in the bottom half of the economy — a lot of them appear to be struggling to make ends meet,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, who has written recently about how the increase in the number of Americans under the poverty line has affected the media industry. Mr. Moffett said the cable industry had failed to provide lower-cost packages, with the lower tier of service starting at around $60 a month. He said this was because the owners of cable channels insisted on full distribution, rather than allowing customers to pick and choose channels, and to seek ever-increasing prices. Mr. Moffett said the image of the cord-cutter had been that of a “cutting-edge technologist” who preferred to bypass cable to watch programming on computers and on an ever-proliferating array of devices. “The reality is it’s someone who’s 40 years old and poor and settling for a dog’s breakfast of Netflix and short-form video.” He added that “the image that people are cutting the cord because they like what’s on the Internet better is giving way to a much more realistic view that what they find on the Internet is marginally good enough when you’re making a choice between a full-service cable package and a third meal on the table.” Comcast’s loss of 275,000 basic cable subscribers was more than double the loss from the previous year’s third quarter and higher than some analysts expected. David C. Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak, for example, had forecast a decline of 221,000 subscribers. In the quarter, the company also added 249,000 high-speed Internet customers and 228,000 voice subscribers. Comcast shares rose 63 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $20.27.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/f-c-c-seeks-more-info-on-comcast-nbc-deal/?ref=comcastcorporation">F.C.C.

The F.C.C. on Monday sent letters to Comcast and NBC Universal asking questions about both companies’ businesses. Among other things, regulators are seeking details about Comcast’s distribution agreements for several popular cable channels that it already owns, including regional sports networks, E! Entertainment, Versus and the Golf Channel. The F.C.C. also wants details about Comcast’s current channel lineups and about the thinking behind Comcast’s decisions on which programming to carry. From NBC Universal, the F.C.C. is asking for details about existing agreements with a number of cable, satellite and phone companies to carry popular NBC Universal channels, including Oxygen and local NBC and Telemundo stations. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, is seeking F.C.C. and Justice Department approval to acquire a 51 percent interest in NBC Universal from General Electric. The combination has raised worries among satellite companies, rival cable operators and other subscription video providers that Comcast would use its control of NBC Universal to push up prices for programming or even withhold it altogether.

As a distributor of cable programming, Comcast is in business with Fox and its parent company, the News Corporation. The business interests of Comcast and the News Corporation were brought to light in a lawsuit by Barry Nolan, a Comcast employee whose protest of Mr. O’Reilly cost him a $200,000-a-year job two years ago. Mr. Nolan later protested his firing, and last month, he lost the case. In an extensive review of Mr. Nolan’s case for the Columbia Journalism Review in August, the writer Terry Ann Knopf asserted that Mr. Nolan’s firing reflected the “corrosive influence of over-concentrated corporate power.” Dan Kennedy, an assistant professor of journalism at Northeastern University who wrote about the firing for The Boston Phoenix newspaper in 2008, said Mr. Nolan “learned a lesson in how seriously media corporations take their relationships with other media corporations.” Citing the impending merger of Comcast and NBC — it is awaiting regulatory approval — Mr. Kennedy said, “Keith Olbermann may prove to be Barry Nolan writ large.” Last year, NBC Universal and the News Corporation tried to tamp down the televised combat between Mr. Olbermann and Mr. O’Reilly, with limited success. Even NBC’s parent, General Electric, waded into the fray. But the sparring was also good for business, at least for Mr. Olbermann, who was taking on a more popular competitor and gaining attention by doing so. Mr. Nolan did not appear to be seeking attention when he took on Mr. O’Reilly. In 2008, he was the host of a talk show for a Comcast regional channel, called CN8 at the time. He became incensed when the New England chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, of which he was a member, decided to give an award to Mr. O’Reilly, a conservative and controversial prime-time host on Fox. To Mr. Nolan, Mr. O’Reilly was a bully who played loose with the facts, unfit for an award. So he spoke up, not on Comcast’s airwaves, but in a series of e-mail messages from his Comcast account, petitioning the academy’s board members and complaining about the award in a newspaper interview. Comcast later said in a legal filing that Mr. Nolan’s protest “jeopardized and harmed the business and economic interests” of the company because Comcast and Fox were “actively engaged in contract renewal negotiations at the time of Nolan’s protest.” The News Corporation is one of the biggest suppliers of content to Comcast, with contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Days before the awards show, which was to be televised by CN8, Mr. Nolan’s boss, Eileen Dolente, counseled him not to create “a scene” or involve Comcast in his protest. Mr. Nolan says he did not; he simply handed out pamphlets that quoted Mr. O’Reilly’s broadcasts (and a harassment lawsuit leveled at Mr. O’Reilly in 2004), and stood up and walked away from his seat at Comcast’s table when the award was presented. In Comcast’s view, Mr. Nolan blatantly defied an order by his boss. On May 12, two days after the awards event, he was suspended for two weeks without pay. Documents that were unearthed in the lawsuit revealed how prickly Mr. O’Reilly can be when attacked. On the day Mr. Nolan was suspended, Mr. O’Reilly sent a complaint about him straight to the chief executive of Comcast, Brian L. Roberts. On corporate letterhead, Mr. O’Reilly wrote that he and Fox News, FNC for short, considered Comcast to be an “excellent business partner,” and for that reason, “it was puzzling” to see Mr. Nolan “use Comcast corporate assets to attack me and FNC.” “All of us here hope this situation will subside and that is why I am bringing it to your attention,” Mr. O’Reilly added. There is no proof that Mr. Nolan’s suspension — or his firing later that month — occurred because of Mr. O’Reilly’s complaint. But for Mr. Nolan, it is easy to connect the dots. Asked what he thought happened, Mr. Nolan said, “O’Reilly threw a little fit and wrote a letter to Brian Roberts, and inferred in lawyerly language that this would have an effect on our business relationship. And Brian Roberts, in what I think is a kind of gutless caving to a man like O’Reilly, says, ‘Fire the guy.’” Presented with that version of events, Comcast said in a statement, “Barry Nolan was terminated by CN8 for the reasons he was told — insubordination.” In a lawsuit, Mr. Nolan accused Comcast of interfering with his free speech rights. Comcast called that claim baseless, and on Sept. 21, a district court judge struck down the suit, finding that Mr. Nolan’s employment agreement allowed Comcast to terminate him “for any reason, or no reason at all.” Mr. Nolan said on Sunday that he intended to appeal. Mr. Nolan said he feared Comcast’s takeover of NBC Universal because of what it might mean for Mr. Olbermann and other critics of Fox. He said, “Under Comcast, is this the way the news division is going to be run?” David L. Cohen, an executive vice president for Comcast, said, “We have been quite clear about our irrevocable intent to preserve the journalistic independence of NBC News, even making a written commitment on the same day we announced the transaction to that effect.” In May, Mr. Roberts was asked in an onstage interview at a cable conference about the news division and said, “The single most awesome asset that comes from this deal is NBC News.” In any case, Mr. Olbermann said in an e-mail message on Sunday that there was no comparison between him and Mr. Nolan. “I’ve run into O’Reilly many times in public — at Yankee Stadium as recently as a month ago — and never have instigated, and never would dream of instigating, something like that,” he wrote. “For that matter, I don’t think Bill would, either.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/sprints-clearwire-resignations-spark-deal-chatter/?ref=comcastcorporation">Clearwire Resignations Spark Chatter<date>October 1, 2010, 5:20 am</date><text>Three top executives of Sprint Nextel resigned from the board of its Clearwire venture, stoking speculation it would pave the way for a wholesale deal or equity stake sale to T-Mobile USA, Reuters reported. Sprint said the resignations were only to comply with new developments in antitrust laws on director independence and were unrelated to any negotiations Clearwire might be having with potential investors. But the news sent shares of Clearwire up 3 percent as investors bet the resignations would make it easier for Clearwire to do a deal with a company such as Sprint’s rival T-Mobile USA, a venture of Deutsche Telekom. The companies said on Thursday that Dan Hesse, chief executive of Sprint, Clearwire’s majority owner, resigned from the venture’s board on Sept 28 along with Sprint’s strategy chief Keith Cowan and top networks executive Steven Elfman. Reuters continued: The move comes after Clearwire, which needs new funding to continue expanding a network it is building, said last week it was in talks with T-Mobile USA about a potential deal in which the No. 4 US mobile service could invest in Clearwire to rent space on its network at discount rates. “People are interpreting this as paving the way for some kind of additional negotiations with T-Mobile USA, which has been talking to Clearwire and Lightsquared about its 4G wireless strategy,” Watts said. Lightsquared is a private company that is setting itself up as a Clearwire rival. T-Mobile spokesman Andreas Fuchs confirmed T-Mobile USA is looking at different options and that Clearwire was one of them. Clearwire declined comment on speculation related to the resignations but said the decision was made to address legal questions that had originally been raised by Clearwire. The news comes amid speculation about tensions over strategy between Sprint and Clearwire, whose investors include cable providers such as Comcast, and technology companies Intel Corp and Google.

That spending has recently become a talking point for opponents, who say that Comcast is effectively trying to buy government approval for the deal. “It’s a big, expensive example of machine politics,” said Susan P. Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, who is writing a book about the proposed merger. “You hire all the lobbyists and lawyers in town; you hand out contributions to every politician you can think of; you buy the affections of every group that might complain about the merger, and you strike fear in the hearts of anyone who will need to do business with you in the future.” She added, “It’s about as subtle as a wet fish in the face.” Comcast counters by saying that such steps are common when companies are facing regulatory approval in Washington. It says the merger is pro-competitive and in the public interest, promising fuller access to TV shows, movies and news. A recent full-page ad in The Washington Post featured a smiling young couple and the quote, “More ways to enjoy our TV, computer and even mobile devices? Sounds good to me.” “It is obviously important that we explain the public interest benefits of the transaction to Congress, the administration and the public,” said Sena Fitzmaurice, Comcast’s vice president for government communications, adding that “special interests” have been advocating against the deal. Comcast’s bid to gain control of NBC Universal from General Electric, valued at $30 billion, was announced last December. It is awaiting approval by the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department, representing a major test of the Obama administration’s position on media consolidation. The companies hope the deal will close by the end of the year. They have many reasons to persuade regulators to move swiftly: for one, analysts say Comcast’s stock has been discounted by the uncertainty about the deal. On Sunday afternoon, Comcast and G.E. announced that Stephen Burke would succeed Mr. Zucker as the NBC Universal chief executive, as had been expected. The companies said in a statement that they would make no further personnel announcements “until the deal closing process and timing is certain.” Because not all of Comcast’s persuasive techniques are subject to disclosure, it is impossible to know exactly how much money has been spent. But the Center for Responsive Politics, which operates OpenSecrets.org, said that through June, Comcast had paid $6.9 million to lobbyists. It paid $12.6 million in 2009. Ms. Fitzmaurice said only some of the “modest uptick” is because of the merger. According to disclosure forms, Comcast has about 30 lobbying firms on its payroll. OpenSecrets.org recently added Comcast to its list of so-called Heavy Hitters, the groups that “consistently bring the biggest bags of cash to political fights.” Contributions to political campaigns in the current election cycle on behalf of Comcast or its employees have not differed much from the election in 2008. That year, Comcast gave almost $3 million to candidates, compared with about $2.5 million so far in this election year. Comcast has spread its campaign contributions very widely, and a significant number of politicians who received contributions have publicly backed the merger. For example, nine of 11 Hispanic members of Congress who signed a letter of support in July received donations this election cycle from Comcast’s political action committee. In part to smooth the way for a deal, Comcast this year announced a $20 million fund for new media businesses owned by minorities . Groups like Free Press, which opposes media consolidation, have worked Comcast’s donations and investments into their antimerger arguments. “So far, most of Comcast’s support seems to have been bought, not earned,” one of the Free Press Web sites, StopBigMedia.com, stated last month. A handful of media companies, notably Bloomberg and Allbritton Communications, which owns Politico and some ABC stations, have opposed the merger. Bloomberg has helped finance the Coalition for Competition in Media, which in turn hired the influential consulting firm Glover Park Group to drum up public opposition. Allbritton has raised eyebrows by running many pages of antimerger ads in Politico, including in the popular morning newsletter Playbook. Frederick J. Ryan Jr., the president of Allbritton, said the legislators and aides he has spoken to “all admit one thing: they have never seen one company spend so much money to move something through the process.” Mr. Ryan asked, “If it’s such a good deal, and it’s so wonderful for everyone who watches television and is interested in news, why do so many lobbyists have to be hired and why does so much money have to be spent to push this merger through?” Comcast is drawing on its years of charitable giving in securing approval for the merger, urging groups across the country that have been the beneficiaries of the company’s largess to write letters of support to the F.C.C. — an effort whose cumulative effect from the more than 1,000 letters on file in Washington paints an image of grand benevolence. The company itself and its charitable arm, the Comcast Foundation, have doled out more than $1.4 billion over the last eight years to groups like the National Urban League, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs, hospitals and AIDS prevention organizations. In part, Comcast does this to give back to the local communities where it owns cable franchises. “There is nothing new about our relationships with community organizations,” Ms. Fitzmaurice said, calling the investments “wholly unrelated to the NBC Universal transaction.” In one of the letters on file with the F.C.C. that is representative of many others, the director of a Boys and Girls Club in Burlington, Vt., wrote that she “recently learned” of the pending transaction with NBC, and continued: “I wanted to take a moment to share some of the positive experiences our organization has had with Comcast and explain why I view the company as a genuinely admirable corporate citizen and valuable member of our Burlington community.” In an interview, Mary Alice McKenzie, the executive director of the club, said that Comcast had given her organization a $20,000 grant to buy computers and other equipment. “The point of the program is to increase digital literacy,” she said. She said that the letter had been sent to the F.C.C. after she was contacted by Comcast and provided with a draft. She said she had reviewed it, made some changes and then signed it.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/business/media/25zucker.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Leaving NBC, Jeff Zucker Relishes His Long Tenure<date>Published: September 24, 2010</date><text>Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal and the longest-serving senior manager at NBC Universal, announced Friday that he would step down upon the completion of the takeover of NBC by Comcast.Mr. Zucker’s fate had been the subject of widespread speculation since Comcast agreed last December to buy 51 percent of NBC Universal from its longtime corporate owner, General Electric. The deal is expected to close at the end of the year, or early next year, following regulatory approval. In an interview Thursday in NBC’s executive offices, Mr. Zucker, who is 45, said the decision to announce that he would leave the only employer he has ever worked for — a decision he acknowledged was not his own — became inevitable after a meeting two weeks ago with Steve Burke, Comcast’s chief operating officer. “We had both gotten to the same place,” Mr. Zucker said. “He made it clear that they wanted to move on at the close of the deal, and I was completely comfortable with that.” Even as he said he accepted the logic of a new owner seeking to install its own chief executive, Mr. Zucker also described his departure as both “incredibly emotional” and “gut-wrenching in the sense that you have spent your whole life here at NBC.” In the face of persistent rumors that Comcast would seek to remove Mr. Zucker the first chance it got, Mr. Zucker had said in previous interviews that he had in no way foreclosed the possibility of staying on. G.E., which retained 49 percent of the company, had awarded Mr. Zucker a new three-year contract seven months ago that was to take him into and past the takeover by Comcast. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chairman of G.E., praised Mr. Zucker’s performance, saying, “In my opinion he has never gotten as much credit as he has deserved.” He added, “I love Jeff: I’d hire him again.” Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chairman, issued a statement Friday, saying Mr. Zucker had led NBC “with integrity and purpose” and that “the success of NBC Universal put us in a wonderful position” going into its new partnership with G.E. “Look, I knew from the day this was announced that this was a possibility,” Mr. Zucker said. “I wasn’t going to shut the door on anything. But in the last nine months it became increasingly clear that they did want to put their own team in place — and I didn’t want to end up being a guest in my own house.” While he often faced withering criticism in Hollywood circles for his leadership of the entertainment division of the NBC network, Mr. Zucker said he did not detect “any particular reason” beyond the broad desire for new leadership for Comcast’s inclination to make a change. Mr. Zucker would not comment on what shape he believed that leadership would take. But another senior executive who has taken part in some of the discussions about NBC’s future said it was a virtual certainty that Mr. Burke himself would take charge as chief of NBC Universal. Two other senior entertainment executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Robert Greenblatt, the former president of entertainment for the Showtime Network, is poised to be named to a prominent role supervising NBC’s entertainment operations, perhaps as early as next week. Mr. Zucker called the media company that he is leaving behind “well positioned,” with most of its assets in strong financial condition. Last year, NBC Universal generated about $2.3 billion in profits, 80 percent of which resided in the company’s cable division. NBC’s entertainment cable channels recently posted their most profitable year for a fifth year in a row. Mr. Zucker also said CNBC, the financial business channel, and the all-news cable channel MSNBC, had logged record profits as well. He also cited strong years from NBC’s theme park division, an improving forecast for Universal Pictures, a comeback in profits for the local television stations owned by NBC and the ratings dominance of every news program on the NBC network. But Mr. Zucker conceded that his legacy at NBC would be colored by what he called “the rap on me,” which has centered on his failure to solve chronic problems in the most high-profile (if not the most high-earning) part of the NBC empire, the prime-time hours on the broadcast network. “Do I wish we’d had more success at NBC Entertainment in recent years? Yes, of course,” Mr. Zucker said. He acknowledged one recent widely publicized blunder, the effort to shift NBC’s late-night star Jay Leno to prime time. But he said it had been a risk worth taking, one “that simply didn’t work out.” Asked to identify the biggest mistake of his tenure, Mr. Zucker said, “The thing I regret most is not moving quickly enough” to fix NBC Entertainment. On the other side of the personal ledger, Mr. Zucker said the highlight of his career remained his days producing the “Today” show, which catapulted to unchallenged leadership and record profits during Mr. Zucker’s two stints as executive producer. Mr. Zucker assumed the “Today” job in 1992 at the age of just 26, one of 10 positions he held during almost a quarter century at NBC. (Mr. Zucker displayed a framed tower of his old business cards. The bottom card listed him as a researcher for NBC’s Olympics; the top one as chief executive.) “Ronald Reagan was president when I got here,” Mr. Zucker said, adding, “I’m O.K. with this, but it’s also very emotional and very tough.” He said, “I’ve spent over half my life at NBC. This is the only place I have ever worked. I’ve been here 24-and-a-half years. I met my wife here. My four kids were born while I was here. I’ve endured colon cancer twice. It’s going to be incredibly strange for me personally” to leave. As for his future, Mr. Zucker said, “I never really thought about it because for 24-and-a-half years I only thought about this place. I have a lot of interests — producing, politics, sports, business.” Friends have previously suggested Mr. Zucker might try to enter political life. “Am I interested in politics? Yes,” he said. “Is it something I am going to do right away? No.” Mr. Zucker said he had completed the details on his contract settlement only Thursday. He did not disclose financial terms of his settlement but said, “Nobody has to worry about me; I’m good.” He will stay on until the deal closes, he said, because Comcast cannot exercise management control until it wins regulatory approval. “Am I disappointed it’s coming to an end?” Mr. Zucker said. “Sure. Am I disappointed with them? No. I understand it. They spent billions of dollars. It’s the way it goes.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/technology/13search.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Combing Your Friends’ Tastes, Not the Whole Web’s<date>Published: September 12, 2010</date><text>Now, even on the Internet, it is not what you know but who you know.After a decade when search engines ruled supreme — tapping billions of Web pages to answer every conceivable query — many people now prefer getting their online information the old-fashioned way: by yakking across the fence. Turning to friends is the new rage in the Web world, extending far beyond established social networking sites and setting off a rush among Web companies looking for ways to help people capitalize on the wisdom of their social circles — and to make some money in the process. “What your friends think and what people like you think is much more relevant than what everybody thinks,” said Augie Ray, an analyst with Forrester Research. Amazon.com now allows its shoppers to connect to their Facebook accounts so that Amazon can display their friends’ favorite books, films and other products. TunerFish, a start-up owned by Comcast, lets users share what television shows and movies they are watching, mapping out an up-to-the-minute TV guide of programs gaining in popularity among their friends. And Loopt, a location-focused social network with 3.4 million registered users, recently began showing them which of their friends liked a particular restaurant. “We’ve gotten a tremendous response from that,” said Sam Altman, a co-founder. Mr. Altman said that one’s network of friends “is an incredible predictor of what you will like.” On Google and other search engines, searches for things like hotels or electronics can turn up a lot of online clutter and spam. Instead, many people informally poll their friends for recommendations, often through social networks like Facebook and Twitter. “Improving search has always been about improving relevance,” Mr. Ray of Forrester said. “But the thinking now is that getting information from your immediate social network is what will really make results more relevant.” While user-contributed review sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor have long been popular ways to get a quick reading on a new place to eat, the sheer volume of reviews they offer can be overwhelming. And the reliability of those reviews can be hard to gauge. Some may have been planted by management, while others are from disgruntled customers with a bone to pick. The trust factor of friends’ suggestions can make a big difference. Mr. Altman said Loopt’s users are 20 times more likely to click on a place their friends had liked or visited than a place that simply ranked higher in search results. So-called recommendation engines on sites like Amazon and Netflix try to guess what customers might like by comparing their previous purchases or rentals with those of others with similar tastes. But that approach often does not offer much insight as to why a particular film or restaurant is being recommended, said John Riedl, a professor of computer science at the University of Minnesota. Social networks, he said, “do a richer job of constructing recommendations.” For example, seeing that a friend is frequenting a new pizzeria can have a lot of influence over whether you go. Of course, your friends are not generating the amount of data that a company like Amazon may use to make its automated recommendations, which could result in fewer choices. “The trade-off is that you will be more comfortable with the recommendation,” Mr. Riedl said. TV watching, often a solitary activity, is an obvious candidate for some social tips. TunerFish shows which programs are gaining in popularity in your online social circle, and what is being watched right now. Although TunerFish is available only on the Web for now, the company says it could eventually be brought to the TV screen through an application running on a set-top box. Facebook has its own recommendation system in place. The service allows its 500 million members to click a button to indicate what news articles, companies and celebrities they “like,” and it shares data about those preferences with its Web partners. When a Facebook user visits a Web site like Yelp or TripAdvisor, they are shown reviews from friends before they get to those from strangers. Facebook recently began introducing a feature called Facebook Questions that allows users to pose questions to friends and strangers using the site. Last month it introduced a service called Places that encourages people to “check in” at places they visit and broadcast their location to friends. The new services will help Facebook amass even more data on its users’ tastes. But for now there is no comprehensive way to search through or refer back to the information your friends have shared. Bret Taylor, the chief technology officer at Facebook, said the company’s main focus was on helping other sites add social features. But he said the company was thinking about ways to corral the “likes” and suggestions of its members into a more cohesive system. “Exposing higher-quality recommendations in more obvious and prominent ways would improve the health of the system,” he said. Hunch, a start-up based in New York, wants to go beyond cataloging the places and products for which your friends have already expressed affection. With some complex software, it tries to use that information to predict what other things you might like, even if nobody you know has ever offered an opinion on those things before. The service pulls in data about articles, topics and people that you and your friends have “liked” on Facebook or follow on Twitter. “Based on your placement in the social graph and who your friends are, we can make inferences about what you like,” said Chris Dixon, who founded the company with Caterina Fake, one of the creators of Flickr. For example, Hunch’s database shows that people who are big fans of Twitter are also likely to be interested in visiting the Museum of Modern Art in New York, while the non-Twitterati tend to favor the theater. Mr. Dixon said the company was testing a local search tool that can make restaurant, shopping and hotel recommendations. “We can take your taste profile and data from the Web and begin to match you to places that you will like,” he said. The company says it plans to unveil partnerships with major e-commerce, news and travel sites, along with mobile location-based services. A shopping or travel site that Hunch is working with could help a visitor decide which offerings would best suit their tastes. Based on the data Hunch has collected about correlations between user preferences, the site might suggest that someone in search of a hotel in Las Vegas should stay at the Venetian if her online circle of friends listens to hip-hop artists like Rihanna and Usher. The friend trend, where likes matter more than links, could eventually present a significant challenge to Google, which has struggled to create appealing social services. In February the company introduced Buzz, which lets Gmail users share updates and photos, and it is including those updates in its customized results when users perform Web searches. “People are likely to find what your friends are saying about the iPhone 4 or a Chinese restaurant more helpful in a Web search,” said Matt Cutts, a software engineer who oversees search quality at Google. Mr. Cutts declined to talk about what Google might do next in the social search area, but he did say he expected “these sorts of trends to continue.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/opinion/08wed1.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Alms for the Rich and Powerful<date>Published: September 7, 2010</date><text>The Elijah Cummings Youth Program in Israel sounds like a lovely idea: a charitable foundation that sends inner-city high school students from Baltimore to Israel to learn about the country and develop leadership skills. The program has undoubtedly been of benefit to many teenagers, but deeper pockets have benefited as well. Comcast, the cable company, has given generously to the foundation, prompting Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Baltimore, to urge the Federal Communications Commission to approve Comcast’s proposed merger with NBC. His charity even wrote its own letter to the F.C.C., saying it supports the merger in part because Comcast gives it money. As Eric Lipton reported in The Times on Monday, charities set up by a score of lawmakers from both parties have become an important — and completely unregulated — way for corporations and lobbyists to get their voices heard and to curry favor on Capitol Hill. While both donors and recipients claim that the millions of dollars pouring into these foundations are good for communities, the real purpose is to make lawmakers look good while skirting limits on campaign contributions and open another door to Washington’s pay-to-play culture. Take, for example, the Utah Families Foundation, a charity that the state’s Republican senior senator, Orrin Hatch, helped establish. While the foundation distributes money to food pantries and women’s shelters, the big companies that gave at least $20,000 got to meet with Mr. Hatch at a foundation golf tournament. Fifteen companies did so, and not for the “executive tee bag” that was also a perk for those high donors. Nine of them were drug companies that have won the senator’s help in reducing federal demands for low-cost generics. Or consider the dozen or so nuclear energy companies that were suddenly interested in financing scholarships for needy South Carolina students once Representative James Clyburn set up a charity to do so. The foundation holds an annual golf tournament and dinner at which corporate givers can hang around Mr. Clyburn, the Democratic whip, and donate to his favorite charity. Nuclear companies said openly they were happy to reward Mr. Clyburn for his support of their industry. Congressional rules require corporate lobbyists to disclose donations to lawmakers’ charities, but many fail to do so with no consequence. The charities themselves are not required to disclose their donors, and there are no limits to the amount a donor can give. The Office of Congressional Ethics looked into a few of these foundations last year, but was stymied when the House granted several congressmen the right to solicit donations even when the donors had business before their committees. The art of currying favor in Washington is an ancient one, and both lawmakers and corporations have become exceptionally creative at finding ways around every legal obstacle reducing the influence of big money. But these “donations” need to be fully disclosed and strictly limited like the campaign contributions they resemble. Members of Congress should pay heed to the rising tide of anti-incumbent disgust this year and stop acting like greedy chiselers of corporate largess.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/business/media/03cbs.html?ref=comcastcorporation">CBS and Comcast Lock 10-Year Subscription Deal<date>Published: August 2, 2010</date><text>In a deal that represents hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for CBS, the network said Monday that it had secured subscriber fees for its local stations from Comcast for the next 10 years.The unusually long-term agreement also lays the groundwork for Comcast subscribers to watch CBS content online through an authentication process sometimes called TV Everywhere. Rather than letting anyone watch television episodes online, media companies want to allow access only to those people who already pay for cable or satellite service. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The 10-year time span proclaims long-term confidence in the monthly subscription business model for media. In fact, CBS said it had never reached a carriage deal of this length before. Last year, the network reached a five-year deal with Time Warner Cable, the nation’s second-biggest cable provider behind Comcast. CBS is to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday after the market closes. The CBS chief executive, Leslie Moonves, has been vocal about demanding so-called retransmission fees from cable systems for the right to carry local television stations. Traditionally, local broadcast stations were free and cable systems paid only for cable channels. However, retransmission fees are becoming more common in the television business. This deal — which was loudly trumpeted by CBS —“says to the marketplace, ‘Yes, people are paying for retransmission,’ ” said Mr. Moonves. A spokeswoman for Comcast said it had been pushing for long-term deals with content providers like CBS. Notably, Comcast’s existing deal with CBS was not set to expire until the end of 2011. The deal with CBS comes as Comcast is trying to buy NBC Universal, the parent of one of CBS’s chief competitors, NBC. Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital, projected in a research report on Monday that CBS would earn about 50 cents a month per subscriber from the Comcast deal in markets where CBS owns television stations, starting in 2012 , for a total of about $75 million a year. He said the fees would probably escalate over time, eventually increasing to about $1 a month. In part because of the retransmission demands, some negotiations between cable systems and content providers have been testy lately, as witnessed when Cablevision viewers missed the beginning of the Oscars in March because of a dispute with the Walt Disney Company. A new dispute is now brewing between Time Warner Cable and Disney. But the talks between CBS and Comcast never became publicly acrimonious. “I think if you have two good, forward-looking companies who value each other, you can get things done,” Mr. Moonves said. Mr. Moonves noted that the negotiations were “probably somewhat easier” for CBS, which owns only one major cable channel, than they are for companies like Disney, which owns numerous channels. Brian L. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, said in a news release, “In this time of rapidly changing technology and viewership interest, we were able to structure a deal that gives customers the content they want without any threat of disrupting their service.” Comcast will have new online and on-demand rights to Showtime series and movies. For instance, Comcast will now have video-on-demand access to CBS’s late-night shows. “There are checks and balances so we will not hurt our product on the air, which is still our bread and butter,” Mr. Moonves said. Also as part of the deal, Comcast will begin carrying the Smithsonian Channel next year, and it will expand the distribution of the CBS College Sports channel. Mr. Moonves said the deal signified “what they’ve said in Washington,” referring to Comcast’s statements to government regulators about the proposed NBC purchase. “They do value the content, and they value the content providers,” he said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/sun-valley-the-year-of-the-no-deal/?ref=comcastcorporation">Live From Sun Valley, Day Three<date>July 8, 2010, 1:10 pm</date><text>1:57 p.m. | Updated SUN VALLEY, Idaho — For years, the Allen &amp; Company annual retreat here has been the birthplace of mega-deals that have reshaped the media landscape. Exhibit A: the sale of ABC to the Walt Disney Company. Exhibit B: the sale of a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast. This year, however, the talk among the moguls has been less about the next big merger than about, at best, smaller deals. And in a couple of cases, strenuous denials that sales are in the offing. On Wednesday, Robert Iger of Disney and Jonathan Miller of the News Corporation both denied that they were shopping around ABC and MySpace, respectively. As DealBook and others reported on Wednesday, Disney is close to selling its Miramax Films unit to an investor group led by Ron Tutor and Colony Capital. But that sales process was in the works weeks before the Allen &amp; Company retreat. Harvey Weinstein, who with his brother Bob co-founded Miramax, is here and has sought to reclaim the company, but is disinclined to discuss the matter. Instead, the tenor of the discussions here — at the catered lunch around the resort’s duck pond, at the closely guarded dinner on the Sun Valley Lodge patio — has been that if there are deals to be struck, they’ll be smaller. They may even be partnerships, Gregory Maffei of Liberty Media said on Wednesday. (Then again, there are two days left for the conference.) Several executives, including investor Gordon Crawford of Capital Research and Management, expressed concern to reporters about the fragile state of the economic recovery. Many of their companies have rebounded from the lows of two years ago, and they’re feeling a bit more confident again. But it’s unclear whether now is the time to consider staking that hard-won trip back to health on a potentially risky acquisition. Many of the panel discussions and the side chats have instead focused on where things go from here. And, perhaps, a tee time or hiking trail. – Michael J. de la Merced Follow the latest developments on Michael’s Twitter feed.

Last month, 74 House Democrats sent a letter to the F.C.C.’s chairman, Julius Genachowski, warning him “not to move forward with a proposal that undermines critically important investment in broadband and the jobs that come with it.” Rather than extend its authority over telecommunications networks to broadband under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, they demanded that the F.C.C. wait for Congress to pass specific legislation. The message parroted views held by AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon — the biggest broadband service providers in the country. (Comcast warned that the F.C.C.’s efforts could “chill investment and innovation.”) Their executives and political action committees have been among the top 20 campaign contributors to 58 of the 74 lawmakers in the past two election cycles. As the F.C.C. proceeds with its plan to regulate broadband access, it seems likely we can expect more of this resistance from members of Congress. Political contributions from AT&amp;T in the current election cycle reached $2.6 million by May 16, on the way to exceeding the total in each of the last three elections. The company has contributed to the campaigns of every Republican and all but three Democrats on the subcommittee that deals with the Internet in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It has given money to more than half the members of the equivalent Senate panel. Comcast has spent more than $2 million on campaign donations; Verizon has given $1.2 million. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association — the industry’s collective lobbying group — has spent about $1 million more. And just in case that isn’t persuasive enough of the ills of government regulation, telephone and cable companies spent $20.6 million lobbying the government in the first quarter of the year. The Sunlight Foundation, which tracks industry lobbying, reported that cable and phone companies had 276 former government officials lobbying for them in the first quarter, including 18 former members of Congress and 48 former staffers of current members of Congress on committees with jurisdiction over the Internet. The list includes former staffers of at least six of the House Democrats who signed the letter to the F.C.C. To us, it seems obvious that the Federal Communications Commission should extend its oversight to broadband, the most important telecommunications network of our time, to guarantee open, nondiscriminatory and competitive access and to protect consumers’ rights. But reason is not always a match for money in Washington. The F.C.C. has a rough road ahead.</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/21/business/media/21comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Local Broadcasters Are Fearful of an NBC-Comcast Deal<date>Published: June 20, 2010</date><text>Comcast, the nation’s biggest cable provider, has long played hardball with competitors and content providers. Now that it is seeking control of NBC Universal in a $30 billion transaction, those competitors are piping up, expressing fears that Comcast will use its consolidated power to favor its own content and squeeze out rivals.But one group has been noticeably silent: local television broadcasters. The owners of local stations are worried that if Comcast owned NBC, its market power would hurt competing stations and drive down the prices that those cable companies pay to retransmit local programs, potentially reshaping the local TV landscape. But the broadcasters have largely kept quiet about the concerns before the Monday deadline set by the Federal Communications Commission for public comments about the proposed sale. That is partly because they have been locked in negotiations with Comcast for months, trying to reach agreement on protections for competitors that both sides can live with. Most stakeholders expect regulators to approve the deal, with conditions attached, by early next year. A wide array of public officials has publicly supported the deal, citing economic benefits and programming opportunities for local communities. The deal would be the first time that a powerhouse in pay cable would own one of America’s few over-the-air networks. The combination comes at a particularly precarious time for broadcasters, when no less than the local station model itself is in doubt. Stations’ advertising revenues have fallen in lockstep with the economy, and alternatives like direct-to-cable distribution look more attractive than ever. Comcast, of course, owns those direct-to-cable pipes, giving the roughly 200 NBC affiliates reason to fear that Comcast could bypass them altogether and take NBC’s best-known shows straight to cable customers. Those affiliates have been wrapped up in talks with Comcast for months, and they are expected to support the sale — with important caveats — on Monday. “Never before have a network and a cable company — of course, the country’s biggest cable company — been co-owned,” said Brian Lawlor, the chairman of the NBC affiliate board, in explaining why “there was initially apprehension” when the deal was announced in 2009. Comcast has 23.5 million cable subscribers. Mr. Lawlor, who oversees the E. W. Scripps Company’s 10 TV stations, and other representatives met repeatedly in New York and once in Comcast’s hometown, Philadelphia, with Steve Burke, the Comcast chief operating officer and former ABC Broadcasting president. In an F.C.C. filing on Monday, the affiliates will indicate support for the merger if a few conditions are attached. Among them: that Comcast will not move sports events like National Football League games and the major Olympic events from (free) NBC onto (pay) cable; and that, in the event that negotiations with a local station break down, Comcast will not bypass the station and deliver a same-day feed of NBC via cable. Mr. Lawlor, whose company also owns ABC-affiliated stations, said he had “looked at this both ways” and, after the meetings with Comcast, is “walking away with a level of confidence in this.” The terms and the time frame for the conditions were unclear. In a statement on Friday, Comcast said, “We’ve committed since the deal was announced to preserve and strengthen the over-the-air business model in the challenging economic environment facing broadcasters.” Comcast has said that it intends to retain ownership of the stations that NBC owns, something that the affiliates support because “it’s keeping skin in our game,” Mr. Lawlor said. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, and Jeff Zucker, president and chief of NBC Universal, have assured lawmakers that the merger will benefit consumers. Other station owners are markedly less confident, although most decline to comment on the record. Jim Goodmon, the president of the Capitol Broadcasting Company, which controls the CBS affiliate WRAL and other stations in North Carolina, said in an interview on Friday that the proposed deal is “just beyond the pale.” “Would they really allow Comcast and NBC to merge? That’s controlling all the distribution. That’s controlling all the programming,” said Mr. Goodmon, a longtime opponent of media consolidation. “There isn’t any way that this could be in the public interest.” Echoing those concerns, the affiliates of ABC, CBS and Fox — who compete fiercely in local markets — teamed up in the winter to press regulators to attach conditions to the deal. In a letter to CBS affiliates in March, Tim Busch, an executive vice president at the Nexstar Broadcasting Group, conveyed concern that the merger would give Comcast reason to discriminate against non-NBC affiliates “in terms of Comcast’s cable carriage, retransmission consent negotiations, and advertising and promotion practices.” Corie Wright, a lawyer for Free Press, a nonprofit group that advocates for media reform and opposes the deal, said the non-NBC affiliates were also worried about the consolidated advertising power that Comcast would have in markets where it would own an NBC station as well as a cable franchise. “Comcast will become one-stop shopping for advertising in those markets,” she said, potentially hurting other broadcasters. Reached on Friday evening, Mr. Busch, said, “Things are still in discussions” with Comcast. He called the discussions productive and declined to comment further. It is not just broadcasters that are fretting. The satellite distributor Dish Network, in a letter to lawmakers in February, warned that the deal would give Comcast the incentive to speed up connections to its own services, like the online TV hub Fancast, while slowing down connections to competing services. Comcast has a history of “network management,” rooted in action it took in 2007 to slow down its customers’ access to some file-transferring applications. A Comcast spokeswoman said, “We treat all Web sites and services the same today, and have no plans to change that.” Concerns about unfair access persist among players like Bloomberg L.P., which is trying to turn its business channel into a serious competitor to the NBC-owned CNBC. Having expressed concern that Comcast would try to choke it, Bloomberg has demanded that Comcast treat its channel the same way as CNBC. Conditions are regularly imposed on big media deals like the AOL-Time Warner merger and the News Corporation’s purchase of a stake in DirecTV. Ms. Wright said, “This merger goes wider and deeper than any of those.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/comcast-spent-3-1-million-on-lobbying-in-q1/?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Spent $3.1 Million on Lobbying in 1st Quarter<date>June 3, 2010, 6:00 am</date><text>Comcast spent $3.1 million in the first quarter lobbying on its acquisition of a controlling stake in NBC Universal, among other issues, The Associated Press reported, citing a disclosure report. That’s up from the $2.76 million the nation’s largest cable TV company spent in the quarter a year ago but down from the fourth quarter’s $3.5 million. Comcast is seeking regulatory approval for its purchase of a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric. The deal, though opposed by consumer groups and subjected to Congressional hearings, is expected to close by year’s end because there’s little overlap of operations between Comcast and NBC. Comcast also lobbied Congress on cable ownership issues, carriage of independent programming, set-top boxes, sports programming, and others in the January to March period, according to the form filed on April 20 in the House clerk’s office.

That’s the suggestion of The New York Post, which reports that some Wall Street dealmakers are predicting that Sumner Redstone, who controls CBS, and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, may begin mulling whether to put their networks up for sale. The Post reports: Among bankers, CBS appears to be garnering the most attention amid signs Redstone these days isn’t dismissing out of hand the notion of selling CBS. “This is a good time to sell a network,” said one Wall Street exec. “Retransmission makes it look more interesting. [CBS] has assets in radio but no long-term strategy in cable.” Retransmission refers to fees for “retransmission consent,” in which cable and satellite operators pay a network a monthly per-subscriber fee to carry the channel on their systems…. Meanwhile, ABC’s future in the Mouse House is also not guaranteed, with Disney chief Bob Iger said to be taking a hard look at the network. “There are no guarantees,” Mr. Iger told The Post recently, referring to ABC’s future at Disney. The paper reported a source said that the issue was what would be done with the network’s accompanying stations.

Hollywood cleared a legal hurdle when the Federal Communications Commission gave its approval on May 7 of “selectable output control,” which can reach into a customer’s home video player and turn off its video outputs while a pay-per-view program is being watched, to prevent the program from being copied. The F.C.C. limited use of the remote power to those movies released to video-on-demand during their first three or four months in theaters, before the films go to DVD or other release formats. By the end of last week, however, no major film studio had yet disclosed a plan to take advantage of this new capability. When asked about the studios’ plans late last week, Bob Pisano, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said, “I can’t tell you that, because I don’t know.” To comply with antitrust law, he added, “we stay out of business-model decisions.” What might at first seem an arcane matter — precisely when to put a movie for sale on cable systems and at what price — has been the subject of ferocious debate in a film industry that so far has stopped just short of embracing the digital revolution. Cable operators, whose customers have become increasingly comfortable with systems that let them pay as they go for programming, stand ready to offer first-run films like “Sex in the City 2” or the forthcoming “Wall Street” sequel almost as quickly as studios are ready to offer them. The toughest challenge, Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, told an audience at a cable industry event here last week, will be that of “navigation in a 100,000-choice world.” Comcast is poised to take control of NBC Universal, if regulators approve a pending deal. It might then be in a position to break the ice by adding future Universal Pictures releases like “Battleship” or “Stretch Armstrong” to its on-demand universe — but only if it is ready to face down, or accommodate, theater owners who have been fiercely protective of the exclusive period during which they have customarily served up the major studio pictures. John Fithian, the president of the National Association of Theater Owners, did not respond to recent queries about the likely response of his member companies to any move by film studios to exploit the F.C.C. approval, which his organization strongly opposed. But one senior theater executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for his chain, said theater owners had made clear to film distributors that they simply would not book films that were simultaneously available in another medium. Well aware of the tension, spokesmen for 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, Warner Brothers, Walt Disney Studios and Universal — all members of the M.P.A.A. — declined last week to discuss their companies’ plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with peers, however, several executives said they expected to see one or more studios soon try to sell at least some films to an on-demand audience in advance of the DVD release. And one executive suggested it would happen as early as this year. Warner Brothers and Fox were described by these executives as being especially eager to find a new revenue stream via on-demand, though it was not clear that either company was prepared to go first. According to one executive, it appeared likely that any early experiment with on-demand film would be devised as a high-priced “premium” event, akin to an expensive pay-per-view fight night, possibly in a collaboration of some kind with theater owners, who might somehow share in revenue or get improved financial terms to make up for lost viewers. The deeper concern, as seen by theater executives, is that even a slight nudge toward additional home viewing might help to break frequent movie-goers of their habit — and jeopardize the $10 billion-a-year box office — just as they are being enticed by big 3-D events like “Avatar.” To date, on-demand screenings of new movies have been confined to the independent film world, where services like those operated by Rainbow Media have routinely sold access to festival-style films that would not otherwise have a large theatrical audience. The added technological protection offered by the output control authorized by the F.C.C. makes it easier for studios to capitalize on the enormous marketing expenditure behind a first-run film like the forthcoming “Salt,” with Angelina Jolie, or “Knight and Day,” with Tom Cruise, by easing it into homes alongside theaters. But that can happen only if theater owners allow it — and if home viewers overcome the suspicion, voiced by some, that antipiracy technology might impede their televisions and recorders once they have allowed a studio film in the door. On this last score, Mr. Pisano said the concerns reminded him of an old television series. “This is not going to come from ‘The Outer Limits,’ to take control of your television set,” he said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/technology/internet/03neutral.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Web’s Users Against Its Gatekeepers<date>Published: May 2, 2010</date><text>BERLIN — With the majority of Internet traffic expected to shift to congestion-prone mobile networks, there is growing debate on both sides of the Atlantic about whether operators of the networks should be allowed to treat Web users differently, based on the users’ consumption.Proponents of the current system — called network neutrality — see that principle as a kind of civil rights declaration of the digital age, one that requires the gatekeepers of the global Internet to treat all users equally, regardless of application, source or download limit. While operators have never been required to maintain neutrality, the industry has created that expectation largely by charging users a flat rate for unlimited Internet access. But there is a big flaw in the concept, according to the operators: Networks have never been neutral. They have always been actively managed to some extent since their inception in the 1980s to ensure that all customers get a basic “best effort” level of service. If an operator could not restrain bandwidth hogs, who typically make up 15 percent of customers but who generate 80 percent of the traffic, most Internet users would experience poor service. “The Internet has never been a neutral environment left to develop freely on a first-come, first-serve basis,” said Stuart Orr, the head of the telecommunications group in Europe, Africa and Latin America for Accenture, a U.S. software services consultant. The arcane issue of network management, and the free speech and competition issues it raises, has taken on broader political importance as operators have increasingly micromanaged the flow of data, favoring some users over others as they have sought to handle exploding levels of traffic or deliver premium broadband service at guaranteed speeds to heavy users and businesses. In the United States, users of the BitTorrent file-sharing service, a large generator of broadband traffic, last year challenged a cable operator, Comcast, that had blocked the service by identifying and disabling a common protocol used by BitTorrent users. The Federal Communications Commission ordered Comcast to stop the blocking. Comcast challenged the ruling. On April 6, an appeals court in Washington sided with the operator, saying the F.C.C. could not tell Comcast how to manage its network. In Brussels, the European commissioner for the digital agenda, Neelie Kroes, plans to hold a public consultation on net neutrality this summer, which could lead to a push for new laws or regulations for operators. Earlier this year, Ms. Kroes warned mobile operators not to block or hinder Internet voice services like Skype from their networks. Operators are worried that any rigid legal mandate that forced them to observe net neutrality standards would be unworkable and make the economics of high-speed wireless broadband less attractive, which could limit future investment and improvement to the networks. “We have no interest as an industry in policing individual surfing habits or acting as the gatekeeper for information,” said Frederic Gastaldo, the head of strategy and innovation at Swisscom. “Historically, our industry has resisted attempts to force operators to act as the personal gatekeepers of information. That would be a very negative marketing approach. However, customers who do excessively use our data network are a big challenge for us.” Congestion is more problematic for mobile than landline broadband operators because wireless broadband capacity is limited by the ability of individual base stations to process the Web activities of hundreds of users simultaneously. The more users per station, the less performance for each user. To avoid bottlenecks, operators use techniques like “traffic shaping,” which sorts traffic to ensure basic service for all, or “throttling,” which applies a general brake on large streams of data. Kabel Deutschland, the largest German cable TV operator, has one million broadband customers. Its coaxial and glass-fiber network is so far able to satisfy all customers without restrictions, said Georg Merdian, director of the company’s infrastructure regulation. But he said that the number of its broadband customers was doubling each year. “We anticipate we will soon have to use some kind of management techniques,” Mr. Merdian said. For most mobile operators, traffic management is a fact of life. Vodafone, one of the largest mobile operators in Europe and a part owner of Verizon Wireless, the No.1 wireless operator in America, routinely alerts its customers when they exceed the download limits of their service packages.Like all other operators, Vodafone uses sophisticated software that can pluck users or applications from the digital clamor. “We use a form of network management to say, ‘I’m sorry, you are not going to be able to get the same level of service unless you decide to top up,”’ said Richard Feasey, Vodafone’s public policy director in London. As data traffic levels rise, some executives, like César Alierta, the chairman and chief executive of the Spanish operator Telefónica, and Vittorio Colao, the Vodafone chief executive, have floated the idea of charging not only customers but also Web sites that generate lots of data traffic, like Google, Amazon and Facebook, for faster, guaranteed service. Web businesses, which depend on fast Internet paid for by individual customers, oppose the idea and have been pushing lawmakers in Brussels and Washington to adopt restrictions preventing operators from making deals with content providers. Prohibitions like that would make an operator’s business untenable, eventually reducing cable and phone networks to unprofitable, crowded data freeways, said Robert Mourik, the director of Telefónica’s regulatory policy in Europe. “We have an explosion of traffic, but our revenues have not been growing at the same pace or staying flat,” Mr. Mourik said. “We are not looking at content on the Internet. We are not trying to police the network. What we are looking to do are commercial deals.” Whether operators can successfully sell preferred Internet access to big Web businesses remains to be seen. Such a move would drastically alter the economics of the Internet, forcing content providers, in effect, to pay a toll, and perhaps a heavy toll, for access. Naturally, none of the big Web sites are interested in doing that. In February at an industry convention in Barcelona, Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google, was asked to comment on statements made by Mr. Colao of Vodafone, who had called for the right to clinch commercial deals with big Web businesses like Google. Mr. Schmidt, who during a speech that day had stressed Google’s role in helping network operators build their wireless broadband businesses by attracting consumers to the mobile Web, declined to comment, adding that Mr. Colao was a friend.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/business/29comcast.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast’s Revenue Rises 3.8% as Local Ads Start to Return<date>Published: April 28, 2010</date><text>Beating Wall Street expectations, Comcast, the nation’s largest cable company, reported strong revenue gains and a turnaround in local advertising on Wednesday.The company said that its revenue had increased 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2010, to $9.2 billion, from the same quarter last year. Analysts said they had expected revenue around $9.15 billion. Operating income increased 6.8 percent, to $1.9 billion. Broadband and telephone subscriber growth accounted for most of the gains, but the earnings also foreshadowed a broader uptick in the television advertising marketplace. Comcast said it gained 23 percent in cable advertising revenue, versus the same quarter last year. It was its the first quarterly ad growth in two years. “This is a nice reminder that what goes up can come back up,” said Craig Moffett, a senior analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, calling it an “awfully nice tailwind going into 2010.” Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, said in an earnings call that the ad turnaround appeared to have “a lot of breadth and depth to it.” The company’s executives repeatedly said they were cautiously optimistic. Separately, advertising revenue for E! and Comcast’s other cable channels rose 6 percent, in contrast to an 8 percent drop in the same quarter last year. Other media companies are expected to show evidence of an advertising rebound as they report earnings in the coming weeks. The vast majority of Comcast’s revenue come from its cable business, which showed 3.5 percent growth for the quarter. The company continued to lose video subscribers to competitors like DirecTV and Verizon, but it gained 590,000 customers between its video, Internet and telephone services. The company’s shares rose 35 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $18.81 at close of trading Wednesday on Nasdaq. The company’s free cash flow increased 38 percent over the same quarter last year, to $1.89 billion. Its earnings were 31 cents a share, compared with 27 cents in the same quarter last year. Last November, Comcast announced a deal to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal. That transaction is still under regulatory review. “We are well under way in the planning,” Mr. Roberts told analysts Wednesday. “Once the transaction closes, we believe we will be ready to execute.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9907E2D8173EF931A15757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=comcastcorporation">U.S.O.C.

''It just didn't make sense from this point, so we ended the contract,'' said Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the committee. The Sports Business Journal first reported the channel's dissolution. The U.S.O.C.'s announcement last year that it was proceeding with the channel prompted a rebuke from the International Olympic Committee, which said it had not granted the proposed network the rights it needed. The U.S.O.C. has not moved ahead on the project since August. ''We think this is part of the new leadership making a genuine effort to have a very meaningful relationship with the I.O.C.,'' said Richard Carrion, an executive board member of the I.O.C., referring to the hiring in January of Scott Blackmun as chief executive of the U.S.O.C. to replace Stephanie Streeter. Carrion said that Comcast's acquisition of majority control of NBC Universal ''probably played a part'' in the end of the U.S.O.C.'s network. NBC has carried every Olympics since 2000 and will carry the 2012 Summer Games. It is a partner in Universal Sports, which carries a lot of Olympic-oriented programming.

This decision has become a rip-the-Band-Aid-off moment for the regulatory agency, forcing it to reconsider its effort to impose ''network neutrality'' by requiring that Internet access providers treat all content equally. It also puts a substantial roadblock in the path of the commission's National Broadband Plan, which proposes to spend billions of dollars to help provide Internet access, rather than phone access, for people in rural areas. But the F.C.C. needn't change either strategy. It can regain its authority to pursue both network neutrality and widespread access to broadband by formally relabeling Internet access services as ''telecommunications services,'' rather than ''information services,'' as they are called now. All the commission needs to do is prove it has a good reason. It wouldn't be the first time that the F.C.C. relabeled Internet access services -- and certainly not the first time it addressed the need for equal access. Until August 2005, the commission required that companies providing high-speed access to the Internet over telephone lines not discriminate among Web sites. This allowed innumerable online businesses -- eBay, Google, Amazon, your local knitter -- to start up without asking permission from phone and cable companies. There was nothing unusual about this legal requirement; for more than 100 years, federal regulators had treated telegraph and telephone service providers as ''common carriers,'' obligated to serve everyone equally. But under the Bush administration the F.C.C. deregulated high-speed Internet providers, arguing that cable Internet access was different from the kind of high-speed Internet access provided by phone companies. Cable Internet access providers, the commission said, really offered an integrated bundle of services -- not just Internet connection but also e-mail, Web hosting, news groups and other services. So the F.C.C. declared that high-speed Internet access would no longer be considered a ''telecommunications service'' but rather an ''information service.'' This removed all high-speed Internet access services -- phone as well as cable -- from regulation under the common-carrier section of the Communications Act. This was a radical move, because it reversed the long-held assumption that a nondiscriminatory communications network was essential to economic growth, civic welfare and innovation. At the same time, the F.C.C. said that it would retain the power to regulate Internet access providers if the need arose, under another section of the Communications Act. The Bush F.C.C. hoped that deregulation would prompt greater competition in Internet access services. But a wave of mergers instead reduced it. Prices stayed high and speeds slow. And eventually the carriers started saying that they wanted to be gatekeepers -- creating fast lanes for some Web sites and applications and slow lanes for others. In its decision last week, the appeals court said that the ''information services'' label given to high-speed Internet access providers means the F.C.C. cannot prohibit companies like Comcast from engaging in discriminatory activities. But if the F.C.C.'s labeling of high-speed Internet access providers undermines its ability to tell them what to do, how can it ensure that consumers get the information they need about real speeds and prices? How can it ensure that basic communications services -- which, these days, means Internet access -- are widely available? The F.C.C. has the legal authority to change the label, as long as it can provide a good reason. And that reason is obvious: Americans buy an Internet access service based on its speed and price -- and not on whether an e-mail address is included as part of a bundle. The commission should state its case, relabel high-speed Internet access as a ''telecommunications service,'' and take back the power to protect American consumers.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/technology/07net.html?ref=comcastcorporation">U.S. Court Curbs F.C.C. Authority on Web Traffic<date>Published: April 6, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that regulators had limited power over Web traffic under current law. The decision will allow Internet service companies to block or slow specific sites and charge video sites like YouTube to deliver their content faster to users.The court decision was a setback to efforts by the Federal Communications Commission to require companies to give Web users equal access to all content, even if some of that content is clogging the network. The court ruling, which came after Comcast asserted that it had the right to slow its cable customers’ access to a file-sharing service called BitTorrent, could prompt efforts in Congress to change the law in order to give the F.C.C. explicit authority to regulate Internet service. That could prove difficult politically, however, since some conservative Republicans philosophically oppose giving the agency more power, on the grounds that Internet providers should be able to decide what services they offer and at what price. More broadly, the ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit could raise obstacles to the Obama administration’s effort to increase Americans’ access to high-speed Internet networks. For example, the national broadband plan released by the administration last month proposed to shift billions of dollars in money from a fund to provide phone service in rural areas to one that helps pay for Internet access in those areas. Legal observers said the court decision suggested that the F.C.C. did not have the authority to make that switch. The F.C.C. will now have to reconsider its strategy for mandating “net neutrality,” the principle that all Internet content should be treated equally by network providers. One option would be to reclassify broadband service as a sort of basic utility subject to strict regulation, like telephone service. Telephone companies and broadband providers have already indicated that they would vigorously oppose such a move. The appeals court’s 3-0 decision, which was written by one of the court’s more liberal members, Judge David S. Tatel, focused on the narrow issue of whether the F.C.C. had authority to regulate Comcast’s network management practices. But it was a clear victory for those who favor limiting the F.C.C.’s regulation of the Internet, said Phil Kerpen, a vice president at Americans for Prosperity, a group that advocates limited government. “The F.C.C. has no legal basis for imposing its dystopian regulatory vision under the net neutrality banner,” he said. As a practical matter, the court ruling will not have any immediate impact on Internet users, since Comcast and other large Internet providers are not currently restricting specific types of Web content and have no plans to do so. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable provider, had a muted reaction to its victory. The company said it was gratified by the court’s decision but added that it had changed the management policies that led it to restrict access to BitTorrent, a service used to exchange a range of large data files, from pirated movies to complex software programs. “Comcast remains committed to the F.C.C.’s existing open Internet principles, and we will continue to work constructively with this F.C.C. as it determines how best to increase broadband adoption and preserve an open and vibrant Internet,” Comcast said in a statement. The company is currently seeking federal approval for its proposed acquisition of a majority stake in NBC Universal, the parent of the NBC broadcast network and a cadre of popular cable channels. Some members of Congress and consumer groups have opposed the merger, saying that it would enable Comcast to favor its own cable channels and discriminate against those owned by competitors — something the company has said it does not intend to do. After the ruling on Tuesday, consumer advocates voiced similar concerns about Comcast’s potential power over the Internet, saying that the company could, for example, give priority to transmission of video services of NBC channels and restrict those owned by a competitor like CBS. “Internet users now have no cop on the beat,” said Ben Scott, policy director for Free Press, a nonprofit organization that supported the F.C.C. in the case. Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the F.C.C., had said previously that if the agency lost the Comcast case, he would seek to find other legal authority to implement consumer protections over Internet service. In a statement, the F.C.C. said it remained “firmly committed to promoting an open Internet.” While the court decision invalidated its current approach to that goal, the agency said, “the court in no way disagreed with the importance of providing a free and open Internet, nor did it close the door to other methods for achieving this important end.”</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/business/01DEALS.html?ref=comcastcorporation">The Pace of Deal-Making Picks Up<date>Published: March 31, 2010</date><text>CORPORATE buyers are intensifying their hunt for deals — and they’re becoming a bit bolder.More than two years past the start of the financial crisis, deal-making is continuing a steady ascent as companies seek to bolster their growth through mergers and acquisitions. And as their collective appetite grows, so too does their willingness to consider more aggressive international transactions or unsolicited bids. The last few months have brought a welter of multibillion-dollar deals, like Comcast’s purchase of a majority stake in NBC Universal, Kraft’s successful $19 billion takeover of Cadbury of Britain and the American International Group’s $51.4 billion sale of two major units. And a spate of unsolicited hostile offers has emerged, notably the Simon Property Group’s $10 billion bid for General Growth Properties, which had filed for bankruptcy. “The next two quarters will probably be defined as a very aggressive period of speed-dating, where companies will try out different combinations to see if they make strategic sense and are actionable,” said Paul G. Parker, head of global mergers and acquisitions for Barclays Capital. Worldwide deal volumes swelled to about $564 billion for the three months ended March 31, according to data from Thomson Reuters, 18.4 percent higher than the same time last year. That is a little over half the deal volume of the first quarter of 2007 (which was nearly the peak of mergers activity), but deal-makers say they do not expect to reach those levels for some time. “The economy’s far from ideal, but companies now have more confidence than they have had in the last 18 months,” said Victor I. Lewkow, a partner at the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton. The conditions that foster successful deal-making are continuing to improve. The stock markets have largely stabilized, with the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index rising almost 5 percent for the quarter, providing greater clarity into how much companies are worth and helping instill confidence in management teams about potential deals they may be considering. Just as important, robust stock and credit markets have continued to make financing available 4for buyers contemplating a takeover. Interest rates remain low, and many strategic companies are drawing upon hoards of cash they stockpiled over the past year. “The debt markets are wide open,” said Mark Shafir, Citigroup’s global head of mergers and acquisitions. “There’s a lot of capacity in the marketplace.” Whereas mergers activity last year was dominated primarily by health care and financial services companies, deal-makers say now they are spending time on a broad range of industries. “It’s across the board,” said Eduardo G. Mestre, vice chairman of Evercore Partners. “I have a very hard time saying that one sector is more active than another sector.” The economic recovery has also helped alter the dynamics of buyers and sellers. The average worldwide deal premium has fallen nearly 5 percentage points, to 27.5 percent, for the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, although it rose 25 percent for transactions in the United States. While buyers have gained more confidence in pursuing their targets, companies eyed as acquisitions have gotten a better sense of how much they are worth — and more are deciding that the best way to grow is to sell themselves. “Many companies have moved toward new 52-week highs,” said Chris Ventresca, a head of North America mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan Chase. “They still have uncertainty with regard to their business outlook and don’t see a catalyst for significant stock price appreciation. That provides some basis for sellers to think about traditional premiums over their current stock performance.” Still, other potential acquisitions say that they are better equipped to grow alone, leaving insistent suitors to ponder whether to try a hostile takeover. Beyond Simon, Air Products and Chemicals, Astellas Pharma, Carl C. Icahn and Elliott Management are among those that have chosen to make unfriendly bids. The improvement in the debt markets has also helped the private equity industry — largely relegated to the margins in 2009 — assert itself as an active presence once again. Leveraged buyout firms struck about $31.7 billion worth of deals during the first quarter of 2010, amounting to about 5.6 percent of all mergers activity worldwide. Private equity firms like the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts have spoken of their billions of dollars in “dry powder,” or committed investor capital, for some time. Now, with banks proving willing to lend and investors comfortable with riskier bond and loan offerings, such firms are expected to push for bigger deals again, though not as large as the immense leveraged buyouts of three years ago. Some are also finding buyers for some of their portfolio companies, like Apax Partners’ $3 billion sale of Tommy Hilfiger to Phillips-Van Heusen and Oak Hill Capital Partners’ $1.1 billion sale of Duane Reade to Walgreen. These sales help the buyout firms generate profit and clear room for future acquisitions. “Private equity firms spent most of last year helping their portfolio companies,” said Randi C. Lesnick, a partner at the law firm Jones Day. “What we’ve been seeing and hearing is an uptick in their interest in new deals.” Deals have also taken on a more international character: Cross-border transactions added up to about 36.6 percent of all mergers for the first quarter, nearly doubling last year’s number. Deal-makers point to a wide array of mergers, like the Kraft-Cadbury deal and the takeover of A.I.G.’s Asian life insurance arm by Prudential of Britain. Emerging markets like China and Brazil have proved a font of deal activity: they accounted for $181.7 billion of deals this quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, or 32.2 percent of worldwide volume. Their expanding presence in mergers and acquisitions has manifested itself both directly, as in Geely of China’s agreement to pay $1.8 billion for Volvo, and indirectly, as in Prudential’s effort to expand its Asian presence through its A.I.G. deal and Kraft’s desire for Cadbury’s footprint in India, Russia and other countries. (A few deals, including Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machines’ $150 million offer for Hummer, fell apart, reportedly because of regulatory troubles.) Deal-makers say that as China and other developing countries continue to seek natural resources and to put their swelling coffers to good use, they will be seeking even bigger pieces of the mergers pie. “They are emerged markets,” said Antonio Weiss, Lazard’s global head of investment banking. “It’s become old-fashioned to think of these regions as emerging.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4D61F3AF930A25750C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=comcastcorporation">Appeals Court Upholds Access Rules for Cable TV<date>Published: March 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- A United States appeals court on Friday upheld a Federal Communications Commission rule that forbids cable companies that also own programming channels from refusing to allow competitors to also offer those channels. The ruling, which consumer advocates hailed as a victory, strengthens the F.C.C.'s hand in trying to gain some leverage over the cable industry, which was largely deregulated in 1996 and has fought subsequent attempts by the commission to impose new regulations. The decision could also play a role in the pending acquisition by Comcast of a majority stake in NBC Universal. In a 2-1 ruling, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that while competition had increased in the cable business, the F.C.C. was still within its rights to extend a prohibition against exclusive contracts between a cable operator and its affiliated channels because it would limit competition. That means that satellite television providers, like DirecTV and Dish Network, and companies like Verizon and AT&amp;T that also provide television programming, must be allowed to offer potential customers a regional sports channel, for example, that is owned by the local cable operator. In creating the rule, the F.C.C. cited its own economic analysis, which found that local cable companies could gain a significant competitive advantage over satellite providers and other competitors if allowed to withhold channels. Cablevision and Comcast, which had challenged the rule, expressed disappointment at the decision. Other court decisions on the commission's rule-making authority are likely to come later this year, including in a case over whether Internet service providers can discriminate against certain Web sites in allowing access to their networks, an issue known as Net neutrality. Cablevision said that the F.C.C.'s exclusivity rule and the retransmission consent provisions, which were the source of a dispute last weekend between the company and ABC, were ''outdated and obsolete.'' ''In today's highly competitive video marketplace, these rules do nothing but tilt the playing field in favor of phone companies and broadcasters to the detriment of fair competition and consumers,'' the company said in a statement. Comcast, which has been fighting F.C.C. rules at the same time that it is seeking its approval for its NBC merger, said DirecTV had its own exclusive content arrangements, including the sole right to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. But that deal does not fall under the F.C.C. exclusivity rule because the owner of the network is an independent company, the National Football League, and not a regulated cable operator. At a Senate hearing on Thursday into the Comcast-NBC deal, Comcast grudgingly pledged to follow the rules, saying it was ''prepared to discuss with the F.C.C.'' having the disputed rules apply to it ''if appropriate.'' DirecTV called the court's decision ''a victory for consumers'' and applauded the court's acknowledgment that the cable operators ''have the incentive and ability to withhold programming from competitors.'' The F.C.C. and various consumer groups also said pay-television subscribers would benefit. ''The commission's program access rules have played a vital role in making diverse and attractive video programming available to cable and satellite TV viewers,'' Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said in a statement. Corie Wright, policy counsel for Free Press, a nonprofit group that has generally opposed media consolidation, including the Comcast-NBC merger, pointed out that the F.C.C. rule upheld on Friday was scheduled to expire in two years. It was adopted in 1992 and has been extended twice. ''If the merger is approved,'' Ms. Wright said, ''Comcast will control an extensive suite of popular channels, including MSNBC, USA and Bravo. Its ability to withhold that programming from competing video services would give it enormous market power and leverage,'' a factor she cited in urging the commission to extend the exclusivity rule again in 2012.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/03/12/the-n-b-c-sale-the-30-rock-version/?ref=comcastcorporation">The NBC Sale (the '30 Rock' Version)<date>March 12, 2010, 9:40 am</date><text>A little over three months since Comcast agreed to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal from General Electric, the deal finally got the “30 Rock” treatment it was bound to get. The sitcom that gleefully skewers its corporate parent took on the sale of NBC in a slightly fictionalized form. In the world of Liz Lemon and Jack Donaghy, the network was indeed sold by its current owner, the Sheinhardt Wig Company, to a Philadelphia-based cable company. Only here, it’s known as Kabletown (which Jack, played by Alec Baldwin, ruefully notes is spelled with a “K”.) Thursday’s “30 Rock” episode centered in part on Jack’s angst at being cut out of the deal loop. After the jump, watch a clip, featuring legendary former G.E. chief executive Jack Welch. The NBC deal definitely involved a fair amount of drama, including back-room dealings between top executives of G.E. and Comcast. But it’s safe to say that the “30 Rock” version is a bit more, as NBC’s current promos say, colorful. For starters, the real-life negotiations didn’t involve an isolated G.E. executive spinning the merits of a non-deal to his golden-tressed CNBC anchor girlfriend (who was more in the loop than he was). Neither did the talks involve stuffing a dead high-level executive in a freezer — at least, that we know of.

Democratic lawmakers in House and Senate subcommittees pledged a vigorous review of the deal without objecting to it outright. Some of the toughest questioning came from Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, who worked on NBC for years on ''Saturday Night Live.'' ''It matters who runs our media companies,'' Mr. Franken said. ''The media are our source of entertainment, but they're also the way we get our information about the world. So when the same company produces the programs and runs the pipes that bring us those programs, we have a reason to be nervous.'' Specifically, media watchdogs and competing video distributors are nervous that the combination of the two companies would restrict programming choice and result in higher prices for cable TV. They are also concerned about the effects the pairing would have on the budding market for video delivered via the Internet. Mark Cooper, the research director for the Consumer Federation of America, said in testimony that the deal's approval would ''increase the likelihood that the ugly business model of the cable cartel will be strengthened and extended to the Internet.'' At the hearings, the Comcast chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, sought to reassure competitors that his cable operator, the country's largest, would ''compete fairly in the marketplace.'' Comcast has made several public interest commitments and has said that the NBC broadcast network would remain free to over-the-air viewers. Jeffrey Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said Comcast's commitments ''give me greater comfort in thinking about the future of broadcasting.'' Comcast is seeking to acquire a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal; General Electric will hold the remaining 49 percent. NBC Universal owns the NBC broadcast network, local NBC stations in 10 major markets, cable channels like CNBC and Bravo and the Universal Pictures studio. Comcast said that the mostly vertical integration of the two companies would cause no major layoffs or closings of facilities. ''That is why some on Wall Street may not love this deal, but this same lack of overlap is why Washington can -- because we will grow these great American businesses over the long term and make them more successful, not cut them,'' Mr. Roberts said. Republican lawmakers largely called for swift approval of the deal, while many Democrats said that conditions should be attached to it. The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are each reviewing the deal in a process that could take a year.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDC173FF937A35751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=comcastcorporation">Comcast Profit Rises Sharply On Web and Phone Revenue<date>Published: February 4, 2010</date><text>The Comcast Corporation reported sharply higher fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, propelled by gains in Internet and phone revenue, and also announced a new brand for its core cable operations as it transforms into a media conglomerate. On the eve of Congressional hearings on its proposed purchase of a controlling stake in NBC Universal, Comcast said it would change the name of its cable TV, Internet and phone services to XFinity. The new brand will be introduced in 11 markets on Feb. 12 and then be expanded nationally. Comcast will remain the name of the parent company. ''We are beginning to reposition the company with the consumer, demonstrating how the technical and product investments we have made can redefine how customers experience video, voice and the Internet,'' the chief executive, Brian L. Roberts said in a call with analysts. Comcast, which has been planning for the brand change for some time, is hoping the new name will sharpen its image as an innovator as it introduces more high-definition channels, faster Internet speeds and other improvements. Mr. Roberts said the company had started to integrate NBC Universal into its business. Although the deal to buy a 51 percent stake from General Electric faces opposition from consumer groups and competitors, federal regulators are likely to approve it with conditions. In the fourth quarter, Comcast also solidified its position as the nation's largest wired broadband provider, topping AT&amp;T for a second consecutive quarter with 15.9 million high-speed Internet subscribers. Comcast earned $955 million, or 33 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $412 million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company took a $600 million charge to write down an investment. Excluding a one-time tax gain in the recent quarter, Comcast earned 29 cents a share, topping the 27 cents expected by analysts. Revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $9.07 billion, slightly ahead of the $8.96 billion estimated by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Comcast added 290,000 subscribers in its core businesses of cable TV, Internet and phone in the quarter. But the total masked weakness in cable video services, as that was offset by increases in Internet and phone subscriptions. Comcast shares fell 32 cents, or about 2 percent, to close at $15.97.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/to-get-nbc-comcast-still-has-persuading-to-do/?ref=comcastcorporation">To Get NBC, Comcast Still Has Persuading to Do<date>January 25, 2010, 6:51 am</date><text>Before Comcast can transform the entertainment business by taking control of NBC Universal, it must convince Washington that the plan won’t hurt rivals and consumers. And the promises the cable company has made so far don’t impress opponents who want federal regulators to attach strict conditions to the deal, The Associated Press writes. To show that it would not abuse its control over NBC‘s broadcast networks, cable TV channels and movie studios, the nation’s largest cable provider is making nine pledges, including a vow not to move the NBC broadcast network to cable and a commitment to expand public interest programming. But consumer groups and competitors say Comcast is offering token concessions that don’t address their biggest fears about the NBC combination. ”Comcast is either promising to do what it was already planning to do or simply what it is required to do by law,” said Corie Wright, policy counsel at the public interest group Free Press. ”I don’t think Comcast can just tie a bow around the status quo and call it a public interest commitment.” Comcast is quick to defend its position. ”We think we have made significant and meaningful commitments that are designed to ensure the deal is pro-consumer,” said David Cohen, Comcast’s executive vice president . Now it is up to Washington to decide. The Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission are examining Comcast’s plans to buy a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal from General Electric for $13.75 billion. Those reviews could last up to a year. Congressional hearings are also scheduled for February. The government will scrutinize the implications of allowing a company with nearly 24 million cable customers and nearly 16 million broadband subscribers to take control of so much popular programming. Comcast already owns cable channels, including E! Entertainment and the Golf Channel. It also has a controlling interest in the Philadelphia 76ers and Flyers, and its SportsNet Philadelphia channel carries Flyers, Phillies and Sixers games. NBC Universal would give it the NBC and Telemundo broadcast networks; 26 local TV stations; popular cable channels such as CNBC, Bravo and Oxygen; the Universal Pictures movie studio and theme parks; and a stake in Hulu, which distributes TV programming online. This week, Comcast and NBC will file paperwork with the Justice Department to comply with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, an antitrust law governing mergers and alliances. It will also file a public interest statement with the F.C.C., which must approve the transfer of NBC’s broadcast licenses. Those filings will provide more detail on Comcast’s public interest commitments. Already, though, two key elements are clear: Comcast promises to keep providing free, over-the-air broadcasts of the NBC and Telemundo networks, and it pledges to extend the F.C.C.’s ”program access rules” to the local NBC and Telemundo stations it would acquire. The program access rules are designed to ensure that satellite TV and other rival video services can carry channels owned by cable companies. The rules require cable companies to make their channels available to rivals on equal terms. Comcast says the program access rules do not automatically apply to local NBC and Telemundo broadcast programming and insists that its offer to extend the rules is therefore significant. However, other F.C.C. rules already prohibit broadcast stations from reaching exclusive distribution agreements and require them to negotiate in good faith. And either way, competitors fear Comcast will still ratchet up prices for — or even withhold — must-have national and local programming, including NBC broadcasts and regional sports, said Matt Polka, head of the American Cable Association, which represents smaller cable companies. For one thing, Comcast’s rivals note, even as Comcast is pledging to expand the program access rules, it is seeking to overturn those same rules in court. What’s more, many rivals believe the program access rules are not very meaningful anyway. Bringing a complaint to the F.C.C. is slow and costly and the commission doesn’t enforce the rules aggressively, they say. What Mr. Polka wants — and what Comcast so far has not offered — is a commitment to submit to arbitration in disputes and a pledge not to pull a broadcast signal during negotiations. Mr. Polka also wants Comcast to promise not to require rival cable and satellite TV services to carry niche channels in order to get access to must-have programming. ”Comcast’s pledges don’t address the harms that will result from this unprecedented consolidation of distribution and content,” said Susan Eid, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for DirecTV. People who run small, independent cable channels fear that Comcast could stop carrying channels that compete with its own, or relegate rival channels to premium tiers with fewer subscribers. Comcast is promising to add new two new ”independently owned and operated” channels to its digital lineup each year for three years. But that’s not enough for Charles Herring, president of WealthTV, an independent channel focused on lifestyle and entertainment programming. Two channels a year on a network that carries hundreds is ”inadequate and insulting,” Herring says. Comcast also has not defined what it means by ”independent” channels. Mr. Herring fears the company could count programming owned by other big media companies. WealthTV has filed a complaint with the F.C.C. accusing Comcast of discrimination for refusing to carry its programming even as it carries a similar channel partially owned by the cable giant. An administrative law judge at the F.C.C. has rejected WealthTV’s claims and WealthTV is appealing that decision to the full commission. Comcast’s concessions don’t address other key fears about the deal, said Rebecca Arbogast, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Those include worries that the company will have too much power in local markets where it would own both the NBC affiliate and the dominant cable system, and concerns that Comcast would begin charging for its media content online. Public interest groups also complain that Comcast has offered few details on some of its other pledges, including promises to preserve local news and public affairs shows and to make programming for children and Hispanics more widely available. This week’s filings could fill in some of the blanks. Meanwhile, Paul Gallant an analyst at Concept Capital, said it was unfair to simply dismiss all of Comcast’s pledges as meaningless. The company’s promise not to abandon over-the-air television is particularly important to NBC affiliate stations, Mr. Gallant noted, given that broadcast advertising is eroding as audiences spend more time with cable TV and the Internet. Broadcasters have begun to study alternative business models, including an end to the traditional network-affiliate structure and possibly relying solely on cable and satellite for distribution. ”To have a major cable operator have a stake in the success of broadcasting and say it is committed to playing a constructive role in negotiations between broadcasters and cable operators is very significant,” said Rick Cotton, executive vice president and general counsel of NBC Universal. Now it will be up to federal regulators to decide whether Comcast’s promises go far enough. If Washington isn’t satisfied, Comcast may have to come back with another offer.

The conglomerate’s $3 billion in earnings, off $41.1 billion in revenue, amounted to 28 cents a share, beating the consensus forecast of 26 cents a share according to Bloomberg News. G.E.’s chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, sought to paint an optimistic picture for GE Capital’s future — an admittedly tough feat, since the division’s $300 million net profit still represented a 76 percent drop from the same time last year. (Its $71 million profit from continuing operations fell 88 percent.) Mr. Immelt noted that GE Capital had raised $4.4 billion toward its long-term financing plan. GE Capital has also bolstered its reserves by $700 million, to $8.1 billion, to help guard against the losses at the unit that have cost its parent dearly since the financial crisis. “Capital Finance is executing well in a difficult environment,” Mr. Immelt said in a statement. “Every segment at GE Capital was profitable with the exception of commercial real estate, which continues to operate in a difficult environment.” Meanwhile, NBC Universal — which G.E. has agreed to sell a majority stake in to Comcast — suffered a 30 percent drop in profits. As the news reports about the kerfuffle over “The Tonight Show” have illustrated, NBC remains a big hole in the business’ bottom line, with the 2010 Winter Olympics broadcast running up a $200 million loss.

With iconic programming, enviable ratings and spectacular business success, the peacock network delivered plenty of laughs along the way with ''The Cosby Show,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''Friends.'' Nobody is laughing anymore. Today the network is in shambles, brought down not just by the challenges facing broadcast television -- fragmenting audiences, an advertising downturn -- but also by a series of executive missteps that have made its prime-time lineup a perennial loser and, most recently, turned its late night programming schedule into a media circus that threatens the lucrative ''Tonight Show'' franchise. ''We live in a society today that loves a soap opera,'' Jeff Zucker, the chief executive of NBC Universal, said in an interview in his office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York on Friday. ''Three months ago it was David Letterman. Six weeks ago it was Tiger Woods's problems. Today it's NBC's problems.'' And this is all happening as the company itself is in transition, waiting for regulators in Washington to approve a sale of NBC Universal from General Electric to Comcast, the nation's largest cable operator. By the time G.E. finally decided to wash its hands of NBC late last year, the network ranked low on the list of those parts of the company most valuable to Comcast, which will swallow the network mainly so it can acquire the company's money-making cable channels, like USA, Bravo, Syfy. Indeed, even though NBC's news division remains highly profitable, the network's overall finances are crumbling -- less than a decade ago, according to Bob Wright, the former chief executive of NBC Universal, the network generated over $1 billion in profit for its parent, G.E. This year, mainly because of high costs associated with broadcasting next month's Winter Olympics, the network is expected to lose more than $100 million, according to a person briefed on the network's finances who insisted on anonymity. The company does not break out financial figures for the network. (In 2009, the network made a few hundred million dollars, and represented about 10 percent of NBC Universal's operating profit.) All of the networks are dealing with economic pressures, but NBC's competitors have proved more deft at managing the challenges and creating hits, even as their profits have declined. How did things go so wrong at NBC? The network's long fall from grace, particularly in prime time, culminated over the last decade. But most recently it has been visible in the public squabble over moving Jay Leno's talk show out of the 10 p.m. weeknight slot, where he has foundered in the ratings, and back to 11:35 p.m. The move will effectively end Conan O'Brien's seven-month stint as host of ''The Tonight Show,'' as he is refusing to go along with a move to 12:05 a.m. The controversy kicked off days of public recriminations, with just about every comic with a talk show taking swipes at NBC, Mr. Leno, Mr. Zucker and everything else on the menu. ''Now they have a situation that -- I've never seen anything like it,'' said Fred Silverman, the only person who has overseen programming at three networks -- NBC, CBS and ABC. ''The hosts are sniping at NBC, and at Zucker, and they both are mad at each other. It's a corporate embarrassment.'' He called the idea of moving Mr. Leno back to 11:35 p.m. a ''Mickey Mouse scheme.'' (Mr. Silverman agreed with the original idea of moving Mr. Leno to 10 p.m.) A Bet Backfires At NBC, it has been an unseemly spectacle for a company that prides itself on a smooth corporate culture, and the disastrous culmination of a high-stakes gamble last year by Mr. Zucker to move Mr. Leno to the 10 p.m. slot, passing ''The Tonight Show'' to the younger Mr. O'Brien and saving money that the network would have spent on scripted dramas at 10 p.m. But the ratings sank, and affiliates that relied on 10 p.m. to lead in to the late local news rebelled. And Mr. O'Brien's ''Tonight Show'' did poorly in his time slot, losing resoundingly to ''Late Show With David Letterman'' on CBS for the first time in 15 years. ''At the end of the day Jay at 10 o'clock didn't work,'' Mr. Zucker said, ''and I take responsibility for that.''</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/sports/tennis/07tennis.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Tennis Channel Takes Its Feud With Comcast to the F.C.C.<date>Published: January 6, 2010</date><text>The Tennis Channel filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission late Tuesday accusing the cable giant Comcast of keeping it on a digital sports tier while making the Golf Channel and Versus, channels that Comcast owns, more widely available. Skip to next paragraph Men Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders Women Scoreboard Results/Schedule Money Leaders In its filing, the Tennis Channel said that Comcast’s “discriminatory refusal” to treat it fairly “is harming the network’s ability to compete in the cable marketplace.” Comcast said in a statement that its 2005 contract with the Tennis Channel allows it to carry the network “on many different tiers, including the Sports Entertainment Package, where we currently offer it to our customers.” Comcast said it was “fully honoring the terms of our agreement” with the Tennis Channel, and called the complaint groundless. The sports tier also includes the CBS College Sports Network, Fox College Sports and the NFL Red Zone. The Tennis Channel’s complaint is similar to one filed with the F.C.C. by the NFL Network against Comcast in 2008 after the cable operator dropped it from a broadly distributed level to its sports tier. The case was dropped when the league and Comcast came to an agreement that made the network more widely available. Distribution on Comcast, which has about 24 million customers, is crucial for networks eager to maximize their revenue from monthly subscriber fees. The sports tier is bought by about 2.3 million Comcast customers who pay $5 to $8 a month while Golf and Versus, older networks, are distributed to virtually all of Comcast’s subscribers. The Tennis Channel wants to expand well past its full-time universe of 25 million subscribers, but does so substantially only during the Grand Slam tournaments. For the French and the United States Opens, special previews make the network available to more than 50 million people. For Wimbledon and the Australian Open, it is available to about 30 million. The complaint says that Comcast refused to broaden the Tennis Channel’s availability during negotiations last year despite having added coverage of all four Grand Slam tournaments and creating a high-definition channel since the original contract with Comcast was signed. In trying to prove its case of “differential treatment,” the network cited a statement by Stephen B. Burke, Comcast’s president, saying that Comcast views its own networks like “siblings” but networks it does not own as “strangers.” Last summer, a feud over the Tennis Channel’s distribution on Cablevision prevented the network from being seen by the cable operator’s customers during the United States Open. Cablevision won the acrimonious battle and carries the channel on its digital sports tier.

The deal, announced late last year, will also be reviewed by the Federal Communications Commission, The Associated Press reports. Even though federal regulators are expected to approve the combination, many industry analysts expect them to attach significant conditions to ensure that rivals in the subscription television market can still get access to popular programming owned by the merged company. Regulators are also likely to attach obligations to prevent Comcast from dropping smaller, independent channels from its lineup. Comcast is seeking to acquire a controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric.

Skip to next paragraph Related Broadcasters Battling for Cable Fees (December 29, 2009) Time Warner and Fox Reach a Cable Deal (January 2, 2010) Add to Portfolio Time Warner Cable Inc News Corporation Comcast Corp Go to your Portfolio » On New Year’s Day, the News Corporation, the media empire controlled by Rupert Murdoch, wrangled new payments from Time Warner Cable, including subscriber fees for the Fox Broadcasting network, which is free for viewers with over-the-air antennas. The high-stakes deal reflected the scramble by media companies to reduce their dependence on advertising. Something else also happened that day: Time Warner Cable put another rate increase into effect. It will not be the last time. Along with Fox, other broadcasters say they deserve a share of the cable and satellite bills that roughly 100 million American households pay each month. At the same time, the cable-only channels that have lured viewers away from broadcast, with shows like “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “The Closer,” are lining up for further fee increases. Viewers usually do not notice until the price goes up, but their pay TV bills are a battleground for media companies. “Content providers are testing the limits  hoping to raise the bar as high as possible,” said Steve Ridge, the president of the media strategy group for the consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates. These battles are playing out just as the television industry is coping with the wrenching changes brought on by new competition from the Internet. Broadcasters have long envied the fact that their cable channel competitors are paid two ways, through advertising and subscriber fees. So now, the television networks are fighting for every penny they can. Several years ago, CBS started asking for fees, and the News Corporation followed in negotiations last month, demanding a dollar for each subscriber every month from Time Warner Cable. The average digital cable customer already pays nearly $75 a month, the research firm Centris found last year. The companies will not reveal what compromise they reached, but that figure will most likely become a benchmark for future deals. Disney is expected to ask for sizable fees for its ABC stations in negotiations this year. In a twist, Comcast, the country’s largest cable provider, will soon own NBC Universal, if its acquisition is approved by the government, putting it in a position to pay out as well as collect fees for NBC. Cable and satellite distributors are resisting the demands, but a “power shift,” as Mr. Ridge put it, is under way as broadband Internet becomes pervasive, putting a seemingly infinite variety of choices in front of consumers. Of course, broadband is not free, either, and it is often provided by the same companies that distribute television programming. The News Corporation fight was unusual because it played out in public, with Time Warner Cable arguing that it wanted to hold the line on further fee increases. That looks impossible, however, as newly powerful cable channels seek to cash in. They argue that they deserve more money for having invested millions in their original programming. Cable executives say privately that the demands, and resulting fights, are increasing in frequency. And every time they clash, there is a chance that viewers will miss out. The sports network Versus, owned by Comcast, has been off of DirecTV’s satellite service for three months in a fee battle. More prominently, the Food Network and HGTV disappeared from Cablevision’s lineups in New York and New Jersey on Friday after talks broke down with the owner of the channels, Scripps Networks. The Food Network costs distributors 8 cents a viewer on average now; Scripps wants a roughly 300 percent raise, according to people briefed on the negotiations. That might seem drastic, but 30 other channels, some with lower ratings, already earn that much. “We were really, really undervalued,” said Brooke Johnson, the president of the Food Network. For ardent fans of “Iron Chef America,” the Food Network is undoubtedly worth 25 cents a month. But that logic, applied to dozens of channels, can become pretty expensive for viewers. For example, the owners of Oprah Winfrey’s cable channel, set to begin one year from now, are hoping that her star power will be worth 50 cents for each subscriber a month. The channel it is replacing, Discovery Health, gets only 12 cents now. Consumers already pay dimes or quarters for most cable channels each month, whether they watch them or not. ESPN earns the most by far, $4.10 on average, and is forecast to receive more than $5 a month by 2012, according to the research firm SNL Kagan. Fox Sports Network gets $2.37 on average. The next-highest paid channel, TNT, gets 96 cents. The Disney Channel, NFL Network, Fox News, USA and ESPN2 each get more than 50 cents. For every channel, the price per month is expected to rise each year. “We hear from consumers that they are paying too much and getting too little for it. And there seems to be no end to the rate hikes in sight,” Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, said. Even as consumers recover from the recession, there is little evidence that people are canceling cable en masse, although some know that calling up their local provider and threatening to cancel can quickly earn them a big discount. Time Warner Cable is not alone in raising rates; higher prices go into effect for DirecTV and AT&amp;T’s customers next month. In Washington, where proposals for “à la carte” cable pricing were popular in recent years, some lawmakers and regulators now look to the Web as a more attractive, market-driven solution. Viewers will increasingly be able to bypass pay TV service and watch whatever they like online. Distributors are trying to put a system into effect that will offer some TV shows online to existing subscribers only. Time Warner Cable asserts that the power ultimately rests with the consumer. “They’re the ones who are going to resist these price increases that the programmers are trying to push,” said Alex Dudley, a spokesman for the company. “One need look no further than the music industry for an example of what happens when consumers feel taken advantage of by an entire industry.” Lest anyone doubt that Americans, who watch an average of five hours of television a day, cannot part with their sets, look no further than Orange County, Fla., where two football fans sought an emergency injunction to avert a Fox blackout of their alma mater’s bowl game on Friday as the dispute with Time Warner Cable persisted. No one, not even Mr. Murdoch, was going to interrupt their viewing of the Sugar Bowl. The fans lost the case but won their Fox, as the two companies committed to a new contract about 45 minutes before kickoff. Soon enough, though, those fans will be paying for it.

Later that year, Vivendi of France acquired Universal Studios in another gargantuan deal. Both of these fusions were fueled by visions of convergence — the idea that digital technology would break down differences in the way media content was delivered, bringing huge benefits to companies that owned content as well as the means to distribute it. Things didn’t quite go according to plan. Last month brought a coda for both of these disastrous deals: Time Warner spun off AOL as a separate company while Vivendi shed its remaining stake in NBC Universal, created by its collaboration with General Electric. NBC Universal is heading into a new combination with Comcast. For consumers, convergence has been at the least confusing. At the start of the past decade, they could confidently leave their homes with just their wallets, keys and mobile phones; now they often feel the need to clutter their briefcases with iPods, iPhones, BlackBerrys, netbooks, e-book readers and other gadgets, too. That seems more like fragmentation. Yet at the turn of another decade, there are signs of a possible new dawn for the idea of convergence. Many of the television sets bought during the holiday season, for instance, have Internet capabilities, and experiments in blending TV and the Web are moving ahead. Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, having managed to offload AOL, is pushing a vision of “TV Everywhere” in which pay-television subscribers would be able to watch shows on their computers or other screens as well. In Britain, the BBC and commercial broadcasters plan to introduce a new way of beaming television over the Internet by the end of the year, giving viewers greater choice over what and when they watch. In millions of living rooms, television viewers already use their video-game consoles as impromptu set-top boxes to receive pay-TV signals. The next frontier may be the convergence of mobile phones and other hand-held devices with televisions and computers. Yes, Apple’s iPhone and App Store are nifty, but for now, most people still see their phones primarily as communications tools. Other mobile devices hold promise. Last week the online retailer Amazon, which also sells the Kindle e-reader, said that on Christmas Day, for the first time, it sold more digital books than the ink-on-paper kind. But there will be no mobile mass medium until business models get more sophisticated. Advertising, seen as a way to finance the delivery of books, video, news and other content, remains meager despite years of boosterism about its potential. But this could change now that Google, the biggest player in the online economy, is taking a greater interest. In November, the company acquired AdMob, a specialist in mobile advertising. Google is preparing another bet on convergence, a digital book store that will make e-books available to computers, smartphones and other devices. While the idea of convergence clearly has outlived some of the mergers that were supposed to facilitate it, many media companies are still rooted in a preconvergence, predigital era, keeping tight control over the distribution of their content via separate technologies and through geographical separations. European publishers, for instance, have largely refused to allow Amazon to sell their books in digital formats because of disagreements over the terms. Movie buffs, meanwhile, still generally have to wait months to get their hands on a DVD or video-on-demand version of a new release. Restrictions like these stimulate piracy, because there are few geographic or time restrictions on illegal downloads. Piracy, in turn, has served as a catalyst for convergence, because it has pressured media owners to look for new solutions. A decade ago, some media owners, driven by hubris, thought combining content and distribution under one corporate roof was enough. Over the next decade, convergence may have to be driven more by what consumers want.

Over the next decade, convergence may have to be driven more by what consumers want.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/business/17views.html?ref=comcastcorporation">A Shrewd Deal for Comcast<date>Published: December 16, 2009</date><text>The Comcast boss, Brian Roberts, said buying control of NBC Universal, General Electric’s media business, made him and his cable group “strategically complete.” This was code to his shareholders, who have worried about him building a media empire ever since he tried to buy Walt Disney, that he’s done shopping. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Kim White/Reuters Comcast's chief, Brian Roberts, appears to have covered his bases on NBC. Add to Portfolio Comcast Corp Go to your Portfolio » But to fully complete the deal, Comcast needs to buy the 49 percent of NBC that is still in G.E.’s hands. And if NBC’s core cable businesses continue growing, the conglomerate’s remaining stake could be worth some $20 billion by the time Mr. Roberts can buy it. That’s a big chunk of change for Comcast shareholders. But here’s where Comcast’s financial engineers may deserve applause. The deal looks to have been structured in a way that should, if Comcast is willing to be patient and NBC performs, pay for itself. First, it’s worth trying to put a future value on G.E.’s stake. The deal with Comcast pegged G.E.’s interest as worth $13.8 billion today. Under the terms of the agreement, G.E. can compel Comcast to buy out half of its remaining interest three and a half years after closing, which should take place in a year. If G.E. exercises that right, Comcast can oblige G.E. to sell it the whole stake. Assume that’s what will happen. Meanwhile, assume that NBC’s operating cash flow will grow at 12.5 percent annually to $4.5 billion in mid-2014  it has grown faster in recent years. Now, say rivals like Disney trade at 10 times operating cash flow by that time. That implies a fair market value of $45 billion for NBC. Then Comcast has to pay a 20 percent premium to that, but, in a private-equity-like profit share, also gets to knock off half the gains since the original deal, which valued NBC at $28.2 billion. Do the math and allow for cash flow paying down some of NBC’s $9 billion of debt along the way, and NBC ends up valued just shy of $40 billion  and GE’s stake at just under $20 billion. That’s if Comcast pays for it. But there’s another option. Suppose instead of paying down debt NBC keeps its ratio of debt to operating cash flow constant. Then by mid-2014, it could have added an extra $4 billion-plus of debt as well as bringing in some $6 billion of free cash. It’s no coincidence that adds up to some $10 billion, about what buying half of G.E.’s stake would cost. One possible outcome would be for NBC, rather than Comcast, to finance the purchase, and then repeat the process over another three and a half years, a timeline the Comcast-G.E. deal contemplates, to finance the purchase of G.E.’s remaining stake. That would be a neat trick, and underscores the savvy deal Comcast has struck. It protects the company against having to pay through the nose for G.E.’s stake if NBC performs really well. Comcast could still end up out of pocket if NBC doesn’t deliver the expected cash flow, or if stock valuations are excessive in 2014. But at least Mr. Roberts hasn’t left his shareholders completely exposed. An Oily I.P.O. Investors rightly clipped the ambitions of Carlyle and Goldman Sachs in the initial public offering on Wednesday of Cobalt International. The deal’s prospectus reads like a sky-diving waiver. Cobalt has no proven reserves and won’t generate revenue for a year. Cobalt has an interesting portfolio of drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coasts of Angola and Gabon. Its management has ample experience in the deepwater drilling that’s needed to extract energy from these parts. But Cobalt’s potential rewards are matched by daunting risks. Cobalt warns its holdings “may never be economically producible.” And it is operating in unstable areas. As a result, Cobalt deserves to trade at a discount to more established and profit-producing operators like Anadarko or Total. Yet after pricing its deal 21 percent below the top of the range it had in mind, Cobalt’s $4.4 billion valuation still checks in at 2.3 times book value, a premium to the sector. Even assuming everything goes well, Cobalt’s crude will start to flow only in 2012. By that time it is anyone’s guess what the oil price will be  and whether a bet on expensive deepwater fields was economical.

Last Thursday, it was a stage for a cable takeover as Comcast announced a plan to acquire NBC Universal. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Michael Nagle/Getty Images The NBC studios, rich in broadcast history, may feel the pinch of cable TV economies. Related Times Topics: Comcast Corporation | NBC Universal Add to Portfolio Comcast Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Virginia Sherwood/NBC Jeffrey Immelt, left, head of General Electric, and Brian Roberts, chief of Comcast, are partners. Enlarge This Image Everett Collection In NBC's glory days, in the late '40s and early '50s, stars like Milton Berle kept America riveted to the small screen. There, in Studio 6B, a town hall meeting for NBC employees opened with Jeff Zucker, the NBC Universal chief executive, introducing “our new friends from Philadelphia,” and closed with a formal welcome to the Comcast family by Ralph Roberts, the cable operator’s 89-year-old patriarch. Mr. Roberts received a standing ovation. For employees of the most storied part of NBC Universal, the broadcast network, one question lingered: will we fit into this cable family? The studios at 30 Rockefeller Plaza  and shows like “30 Rock,” which parodies NBC’s corporate culture  will not be going dark as a result of the deal. But employees inside both the thriving news division and the ailing entertainment division of the National Broadcasting Company still have reason to be anxious about it. At every turn, Comcast has emphasized to its own shareholders that the deal’s purpose is to gain control over NBC Universal’s fast-growing cable channels. The writer and humorist John Dillon observed Thursday that in the 2,742-word news release about the deal, the broadcast network was not mentioned until word 2,170. There is even talk of changing NBC Universal’s name to play down the broadcast association. The deal is structured to give Comcast a controlling 51 percent interest, with its partner, General Electric, initially retaining 49 percent. “Everyone’s now talking about NBC as a cable company, and Comcast is a cable company,” a longtime NBC News staff member said. “I guess we’re wondering, do they like broadcast?” On the record, they do. Comcast says NBC and its affiliate structure will remain intact for the time being. All day Thursday, Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, whose fortunes have come from converting broadcast viewers into cable customers, talked up broadcast as “an important part of the fabric of America.” “We’re very committed to trying to see ways to make it successful,” he said in an interview on the cable channel CNBC. Later, in a conference call with reporters, the first question was about the viability of broadcast, leading Mr. Roberts to say of NBC, “I think there’s more upside than downside.” He said Comcast would seek to “restore it to No. 1.” Similarly, the G.E. chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, said on CNBC the same morning that his “top priority for next year” is to get NBC back in first place. “Let’s make no mistake, where we are today as a broadcast network is unacceptable,” he said. “And I share responsibility with that. That is job one.” Even as its news programs remain top-rated, NBC has seen its fortunes fall sharply in the last decade. In prime time, the network ranks a distant fourth, and its 10 p.m. program, “The Jay Leno Show,” is increasingly the butt of jokes. The network’s “Saturday Night Live” alluded to the network’s losses over the weekend, with the host of “Weekend Update” joking that the final sticking point to the deal was “G.E. convincing Comcast that it’s still 1996.” With that, the logos for NBC’s “Must See TV” shows of the 1990s  “Seinfeld,” “Friends” and “E.R.”  were flashed on the screen. The weakened state of the network aside, NBC employees said in interviews that they only sensed low-level anxiety about Comcast’s takeover, in part because changes are not expected until after the deal closes. The companies expect regulatory approvals to take a year or more. But one of the staffers acknowledged, “Some of us are worried that they’re going to have sticker shock over what it takes to do it on the broadcast side.” Some employees said they were relieved to hear Comcast executives say at the town hall that widespread layoffs were unlikely because there is little overlap between the two companies. The employees requested anonymity to speak candidly and describe the town hall meeting because they were not authorized by the network to speak. Strumming a Comcast-branded guitar to celebrate the Comcast news on Thursday, Conan O’Brien, the host of “The Tonight Show,” joked about the deal having “no apparent redundancy issues.” If anyone feels redundant, it would be the NBC affiliates that deliver their signals over the air; they will now be part of a company that provides its programming via cable. Mr. Roberts said in interviews that he did not foresee changes to the NBC affiliate structure, but was not specific about how far into the future he could see. Comcast has not yet contacted the affiliates. “From what we’ve read and what we’ve seen, their interest in content certainly aligns with ours, so there’s reason to be optimistic,” said Michael Fiorile, the chairman of the NBC affiliates board and the chief executive officer of Dispatch Broadcast Group, which owns NBC stations in Indiana. Comcast could toss a lifesaver of sorts to the broadcast business by supporting per-subscriber payments to stations, or so-called retransmission agreements. Comcast was noncommittal about retransmission last week, saying only that it hoped to play a constructive role. In a letter aimed at Washington lawmakers and regulators who will scrutinize the deal in the coming months, David L. Cohen, an executive vice president at Comcast, expressed support for NBC on Thursday. He wrote, “Notwithstanding the turbulence in the current media marketplace and the ongoing threats to the business model of a national broadcast network, the combined company remains committed to continuing to provide free over-the-air television” through its owned and operated stations and its local broadcast affiliates. Comcast also said it would “preserve and enrich the output of local news, local public affairs, and other public interest programming” on NBC’s stations. Public interest groups opposed to the deal called Mr. Cohen’s letter weak, noting that it did not make any funding commitments for local or national news. Not surprisingly, Comcast did not commit to keeping the name NBC Universal after the deal closes. Internally, the company will house its stake in NBC Universal inside a unit called Comcast Entertainment. Some Comcast executives are keen on using the Comcast Entertainment name in the future, although it is doubtful that the “NBC Nightly News” will become the “Comcast Nightly News” anytime soon. Talking to CNBC on Thursday, Mr. Roberts suggested that the NBC name sometimes distracts from the fact that NBC’s cable channels are “fantastic.” “In a way, sometimes their name gets in the way of that,” Mr. Roberts said. He started to say that he had talked about that fact with others, then cut himself off, saying instead, “we’ve joked about that.” Tim Arango, David Carr and Bill Carter contributed reporting.

But there is much to be concerned about in Comcast’s proposed takeover of NBC and its sister company Universal Studios. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Comcast Corporation | NBC Universal The pairing of the nation’s largest cable company with one of the leading television broadcasters, which also owns several popular cable networks, could limit choices and raise prices for viewers and advertisers. As they evaluate the proposed merger, antitrust and communications watchdog agencies should also consider the risks to the emerging business of delivering video entertainment over the Internet  the main competitive threat to cable TV. Despite shrinking ratings, network TV shows still have the biggest audiences in the country. Under current rules, Comcast could bar rival cable and satellite TV companies from access to desirable NBC shows, or it could offer them only at a high price, bundled with less-attractive content. It would also have an incentive to bar rivals’ content from its cable network. Programmers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission that Comcast keeps their channels off its system. Owning NBC’s Spanish-language network Telemundo, for instance, Comcast might be less inclined to carry other channels in Spanish. There is also a potential threat to advertisers. The merged company would own more than two dozen TV stations in many of the biggest media markets, which would give it huge clout to negotiate ad rates. Yet the biggest potential threat from a combination of Comcast and NBC is to the development of video delivery over the Internet and its promise of à la carte programming  which promises to expand viewers’ choices, allowing them to elude the bundling strategies common to cable and satellite TV that force them to pay hundreds of dollars for content they do not want. In 2007 the F.C.C. accused Comcast of violating net-neutrality principles by trying to block the content from BitTorrent services that allow users to share files online, and then ordered it to stop. Comcast is appealing the order in court. Being one of the largest broadband Internet service providers in the country, Comcast could now be tempted to limit access to NBC content on rival Internet services, or charge them high fees. And Comcast could take its bundling business model to the Internet by forcing customers to buy cable packages in order to see content from NBC’s network online. NBC is part owner of Hulu.com, an ad-driven service offering TV shows over the Internet. Comcast could well see such services as a threat and bundle them with cable services or abandon them entirely. These concerns might not justify blocking a merger. But they do justify a careful review. In a letter to regulators, Comcast offered several commitments to quell concerns over the merger, including a promise that NBC would remain a free over-the-air network and that it would offer NBC and Telemundo channels to rivals under the current rules that apply to cable networks. These commitments are welcome. They would carry more weight if they were made legally binding. And regulators could impose their own conditions on the deal. They might demand that the merged companies divest stations. They could also require that Comcast’s network carry content from independent cable channels. Online, regulators could demand that the company offer unbundled Internet content, and ensure that it is made available to consumers regardless of whether they buy cable or broadband services from Comcast. What regulators must not do is let this deal pass unchallenged. The risks to the development of the new media industry are too significant to simply ignore.

It would also have an incentive to bar rivals’ content from its cable network. Programmers have complained to the Federal Communications Commission that Comcast keeps their channels off its system. Owning NBC’s Spanish-language network Telemundo, for instance, Comcast might be less inclined to carry other channels in Spanish. There is also a potential threat to advertisers. The merged company would own more than two dozen TV stations in many of the biggest media markets, which would give it huge clout to negotiate ad rates. Yet the biggest potential threat from a combination of Comcast and NBC is to the development of video delivery over the Internet and its promise of à la carte programming  which promises to expand viewers’ choices, allowing them to elude the bundling strategies common to cable and satellite TV that force them to pay hundreds of dollars for content they do not want. In 2007 the F.C.C. accused Comcast of violating net-neutrality principles by trying to block the content from BitTorrent services that allow users to share files online, and then ordered it to stop. Comcast is appealing the order in court. Being one of the largest broadband Internet service providers in the country, Comcast could now be tempted to limit access to NBC content on rival Internet services, or charge them high fees. And Comcast could take its bundling business model to the Internet by forcing customers to buy cable packages in order to see content from NBC’s network online. NBC is part owner of Hulu.com, an ad-driven service offering TV shows over the Internet. Comcast could well see such services as a threat and bundle them with cable services or abandon them entirely. These concerns might not justify blocking a merger. But they do justify a careful review. In a letter to regulators, Comcast offered several commitments to quell concerns over the merger, including a promise that NBC would remain a free over-the-air network and that it would offer NBC and Telemundo channels to rivals under the current rules that apply to cable networks. These commitments are welcome. They would carry more weight if they were made legally binding. And regulators could impose their own conditions on the deal. They might demand that the merged companies divest stations. They could also require that Comcast’s network carry content from independent cable channels. Online, regulators could demand that the company offer unbundled Internet content, and ensure that it is made available to consumers regardless of whether they buy cable or broadband services from Comcast. What regulators must not do is let this deal pass unchallenged. The risks to the development of the new media industry are too significant to simply ignore.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/business/media/04hulu.html?ref=comcastcorporation">Web-TV Divide Is Back in Focus With NBC Sale<date>Published: December 3, 2009</date><text>As she prepared her daughter for college, Anne Sweeney insisted that a television be among the dorm room accessories.

I don’t need it,” her 19-year-old responded, saying she could watch whatever she wanted on her computer, at no charge. That flustered Ms. Sweeney, who happens to be the president of the Disney-ABC Television Group. “You’re going to have a television if I have to nail it to your wall,” she told her daughter, according to comments she made at a Reuters event this week. “You have to have one.” But she does not, actually. For 60 years, TV could be watched only one way: through the television set. Now, though, millions watch shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” on demand and online on network Web sites like Ms. Sweeney’s ABC.com and on the Internet’s most popular streaming hub, Hulu.com. How people watch TV on demand  and whether they should pay for the privilege  is a critical issue in the landmark deal, announced Thursday, that will give Comcast control of NBC Universal. In the deal, Comcast will become a co-owner of Hulu. Like all its broadcast rivals, NBC rushed to put its popular shows on the Web years ago, hoping to secure a piece of the booming online advertising market and offset an eroding audience. The viewers came in droves, but the ad revenues have not materialized as expected. By giving away TV episodes online, “the industry is literally tossing money and premium content away,” Barry M. Meyer, the Warner Brothers Entertainment chief executive, said in a speech in October. Comcast, the country’s largest cable operator, has already been using its considerable muscle to limit how many shows are available online, lest people think they can cancel their costly cable subscriptions and watch free online. Now the company  which, if the NBC deal passes government muster, will own a piece of the biggest site that threatens to undercut its core business  is looking for ways to charge for ubiquitous access to shows. With millions now watching TV on their computers, can the media companies put the Hulu genie back in the bottle? The scramble by TV companies to preserve its ad model while giving consumers choice  what Comcast’s chief executive called in interviews Thursday “anytime, anywhere media”  mirrors the efforts of newspapers, magazines and radio companies to wring more money from digital media. But all are facing some entrenched habits. “If you disrupt the consumer experience, you’re in trouble,” warns Mike Kelley, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. Stephen B. Burke, the chief operating officer of Comcast, recently called streaming “the biggest social movement I’ve ever seen.” “Online video consumption is off the charts,” he said at an industry conference. NBC and the News Corporation, the owner of Fox, jointly formed Hulu in 2007. Disney later became an equity partner in Hulu. On Hulu and sites like it, TV episodes are available any time, usually for a full month after they premiere; the images are crystal clear, and the commercial breaks are short. Hulu now draws more than 40 million visitors a month, according to comScore, and in October about five billion minutes of full episodes and short video clips were viewed. If online streams were included in TV ratings  and they eventually will be, Nielsen says  some shows would see considerable improvements. While Hulu does not release revenue figures, executives privately concede the site is not yet profitable. The race to “get our content out to viewers where, when and how they want it” was well intentioned, Mr. Meyer said in October, but it is “undermining the basic business model  by making our content less valuable to the people who actually are paying for it.” In response, Comcast and other operators are busy creating so-called authentication systems that will allow subscribers to stream a buffet of shows  but will lock out people who do not pay for cable. “Hollywood needs a toll collector,” said Todd Dagres of the venture capital firm Spark Capital, and “Comcast can play the part because online video will erode traditional cable.” Some are advocating for a pay model for TV streaming, and Hulu is widely expected to add a subscription arm next year. Chase Carey, the president of the News Corporation, said in October that Hulu needed to have a “subscription model as part of its business,” suggesting that the site could share some episodes for free and charge for others. In an interview last week, Hulu’s chief executive, Jason Kilar, would not discuss forthcoming changes to the site, but said “we never aspired to be Hulu.org,” referring to a nonprofit domain name. The site continues to be bullish on the current ad-supported model, but Mr. Kilar indicated that it was eyeing multiple business models for TV and movie viewing for the future. “If your ambition is to bring the world’s premium content to users, and to do so in a way that produces fair returns to content owners  and it is our ambition  there isn’t one single bullet,” Mr. Kilar said. In other words, on-demand viewing is about to get a lot more complicated. In the short term, users can expect more commercials and, potentially, fewer options for watching hit shows like “CSI” and “House.” Already, TV distributors have started to tighten the screws. For example, episodes of ABC shows usually appear online the morning after they premiere on TV  but last month each episode of the network’s alien invasion drama “V” was held back for four days. The message was clear: Watch “V” on TV. Fearing backlash from distributors, cable channels have always been more stingy about allowing streaming. The Syfy channel, for instance, streams episodes of its drama “Eureka” eight days after they premiere on TV. Many cable shows are never streamed. But they could come online through the authentication systems proposed by Comcast, Time Warner Cable and other operators. Sometimes called “TV Everywhere,” authentication proposes that it does not matter what screen people watch shows like “The Office” and “NCIS” on, as long as they pay a cable subscription and are counted by Nielsen. Even authenticated subscribers can expect to see more ads online in the near future. Currently a typical sitcom will stream on Hulu with about two minutes of ads, a pittance compared with the eight minutes of ads on television. Comcast and other companies are already experimenting with higher levels of ads, and the trials indicate that consumers will sit through them. “Given the amount of change you’re seeing happen,” Mr. Kilar said, “you’re going to see a tremendous number of experiments.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 4, 2009, on page A1 of the New York edition.As she prepared her daughter for college, Anne Sweeney insisted that a television be among the dorm room accessories.

Makes It Official: NBC Will Go to Comcast<date>Published: December 3, 2009</date><text>After nearly nine months of negotiations, Comcast, the nation’s largest cable operator, announced an agreement on Thursday to acquire NBC Universal from the General Electric Company. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Video Immelt and Roberts on Deal (CNBC) Related Media Decoder: Comcast Readies Itself for Long Regulatory Fight Media Decoder: For Time Being, 'Business as Usual' at NBC Universal (December 3, 2009) DealBook: The NBC Universal Sale, by the Numbers Web-TV Divide Is Back in Focus With NBC Sale (December 4, 2009) Add to Portfolio Comcast Corp General Electric Co Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Mark Lennihan/Associated Press NBC’s headquarters will remain in New York, the companies said. The deal valued NBC Universal at about $30 billion. The agreement will create a joint venture, with Comcast owning 51 percent and G.E. owning 49 percent. Comcast will contribute to the joint venture its stable of cable channels, which includes Versus, the Golf Channel and E Entertainment, worth about $7.25 billion, and will pay G.E. about $6.5 billion in cash, for a total of $13.75 billion. For now, the network will remain NBC Universal, but ultimately Comcast could decide to change the name. Almost immediately, the transaction reshapes the nation’s entertainment industry, giving a cable provider a huge portfolio of new content, even as it raises the sector’s anxieties about the future. In a joint statement announcing the agreement, Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, said the deal was “a perfect fit for Comcast and will allow us to become a leader in the development and distribution of multiplatform ‘anytime, anywhere’ media that American consumers are demanding.” The deal’s genesis lies in frequent flirtations over the last several years between Comcast and General Electric, although serious talks began in March. For Comcast, the purchase is the realization of its long-held ambition to be a major producer of television shows and movies. News of the negotiations broke in late September, and in the ensuing weeks G.E. worked to resolve details with Comcast, while simultaneously negotiating to buy out a 20 percent stake in NBC Universal held by Vivendi, the French telecommunications conglomerate. It was this last part that proved difficult. G.E. and Comcast’s part of the transaction has essentially been complete for weeks, but the final step was held up by the negotiations between G.E. and Vivendi. Vivendi will receive about $5.8 billion for its stake. Jeff Zucker, the current head of NBC Universal, will stay on as chief executive and report to the chief operating officer of Comcast, Steve Burke. In a statement released by the companies Thursday morning, Mr. Zucker called the deal the “start of a new era” for NBC. The deal could take up to 18 months to pass regulatory muster. Although Comcast is based in Philadelphia, NBC’s headquarters will remain in New York, the joint release said. Most of NBC’s value is in its lucrative cable channels  USA, Bravo, SyFy, CNBC and MSNBC. These networks, along with the channels that Comcast will contribute to the joint venture, will compose 82 percent of the company’s cash flow. The NBC network and Universal Studios will account for only a small portion of the joint venture’s cash flow. In some respects, G.E.’s decision to sell reflects a desire to exit a business that never quite meshed with its industrial side. “It’s something I always thought about,” said Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, in an interview. “In some ways my thinking gets shaped by the totality of G.E.” He said that the economic recession also affected his thinking, adding, “you never have an epiphany.” NBC has been mired in fourth place among the major broadcast networks, and the economics of the broadcast television business has deteriorated in recent years amid declining overall ratings and a decline in advertising. By contrast, cable channels have continued to thrive because they rely on a steady stream of subscriber fees from cable companies like Comcast. Mr. Roberts, the Comcast chief executive, failed in 2004 with a hostile takeover bid for the Walt Disney Company. Since then, the company has taken a less ambitious approach to content, buying a stake in MGM and building up smaller cable channels and regional sports networks. On Thursday, Mr. Roberts said, “I believe our company is strategically complete.” Shortly after news of the deal leaked in September, G.E. and Comcast signed a standstill agreement, which effectively blocked other bidders from entering the fray. Previously, G.E. had sought to entice Time Warner. More recently Rupert Murdoch, who controls the News Corporation, considered making an offer for NBC Universal. On Capitol Hill, a number of lawmakers said they would hold hearings to examine the deal in detail. Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Senate Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights Subcommittee, said he would convene a hearing about the deal “so that consumers can get a better sense of how this deal could affect their access to diverse programming and information, especially as they more often look to the Internet for such services.” Michael J. Copps, a commissioner of the Federal Communications Commission who regularly opposes media consolidation, said in a statement that “every citizen has a stake here,” given the size of the combined entity. “The lodestar for this review must be the public interest,” he said. Foreseeing a long regulatory fight, Comcast published a letter on Thursday that outlined commitments to enrich and extend programming for children and minority groups. It also said policies would remain in place to ensure independence for NBC’s news division. Asked about the NBC broadcast network and its affiliate structure, Mr. Roberts said in an interview, “We’re committed to free, over-the-air broadcast television continuing.” But he and other Comcast executives acknowledged that broadcasters faced continuing threats to their business model. Mr. Zucker reassured employees of NBC Universal that given the regulatory hurdles ahead, “for now, it remains business as usual.” Mr. Immelt said G.E. may consult its future partners on occasion over certain deals. G.E. will still be managing the company when certain significant television rights deals come open for bid within the next year. Under G.E., NBC has become the exclusive rights holder to every summer Olympics since 1988 and every winter Olympics since 2002. Referring to the coming games in Vancouver and London, which NBC already owns the rights to, Mr. Zucker said, “We’re excited for next year and 2012,” and stressed the company would remain in the bidding for the games in 2014 and 2016. Mindful of past deals that failed on their promise of synergies, Comcast made sure to point out that the financial projections underlying the deal took no account of any potential cost savings from combining the various assets. For the thousands of employees of both companies, that is good news. Comcast has about 100,000 employees, while NBC Universal employs about 30,000. Mr. Burke, the Comcast executive who will oversee the joint venture, said, “99.9 percent of those employees are in businesses that don’t overlap.” Bill Carter and Brian Stelter contributed reporting.

Their efforts failed or never advanced beyond big talk. Comcast's impending acquisition of NBC Universal will certainly set off an effort to turn Versus into a viable alternative, if not a full-fledged competitor, to ESPN. Under Comcast's ownership, Versus has transformed from the Outdoor Life Network to OLN, then, in 2006, into its current incarnation. But Versus is a second-tier network whose highest-profile sports, the N.H.L. and the Tour de France, aren't blockbusters. It lacks a studio show that would give it identity, like ESPN's ''SportsCenter,'' or an announcer who is its defining personality. Versus (and its sister network, the Golf Channel) will be turned over to NBC for an overhaul, assuming regulators approve the deal, a process that could take 12 to 18 months. Versus will probably be renamed something like NBC Sports Cable to reflect a more defined sports brand. On-air and production talent would migrate from NBC, to a certain extent, although Bob Costas would not be hosting IndyCar races. Versus and Golf would certainly be overseen by Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Universal Sports, who has never had a sports cable network to tinker with (the expanding Universal Sports channel is distributed through NBC stations and affiliates); he would no doubt quickly strip Versus of its current crop of late-night infomercials. But beefing up Versus' quality and appearance is a small part of getting part of ESPN's business. Comcast would have to decide to spend what is necessary to lure viewers from ESPN and ESPN2 by acquiring bigger events, like the Olympics, Major League Baseball, the N.F.L., Nascar and the N.B.A. -- properties on a tier above its current rights to IndyCar, the Professional Bull Riders, Mountain West Conference football and mixed martial arts. Versus needs big acquisitions to become something more than a default network for sports that ESPN doesn't want (although it doesn't need the huge bulk of hundreds upon hundreds of college games). Executives at Comcast and NBC declined requests for comment. A real competitor to ESPN -- with its epic power, multitude of platforms and billions of dollars in revenue -- does not truly exist. Yes, there are sports on other networks, like Fox, CBS and NBC, or on TNT or TBS, and one-sport channels like the MLB Network and NBA TV. But ESPN has spent enough to get the N.B.A. from NBC and the Bowl Championship Series games from Fox. It had Nascar rights, lost them, then got them back. And ESPN could wrest the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament from CBS. It's all about building huge audiences. ESPN and ESPN2 have close to 100 million subscribers, ESPNews has 70.1 million and ESPNU has 64 million. It is no wonder that no real or hypothesized competitor -- from Mizlou to Fox and CNN/SI, as well as an AOLTime Warner-N.B.A. venture -- has succeeded. But Comcast is a potentate, too, with more subscribers than any other cable or satellite provider. It knows all about the sea of revenue you can get from subscribers and advertisers. It has 10 regional sports networks. So, if Comcast is serious financially and qualitatively, it and NBC could turn Versus into a credible rival. It could turn Versus into a network that would provide cable operators (like Comcast) leverage in negotiations with ESPN. It might also make leagues giddy, knowing they could potentially juggle large-scale bids from Versus. ''You can see that the leagues must be concerned about the next round of negotiations,'' said Randy Falco, the former president of the NBC Universal Television Group. ''They're asking, 'Where's the money coming from?' Less and less over the next 10 years will it come from the broadcast networks, so they're looking for an alternative.'' Given the time it will take to receive regulatory approval, the next round of Olympic bidding (for the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, and the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro) will be handled sometime next year by General Electric, NBC's parent company. But Comcast would surely have to agree, before a takeover, to G.E.'s bid. Comcast does not need the Olympics to rationalize its NBC purchase, or to defeat ESPN, which has never carried the Olympics. But buying the rights would be a significant gesture of support for one of the last anchors of high ratings at fourth-place NBC. Falco, a former key member of NBC's Olympic team, said that whether Comcast spends what is necessary to outbid ESPN is not a certainty. ''Depending on what they find in due diligence, I don't think Comcast will say, 'If we're not a player in the Olympics, we're in trouble,' '' he said. Still, Falco said, if Ebersol and his Olympic team make a strong case to Comcast about the Olympics, having them would benefit Versus starting in 2014 and the Golf Channel in 2016, when golf will be played in the Rio Games. Challenging ESPN will not be easy. But once upon a time, CNN had the cable news world to itself.</text></article></page></root>
