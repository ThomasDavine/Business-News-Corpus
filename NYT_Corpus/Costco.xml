Now she is fighting for her own. On Sunday night, Ms. Hedges was with her 13-year-old son, Dayton, at a Costco store in East Harlem, buying several hundred dollars in Halloween candy, which the family planned to distribute to children from less-privileged neighborhoods who make the annual pilgrimage to their Upper West Side block of brownstones. Suddenly, she was crushed by a shopping cart, which was dropped from four floors above, the police said, by two boys from a walkway connecting a parking garage to the shopping center that houses the Costco and a Target store. Ms. Hedges, 47, was unconscious and sedated Tuesday in the intensive care unit at Harlem Hospital Center, according to her husband, Michael Hedges Jr., who rushed back from Madrid, where he works in finance. “She is the kind of woman,” Mr. Hedges said, “who gives her life to her family and the people around her.” The police said the two suspects, both 12 years old, were charged with felony assault. They appeared at a hearing on Monday in Family Court in Manhattan and are in the custody of the Administration for Children’s Services. Because of the boys’ age, their names were not released. The police are continuing to investigate with the help of surveillance video. On Tuesday, friends and family members grappled with the unthinkable: that a woman so selfless, volunteering at organizations as varied as the Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center, the New York Junior League and the Brick Presbyterian Church, could now be so helpless. “She’s very effervescent, just high-energy and motivated, and that made everybody feel motivated,” said Wanda Wooten, the executive director of the Isaacs center. “I’ve been in touch with the other board members, and we’re all rallying around the family to be supportive.” In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Hedges, 49, spoke of how his wife took in her sister, Fiona, after a car accident 10 years ago left her brain-damaged and unable to live alone. He said that his wife’s father just had heart surgery. The economy, he said, forced him to work abroad to support his family. Now Mr. Hedges is struggling with the possibility that he could have three physically incapacitated people living in his in-laws’ house in Manhattan, with his teenage son and daughter, Elizabeth. Ms. Hedges, who graduated from the Spence School and Barnard College, has always made philanthropy a priority. She joined the Junior League in 1993 and received an award in 2006 as an outstanding volunteer. From 2007 to 2008 she served as a vice president for development, and was recently training new members, said Lisa Hathaway Stella, the president of the New York Junior League. Fourteen years ago, Ms. Hedges was a co-chairwoman of the Junior League’s spring ball, when she went into labor on the day of the event. Hours before giving birth to Elizabeth, she wrote copious notes for the heads of various committees. Mr. Hedges said he wondered if there had been enough recreation programs available for the two young suspects, that perhaps they would have had a different outlet for playing than the parking garage walkway. “If there were more of these programs, then perhaps those kids would not have been on the bridge,” he said. In her work at the Isaacs center, a full-service community center at the Isaacs housing project on First Avenue between 93rd and 95th Streets, Ms. Hedges had recently become interested in helping to develop a college scholarship program for “disconnected” youths, Ms. Wooten said. In addition to volunteering, Ms. Hedges has worked for the last five years as a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman, specializing in town house sales, earning a top company honor for her performance in 2010. “I always said, ‘I don’t know how you do it all,’ ” Ms. Wooten said. “She’d just laugh, and say, ‘Oh, when it’s important, you find a way.’ ” Reporting was contributed by Jenny Anderson, Alain DelaquÃ©riÃ¨re, Daniel Krieger and Patrick Wall.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/business/food-companies-act-to-protect-consumers-from-e-coli-illness.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco and B.P.I. Require Broad E. Coli Testing<date>Published: July 15, 2011</date><text>The federal government has spent years considering whether to take steps to help keep dangerous strains of E. coli bacteria out of the food supply, a question that has become even more urgent in the face of a deadly wave of E. coli sickness that swept through Europe and raised alarms on both sides of the Atlantic.Now, two major American companies, Costco Wholesale and Beef Products Inc., have gotten tired of waiting for regulators to act. They are proceeding with their own plans to protect customers. Last month, Costco, one of the nation’s largest food retailers, quietly began requiring its suppliers of bagged produce, including salad greens and mixes, apple slices and baby carrots, to test for a broad range of toxic E. coli. “We know this is where we have to go and there’s no reason to wait,” said Craig Wilson, the food safety director of Costco. In the last two weeks, he said, most produce suppliers have added a test that can detect the strain from the European outbreak as well. The company also plans to test all of the ground beef sold at its warehouse stores. Costco operates a large ground beef plant in Tracy, Calif., and Mr. Wilson said the plant recently began evaluating testing procedures to detect the broader range of E. coli in the hamburger it makes and the beef trimmings that go into it. As an added step, the company plans to ask suppliers of the trimmings to do their own testing, starting later this summer, he said. Until recently, the produce and beef industries focused E. coli prevention efforts on a single strain of the bacteria, known as O157:H7, which was responsible for scores of outbreaks and recalls. But public health experts have identified six rarer forms, often referred to as the “Big Six,” which have increasingly been found to be the cause of illness related to food, including an outbreak in the United States last year traced to tainted romaine lettuce. The devastating outbreak of illness in Europe this spring was caused by yet another rare form of E. coli, O104:H4, which investigators say was spread through tainted sprouts. That strain has not been known to cause illness in this country and it is not on the list of the Big Six, but it was so virulent that it made the food industry take notice. More than 3,900 people were sickened in the German outbreak and at least 42 died, including one American who became ill after traveling to Germany. People infected with E. coli can get bloody diarrhea; severe cases may lead to kidney failure and death. Costco’s new testing requirements come as the federal government continues to drag its feet on what to do about the expanding E. coli threat. After four years of study, the United States Department of Agriculture finished drafting rules in January for how the industry should handle the “Big Six” E. coli in ground beef. But the proposal has been stalled within the Office of Management and Budget, which reviews most federal regulations before they are released. Details of the proposal are confidential, but many in the industry expect that the rules would require testing or even make it illegal to sell ground beef that contained the additional strains of toxic E. coli. Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, on Friday sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, decrying the delay and urging him to unilaterally declare any ground beef containing the six additional strains of toxic E. coli unfit for sale. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, wrote last week to the Office of Management and Budget, asking it to act on the U.S.D.A. rules. Just last month, many in the food industry said they were waiting to see what the government would do. But alarm over the German outbreak may be changing that. “There’s a lot of companies that don’t want that repeated here in the United States,” said James L. Marsden, a professor of food safety and security at Kansas State University. This week, Beef Products, a large manufacturer of lean beef, an ingredient used to make hamburger meat, announced that it had started testing for the six additional strains of E. coli at one of its five grinding plants. The company, based in South Dakota, said it would start tests in its four other plants as soon as it could get enough test kits from manufacturers, which are just beginning to produce them. “For a little bit of extra cost, they can stay ahead of the food safety curve,” said Gene Grabowski, a Beef Products spokesman. The landscape is changing partly because tests created by U.S.D.A. scientists that can quickly pinpoint the presence in food of the “Big Six” E. coli are now being developed for commercial sale by test-kit companies. Some kits are already on the market. DuPont Qualicon, which makes a kit used widely in the beef industry, said that by September it expected to begin selling an expanded version capable of detecting the six additional strains. The company is also working to develop a screening test for the German E. coli strain. Costco has been using a preliminary version of the DuPont kit in its California plant to evaluate the test before requiring that its beef suppliers adopt it. Amy Smith, technical and regulatory support leader of DuPont Qualicon, said several other companies had been using the preliminary kits as they went through similar evaluations. “People are really gearing up,” she said. “While they might not be running things routinely, they’re getting ready for the fact that they might have to very soon.” She said the company was working to develop a test for the European E. coli strain that could be added to its kits. Each type of E. coli has different characteristics that make developing tests for rapid detection a challenge. Food companies have adopted many measures to rid their products of E. coli. Testing is used mainly to verify how well those steps are working.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/american-express-costco-card-to-lower-restaurant-rebate/?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">American Express Costco Card to Lower Restaurant Rebate<date>June 1, 2011, 11:59 am</date><text>It’s a fact of life for credit card reward chasers — almost inevitably, the most generous cards end up scaling back the goodies sooner or later. A while back, it was the Charles Schwab Visa that stopped paying a 2 percent rebate. And now it’s the Costco True Earnings American Express Card. Starting Aug. 1, the cash rebate will fall to 2 percent from 3 percent for restaurant purchases. Also, people who carry a less-used “Cash Rebate” version of the card will need to spend $7,500 in a year before they graduate to a higher cash-back earning tier that is unique to that card; currently, they need to spend $5,000. These are the only changes that Amex is making. The 3 percent gas rebate will remain on the True Earnings Card for purchases up to $3,000 each year, and there is still no annual fee besides whatever you pay to be a Costco member each year. So why this and why now? Leah Gerstner, a spokeswoman for American Express, said that rewards were expensive and that the company needed to make adjustments given the costs associated with increased regulatory scrutiny. “We still have some of the richest cards in the market,” she added. Which is true. But the gluttons among us will soon be paying just a bit more out of pocket to feed our faces. Meanwhile, any guesses as to which card will see the next devaluation?</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/business/26costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Profit Increases 6%<date>Published: May 25, 2011</date><text>Costco Wholesale said on Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 6 percent as rising sales and membership fees made up for declining margins.But the company warned that rising costs for things like meat and cotton for T-shirts would continue to pose a challenge. “Over all, inflation’s hitting everybody,” Costco’s chief financial officer, Richard A. Galanti, told investors. “It’s going to continue.” Costco reported earnings of $324 million, or 73 cents a share, up from $306 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended May 8 and was the third quarter of Costco’s fiscal year, rose 16 percent, to $20.62 billion, from $17.78 billion. Membership fees, which are included in the revenue figure, rose to $435 million from $395 million as more consumers joined the warehouse club in search of lower prices for household staples. The results included a charge of $49 million related to an accounting adjustment reflecting a change in the value of inventory. Costco said it expected to take a similar charge in the current quarter and potentially beyond as commodity prices continued to rise. The rising costs of many common goods like fuel, grain, cotton and coffee are being passed along by manufacturers. Shares of Costco, which is based in Issiquah, Wash., fell $1.03, to $80.32.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/your-money/05money.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Adding It Up: Amazon’s Subscription Service vs. Costco<date>Published: March 4, 2011</date><text>For millions of Costco customers, this is an eagerly awaited time of year. Right about now is when their big annual rebate checks arrive from American Express.Amex has a couple of different Costco-branded credit cards. The ones currently available to new customers earn 2 percent back on all travel purchases, 3 percent on all restaurant charges and at least 3 percent on gasoline (at any station, not just Costco ones) up to certain annual spending limits. Plus, you get 1 percent cash back for spending everywhere else. The check arrives attached to the bill for February, but it comes with a catch: You have to go to Costco to redeem it. You can just collect cash, turn around and walk out. But Costco is clearly hoping that most people will see the check as a good excuse to go shopping right then and there. And that’s what most people seem to do. I have this card and love it. But I’ve also begun to question the value of the time it takes for an expedition to one of these stores. And if you shop at Sam’s Club or BJ’s, Costco’s competitors, you may be wondering, too. After all, the older you get, the more valuable your time seems. And going to Costco, even though it’s just a couple of miles from my home, is generally a two-hour round trip by the time the driving, the shopping, the waiting in line, the loading of the car and the unloading back home are done. In 2007, meanwhile, Amazon.com introduced a service called Subscribe &amp; Save. The premise is simple: If you agree to get a recurring shipment of an item, Amazon will cut 15 percent off its normal price and send it to you every one, two, three or six months without charging the standard shipping rate. So I subscribed to toilet paper, which makes for a great story and good fun for children when three months’ worth arrives and become a temporary tower or a fort on the living room floor. Ever since the toilet paper subscription (and later, the paper towel one) started coming, I’ve wondered what it would be like to subscribe via Amazon to everything I get at Costco and never set foot in the place again, except to cash my check each year. So this year, $304.50 refund check in hand, I went to Costco with a list of items that most households need to replenish every so often. I recorded the prices. Then, I compared them with identical items at Amazon, looking in particular for the ones among the 40,000 or so that are now available for subscription. My guess is that many Costco customers would find that any savings they gain by shopping there is eliminated and then some when they consider the value of the time spent going to and fro many times a year. That’s time they would win back if they subscribed to those same items at Amazon and then never had to think again about running out of them. My Costco list included the following: Huggies diapers, Tide powder, Bounty paper towels, Swiffer refills, Clorox wipes, Ziploc sandwich bags and enough Duracell batteries to power multiple electronic devices for many months. There was also Dove soap, Lubriderm lotion, Tampax, Mach 3 Turbo razor blades and enough house brand ibuprofen to kill off hundreds of headaches, among other things. Then, I spent some time on Amazon’s site and recorded the per unit price for each of these items. Almost all were available at the discounted subscription price, which manufacturers help Amazon pay for (so excited are they by the idea of a recurring pipeline into people’s homes and wallets). Setting up Amazon subscriptions for the first time probably takes about as much time as a round trip to Costco. But, according to Doug Herrington, vice president of consumables for Amazon, many people start with just a few items. “They add over time,” he said. “They start with one big schlep factor, like toilet paper or diapers.” Over time, you may need to adjust your delivery dates So what does that 15 percent discount get you? My sample basket of goods, enough for a three-month supply for a family of four, cost $251 at Amazon. At Costco, it was $208, representing a 17 percent savings. Costco was tied or cheaper on every item, occasionally by a lot. Amazon, for instance, isn’t competitive on large containers of cleaning liquids of various sorts, since it’s just too expensive to ship those sorts of things. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/environmental-impact-costco-vs-amazon/?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Environmental Impact: Costco vs. Amazon<date>March 4, 2011, 4:42 pm</date><text>I probably could have written an entire column on the question of whether Costco or Amazon.com’s Subscribe &amp; Save program is the more environmentally friendly choice. Instead, I gave it a brief mention in my column this weekend. So here’s where you come in. How would you attempt to break down the analysis? Is an Amazon subscription greener, since the company has no stores where it has to keep the lights and the heat on? Or is it better to drive to Costco a few times each year to stock up, thus avoiding all the cardboard boxes that often come with Amazon purchases? Doug Herrington, vice president of consumables at Amazon, tried to frame it this way: It’s the difference between your several-thousand-pound vehicle lumbering up the road to a warehouse store vs. letting your small package carpool with others on a U.P.S. truck. But you know what he wants you to think. So which choice do you think is greener?</text></article><article index="7" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/kicking-the-costco-habit/?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Kicking the Costco Habit<date>March 4, 2011, 4:43 pm</date><text>In this weekend’s Your Money column, I ran a little experiment. I’d always wondered how much money I was really saving by shopping at Costco and whether it was worth the two hours it generally takes round trip. I’d gotten more interested in figuring this out in the last year or two as I’ve experimented with Amazon.com’s Subscribe &amp; Save program, which allows you to sign up for automatic delivery of household staples at regular intervals. For me, at least, the savings at Costco (or Sam’s Club or BJ’s) over Amazon don’t equal the value I place on the time it takes to shop at Costco. You may feel differently, if you’re able to shop for fresh foods there (I mostly don’t) in addition to cleaning supplies and other products that won’t spoil, or you have a large family. (Also, if you want to comment about the environmental impact of Costco vs. Amazon, you can do so in a separate post. ) So how do you do the math on whether a warehouse club membership is worth it?</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/business/03retail.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco and BJ’s Post Better Than Expected February Sales<date>Published: March 2, 2011</date><text>February sales at Costco Wholesale and BJ’s Wholesale Club surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, as members drove in for deals on gasoline and stayed to do more of their shopping.With the price of regular gasoline close to $4 a gallon in some parts of the country, retailers like Costco are doing what they can to absorb higher commodity costs, a move that could pressure margins. BJ’s has gas stations at 103 of its 190 or so locations, and sales and memberships increase in tandem with the price of gas. “We see each week and each day, actually, as gas prices rise, more and more traffic to the clubs,” Laura Sen, its chief executive, said during a conference call. “We see this as one of our best marketing tools, especially in a rising price environment.” BJ’s, which is considering selling the company, also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, while Costco’s profit met Wall Street’s expectations. BJ’s shares rose 2.8 percent to $49.66, while Costco’s shares fell 2.5 percent to $71.76. Costco, the country’s largest warehouse club operator, said that lower-margin gasoline accounted for 8.5 percent of sales in the quarter, up from 7.2 percent a year earlier. Costco’s February sales at stores open at least a year rose 8 percent, while analysts were looking for a 7 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters data. BJ’s said its February same-store sales rose 5.5 percent. Analysts were expecting a 3.5 percent gain. Costco’s February same-store sales in the United States rose 6 percent including gas, or 4 percent excluding it. At BJ’s, same-store sales rose 2.4 percent without gas. Costco earned $348 million, or 79 cents a share, in its fiscal second quarter that ended on Feb. 13, up from $299 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. BJ’s earned 95 cents a share in the fiscal fourth quarter that ended on Jan. 29, up from 94 cents a year earlier, topping analysts’ forecast of 92 cents. BJ’s forecast first-quarter earnings of 54 cents to 58 cents a share and fiscal-year earnings of $2.62 to $2.82 a share. Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on BJ’s potential sale, which the company did not discuss on Wednesday. The possible sale “sort of overrides the fundamentals at least for the near term,” said Walter Stackow, a senior research analyst at Manning &amp; Napier, which has held BJ’s shares for nearly three years. Mr. Stackow said he expected that a buyer would be a private equity firm or consortium, rather than a grocery store chain or other strategic player. BJ’s raised its annual membership fee $5 to $50 in January, matching Costco’s lowest-price membership. The least expensive membership at Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart, is $35 a year. Costco said it planned to open 15 or 16 new warehouses, including one relocation and one reopening, before its fiscal year ends on Aug. 28. BJ’s has plans to open six to eight clubs this year, including one relocation and four or five smaller clubs that are about 85,000 square feet. Last week, Wal-Mart said fourth-quarter sales at Sam’s Club rose 4.5 percent, or 2.7 percent excluding fuel.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/17/where-to-buy-eyeglasses/?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Where to Buy Eyeglasses<date>January 17, 2011, 3:00 pm</date><text>Paul Sakuma/Associated Press Costco Optical topped a Consumer Reports rating of eyeglass retailers. An article in The New York Times on Monday, “Defying Conventional Wisdom to Sell Glasses Online,” describes how a start-up e-commerce site, Warby Parker, is trying to change the way people buy prescription glasses. But if you still prefer to buy glasses in a brick-and-mortar store, you may want to consider another unconventional outlet: Costco. Costco Optical topped a recent Consumer Reports list rating eyeglass retailers including large chains, independent local optical shops and private doctors’ offices. The ratings, which we learned about from a recent Consumerist post, were based on a survey that asked Consumer Reports readers about their satisfaction with their most recent eyeglass purchase, including their experience regarding factors such as price, frame selection and customer service. According to Consumer Reports, Costco Optical earned the highest score for overall satisfaction among chains, had one of the lowest median prices ($157) among retailers and stood out for lack of reported problems in the first few weeks after purchase (think loose lenses or damaged frames). While doctor’s offices and independent optical boutiques had higher median prices, they did receive high marks for service and quality. Some other chains, however, didn’t fare so well, including Visionworks, America’s Best Contacts &amp; Eyeglasses, and JCPenney Optical.

But the holiday season altogether was still the strongest since 2006, and several categories including luxury continued their growth.Sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.1 percent in December compared with the same month a year ago, according to a tally of 28 retailers by Thomson Reuters. That was below analysts’ expectations of 3.4 percent, a prediction buoyed by reports of rising foot traffic, online spending and early holiday sales. Though December was weaker than expected, the overall holiday season was relatively strong, analysts said, especially when November’s 6 percent increase in sales is taken into account. The two months together posted an increase of 4.4 percent, the biggest holiday-season increase since 2006, Thomson Reuters said. “A lot of companies and sectors out there did well, better than analysts expected,” particularly the more exclusive retailers, said Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in the retail practice at Accenture, the consulting firm. The mixed results among specialty retailers suggested that stores with tepid sales had problems with merchandise or operations, he said, since other stores were doing fine. “You’ll see folks with good numbers that are in the same malls as those companies and are catering to, relatively, the same customer base,” Mr. Donnelly said. “It’s not that customers forsook the specialty apparel space — they went in the same malls, they just happened to walk by some stores.” Since specialty stores all designed and sold exclusive clothing, the problem was probably in the clothes, he said. But “for most customers out there, the fundamentals of the economic situation haven’t changed substantially,” Mr. Donnelly said. Customers might be saving a bit less or earning a bit more in the stock market, and small shifts in how consumers felt could push sales higher. “Instead of spending $100, people spent $103,” he said, referring to the December 3.1 percent increase. “It doesn’t take much.” The International Council of Shopping Centers, which tracks sales at chain stores, said on Thursday that December sales rose 3.1 percent for stores open at least a year, compared to December 2009. For the November-December holiday period, same-store sales rose 3.8 percent, which was the biggest holiday increase since 2006. While concerns were rampant about how the post-Christmas snowstorm on the East Coast would affect December results, only a handful of retailers cited that as a factor. BJ’s Wholesale Club, for instance, said that comparable sales rose in every region except the New York City area, where results were hurt by the storm. On the other hand, J. C. Penney said its Manhattan store outperformed the company average for the month, and that the Northeast was one of the best-performing regions in December. The day after Christmas tends to account for only 2 to 2.5 percent of sales for the month, making it one of the lower-ranked spending days in December, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which estimates overall spending. Luxury items continued to rise, even more so than analysts had expected, with the two higher-end stores reporting results — Nordstrom and Saks Fifth Avenue — beating estimates by the biggest amounts. At Saks, sales at stores open at least a year, a measure called same-store sales, rose 11.8 percent, beating estimates of 3.9 percent. And Nordstrom’s rose 8.4 percent, versus estimates of 3.4 percent. Other data showed strength in luxury. Even at a middle-market store like J. C. Penney, more expensive items like fine jewelry were among the top performers for the month. December jewelry sales rose 10.4 percent compared with the month a year ago, according to SpendingPulse. And luxury sales outside of jewelry rose 8.5 percent. Some apparel stores were among the worst performers for December, missing estimates by big margins, including — American Eagle Outfitters (down 11 percent), Aéropostale (down 5 percent) and Gap-owned stores (down 3 percent). But that seemed to be more a store-specific problem than a mark of a troubled sector. Other apparel stores did well, like Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, where sales rose 15 percent; Limited Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works, up 5 percent; and stores aimed at teenagers, like the Buckle, which was up 6.1 percent. Overall apparel sales rose 10.9 percent in December from a year earlier, according to SpendingPulse, which measures consumer spending. That was the biggest increase since March 2007, and the teen apparel category increased 12.2 percent. For stores with wide arrays of merchandise, a good performance in apparel did not totally offset lackluster categories elsewhere, particularly in electronics. SpendingPulse said that the consumer electronics category was up just 1.5 percent from a year ago, one of the weaker results among the sectors it measures. At Costco Wholesale, for instance, same-store sales rose 6 percent, just a bit below analyst expectations of 6.2 percent. There, the category that includes apparel, jewelry and housewares rose in the high single digits compared to a year ago, but electronics was weak, declining in the high single digits versus a year ago. Costco said that a big reason for that was declining television prices — while the number of TVs sold rose, revenue from TVs dropped in stores open at least a year. Target saw a similar pattern. It posted a same-store sales increase of 0.9 percent for the month, which was 3.1 percent lower than what analysts had predicted and "below expectations," Target said in a press release. Though apparel was up for the month, electronics and some other categories decreased compared to a year ago. "Target saw a weakness in consumer electronics, and we saw that coming from a number of different chains, including, of course, Best Buy," said Michael B. Koskuba, a senior portfolio manager at Victory Capital Management, which owns shares in Target, referring to Best Buy’s lackluster earnings report from last month. "It’s difficult to get that incremental buyer to buy another flat-screen television, and I also think consumers in general have been looking for greater bargains. The prices of consumer electronics should continue to come down, so maybe they’re waiting." Measuring double-digit increases over last December in categories like jewelry, apparel and e-commerce (up 17.6 percent, the highest increase since December 2007), SpendingPulse had a brighter take on the holiday season than the Thomson Reuters numbers. Categories including apparel, auto parts and services, e-commerce and grocery are now above 2007 levels in terms of dollars spent (though electronics, jewelry, luxury and home furnishings still lag behind), said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis at SpendingPulse. “This is the longest sustained period of improvement, from a consumer-spending standpoint, that we’ve seen since the recession,” Mr. McNamara said. “It’s really strong growth across a number of retail categories.”</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/14costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Supreme Court’s Tie Vote Sustains Swatch Ruling Against Costco<date>Published: December 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Supreme Court said Monday that it deadlocked, 4-4, and would not decide a copyright infringement case involving the discount warehouse chain Costco Wholesale over the resale of imported Swiss watches made by a Swatch Group unit.In a case between the top warehouse club and the world’s largest watchmaker, the deadlock means that the justices automatically affirmed a federal appeals court ruling that Swatch’s Omega unit retained the rights to watches it made and sold abroad that later were imported into this country. The Supreme Court’s action was not a ruling on the merits of the dispute and it did not set a precedent, but it did resolve the case in Omega’s favor. It had been one of the court’s more important business cases, with implications for the multibillion-dollar so-called gray market, in which brand-name goods protected by trademark or copyright are imported via third parties into the United States. Retailers like Costco and Amazon.com have faced legal problems over the resale of goods that brand holders say infringes their copyright. Several business groups, retailers and companies, like the online auctioneer eBay, had supported Costco before the Supreme Court. The Obama administration backed Omega. Costco obtained Omega’s Seamaster watches through a series of transactions, selling them to consumers in California for $1,299 each, a third less than the suggested retail price. Omega first sold the watches to authorized distributors overseas. Unidentified third parties bought and sold them to a New York company, which in turn sold them to Costco. Although Omega approved the initial foreign sale, it did not authorize the importation of the watches into the United States or the sales by Costco. After Costco’s sale of 43 watches in 2004, Omega sued and claimed Costco’s actions amounted to copyright infringement. A federal judge ruled for Costco, but the appeals court sided with Omega. The Supreme Court deadlocked because Justice Elena Kagan did not participate in the case, presumably because of her previous involvement as solicitor general. She has recused herself from several cases, but this was the first to end with a tie vote.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/four-guidelines-for-polite-costco-shopping/?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Four Guidelines for Polite Costco Shopping<date>December 11, 2010, 7:46 am</date><text>After a few too many near-cart collisions, line-cutting incidents and the like, I decided to sound off this weekend in a Marketplace Money commentary about how people should behave themselves when shopping at Costco, Sam’s Club, BJ’s and other big-box stores. My suggestions: 1) Leave your children at home if you have someone to take care of them, lest someone crash a cart into them. (Small children sometimes fall out of the carts too.) 2) No adding additional carts to your spot in line. (No, I don’t care if you have nine children and need two carts; finish shopping and then get in line with all of your carts so the people behind you have an accurate sense of the wait in that particular queue.) 3) Move out of the aisle when you stop to eat the samples. (Remember, there’s often a wait for the next batch of hot shumai.) 4) Let others who have been waiting longer go to the cashier first when a new checkout lane opens up. (The bumper carts routine gets a bit tiresome.) My guess is that many of you have your own etiquette rules that you wish these stores would post in a prominent place. Please start your campaign for them in the comments below.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/business/09costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Profit Tops Expectations<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>Costco posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by strong sales and increased fee revenue as consumers sought its bulk offerings of food and other items.Gross margins rose to 10.98 percent from 10.88 percent, though the improvement was less than some analysts had expected because of strong sales of lower-margin gasoline. Costco said sales growth improved as the quarter progressed, helping to assuage concerns that tougher comparisons late in the year would make it harder for the company to show increased sales, especially during the holiday sales season. Improvement in the California market, which makes up more than a quarter of Costco’s sales, helped lift results, analysts said. Costco, the warehouse club operator, said sales in its fiscal first quarter, ended Nov. 21, rose 11 percent, to $18.82 billion from $16.92 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 7 percent, helped by higher gasoline prices. Total revenue, which includes membership fees, rose to $19.24 billion. Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., and sells bulk packages of products as various as diapers and detergent, said quarterly profit was $312 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $266 million, or 60 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast 69 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/business/09costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Supreme Court Case Could Affect Discount Sellers<date>Published: November 8, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court heard arguments on Monday in a dispute between Costco and the Swiss watch maker Omega over a line of watches that Costco sold for a third less than they cost elsewhere.The copyright case has implications for discount sellers like Costco as well as eBay, Amazon and other companies that form an estimated $58 billion annual market for goods that are purchased abroad, then imported and resold without the permission of the manufacturer. The software, book, music and movie industries say a broad ruling for Costco also could threaten their ability to retain control over copyrighted works. But libraries worry that a decision in favor of Omega could force them to withdraw foreign-made books. Omega sued Costco after it offered Omega’s Seamaster watch for $1,299. The suggested retail price was $1,995. Costco purchased the watches from a company in New York. Omega sold at least some of the items to an authorized distributor in Paraguay.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco’s Profit Rose 16% in 4th Quarter<date>Published: October 6, 2010</date><text>Net income at the Costco Wholesale Corporation, the warehouse club operator, rose nearly 16 percent in the fourth quarter on higher revenue from membership fees and international operations.Shoppers, who began to flock to Costco when the recession hit, showed strong demand for food and necessities. Sales of small extras, like housewares and sporting goods, continued to grow modestly. Costco earned $432 million, or 97 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Aug. 29, up from $374 million, or 85 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent, to $24.13 billion. The earnings beat analysts’ expectations of 95 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. But Costco fell short of revenue expectations of $24.23 billion. Costco’s push into markets outside the United States paid off. While revenue from sales at stores open at least a year — a crucial measurement of a retailer’s health — climbed 6 percent over all, that same figure jumped 14 percent for international sales. Excluding the impact of gasoline and foreign exchange, the figure rose 4 percent over all and 8 percent internationally. Revenue at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent for the month of September. Analysts had expected a 4.5 percent increase. The company does not issue earnings guidance, but Richard A. Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer, said management was “positive and aggressive” as it heads into the holiday season. “We feel good about selling through without risk of big markdowns, and we’ve had good sell-through on some seasonal stuff,” Mr. Galanti said. Costco has been one of the top performers during the recession, so the more modest quarter left investors a little leery. Shares of the company, based in Issaquah, Wash., rose 75 cents, to $65.41, in Nasdaq trading. For the full year, Costco’s net income increased 19 percent, to $1.3 billion, or $2.92 a share, compared with $1.09 billion, or $2.47 a share, a year earlier. Annual revenue rose 9.1 percent, to $77.95 billion.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/business/28shop.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Profit Rises 46% as Sales Grow 12%<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>The Costco Wholesale Corporation said Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 46 percent as shoppers began buying nonessential items, driving sales up 12 percent.Costco said it earned $306 million, or 68 cents a share, up from $210 million, or 48 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for special items in each period, the profit rose to 66 cents a share from 53 cents. Revenue in the period, which ended May 9 and was the third quarter of Costco’s fiscal year, rose to $17.78 billion from $15.8 billion. Membership fees, which are part of the revenue figures, rose to $395 million from $329 million. “I think if there is a silver lining to this horrible economy over the last year and a half, it is that the warehouse clubs and us in particular are the extreme value proposition,” said Richard A. Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer. “People are shopping with us more frequently than they used to.” Profits matched, and sales exceeded, analysts’ estimates. Shares of Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., rose $2.76, or 4.9 percent, to close at $58.74 on Thursday. Costco said it had more business from everyday consumers and businesses like small restaurants, which helped keep the bulk of the company’s business in food. But small luxuries like patio furniture sold out quickly while television sales slumped. Mr. Galanti said shoppers were coming in more often but average spending per visit fell slightly. Shoppers are buying more food and necessities and fewer televisions than last year, he said, but that is somewhat offset by sales of housewares, exercise gear and other discretionary items. “My view is we’ve got them coming in more frequently, and it is not like they’re buying it somewhere else,” he said on Thursday. “And when they start buying it, they are buying it at us.” Sales at stores open at least a year grew 10 percent. Excluding the impact of higher gas prices and changes in currency exchange rates, they rose 4 percent.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/nyregion/18costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">A 30-Pack of Charmin, but Where to Store It?<date>Published: April 16, 2010</date><text>WHEN Costco opened its first Manhattan outpost last November, in a soaring East 116th Street shopping complex with river views, management did not know precisely who or what to expect: Would customers stream in from East Harlem and Washington Heights? Or would the aisles be flooded with Upper West Siders stocking up on San Pellegrino? How much demand would there be for kosher meat? Costcos nationwide sell some 57 million rolls of Charmin per month: would people living in cramped apartments go for those 30-roll packages?Turns out there are even more Upper East Siders shopping at the Manhattan Costco than had been expected (and a lot were expected), but there are also plenty of people from Harlem, Morningside Heights, the Bronx and beyond. Kosher food is in high demand, though not as high as in Costco’s kosher capital, Lawrence, N.Y. And as for the question of where shoppers keep it all, Iliana Dimitrova, 36, an accountant, offered this clue: “If you open my kitchen cabinets, it’s all toilet paper and Bounty from Costco.” In fact, Bounty paper towels have been the store’s most popular item: 258,000 rolls were sold by April 6, 12 at a time. On a recent sunny Friday, Costco was an oasis of urban harmony: Parents who live in public-housing complexes shopped for after-school snacks alongside people planning to split their loot between homes in the city and the Hamptons. Some strolled home, fruit salad and Pop Tarts teetering over the edge of their granny carts; some piled flat-screen televisions into livery cabs; some packed their bottled water and eggs — the store sells 76,000 eggs a week — into beat-up trucks or Mercedes S.U.V.’s. A black Michael Kors blazer hung from the handle of one woman’s cart: a $79.99 gift for her driver. Rob Coope, the store’s general manager, said Manhattan shoppers were more likely to prefer the smaller — O.K., less big — and higher-end version of things. At most Costcos, large tubs of Polly-O mozzarella easily outsell containers of buffalo mozzarella at nearly triple the per-pound price. Not in Manhattan, though Mr. Coope is still trying to determine whether that is more about a taste for finer things or a lack of refrigerator space. “Almost all the questions we had were, ‘Can you get the healthier version?’ Organic sugar, low-calorie bread, soy cheese,” Mr. Coope recalled of the early weeks. “Kosher, big. Healthy, organic, big. Much bigger than the other buildings.” See the accompanying slide show for a look at some shoppers and their purchases.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/04/business/04discount.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Profit Rises 25%; BJ’s Is Up 5%<date>Published: March 4, 2010</date><text>The Costco Wholesale Corporation posted a 25 percent increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by sales growth overseas and higher gas prices. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio BJ's Wholesale Club Inc Go to your Portfolio » Costco said it earned $299 million, or 67 cents a share, for the quarter, up from $239 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time charge of 3 cents a share tied to employee benefits, Costco’s profit fell short of the 72 cents a share that analysts had expected. Sales in the quarter, which ended Feb. 28 and was the second quarter of Costco’s fiscal year, rose 11 percent, to $18.74 billion, from $16.84 billion. The company’s revenue from membership fees increased nearly 9 percent to $386 million. The chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said food sales were steady and discretionary categories like sporting goods and some housewares grew modestly. Much of the revenue gain came from higher gas prices and favorable currency exchange rates. Shares in Costco, based in Issaquah, Wash., fell 70 cents, or 1.14 percent, to close at $60.68 on Wednesday. Another discounter, BJ’s Wholesale Club, said Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 5 percent, also helped by higher gasoline prices. BJ’s profit increased to $55.1 million, or $1.01 a share, from $52.7 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding 6 cents a share in legal charges, earnings were 95 cents a share, falling just below the 96 cents a share expected by analysts. Sales for the period, which ended Jan. 30 and was the fourth quarter of BJ’s fiscal year, rose 9 percent, to $2.8 billion from $2.56 billion.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Costco Wholesale Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Costco reported nearly flat earnings for the quarter that ended Nov. 22. The company earned $266 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $263 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Costco has been one of the stronger retailers during the economic downturn as shoppers have focused on prices and limited their spending to necessities like food. But falling prices on goods like meat and produce have hurt its profit as those changes are typically passed through to shoppers. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $17.3 billion, as more shoppers joined its clubs and net sales rose 5.5 percent, to $16.92 billion. Sales at Costco’s stores that have been open at least a year, an important measurement for retailers, rose 3 percent. Much of that growth was from overseas business as the weaker dollar translated to gains when foreign currencies were converted to dollars. This was a significant improvement from the previous quarter, when the figure fell 5 percent. The company said it planned to add 16 to 18 stores in fiscal 2010. Costco, one of the nation’s largest wholesale club operators, has 566 stores worldwide. Shares of Costco rose 10 cents, to $58.76.

This gene marks us as part of a minority that finds nothing at all strange in the act of stockpiling cleaning supplies, say, or else salted cashews or Bayer aspirin in institutional quantities. I recognize that not everyone is as bewitched as I am by a four-pack of Fantastik. The only person I ever met who got a bigger charge than I do out of buying Bounty paper towels in the 12-roll size is a man I once interviewed who ran private sex parties from an East Village loft. When a Kmart opened on Astor Place, this man was close to ecstatic, although I suppose he was ecstatic a lot of the time. Presumably he would be even more charged up to learn that Manhattan’s first ever Costco wholesale club opened last month in East Harlem, thus making our island officially a suburb of Hicksville. As it happens, there was, among the thousands of constantly changing items available last week at Costco, a display of lubricated Trojan condoms in a 40-unit package ($9.99). And so, for all I know, that sex-club guy has switched careers and is now doing target marketing for big-box chains. Costco, as most of us are already aware, is a wholesale-warehouse club chain, among the 10 largest retailers in the country and the world. The apparent contradiction in a business being termed simultaneously a wholesale club and a mass retailer is at the heart of the incredible success Costco has enjoyed since its founding in 1983. There are now more than 560 Costco locations in the United States, and what all of them provide is the benefit of buying Sony Bravias, Ecko sweatshirts, Bachman pretzels, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, Spam and Vienna sausages, Uggs and vacuum-packed snack trays priced affordably because they are acquired in bulk. Limited variety and high volume equal savings, the theory goes, and the operative delusion is that a consumer is paying wholesale for what are in fact retail goods exposed to supersizing gamma rays. Scale is the key at Costco, where the shopping carts are the size of a Mini Cooper; where butter is sold in four-pound bricks ($6.59); and where pies (pumpkin, $5.99; apple, $8.99) are the diameter of cartwheels and come in plastic tubs the size of a kiddie pool. A box of Kellogg’s Raisin Bran ($6.89 for 76.5 ounces) is so enormous that, with a little ingenuity, one could add a handle to the empty box and convert it to a carry-on bag. You could, that is, if you think it would fit in the overhead bin. There is an annual fee for induction into the wonderful world of savings and 50-pound bags of rice, a fact I learned when I joined a long line stretching along 117th Street on opening day in mid-November. Laboriously inching along behind an Ellis Island array of New Yorkers yearning to be free of supermarket gouging, I thought that perhaps every single person who had waited the 15 years it took the developer David Blumenfeld to raze the old Washburn Wire factory and replace it with a big-box store was on hand. Still, it was a glorious day for what David Dinkins used to call the gorgeous mosaic. And the palpable excitement on line made it hard to remember why Mr. Blumenfeld’s plan had ever caused so much stir. Two decades ago both the local community board and Jane Jacobs adherents like me had all griped in chorus that the last thing the city needed was a $500 million, 485,000-square-foot shopping complex (Target, Best Buy and Marshalls will join Costco next spring). Weren’t there already plenty of mom-and-pop stores around to rip off New Yorkers for a gallon of milk? Then the Giuliani years happened, and the early Bloomberg ones and pseudo-malls popped up everywhere and major avenues were converted into picnic grounds and the parks became so much surplus square footage to be leased to dreadful seasonal crafts fairs and Times Square was finally scoured of the final vestiges of delirious sleaze and my city, to paraphrase Chrissie Hynde, was finally gone. In the name of bulk buying in a recession-era economy, I accept this. Or I did that day as harried but eager Costco employees working the line instructed me that, by doubling the basic membership charge of $50, I could achieve elite status and thus receive regular mailers containing coupons for extra savings and an elaborately calculated refund at the end of the year. This might make sense if I were Octomom and really needed Huggies in the 500-count box. But I know my limits, and that is crucial when you shop at Costco. Otherwise you may find that, in no time at all, your automobile-size cart is filled with stuff that would barely fit in the automobile it turns out you do not own. I BOUGHT two heavyweight plastic Costco shopping bags suitable for lugging boulders, and was careful to fill them with no more cleaning supplies and Kleenex products than could be hoisted home on the Lexington Avenue bus. Costco, it probably goes without saying, does not deliver (although it does maintain a contract with Discovery cabs, whose drivers meet laden shoppers at the parking garage). Unlike many of my fellow shoppers that day, I forgot to bring a calculator. Unlike Asta Hansen, a shopper whose apartment in upper Manhattan is equidistant from the new East Harlem Costco and the one where she usually shops across the bridge in New Jersey, I had no baseline for price comparisons. (“Nuts are always a bargain,” Ms. Hansen told me. “Nuts and sweat socks.”) Still, by my estimate, and at an ordinary rate of consumption, the supply of Soft Scrub With Bleach Cleanser (four for $9.99) I picked up should carry me through to the end of my days. COSTCO 517 East 117th Street; (212) 896-5873. BIG BOX Costco may not be the first, but it is the biggest big-box store in Manhattan. Next spring, when additional tenants like Target and Marshalls open in the mammoth new East Harlem building, it will be the definitive event in the malling of Manhattan. BIG CHEESE There are savings across the range of consumer goods, Burberry bags to bananas. The best may be on products packaged under the company’s Kirkland label: 2.5 pounds of cashews, for instance, cost $12.49; at a grocery near me, an eight-ounce tub costs $10. Costco’s cheese and meat selections, too, are notably good. And because you can’t walk 20 feet without bumping into a food demonstrator offering free samples, you run no risk of starving as you shop. BIG LETDOWN Depending on one’s view of tube socks and sweat pants (Timberland fleece sweatshirt, $29.99), apparel can be considered the weak link in Costco’s impressive supply chain. Some items are downright scary. On a hang tag attached to a Jona Michelle holiday dress for girls, with a black satin bodice and a metallic miniskirt overlaid with sequins and embroidered vines, are these words: “I’m a Tea Dress.” That is useful to know if you happen to be planning a holiday tea with the ladies from an Albanian bordello.

Drive in East Harlem, has proceeded at a glacial pace. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ruby Washington/The New York Times East River Plaza in East Harlem. A Costco store opens there on Nov. 12, with more stores moving in next spring. Ruby Washington/The New York Times David Blumenfeld began working on the project in the early 1990s. David Blumenfeld, the scion of a Long Island real estate family, first spotted the dormant Washburn wire factory in the early 1990s, while commuting to work in Syosset. To Mr. Blumenfeld, then in his 20s, the site seemed to offer the perfect chance to introduce suburban-style big-box shopping in Manhattan. Nearly two decades later, workers are finally preparing for the Nov. 12 opening of the shopping center’s first tenant: a 110,000-square-foot Costco wholesale warehouse club, the borough’s first. Target, Best Buy and Marshall’s will start moving in next spring. Of 485,000 square feet, only 30,000 are not yet spoken for. The opening is coming 15 years after the Blumenfeld Development Group, headed by Mr. Blumenfeld’s father, Edward, worked with Canyon Capital Realty Advisers of Beverly Hills, Calif., to buy the six-acre site, which stretches from 116th Street to 119th Street, for $3.1 million at a foreclosure auction. Five years later, the project was approved by the City Council. In 2004, Canyon Capital sold its interest to Forest City Ratner. Many factors contributed to the delay, including a long battle with a cabinetmaker whose shop occupied land needed for a parking structure with 1,248 spaces. (Finally the developers bought his shop and five other properties.) The project was stalled for years over the question of whether public subsidies or shoppers would help defray the costs of the parking garage. Mr. Blumenfeld said the project lost a lot of political muscle when Randy A. Daniels, the state official who had championed it, took a job in the private sector. Mr. Daniels described the delay as a classic example of what is wrong with the development process in New York. “It takes too long to get anything done,” he said. “There are many missed opportunities because of that.” Now 45 and graying at the temples, Mr. Blumenfeld said he never expected the project would consume so many years. “We’ve been to hell and back to get it done,” he said. In the interim, the price tag ballooned to $500 million, partly offset by about $80 million in tax credits and other subsidies. In 1999, the price was estimated as $150 million. One of the largest developments in northern Manhattan in decades, East River Plaza is the most significant commercial development in East Harlem since a Pathmark supermarket opened on Lexington Avenue and 125th Street in 2000. The Target store will be the first to be fully situated in Manhattan (a Target in the Bronx dips its toe into the Marble Hill section of Manhattan). But these days, East River Plaza no longer seems quite so pioneering. Superstores have proliferated in New York City, and some retailers like Home Depot have squeezed into smaller urban spaces, often on multiple floors. As the crime rate fell, retailers stopped shunning poor neighborhoods and developers took advantage of financial incentives. Even stacking large retailers on top of one another is no longer a novelty. One new example is Gateway at Bronx Terminal Market, on 149th Street in the South Bronx, which took just five years to build, though it is twice the size of East River Plaza. Mr. Blumenfeld said the Related Companies, which developed Gateway, got the benefit of his trailblazing, even hiring the same architectural firm, GreenbergFarrow. “Obviously, things went a lot faster for Related,” he said. Related officials have said they were inspired by Dadeland Station, a big-box center in Miami. Mr. Blumenfeld said his first challenge was getting superstores to accept the idea of operating in Manhattan. He said national chains could not imagine that apartment dwellers, especially renters, would shop in their stores. “They all told me I was crazy,” he said. Then, too, there were the logistical problems that big-box retailers do not encounter in the suburbs. How efficiently would the traffic flow through narrow urban streets? How would freight be moved to the higher floors? Eventually, Home Depot and Costco agreed to be anchor tenants. “It took years to get to that point,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. Because of the delays, however, the developers had to redo the leases. The second time, Costco thought it had a deal but the developers decided to lease to Target. But then Home Depot slowed its expansion plans because of the recession and opened a store at Gateway while surrendering its space at East River Plaza to Costco. Jeffrey H. Brotman, the chairman of Costco, said he expected annual sales at the East Harlem store to exceed $2,000 a square foot, about double the average. While some residents living near the project are angry about the prospect of more noise and traffic, most residents are eagerly awaiting its opening, said Robert J. Rodriguez, the chairman of Community Board 11 in East Harlem. “The overwhelming sense in the community is that this has been slated to happen for so long, the community really wants to see the benefits of this project,” he said. Under an agreement with the developers  including such concessions as the installation of double-paneled windows at the developers’ expense, to block out noise for nearby residents  a local nonprofit group is helping Costco recruit workers from the neighborhood and has identified 900 qualified candidates, more than twice the number of available jobs, he said. The project began to pick up speed after Forest City, a partner in the development of the headquarters building of The New York Times Company on Eighth Avenue, became involved. Having a well-connected local partner added strength to the project, Mr. Blumenfeld said. The thorny question of who would pay for the $62.4 million garage was resolved when the tenants finally accepted the notion of paid parking  $4 for two hours, and an additional $9 for a third. As his project nears completion, Mr. Blumenfeld said he was disappointed that the city’s Planning Department had not allowed him to make the center’s brick-and-limestone facade more eye-catching from the highway. “This is one of the first properties you see when you come into Manhattan,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. “It deserves something more iconic.” Under a design commissioned from Kevin Roche, a Pritzer Prize-winning architect, the facade would have been draped in mesh, with an American flag sandblasted onto it. But city officials issued a stop-work order in 2007 after the Planning Department discovered that the facade did not conform to the design that had been approved in 1999, said Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman for the department. Though the flag design was not rejected on aesthetic grounds, “that is not to say that anybody liked it,” she said. Amanda M. Burden, the planning commissioner, was one of three commission members to vote against East River Plaza in 1999. “I don’t think she thought this was the right use for the site,” Mr. Blumenfeld said. Ms. Raynoff said Ms. Burden would not offer an opinion on the shopping center. The developers got a big shock last Dec. 11, when Bernard L. Madoff, the Blumenfelds’ close family friend, was arrested and accused of a multibillion-dollar fraud. Edward Blumenfeld’s personal guarantee for the East River Plaza loan was collateralized by his investment with Mr. Madoff, and Ruth Madoff, Bernard’s wife, made a small investment in the project, David Blumenfeld acknowledged. “It was a terrible day for us,” he said, without further comment. Looking back on his experience at East River Plaza, Mr. Blumenfeld said that developers of complex projects needed a lot of patience. “Ten to 15 years is probably the right time horizon,” he said. “I don’t know if a lot of people have the stomach for that.” An earlier version of this article misstated the name of the architect involved in the development of East River Plaza.

Too often it is. As Michael Moss wrote in The Times recently, E. coli sickens thousands of people annually, including a young dance teacher named Stephanie Smith, who was paralyzed after eating a contaminated hamburger. Her case offers a poignant reminder that President Obama and Congress need to quickly fill the safety gaps in food production. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Meat | Food Safety Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who called Ms. Smith’s case “unacceptable and tragic,” said his department has stepped up inspections of meat facilities and planned to establish new rules to help trace any tainted ground meat more swiftly. There is a lot more to do. Hamburger is no longer a simple patty created by grinding up cuts of beef from one cow. It is a mix of meat and other parts, often from a variety of slaughterhouses around the world. Testing is done in meat-production facilities, but Mr. Moss found troubling instances when slaughterhouses refused to sell their meat to producers or companies that wanted to do extra testing for the particularly dangerous E. coli that paralyzed Ms. Smith. Costco, for example, routinely tests hamburger and other foods as they come into their plant and before they are mixed with products from other suppliers. As a result some hamburger producers refused to sell to Costco for fear it would start a major recall. More companies should follow the best practices used by Costco and others. In the meantime, it should be illegal to discourage such additional safety precautions. So far, Congress and the Department of Agriculture have failed to take that important step. Congress must also give the Agriculture Department more authority to recall foods as needed or to shut down plants that keep sending out contaminated products. And the administration should nominate a strong undersecretary for food safety. That vacancy leaves a huge gap. Already too much of the burden for food safety falls on consumers who are advised to cook hamburgers into shoe leather to kill off any dangerous germs. But even that is not enough because it is too easy for raw ground beef to leave behind toxic traces in the kitchen. Ground beef is a major part of the American diet. Consumers should not have to fear that their hamburger comes with a trip to the nearest emergency room.

Costco, which is based in Issaquah, Wash., and operates 560 warehouse clubs, said it earned $374 million, or 85 cents a share, down from $398 million, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit exceeded the 77 cents forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters and Costco’s stock rose $1.07, or 1.9 percent, to $59 a share. Revenue in the quarter, which ended Aug. 30, slipped 3 percent, to $22.38 billion from $23.1 billion, but surpassed Wall Street’s $22.34 billion estimate. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent in the quarter, with a 6 percent decline in the United States and a 3 percent drop abroad. Removing the effect of the stronger dollar and lower gas prices, sales at stores open at least a year rose 1 percent.

Coli<date>Published: October 7, 2009</date><text>In an expanding effort by the meat industry to make its hamburger safe, officials at the retail giant Costco said Wednesday that they had struck a new accord on testing for the pathogen E. coli. Skip to next paragraph Related E. Coli Path Shows Flaws in Beef Inspection (October 4, 2009) The Lede: Stuff People Find in Food (October 5, 2009) Costco’s food safety director, Craig Wilson, said the company would begin buying beef trimmings for making hamburger from Tyson, one of the largest beef producers, after an agreement reached with Tyson this week that allows Costco to test the trimmings before they are mixed with those from other suppliers. The United States Department of Agriculture has encouraged such testing as a way to make hamburger safer, but some of the largest slaughterhouses have resisted the added scrutiny for fear that one grinder’s discovery of E. coli will lead to expanded recalls of beef sent to other grinders, The New York Times reported Sunday. Costco is one of the few large grinders to test ingredients for the pathogen as they arrive at its plant, and Mr. Wilson said Tyson had declined to sell trimmings to the company, citing its testing. A Tyson spokesman has declined to respond to the accusation, but said that the company did not prohibit grinders from testing and that some of its customers did conduct some of their own testing, beyond the testing that Tyson performs. The report by The Times focused on the hamburger patties that precipitated one of the 16 outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 since 2007, and the injuries suffered by a children’s dance instructor, Stephanie Smith, now 22. While most E. coli victims recover, Ms. Smith developed kidney and brain injuries, and emerged from a coma partly paralyzed. In a statement this week, Cargill, the food giant that made the hamburger eaten by Ms. Smith, said it was committed to continuous improvements in food safety. “Our hearts go out to Ms. Smith and her family, as well as the others whose lives have been so affected by O157:H7,” Cargill said. Like other hamburger grinders, Cargill tests its ground beef for the pathogen only after it mixes trim from multiple suppliers, and Cargill officials told the U.S.D.A. that they could not identify the slaughterhouse that shipped the tainted beef in Ms. Smith’s burger, company and government records showed. Slaughterhouses are viewed as the most likely source of E. coli because the pathogen emerges from fecal matter on hides and in the digestive tracts of cattle. In its statement, Cargill said it required suppliers to test their trim and take other steps that are also effective in preventing contamination. “Over the past 10 years, Cargill has invested $1 billion in ongoing meat science research and new food safety technologies and interventions,” the company added. On Monday, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said the Times report would stimulate the department’s efforts to fight E. coli, which the department banned from ground beef in 1994. “The story we learned about over the weekend is unacceptable and tragic,” Mr. Vilsack said in a statement. He said the U.S.D.A. had already increased inspections and drafted guidelines for industry. But some critics in Congress say the department has an irreconcilable conflict. “The U.S.D.A. is supposed to be protecting public health and at the same time be promoting agricultural products, and my view is that those two things don’t mix,” said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and chairwoman of a House agriculture panel. On the floor of the House, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee, read parts of The Times article on Wednesday and said the lingering pathogens in meat and the industry’s use of antibiotics were threatening to harm exports of beef to Europe. “We’ve got to get people to understand what’s going on here,” said Ms. Slaughter, who is also a microbiologist.

The aches and cramping were tolerable that first day, and she finished her classes.Then her diarrhea turned bloody. Her kidneys shut down. Seizures knocked her unconscious. The convulsions grew so relentless that doctors had to put her in a coma for nine weeks. When she emerged, she could no longer walk. The affliction had ravaged her nervous system and left her paralyzed. Ms. Smith, 22, was found to have a severe form of food-borne illness caused by E. coli, which Minnesota officials traced to the hamburger that her mother had grilled for their Sunday dinner in early fall 2007. “I ask myself every day, ‘Why me?’ and ‘Why from a hamburger?’ ”Ms. Smith said. In the simplest terms, she ran out of luck in a food-safety game of chance whose rules and risks are not widely known. Meat companies and grocers have been barred from selling ground beef tainted by the virulent strain of E. coli known as O157:H7 since 1994, after an outbreak at Jack in the Box restaurants left four children dead. Yet tens of thousands of people are still sickened annually by this pathogen, federal health officials estimate, with hamburger being the biggest culprit. Ground beef has been blamed for 16 outbreaks in the last three years alone, including the one that left Ms. Smith paralyzed from the waist down. This summer, contamination led to the recall of beef from nearly 3,000 grocers in 41 states. Ms. Smith’s reaction to the virulent strain of E. coli was extreme, but tracing the story of her burger, through interviews and government and corporate records obtained by The New York Times, shows why eating ground beef is still a gamble. Neither the system meant to make the meat safe, nor the meat itself, is what consumers have been led to believe. Ground beef is usually not simply a chunk of meat run through a grinder. Instead, records and interviews show, a single portion of hamburger meat is often an amalgam of various grades of meat from different parts of cows and even from different slaughterhouses. These cuts of meat are particularly vulnerable to E. coli contamination, food experts and officials say. Despite this, there is no federal requirement for grinders to test their ingredients for the pathogen. The frozen hamburgers that the Smiths ate, which were made by the food giant Cargill, were labeled “American Chef’s Selection Angus Beef Patties.” Yet confidential grinding logs and other Cargill records show that the hamburgers were made from a mix of slaughterhouse trimmings and a mash-like product derived from scraps that were ground together at a plant in Wisconsin. The ingredients came from slaughterhouses in Nebraska, Texas and Uruguay, and from a South Dakota company that processes fatty trimmings and treats them with ammonia to kill bacteria. Using a combination of sources — a practice followed by most large producers of fresh and packaged hamburger — allowed Cargill to spend about 25 percent less than it would have for cuts of whole meat. Those low-grade ingredients are cut from areas of the cow that are more likely to have had contact with feces, which carries E. coli, industry research shows. Yet Cargill, like most meat companies, relies on its suppliers to check for the bacteria and does its own testing only after the ingredients are ground together. The United States Department of Agriculture, which allows grinders to devise their own safety plans, has encouraged them to test ingredients first as a way of increasing the chance of finding contamination. Unwritten agreements between some companies appear to stand in the way of ingredient testing. Many big slaughterhouses will sell only to grinders who agree not to test their shipments for E. coli, according to officials at two large grinding companies. Slaughterhouses fear that one grinder’s discovery of E. coli will set off a recall of ingredients they sold to others. “Ground beef is not a completely safe product,” said Dr. Jeffrey Bender, a food safety expert at the University of Minnesota who helped develop systems for tracing E. coli contamination. He said that while outbreaks had been on the decline, “unfortunately it looks like we are going a bit in the opposite direction.” Food scientists have registered increasing concern about the virulence of this pathogen since only a few stray cells can make someone sick, and they warn that federal guidance to cook meat thoroughly and to wash up afterward is not sufficient. A test by The Times found that the safe handling instructions are not enough to prevent the bacteria from spreading in the kitchen. Cargill, whose $116.6 billion in revenues last year made it the country’s largest private company, declined requests to interview company officials or visit its facilities. “Cargill is not in a position to answer your specific questions, other than to state that we are committed to continuous improvement in the area of food safety,” the company said, citing continuing litigation.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/07/business/economy/07shop.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Retailers Suffered Listless Sales in July<date>Correction: August 11, 2009Published: August 6, 2009</date><text>Retailers had a case of the summer doldrums in July and now face a crucial but uncertain back-to-school season, according to July sales figures released on Thursday. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in July Add to Portfolio Costco Wholesale Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Large retailers reported an overall decline in sales for July as consumers, worried about the economy and their jobs, stuck with essential purchases. The slow spending, analysts said, was compounded by lean inventories that left clearance racks, usually a reliable source of midsummer sales, thinner than usual. Fearing low traffic, “a number of retailers ordered less and moved the merchandise out earlier than usual,” said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. “Good for margins; bad for sales.” Analysts said that the postponement of state tax holidays from July to August and the federal “cash for clunkers” program might have contributed to the slower sales. In the retail sector over all, sales slid 5.1 percent in July from June, according to Thomson Reuters, the 11th consecutive month of declines and the longest losing streak since 2000. The largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores, no longer reports monthly sales. The July data “doesn’t bode particularly well heading back into the all-important back-to-school season,” said Ken Perkins of the consulting firm Retail Metrics. “The entire retailing space is a little worried here.” The back-to-school period is traditionally a critical phase of the retail business cycle. For many stores, August is only second to the year-end holiday season in determining how they fare over all in a given fiscal year. ShopperTrak, a company that tracks shopping patterns, projected that the total foot traffic in retail stores during the coming season would fall 10 percent as shoppers focused on necessary purchases and targeted sales. The government’s unemployment report, to be released on Friday, could offer an indication of the challenge retailers may face in the month ahead. The jobless rate, now 9.5 percent, is expected to rise. Another indicator came earlier this month, when the government reported that consumer spending, which drives the economy, declined 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Furthermore, Mr. Perkins added, the “cash for clunkers” auto purchase program might have begun to divert household discretionary income to car dealers. “If you’re adding another $400-a-month car payment, that’s pulling money away.” At a glance, the sales declines in July were most severe among luxury destinations, while discounters were better cushioned. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted the biggest decline of any chain, plummeting 28 percent, close to analysts’ forecasts. Its competitor, Aéropostale, gained 6 percent but fell well short of expectations. Gap Inc., which operates the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, had an 8 percent decline, slightly less than analysts expected. T.J. Maxx, and Ross Stores each beat forecasts with 4 percent gains. T.J. Maxx's parent company, TJX, also raised its second-quarter profit outlook. On the whole, department stores fared poorly but did slightly better than the pessimistic forecasts by analysts. J. C. Penney and Macy’s both missed expectations, with Macy’s sales dropping 10.7 percent and Penney’s falling by 12.3 percent. Luxury stores, though, were harder hit: Saks fell by 16.3 percent; Neiman Marcus, 27.3 percent; and Nordstrom, 6.9 percent. Some good news was that demand for basic goods and discounters seemed to hold steady. Costco, the discount warehouse, reported a 2 percent drop. In its recorded message, Costco said food  including deli, candy and frozen food  was strong. While it said discretionary sectors were weak, it noted some improvement in apparel for men and women, sporting goods and small appliances. Target posted a 6.5 percent drop, worse than the 5.8 percent expected by analysts. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 11, 2009 Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about quarterly earnings for several retailers misstated the corporate standing of one retailer, Ross Stores. An off-price retailer, Ross Stores is a public company based in California; it has no connection with TJX, which is the parent company of another off-price retailer, T.J. Maxx.

Costco has been one of the more resilient retailers during the recession as shoppers came to its membership clubs for deals on food and everyday items. But Costco said Thursday that its total sales slid during the quarter because of the stronger dollar’s impact on foreign sales and a continued slump in spending on higher-ticket discretionary items like jewelry. Costco said it earned $209.6 million, or 48 cents a share, in the quarter, down from $295.1 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Included in those results was a $34 million charge related to a settlement of a class-action lawsuit over its membership renewal policy. Increased employee health care costs also weighed on its quarterly performance. Revenue in the period, which ended May 10 and was the third quarter of Costco’s fiscal year, fell 5 percent, to $15.81 billion from $16.61 billion.

The company will be eligible for millions of dollars in tax credits for creating new jobs. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Jim Dwyer But there’s one kind of government money Costco won’t take: food stamps. That policy effectively cuts off more than 30,000 of its immediate neighbors in East Harlem, who receive food stamps. Throughout the city, 1.4 million people got them in April, an increase of 80 percent since 2002, city officials said. Most of the recipients have jobs, but their wages are so low that they qualify for the food stamps, now issued in the form of debit cards. Even if those neighbors don’t get to shop at the store and take advantage of bulk food purchases, they will have plenty of chances to see  and hear  a critical part of the company’s warehouse operations: Costco just won special permission for its tractor-trailers to drive on residential streets in East Harlem between midnight and 5 a.m. to make deliveries. “You’re moving to a neighborhood with thousands of people on food stamps, and you don’t accept food stamps, and you want to drive on their streets all night to deliver something they can’t buy?” said Viveca Diaz, an East Harlem resident who has objected to the delivery schedule. So far, executives of Costco have made no public statements about why its stores  with the exception of one in Puerto Rico  will not take food stamps. They did not reply to four requests for comment. Many other big chains, including Wal-Mart, Whole Foods, B.J.’s and Sam’s Club, do take them. Costco’s policy is the target of a campaign by public officials, including City Councilman Eric Gioia, and the public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum. Mr. Gioia said that he had written to Costco over the last two years about the policy, and that company executives had responded to him by phone, but never in writing. Their reasons, he said, vary. “One of the reasons is that it would cost too much to modify their equipment,” he said. “That doesn’t make much sense, because the state provides the equipment free of charge.” The company raised other concerns, he said, like whether people on food stamps would be able to afford the $50 annual membership fee. “Being able to shop in bulk is a huge benefit,” said Matthew Washington, a member of Community Board 11, which covers East Harlem. “People will figure out a way.” Costco is moving into the site of the old Washburn Wire factory, which shut down decades ago, and is being developed as East River Plaza by a partnership of Forest City Ratner Companies and the Blumenfeld Development Group. The project received a $15 million economic development grant, and the city’s Industrial Development Authority issued $40 million in tax-free bonds to pay for a parking garage. The bonds will be paid back by the developer, but the lost tax revenue amounts to $10 million, according to the city’s Independent Budget Office. In March, the developers asked the community board to allow Costco to make the late-night deliveries. The board agreed after the developer offered to install double-paned glass and air conditioning in apartments along the route. Costco will supply 2,000 free memberships through a lottery. AS for food stamps, Mr. Washington said he urged the other members of the community board not to grant the delivery permits unless Costco changed its rules, but the developers said the company would not budge. “Costco never came in front of the community and the community board,” said Mr. Washington, who did not vote for the delivery permit but said the company would be an important presence in East Harlem. “Remember that there will be 400 new jobs, and over 85 percent of their employees receive health care, and the average employee is paid more than $18 an hour. These are things you just don’t hear of in retailing.” Costco should not turn away food stamp business, Mr. Gioia says, noting that the city pension funds hold about $65 million of the company’s stock. Ms. Diaz detected an air of elitism in the rules. “They were saying at one point they don’t have the technology,” she said. “Very interesting. The corner bodega takes food stamps, and Costco doesn’t?” E-mail:Dwyer@nytimes.com More Articles in New York Region » A version of this article appeared in print on May 13, 2009, on page A24 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/nyregion/22translate.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Pharmacies Agree to Provide Prescription Data in Many Languages<date>Published: April 22, 2009</date><text>In a deal that underscores the challenges and obligations of doing business in polyglot New York State, five major chains that sell prescription drugs have agreed to provide customers with information about them in the customers’ primary languages, the office of Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Tuesday. The agreements stem from a lengthy investigation by Mr. Cuomo’s office that found that pharmacies across the state, in violation of the law and at great risk to customers, routinely failed to provide information about medication in a language their immigrant customers could understand, officials said. “The need to understand prescription information can literally be a matter of life and death,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. For those New Yorkers who do not speak English as a first language, he said, “this agreement will ensure they have the medical information needed to protect their health and well-being and that of their families.” State law requires that pharmacists personally provide to patients spoken and written information about the dosage, purpose and side effects of prescription drugs, officials said. The law also prohibits pharmacies from discriminating against non-English speakers. Complying with the law has become an increasing challenge for pharmacies in a state where the foreign-born population has grown to 4.1 million, or 21.3 percent of the total population in 2007, up from 3.8 million in 2000, or about 20.1 percent of the total population then. According to census data, about 3 in 10 residents of New York State, and about half of the residents of New York City, speak a language other than English at home. There are an estimated 170 languages spoken in the state. The agreement announced Tuesday involves Wal-Mart; Target; A.&amp;P., which operates Pathmark, Super Fresh, and Food Emporium among other stores; Costco; and Duane Reade, the largest pharmacy chain in New York City. Under the agreement, the retailers will equip their dispensaries with telephones that will connect customers with off-site interpreters working for language-service contractors. Some stores plan to provide dual handsets to allow pharmacists and customers to confer jointly with the interpreters, Mylan L. Denerstein, executive deputy attorney general for social justice, said at a news conference in Brooklyn announcing the agreement. Ms. Denerstein said that customers at the five companies’ pharmacies will have access to interpreting services in more than 150 languages. In addition, the retailers have agreed to provide written information about the medication they sell in five of the main foreign languages spoken in New York: Spanish, Chinese, Italian, Russian, and French. Ms. Denerstein said the agreement was “a major undertaking” for the stores. In a statement, Duane Reade said, “We applaud the attorney general’s efforts to upgrade prescription-translation services,” and noted that the company currently provides language translation services in 13 languages as well as telephone interpreting for more than 170 languages. Last November, under pressure from Mr. Cuomo’s office, two other major pharmacy chains, CVS and Rite Aid, reached similar agreements. The investigation began with a complaint filed in 2007 by a group of immigrant-advocates’ organizations, led by Make the Road New York, which works primarily with Latino immigrants in New York City. “Over the past two decades, New York has undergone a major demographic shift,” the group’s co-executive director, Andrew Friedman, said at the news conference. “Literally millions of New Yorkers are in the process of learning English.” While the state and New York City have tried to adjust to the increasing linguistic demands by providing services in an increasing array of languages, he said, “most New York State pharmacies have been lagging far behind.” In an interview, Mr. Friedman said that the initial complaint to Mr. Cuomo’s office involved more than 20 customers who claimed they had not been able to communicate with pharmacists and could not read the written material provided to them. Most of the customers were Spanish speakers, he said. One woman, he recalled, had been giving her child a medication by mouth, “and her kid kept throwing up.” She turned to Make The Road, which determined that the medicine was a topical drug. “We figured that if pharmacies were doing this badly in Spanish, they were doing significantly worse with other languages,” he said.

(AP)  The warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corporation reported nearly flat quarterly profit Thursday, citing the stronger dollar and cuts by consumers in spending on nonessentials. Profit for Costco’s first fiscal quarter, which ended Nov. 23, was $262.5 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $262 million, or 59 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. The results include charges of 5 cents a share related to an accounting adjustment stemming from life insurance contracts and a write-down on corporate investments. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $16.39 billion, from $15.81 billion. Costco said consumers pulled back on spending on nearly all items outside of food, especially in the later part of the quarter, despite more aggressive pricing. “I think people’s habits have changed,” said Richard Galanti, Costco’s chief financial officer. The only exception in the trend away from nonfood items was an increase in television sales in November, when excess inventory at some vendors allowed Costco to lower prices. Sales at stores open at least one year rose 1 percent, including a 3 percent gain in the United States and a 7 percent decline internationally. Shares of Costco, which is based in Issaquah, fell $1.64, to $52.06.

Some retailers reported strong Thanksgiving weekend sales. For many chains, the precipitous sales drops that took hold in September and October got worse, not better, in November, despite relatively strong sales in the few days after Thanksgiving. The International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry group, described November’s figures as the weakest in more than 35 years. Declines were recorded in every retail segment the group tracks, with the biggest coming from department stores, with sales down 13.3 percent compared with November a year ago, and specialty apparel retailers, down 10.4 percent. Some retailers, though, have begun to figure out how to manage in the bleak environment, selling huge amounts of merchandise at steep discounts to generate cash. That will erode profits, of course. Department store profits will most likely plummet 20 to 60 percent in the final three months of the year, said Bill Dreher, senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. But retailers who are unloading merchandise early in the season are at least demonstrating an ability to take control. “Even if they’re giving away the product, it reduces inventory levels and keeps the problem from continuing,” Mr. Dreher said. “It shows retailers are being disciplined.” Retail stocks rallied Thursday as investors interpreted the sales report as showing that, with sufficient discounts, goods can be sold in volume despite the poor economy. The Standard &amp; Poor’s retail index rose 1.5 percent. The discounts being dangled by stores are the biggest retailing analysts have ever seen. “When did you ever see, on Dec. 1, 70 percent off apparel on the high end?” said Claire Gruppo, managing director of Gruppo, Levey &amp; Company, a New York investment bank. “You just don’t.” Any retailer that refused to trot out jaw-dropping bargains in November paid the price. For example, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the chain that uses sexy bodies in seductive poses to sell clothes to teenagers and young adults, has refused to get on the discount bandwagon. In November, sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail health, fell a whopping 28 percent for the company, in contrast to a 2 percent increase for the period a year ago. That is a far worse decline than previous months: Sales at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch stores open at least a year were down 14 percent in September and 20 percent in October. Saks, on the other hand, has driven consumers into shopping frenzies with eye-popping deals on luxury names like the Armani Collezioni and Zac Posen. The tactic worked: In November, Saks had only a 5.2 percent decline in sales at stores open at least a year, clawing its way up from months of double-digit declines. Other stores that improved their lot in November took a page from the same playbook. Neiman Marcus, for example, has also been selling luxury goods at startling discounts. Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year fell 11.8 percent in November  better than the 15.8 percent drop in September and the 27.6 percent dive in October. “If you don’t understand the consumer and his mood right now and you’re doing things as usual,” said Walter Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a consultant firm, “you’re not going to get any business.” Stunning declines have become the norm in retailing since sales first plunged in September amid the financial crisis. The November figures indicate the downturn is migrating to some discount and warehouse stores, some of which even had sales growth in October. Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm, said either Wal-Mart Stores was stealing market share from its bargain competitors or the whole sector was softening. At Target, sales at stores open at least a year tumbled 10.4 percent, in contrast to a 10.8 percent increase a year ago. Sales at Target were down 3 percent in September and 4.8 percent in October. Sales at Kohl’s stores open at least a year sank 17.5 percent, in contrast to a 10.2 percent increase last year. Sales at Kohl’s stores dropped 5.5 percent in September and 9 percent in October. Sales at Costco were down 5 percent in November after a 7 percent increase in September and a 1 percent dip in October. Even some stores with October sales increases lost their edge in November. Children’s Place, which had a 4 percent sales increase in October, sank 7 percent in November. Aéropostale, which was up 1 percent in October, was down 5 percent in November. Of all the major retailers, only Wal-Mart and BJ’s Wholesale Club, two of the country’s best-known discount chains, thrived, in part because of robust grocery sales. Wal-Mart, in fact, enjoyed the biggest grocery sales spike in its history. With new lines of brand-name merchandise from makers like Sony and Samsung, and with rock-bottom prices and an ability to move high volumes of merchandise, Wal-Mart seems to have cornered the market on Christmas this year. The company began the critical holiday season by exceeding expectations. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 3.4 percent in November, not including fuel, compared with a 1.5 percent increase a year ago. (The company made a point of being subdued in its sales announcement, noting its sadness that a worker, Jdimytai Damour, had been trampled to death at a Wal-Mart in Valley Stream, N.Y., when rowdy shoppers burst through the doors on Black Friday.) Sales at BJ’s Wholesale Club stores were up 4.1 percent in November, not including fuel, compared with a 7.7 percent increase a year ago. Many retailers were buoyed by sales over Black Friday weekend, which increased about 0.9 percent, compared with a 6.5 percent increase last year, according to ShopperTrak, a research firm. Yet the weekend after Thanksgiving did not account for the majority of retailers’ November sales. Results for the month were weakened, many people in retailing said, by the calendar  a later Thanksgiving this year meant fewer post-Thanksgiving shopping days in November. “The Thanksgiving weekend improvement was not enough to significantly alter the month’s outcome,” Linda M. Farthing, president and chief executive of Stein Mart, said in a statement on Thursday. “We expect to continue aggressive promotional activity through the remainder of the year.” It was a plan echoed on Thursday by other retailers, like American Eagle Outfitters and Kohl’s. John D. Morris, an analyst with Wachovia whose Holiday Sale Rack Index tracks promotions at specialty mall retailers, said discounts were up 12 percent compared with last year. That may not sound like much, but it is the biggest jump in the decade-long history of the index. Usually, a big promotional period sends the index up 5 percent. “It’s a terrible story for retailers and their margins,” said Michael Unger, a principal with Archstone Consulting. “But if you’re a consumer looking for a good deal, you will find it.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 5, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E3DD1738F93AA35753C1A96E9C8B63&amp;ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Retailers' Sales Fall Sharply At Both High End and Low<date>Published: October 9, 2008</date><text>Sales at some of the nation's best-known retailers fell by double digits in September, highlighting the rapid deterioration of the economy and raising fresh questions about how many of those chains can survive. Retail analysts and executives said they had not seen such a rapid slowdown in consumer spending since the nation's last deep recession, in the early 1980s. Retail executives, though braced for bad news, were stunned at the magnitude of the drop-offs reported on Wednesday. Retailers high and low -- like Nordstrom, J. C. Penney and Kohl's -- lowered their earnings projections. September sales for stores open at least a year, known as same-store sales, a barometer of retail health, plunged 14.8 percent at Stein Mart, an off-price department store. That chain, like many others, was already in trouble a year ago, but the drop-off last September was only 9.1 percent. Sales at Dillard's dropped 12 percent, compared with a 7 percent decline last year. J. C. Penney's same-store sales fell 12.4 percent, compared with a decline of 3.7 percent for the period a year ago. Sales at Kohl's decreased 5.5 percent, compared with a 3.2 percent decrease last year. At Bon-Ton Stores, same-store sales decreased 4.6 percent, and they declined 3 percent at Target. The sales results laid to rest any lingering notion that the nation's luxury retailers might be impervious to the downturn. Same-store sales in the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus Stores and Bergdorf Goodman, tumbled 15.8 percent. Saks's same-store sales sank 10.9 percent and Nordstrom's were down 9.6 percent. Blake W. Nordstrom, president of Nordstrom, said the deteriorating consumer environment led to ''a weakening sales trend that was greater than our earlier expectations.'' Specialty retail sales figures, too, were soft. At Zumiez, same-store sales were down 9 percent compared with a 13.9 percent increase in the year-earlier period. Same-store sales at Wet Seal were down 7.5 percent. Sales at American Eagle Outfitters and Limited Brands decreased 6 percent. At Pacific Sunwear, sales were down 5 percent, while Children's Place fared slightly better. Its sales were flat compared with a 2 percent decrease last year. The exception in this category was Aeropostale, which reported a 5 percent increase in same-store sales compared with a 1 percent increase in the year-earlier period. Dean Hillier, a partner and a retail specialist with A. T. Kearney, a management consultant, said the Christmas shopping season ''could quite frankly be one of the worst we've seen in 25 years.'' It might be a holiday of movie tickets and board games, he said, not of big-screen televisions and vacations. ''This is the cocooning that we saw in the '80s, for goodness sakes, that we're seeing coming back,'' he said. Sales drops of 5 or 10 percent might not sound like the end of the world. But because store chains have fixed costs, declines that large can devastate their profits and discourage banks from offering the financing necessary to run such a seasonal business. Most of the chains will report their third-quarter profits in October and November. Some analysts are expecting a fresh wave of bankruptcies among store chains after the holidays. Already, famous names like the Sharper Image and CompUSA have gone out of business. Share prices of most leading retailers, which have been declining for many months, fell by 2 to 5 percent on Wednesday. Shares of Circuit City Stores, the struggling electronics chain, fell 18 percent, to 41 cents a share, down from $9.02 a year ago. That chain said on Sept. 29 that same-store sales for three months ending in August fell 13.3 percent. In general, the weakest categories in Wednesday's report were nonessentials like housewares, furniture, electronics, jewelry and women's apparel. To the extent stores showed any strength, it was in must-have categories like food and children's clothing. ''Even the über-wealthy are slowing down,'' said Bill Dreher, an analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. ''It's going to be a discount-store Christmas.''</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/09costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Basics Push Up Profit at Costco<date>Published: October 8, 2008</date><text>The warehouse-club operator Costco Wholesale Corporation said Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 7 percent as consumers shopped for bargains in the tough economy. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Costco Wholesale Corporation Go to your Portfolio » Demand was strong for necessities like food and sundries but shoppers shied away from big-ticket items like furniture and jewelry, the company said. Costco said net income rose to $397.8 million, or 90 cents a share, from $372.4 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, net income was 97 cents a share for the quarter.

The number of people visiting such stores grew three times as fast the adult population of the United States, according to figures recently released by Mediamark Research, a market research company, which asked about 26,000 adults whether they had visited a club store within the preceding six months. Skip to next paragraph Much of the growth came from high-income households, whose members may be finding bargain prices more attractive amid the lingering economic downturn. Club stores had an 11.9 percent jump in shoppers with household incomes above $75,000, who now make up just under half of their visitors, according to the Mediamark figures. “My guess is that lower-income people were already shopping at club stores, and the economy has made people who are more affluent shop there, too,” said Kathi Love, the president of Mediamark.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in August Add to Portfolio Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » As merchants announced their August sales results, Wal-Mart Stores, the world’s largest retailer, reported a solid gain that beat Wall Street forecasts, as consumers stuck to low-price operators. Mall-based apparel stores, including merchants like Wet Seal and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, remained in the doldrums. And the high-end retailers Saks and Nordstrom posted weaker results as their affluent customers started to feel pinched. “Consumers are spending on necessities and looking for value and the lowest price possible,” Ken Perkins, president of the research company RetailMetrics, said. “And it’s reflective again in the results that we are seeing.” A report from the Labor Department offered more evidence that the slowing economy was taking its toll on the job market, a bad sign for consumer spending. The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits jumped unexpectedly last week, reversing three weeks of declines. The reports are not comforting to the retail industry as it prepares for the holiday season. Many merchants entered the fall season with inventories well below a year ago, but such reductions might not have been enough as last month proved to be even weaker than planned. Dan Hess, founder and chief executive of the research firm Merchant Forecast, estimated that discounts were 10 percent deeper at mall-based apparel stores than a year ago, despite a drop of 10 to 15 percent in inventories. One encouraging piece of news is that Hurricane Gustav, which hit the Gulf Coast on Monday, was not as bad as analysts had feared. But retailers are now getting ready for the next series of tropical storms, including Hanna, which could become a hurricane by the time it makes landfall in the United States on Saturday. Wal-Mart reported a 3 percent gain in same-store sales, helped by sales of groceries and back-to-school products. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected a 1.6 percent increase. Including fuel, the retailer’s sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.5 percent. “The underlying business performance for Wal-Mart U.S. continued to show strength, and the improved relative performance has resulted in market share gains,” Eduardo Castro-Wright, the president and chief executive of Wal-Mart’s American stores, said in a statement. Wal-Mart expects same-store sales to rise 2 to 3 percent in the current month. At a Wal-Mart rival, the Target Corporation, same-store sales fell 2.1 percent, though that was better than the 2.6 percent decline that Wall Street had expected. The discount retailer has not fared as well as Wal-Mart in the weak economy, as Target heavily emphasizes nonessentials like home furnishings and stylish jeans. Another bright spot is warehouse club operators as shoppers buy in bulk. The Costco Wholesale Corporation announced a 9 percent same-store sales increase in August on Wednesday as higher gas prices lifted sales. Analysts had expected a 9.6 percent gain. Excluding the effect of higher gas prices, Costco’s same-store sales rose 6 percent. Among luxury department stores, Saks recorded a 5.9 percent decline in same-store sales, steeper than the 4.7 percent that Wall Street had expected. The weakest categories were women’s apparel, women’s shoes and intimate apparel, while the strongest categories were fashion jewelry, fragrances, men’s sportswear and men’s shoes. Nordstrom recorded a 7.9 percent drop in sales, a bit worse than the 7.1 percent decline expected. On Wednesday, J. C. Penney announced that same-store sales at its department store business dropped 4.9 percent, slightly better than the 6.3 percent drop that analysts had projected. Penney also predicted a mid- to high-single digit decrease in sales for the current month. Kohl’s announced a 5.8 percent drop on Wednesday, though the decline was not as steep as the 7.6 percent expected by analysts.

Skip to next paragraph The company also said it would expand its stock repurchase plan by $1 billion. For the fourth quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Financial expect $1 a share in profit, and Costco said it expected earnings “well below” this estimate. Analysts expect full-year earnings of $2.99 a share, according to Thomson. “Factors negatively affecting our fourth quarter earnings outlook arise largely from inflation, particularly as to energy costs,” the chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, said in a statement. The outlook reflects weakness in the company’s gasoline operations and slightly lower-than-planned merchandise profits as the company holds back on price increases to drive sales. Mr. Galanti also said a greater-than-anticipated LIFO charge, which refers to the last-in-first-out method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first. During times of rising prices, that results in a charge that eliminates inflationary profits from net income. The company also said its board expanded its buyback plan by up to $1 billion, which is in addition to the $5.8 billion already authorized, and it declared a quarterly cash dividend of 16 cents, payable on Aug. 22 to shareholders of record on Aug. 8. The company will report results on Oct. 8.

A Milk Jug for a Green Earth'' (front page, June 30): I applaud the efforts on the part of big-box retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco to offer more earth-friendly packaging of food products. But if Americans are having trouble figuring out how to pour from a newfangled milk jug that is better for the environment, and complaining about it to boot, what are we to expect when further green innovations come along that force us to adapt? A greener world means modifying our habits, even something as mundane as buying and pouring milk. Katy Crossley-Frolick Gahanna, Ohio, June 30, 2008 To the Editor: Regarding your article about the new design of milk jugs, I, too, had a number of spills using the new design until my 8-year-old son, Sam, pointed out the solution. Instead of pouring the milk forward from the opening, if you simply pour the milk to either side, it will pour out cleanly with no mess. David Ehrlich Springfield, N.J., June 30, 2008 To the Editor: Designing ''green'' is a laudable goal. Designing to ''serve the user'' or ''ergonomically'' is also a laudable goal. As the baby boomers age, they will need usable packaging that takes into account changes that may come with aging, such as arthritic joints, vision changes, weakness and/or neurological changes that may result from diabetes, stroke or other conditions. Saving labor costs, fuel and water in the packaging of products is admirable -- but only if the user can still ''use'' the product. I would hate to think of milk or other food products as ''child'' or ''older adult''-proof. Barbara L. Kornblau Miami, June 30, 2008 The writer is a professor of occupational therapy and public health, Nova Southeastern University. To the Editor: The milk I buy is in a green bottle. It's not a redesign of plastic; it's made of glass. The only waste is the wee bottle cap. I rinse the bottle and bring it back for deposit. There's no cost (or energy expended, save a bit of water to clean it) to recycle it -- it's instead reused. I feel good about myself, and boy, does the milk taste good.

A Milk Jug for a Green Earth<date>Correction: July 2, 2008Published: June 30, 2008</date><text>Correction Appended NORTH CANTON, Ohio  A simple change to the design of the gallon milk jug, adopted by Wal-Mart and Costco, seems made for the times. The jugs are cheaper to ship and better for the environment, the milk is fresher when it arrives in stores, and it costs less. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image David Maxwell for The New York Times Amy Wise, of Ohio, said the gallon jug spilled milk everywhere. Multimedia Audio Slide Show New Milk Jug Leads to Cost Savings and Spills Graphic Efficiency One Gallon at a Time Enlarge This Image David Maxwell for The New York Times Greg Soehnlen, who helps run the company that designed the newfangled jugs, with a pallet at Superior Dairy in Canton, Ohio. What’s not to like? Plenty, as it turns out. The jugs have no real spout, and their unorthodox shape makes consumers feel like novices at the simple task of pouring a glass of milk. “I hate it,” said Lisa DeHoff, a cafe owner shopping in a Sam’s Club here. “It spills everywhere,” said Amy Wise, a homemaker. “It’s very hard for kids to pour,” said Lee Morris, who was shopping for her grandchildren. But retailers are undeterred by the prospect of upended bowls of Cheerios. The new jugs have many advantages from their point of view, and Sam’s Club intends to roll them out broadly, making them more prevalent. The redesign of the gallon milk jug, experts say, is an example of the changes likely to play out in the American economy over the next two decades. In an era of soaring global demand and higher costs for energy and materials, virtually every aspect of the economy needs to be re-examined, they say, and many products must be redesigned for greater efficiency. “This is a key strategy as a path forward,” said Anne Johnson, the director of the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, a project of the nonprofit group GreenBlue. “Re-examining, ‘What are the materials we are using? How are we using them? And where do they go ultimately?’ ” Wal-Mart Stores is already moving down this path. But if the milk jug is any indication, some of the changes will take getting used to on the part of consumers. Many spill milk when first using the new jugs. “When we brought in the new milk, we were asking for feedback,” said Heather Mayo, vice president for merchandising at Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart. “And they’re saying, ‘Why’s it in a square jug? Why’s it different? I want the same milk. What happened to my old milk?’ ” Mary Tilton tried to educate the public a few days ago as she stood at a Sam’s Club in North Canton, about 50 miles south of Cleveland, luring shoppers with chocolate chip cookies and milk as she showed them how to pour from the new jugs. “Just tilt it slowly and pour slowly,” Ms. Tilton said to passing customers as she talked about the jugs’ environmental benefits and cost savings. Instead of picking up the jug, as most people tend to do, she kept it on a table and gently tipped it toward a cup. Mike Compston, who owns a dairy in Yerington, Nev., described the pouring technique in a telephone interview as a “rock-and-pour instead of a lift-and-tip.” Demonstrations are but one of several ways Sam’s Club is advocating the containers. Signs in the aisle laud their cost savings and “better fridge fit.” And some customers have become converts. “With the new refrigerators with the shelf in the door, these fit nice,” said April Buchanan, who was shopping at the Sam’s Club here. Others, even those who rue the day their tried-and-true jugs were replaced, praised the lower cost, from $2.18 to $2.58 a gallon. Sam’s Club said that was a savings of 10 to 20 cents a gallon compared with old jugs. The new jug marks a sharp break with the way dairies and grocers have traditionally produced and stocked milk. Early one recent morning, the creators and producers of the new tall rectangular jugs donned goggles and white coats to walk the noisy, chilly production lines at Superior Dairy in Canton, Ohio. It was founded in 1922 by a man who was forced to abandon the brandy business during Prohibition. Five generations of the founder’s family, the Soehnlens, have worked there. Today, they bottle and ship two different ways. The old way is inefficient and labor-intensive, according to members of the family. The other day, a worker named Dennis Sickafoose was using a long hook to drag plastic crates loaded with jugs of milk onto a conveyor belt. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: July 2, 2008 A chart on Monday with the continuation of a front-page article about a new milk jug design adopted by Wal-Mart and Costco used an incorrect unit of measure.

Skip to next paragraph Related Excerpt: The Shack (June 23, 2008) Mr. Nowak, a maintenance worker near Yakima, Wash., first bought a copy of “The Shack,” a slim paperback novel by an unknown author about a grieving father who meets God in the form of a jolly African-American woman, at a Borders bookstore in March. He was so taken by the story of redemption and God’s love that he promptly bought 10 more copies to give to family and friends. “Everybody that I know has bought at least 10 copies,” Mr. Nowak said. “There’s definitely something about the book that makes people want to share it.” Thousands of readers like Mr. Nowak, a regular churchgoer, have helped propel “The Shack,” written by William P. Young, a former office manager and hotel night clerk in Gresham, Ore., and privately published by a pair of former pastors near Los Angeles, into a surprise best seller. It is the most compelling recent example of how a word-of-mouth phenomenon can explode into a blockbuster when the momentum hits chain bookstores, and the marketing and distribution power of a major commercial publisher is thrown behind it. Just over a year after it was originally published as a paperback, “The Shack” had its debut at No. 1 on the New York Times trade paperback fiction best-seller list on June 8 and has stayed there ever since. It is No. 1 on Borders Group’s trade paperback fiction list, and at Barnes &amp; Noble it has been No. 1 on the trade paperback list since the end of May, outselling even Mr. Tolle’s spiritual guide “A New Earth,” selected by Ms. Winfrey’s book club in January. Its publisher, Windblown Media, a company that was formed expressly to publish “The Shack” in May of last year, estimates that the book has sold more than one million copies. According to Nielsen Bookscan, which usually tracks about 70 percent of sales, the book has sold about 350,000 copies, although those numbers do not include sales at stores like Wal-Mart or direct sales from the publisher’s Web site, theshackbook.com, which may have accounted for an unusually large percentage of the book’s sales. Early in the novel the young daughter of the protagonist, Mack, is abducted. Four years later he visits the shack where evidence of the girl’s murder was discovered. He spends a weekend there in a kind of spiritual therapy session with God, who calls herself “Papa”; Jesus, who appears as a Jewish workman; and Sarayu, an indeterminately Asian woman who incarnates the Holy Spirit. Sales have been fueled partly by a whiff of controversy. Some conservative Christian leaders and bloggers have attacked “The Shack” as heresy. The Rev. R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, devoted most of a radio show to the book, calling it “deeply troubling” and asserting that it undermined orthodox Christianity. Others have said the book’s approach to theology is too breezy to be taken seriously. Brad Cummings, a former pastor and the president of Windblown, said the company, which first shipped books out of his garage, spent about $300 in marketing. Word of the book ripped through the Christian blogosphere, talk radio and pulpits across the country. “People would call back, asking for a dozen or a case,” Mr. Cummings said. Even people initially put off by the book’s characterization of God as a black woman were won over. “I was so stunned by the presentation of Papa that I couldn’t deal with it,” said Bill Ritchie, senior pastor of an 8,000-member nondenominational church in Vancouver, Wash., who recalled putting the book down at first. He eventually finished it and told his congregation that it was “one of the most remarkable books I’ve read in years.” Since early this year, his church has been buying copies to sell to members by the caseload. In May Hachette Book Group USA, a large mainstream publisher, entered into a partnership with Windblown to continue to publish the book. Hachette is now investing heavily to place advertisements on subways in Atlanta, Chicago and New York, as well as running television spots on the CNN airport network and other local stations. Mr. Young, who is known as Paul, said he had written “The Shack” as a gift for his six children.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Retails Sales in May Despite falling consumer confidence and gas prices that teetered around $4 a gallon, retailers said Thursday that same-store sales for May were stronger than expected, touching off a stock market rally that lifted the main indexes nearly 2 percent. Discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores, Costco Wholesale and TJX fared particularly well as price-conscious customers spent federal income tax rebate checks on groceries, gasoline and off-price clothing. Analysts said forecasts for May were especially conservative as retailers braced for disappointing news. There was no telling whether consumers would spend or save their tax rebates as housing prices plunged and the economy weakened. “The rebate checks were going to be a wild card this month, but it certainly looks like they kicked in,” said Ken Perkins, president of the research firm Retail Metrics. “The fear was that high gas prices were going to siphon off most of the stimulus checks into consumers’ gas tanks and, given rising food costs, into their grocery carts.” The indication that consumers were willing to spend was good news for investors, who reversed a largely sluggish week. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 213.97 points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,604.45. The broader Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index gained 26.85 points, or 1.95 percent, to 1,404.05, while the Nasdaq composite index ended up 46.80 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,549.94. Stocks of the retailers helped lead the way. Wal-Mart’s shares jumped 3.7 percent, or $2.12, to $59.80, a four-year high. Shares of Costco, which rose 3.8 percent, to $73.50, and TJX, which rose 2.2 percent, to $32.95, also reached records. For May, Wal-Mart’s same-store sales rose 3.9 percent, excluding fuel, as demand for groceries, flat-panel TVs and computers remained strong. Sales at the company’s namesake stores rose 4 percent, while sales at Sam’s Club outlets were up 3.6 percent. The company attributed the results to its low prices and said sales of home furnishings were up for the first time in more than two years, which Mr. Perkins said might be because consumers were “spending their vacation money on their homes.” Other wholesalers also benefited. Same-store sales at Costco climbed 5 percent, excluding gasoline, compared with an 8 percent increase last May. Comparable sales at BJ’s Wholesale Club rose 6.8 percent, excluding gasoline, in May. “May came in better than expected,” Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group, said in a statement. “It is very clear that consumers are spending in a conservative manner as the lift largely came from an increase in sales in the wholesale, drug store and discount sectors.” Even so, same-store sales at Target fell 0.7 percent, compared with a 5.8 percent increase last May. Analysts said the retailer’s focus on discretionary items like apparel, jewelry and home furnishings had deterred customers shopping for groceries and medication. The demand for discount goods has also affected clothing stores. Off-price retailer TJX reported a 2 percent increase in comparable sales, but sales at higher-end clothing stores lagged behind. Saks, for example, reported an 8.7 percent drop in sales, compared with a 4.5 percent increase last year. The Gap Inc., which owns Banana Republic and Old Navy in addition to its namesake store, said comparable sales tumbled 14 percent. The largest hit came at Old Navy, where sales fell 25 percent. Limited Brands, whose stores include Express, Victoria’s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works, said sales fell 6 percent in May, compared with a 2 percent increase last year, as customers cut back on trips to shopping malls. Mid-tier department stores Kohl’s and J. C. Penney both reported drops in same-store sales. Kohl’s said sales fell 7.2 percent, while Penney attributed its 4.4 percent drop to weakened sales of big-ticket items like fine jewelry and housewares. Nordstrom, which moved the beginning of its semi-annual sale up from June, said sales rose 10.9 percent in May. But the company expects a drop of 18 percent to 22 percent in June. The shopping centers council expects a 2.5 percent to 3 percent increase in same-store sales in June as more consumers receive tax rebates. But analysts said the boost in consumer spending will last only as long as the rebate checks do. “This is a one-time bump that’ll continue into June and maybe July,” Mr. Perkins said. But beyond that, “we just don’t see any near-term stimulus to boost consumer spending anytime soon,” he said.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Retail Sales in April Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, said sales at stores open at least a year climbed 3.2 percent, surpassing its forecast and sending the shares higher. Industry sales increased 3.6 percent, the most since March 2007, the International Council of Shopping Centers said. Consumers facing job losses headed for discounters instead of malls, hurting sales at Gap. Saks sold clothes for as much as 40 percent off to draw shoppers. As customer expenses rise, stores may need to keep up promotions, said C. Britt Beemer, founder of America’s Research Group. “If you didn’t have a sale, you didn’t have customers,” Mr. Beemer said in a telephone interview. “Consumers are having a hard time dealing with inflation in both food and fuel.” Target, the second-largest American discount retailer, said same-store sales rose 3.1 percent, falling short of analysts’ estimates. The company said sales were “slightly below” its plans. Sales at Costco and TJX, the owner of the Marshalls chain, both advanced 8 percent. Nordstrom and J. C. Penney posted declines. Even a luxury retailer like the Neiman Marcus Group reported a 1.9 percent decline in sales. Wal-Mart’s shares rose 33 cents, to $57.16. They have increased 20 percent this year, the biggest gain in the Dow Jones industrial average. Costco dropped 88 cents, to $71.20. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 retailing index fell 1.9 percent. Same-store sales figures are derived from 35 chains and do not include sales of gasoline, the New York-based shopping centers council said. April growth exceeded the group’s estimate of a gain of as much as 2 percent. Sales rose 1.7 percent from February through April. Fifty-five percent of retailers exceeded the estimates compiled by Retail Metrics. Same-store sales are considered the best measure of a retailer’s performance because they exclude locations that have recently opened or closed. Wal-Mart, which reduced prices as much as 30 percent in January, said customers were spending less before their paychecks arrive at the end of the month, signaling that the economy is getting tougher. “I’ve never seen numbers like this,” said Mr. Beemer, who said he believed that the United States had been in a recession since October. “The numbers of consumers a day who are literally putting everything on hold right now and slowing down is incredible.” (The Commerce Department has estimated first-quarter growth at 0.6 percent. A recession, by economists’ definition, is two consecutive quarters of contraction in the economy.) The largest American retail clothing chain, Gap Inc., said same-store sales dropped 6 percent. Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret, fell 5 percent. BJ’s Wholesale Club and the discounter Fred’s each reported sales gains that exceeded analysts’ estimates. TJX and Ross Stores, which sell designer clothes at reduced prices, also exceeded projections. Saks said its sales jumped 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by the acceleration of a spring-season clearance sale, but said that promotions might hurt first-quarter profit. Sears Holdings and Macy’s, the two biggest American department store chains, do not report monthly same-store sales.

Skip to next paragraph Related News Analysis: Fuel Choices, Food Crises and Finger-Pointing (April 15, 2008) The Food Chain: A Drought in Australia, a Global Shortage of Rice (April 17, 2008) Sam’s Club is a division of Wal-Mart Stores, but the broader chain has no plans to limit food purchases. American rice futures are hitting record highs amid global food inflation, although one rice expert said the warehouse chains might be reacting less to any shortages than to stockpiling by restaurants and small stores. Sam’s Club declined to say if this was the first time it had restricted sales of bulk foods. The limits affect 20-pound bags, not retail-size portions. Costco could not immediately be reached for comment on its limits, which affect bulk purchases in some stores. Sam’s Club said it would limit customers to four bags at a time of imported jasmine, basmati and long-grain white rice. A Sam’s Club spokeswoman, Kristy Reed, said she could not comment on whether the problem had been caused by short supplies or by customers stocking up in anticipation of higher prices. A USA Rice Federation spokesman, David Coia, said there was no rice shortage in the United States. A smaller chain, BJ’s Wholesale Club, said it was not imposing limits for now.

She first contracted the disease three years earlier and suffered through seven months of chemotherapy. After her cancer came back, her husband walked out on her. “He told me he wasn’t sexually attracted to me anymore,” she said. Skip to next paragraph Related Chapter One: Worked Over and Overworked (April 20, 2008) Times Topics: Fedex Corporation Add to Portfolio FedEx Corp Go to your Portfolio » Enlarge This Image Monica Almeida/The New York Times Patagonias headquarters in Ventura, Calif., has storage space for surfboards so employees can take a break and hit the waves. For more than a decade, Jean and her husband had been a truck-driving team, driving hazardous waste. Now, with husband and truck gone, her career as a long-haul driver was gone as well. After she recovered, Jean started looking for work. She spotted a help-wanted ad from Roadway Package Systems, which said it was looking for independent contractors to deliver packages. “I needed a job,” said Jean. “They tell you, ‘You’ll make all this money working for yourself.’ ” She soon discovered that her new employer had embraced a controversial strategy to squeeze down costs by millions of dollars each year: it insisted that Jean and the other drivers were independent contractors, not employees. The I.R.S., New York and many other states are investigating this strategy, convinced that many companies use it to cheat their workers and cheat on taxes. Jean arrived at the Roadway terminal in Brockton, Mass., at 6 each morning and spent the next 90 minutes loading 100 to 140 packages into her truck. She usually left the terminal around 7:30 a.m. and returned after 6 p.m. Jean had to leave her job for two years when she suffered a severe back injury while lifting a package. Before she could return to work, FedEx Ground, which had acquired Roadway, required her to to have a truck that met its specifications. The list price was $37,800, with Jean having to make 60 monthly installments of $781.12 and a final, one-time payment of $8,000. In Jean’s view, it was ludicrous for Roadway and FedEx to call the drivers independent contractors. “We’re told what to do, when to do it, how to do it, when to take time off,” Jean said. “You have to wear their uniform. You can’t wear your hair certain ways. You have to deliver every single thing they put on the truck.” Jean called it “a great deal for FedEx. They don’t have to pay for trucks, for the insurance, for fuel, for maintenance, for tires,” she said. “We have to pay for all those things. And they don’t have to pay our Social Security.” By some estimates, this arrangement saves FedEx $400 million a year, giving it a significant cost advantage over U.P.S., which treats its drivers as regular employees. Moreover, FedEx Ground has sought to rebuff a Teamster organizing drive by arguing that its 15,000 drivers have no right to unionize because they are independent contractors. “These drivers are more like business people,” said Perry Colosimo, a FedEx Ground spokesman. “They can set their own hours. They can buy routes. They can develop their business.” In 30 lawsuits, FedEx Ground drivers have argued that they are employees, not independent contractors, and that the company should therefore pay for their trucks, insurance, repairs, gas and tires. In one lawsuit, a California judge ruled that FedEx Ground was engaged in an elaborate ruse in which FedEx “has close to absolute control” over the drivers. Last December, FedEx acknowledged another setback: the I.R.S. assessed it $319 million in taxes and penalties for 2002 for misclassifying employees as independent contractors. FedEx could face similar I.R.S. penalties for subsequent years. FedEx said it would appeal. To attract drivers, FedEx Ground often runs ads claiming that its drivers earn $60,000 to $80,000 a year. Many drivers say those ads are deceiving. Gross income can exceed $60,000, but Jean, echoing many drivers, said she had to pay nearly $800 a month for her truck, $125 a week for gas, $55 a week for business equipment, $4,000 a year for insurance policies, plus outlays for tires, maintenance and repairs. Some years, Jean calculated, her net pay was just $32,000, amounting to $10.25 an hour. Many drivers find it hard to walk away because they have invested so much in their trucks. If they leave, they might still be stuck with years of monthly payments and the final payment of $8,000. One morning in August 2004, Jean doubled over in pain. Three days later, her doctor informed her she had ovarian cancer. 1 2 3 Next Page » This article is adapted from "The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker," by Steven Greenhouse, a reporter for The New York Times. The book, published by Knopf last week, examines difficulties faced by workers at companies like Fed Ex and Wal-Mart, and points to Patagonia and Costco as models for corporate America. Read Chapter One of the book. Correction: June 8, 2008 An article on April 20, adapted from the book “The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker,” referred imprecisely to the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of FedEx Ground, the delivery business, over the way it classifies truck operators. The I.R.S. preliminarily assessed FedEx $319 million in taxes and penalties, plus interest, for 2002 over its classification of truck operators as independent contractors rather than employees; the I.R.S. did not order it to pay $319 million. As the article noted, the I.R.S. told FedEx that it could face similar charges for subsequent years. The article also referred imprecisely to FedEx Ground’s requirements for a truck driver in Massachusetts. The company required her to have a truck that met its specifications; it did not require her to buy one.

Skip to next paragraph Chris Hondros/Getty Images A family passing bulk packages of diapers at a Costco appears to be benefiting from a shift to thriftiness as the American economy slows. Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in March As retailers reported sales results on Thursday, Wal-Mart Stores and the Costco Wholesale Corporation were among the few winners, as shoppers stuck to basics. Wal-Mart raised its earnings outlook, noting that better inventory control helped to limit markdowns on merchandise. It also said that April sales should top prior expectations. But March proved to be bleak for most others, including the J. C. Penney Company, Gap, and Limited Brands. All of them reported sharp drops in sales. Even high-end department stores like Saks languished; Saks noted that jewelry and designer women’s apparel were among the weakest areas. Merchants faced numerous obstacles to improving sales: record gas prices, rising food costs, a weaker job market, slumping home prices and an early, frigid Easter. “Consumers are buying what they need,” said Jennifer Black, president of Jennifer Black &amp; Associates, an equity research company in Lake Oswego, Ore. For everything else, shoppers are being pickier and focusing on discounters, she said. According to a preliminary tally by UBS-International Council of Shopping Centers, sales slid 0.5 percent versus its original estimate of 1 percent growth. The results, based on same-store sales, or sales at stores open for at least a year, were the weakest since March 1995, when the industry registered a decline of 0.8 percent. Wal-Mart was a bright spot. It reported a 0.7 percent gain in same-store sales, excluding sales of fuel. Still, that was slightly below the 1 percent estimate by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Wal-Mart raised its first-quarter earnings outlook because of better inventory controls that yielded fewer markdowns and reduced store theft. The company also benefited from strong sales of groceries, video games and other electronics. Costco posted a 7 percent gain in sales, higher than expected, with much of the gain coming from gasoline sales. Many department stores and apparel chains suffered, though. Among department stores, J. C. Penney posted a larger-than-expected 12.3 percent sales decline. The department store retailer had warned late last month that same-store sales would be down at least 10 percent in a souring economy. Saks reported a 2.9 percent decline in same-store sales, in contrast to the 3.5 percent gain that Wall Street anticipated. Nordstrom had a 9.1 percent decline in same-store sales; analysts had expected an 8 percent drop. Limited Brands reported an 8 percent drop in sales. Gap had an 18 percent drop in same-store sales, dragged down by a 27 percent drop at its Old Navy division. Sellers of teenage goods, which typically are more recession-proof than other categories, stumbled last month, too.

Casey for The New York Times Tom Nissley, senior books editor at Amazon.com, and Daphne Durham, the managing editor of books for the site, work in Seattle, which has rapidly become influential in publishing. TEN years ago, Nancy Pearl started a program for public libraries here that she hoped would get adults excited about literature. It was called, “If All of Seattle Read the Same Book.” Free copies of “The Sweet Hereafter,” a novel about a tragic school bus accident, were distributed to individuals and book clubs. Posters encouraged people to read the book and discuss it at library-sponsored events. The novel became the top-selling book in the area. But Ms. Pearl’s program received little national attention despite its success. “We just weren’t on the map then,” Ms. Pearl, who is a librarian, said. Today, her name is familiar to book lovers from coast to coast. She attracted attention in 2003, when she published “Book Lust,” a guide to must-read books. A few years later, a sequel to that book coincided with her promotion to national book commentator on National Public Radio. While she doesn’t have as much clout as Oprah Winfrey, authors tell Ms. Pearl that her recommendations cause book sales to jump. She even has an action figure modeled in her likeness  a Seattle novelty company has sold more than 100,000 of them. (The toy makes a librarian’s shushing sound.) In many ways, Ms. Pearl’s rise in the book world parallels Seattle’s rise in the publishing world. Though the big publishing houses are still ensconced in New York, the Seattle area is the home of Amazon, Starbucks and Costco, three companies that increasingly influence what America reads. Books by relatively unknown or foreign authors become best sellers by dint of their anointment at the hands of Amazon editors. A forgotten older paperback, recommended and featured by the book buyer at Costco, can sell more copies in six weeks than it did in the last few years combined. Almost every book Starbucks stocks in its coffee shops sells more than 100,000 copies in its outlets alone. That pushes most Starbucks selections into the top 1 percent of all books sold that year, without counting sales in other types of stores. The three companies settled in Seattle for different reasons, and each had its own motivation for choosing to sell books. Together, though, their combined power in the book industry has put the city in the position of tastemaker. Each company, in its own way, “guides their customers, by selecting the books they will see,” Ms. Pearl said. “New York may publish the books, but Seattle significantly defines America’s reading list.” INDUSTRY trends suggest Seattle’s influence will keep growing. More people are bypassing bookstores and buying at mass-market merchants, online retailers and specialty stores, says Albert N. Greco, a marketing professor at Fordham University’s Graduate School of Business Administration. In the last two years alone, sales of consumer books sold through such nontraditional outlets grew by more than $260 million, Professor Greco said. The presence of Costco, Amazon and Starbucks ensures that “Seattle will keep making an impact on what we read,” he said. When Kim Ricketts, founder of a book promotion company in Seattle, visited the big publishing houses in New York last month, she said she was repeatedly asked for advice on how to do business with the three Seattle heavyweights: “Publishers want to find the golden ticket  how to get their title beloved by one of these companies.” Seattle’s literary seeds have been here for decades, with local authors, abundant writing courses and robust independent bookstores, according to J. A. Jance, the Seattle mystery author whose books have sold 15 million copies over the last 20 years. “Maybe it’s the rain, but Seattle has always been a reading town,” she said. Over the last 10 years, the city has spent nearly $200 million to improve its libraries, including the new downtown showpiece designed by Rem Koolhaas and completed in 2004. This love of books even seeps into the town’s corporate cultures, says Ms. Ricketts, who 10 years ago started organizing author visits for employees at Microsoft, Starbucks and other companies in the area. “The authors were always shocked at how big the crowds were and how many books they sold,“ Ms. Ricketts remembers. The town’s enthusiasm for books may have made it easy to find well-qualified employees, but Amazon, Starbucks and Costco each occupy a different niche in the book world. Starbucks started offering books to enhance the coffee-house experience, thinking that customers would enjoy spending more time in the shop if they had a provocative read and conversation starter to go along with their coffees and scones. They also hoped it would increase spending by each customer. Starbucks sells just one title at a time, usually for a period of two to three months. The selections bear little resemblance to one another. Some have been almost unknown; others were already best sellers. The latest title, “Beautiful Boy,” focuses on a father trying to help his drug-addicted son. “We wanted to find extraordinary books that would encourage people to discuss compelling issues” like war, hope, faith and family, said Ken Lombard, president of Starbucks Entertainment. 1 2 3 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/business/06shops.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Profits Rise at Costco and a Rival<date>Published: March 6, 2008</date><text>The warehouse clubs Costco and BJ’s reported substantially higher profits on Wednesday, with both benefiting as cost-conscious shoppers favored lower-priced alternatives to department stores and specialty retailers. The Costco Wholesale Corporation, the nation’s largest warehouse club, said its quarterly profit rose 31 percent to continue a recent run of solid results driven by strong sales and cost-cutting. Profit at its smaller rival, BJ’s Wholesale Club, more than quadrupled. BJ’s, based in Natick, Mass., beat Wall Street expectations and raised its 2008 earnings forecast. Costco, based in Issaquah, Wash., said second-quarter net income rose to $327.9 million, or 74 cents a share, matching expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. In the quarter a year earlier, Costco earned $249.5 million, or 54 cents a share. Sales increased 12 percent, to $16.62 billion, just shy of the analysts’ consensus estimate of $16.85 billion. BJ’s posted fourth-quarter net income of $50.2 million, or 80 cents a share, beating analysts’ forecast for a profit of 74 cents a share. It was up from net income of $11.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. BJ’s attributed the higher profit to strong January sales, rising profit margins and lower-than-expected expenses. Revenue rose 2 percent, to $2.48 billion, just above analysts’ forecast of $2.46 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year rose 5 percent at BJ’s, whose 177 clubs are all in the United States, spread across 16 Eastern states. The same-store sales gain was 7 percent at Costco.

Mr. Perle, the neoconservative and former adviser to Donald Rumsfeld, offered to walk through his local Costco, pointing out the products that he said were increasingly drawing D.C. power shoppers like himself. That Richard Perle? The gourmand with a home in Provence who once dreamed of opening a chain of soufflé restaurants? Yes, Mr. Perle proudly shops in Costcos concrete warehouses stocked with three-pound jars of peeled garlic and jumbo packs of toilet paper. And he has no problem serving the stores offerings to dinner guests. Because it should have been Dean &amp; DeLuca? he asked, sounding half incredulous and half amused. I really think theres a socio-cultural thing here, and people are entitled to their pretensions. As a recent article in Vanity Fair lamented, the days of glamorous Washington dinner parties are long gone. Indeed, some hostesses today arent above serving Costco salmon, nicely dressed up with a dollop of crème fraîche. Mr. Perle said he shopped at Costco once a week when he was in town, and at a dinner party he held recently for several colleagues and friends, most ingredients were from there  the beef for his daube à la Provençal, the limes for his lime soufflé. The salmon for gravlax  also from Costco. He said he always received compliments, and he always got double takes when he told his guests where he shopped. Hes not the only D.C. host or hostess to go big box. I do it  Costco all the way, said the writer Sally Quinn, who is known for the power salons she puts on with her husband, the former Washington Post editor, Ben Bradlee, at her Georgetown town house. I just started. Ann Jordan, the wife of Vernon Jordan, also calls herself a big fan and says she has used Costco food for parties, especially for the fund-raisers she held during the Clinton years. Ellen Bennett, a fine art photographer and the wife of Robert S. Bennett, President Clintons personal lawyer in the Paula Jones case, has thrown an open house Costco party each Christmas since 2004. Pigs in blankets, salamis, salmon, shrimp, pâté, cheese, said Mrs. Bennett, remembering her parties. Juleanna Glover, a lobbyist and former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney who is also known as a hostess, was an early convert. And, she added, almost as if confiding a secret, You recognize the brownies and black and white cookies at some of the most prominent individuals homes. Susan Lacz, chief executive of Ridgewells, the largest catering company in the Washington area, said she knows the trend all too well. My gosh, it drives me crazy, she said. Some of the people I hear are going to Costco, I think, Oh, you must be kidding me. The ultimate awkwardness, she said, is when clients want to buy their food from Costco but disguise it: Theyll say: Why dont you bring the fancy glassware, and well get the rest from Costco. And could you put it on one of your fancy plates? Oh, and how about some of your fancy ice cream on top? Ms. Lacz said she was not going to name names, but that one of her best clients, a high-end retail store, told her, Were going to go to Costco and buy a bunch of stuff, and we want you guys to serve it. To which she replied: No, youre not. Entertaining in Washington has gone decidedly casual. No one has stepped in to duplicate Pamela Harrimans or Katharine Grahams elegant soirees, and the Iranian Embassy, which once served free-flowing Champagne and caviar, is long shuttered. There used to be so many black-tie dinners at private homes, said Buffy Cafritz, an honorary Kennedy Center trustee who also is known in Washington hostess circles. Now everything is so much more informal, and we serve meatloaf instead of beef Wellington. (For the record, Mrs. Cafritz said she had never used Costco herself, but might get there before the holiday season ended. I have a weakness for apple pie, she said. Ive heard their apple pie is delicious.) Against the backdrop of an unpopular war, rising oil prices and a subprime mortgage crisis, a certain thriftiness seems to have crept into the citys dining rooms. I dont think anyone would dare serve caviar as a first course today, and instead of filet mignon, there are a lot of other beef dishes, said Letitia Baldrige, the etiquette writer who was Jacqueline Kennedys social secretary. Embassies dont have the pocketbooks they used to. And to have these opulent menus for these parties here, it looks bad. In that sense, catering by Costco is a style statement, like drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Reverse chic is a very powerful phenomenon in status-oriented circles, said David Kamp, the author of The United States of Arugula (Broadway, 2006), a book about the American fine-food revolution. I think Costco is the same thing. It gets discovered. To its benefit, Costco has carefully fashioned an upscale-downscale image, and their stores do better in high-end locations, said the companys chief financial officer, Richard Galanti. In the Washington area, the highest volume location is its store in the Pentagon City neighborhood of Arlington, Va. WE knew that we would attract government, we would attract ambassadors, we would attract military personnel, we would attract the parties and embassies," said Joe Potera, the chief operating officer, referring to the Pentagon City store. "We have thousands of sheet cakes during all the major holidays for Pentagon parties, for ambassador parties, for staff parties in the capital. Its kind of a destination." Costco also has a chocolate shop that produces molds of the Capitol as well as the Pentagon. Ms. Baldrige said she saw no problem shopping for dinner parties at Costco. I would say bully for you, get the best deal you can, she said. Just dont make that the main topic of conversation. Know a little bit about foreign affairs as well as how Costco is doing. Be able to be a little more scintillating other than being able to discuss the cost of your food. Bragging about the saving might be reserved for the brave few. One Washington hostess who loves Costco didnt want people to know that her husband likes to hang out in the food court munching the quarter-pound hot dogs ($1.50 with a soda). Mr. Perle knows no such shame. The book section, the cheese section, the seafood, I almost always get some fresh produce there, he said, rattling off his favorite Costco haunts. I just bought chanterelles there the other day, and they often have fresh shiitake mushrooms. Perfect for a mushroom soufflé.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Brandi Simons for The New York Times After declining Wal-Marts health coverage last year, and then avoiding doctor visits, Katrina Wagner chose a plan this year. Multimedia Graphic Assessing the Plans Graphic Timeline: Criticism, Then Change Graphic Broader Coverage Related Q&amp;A: The Public Face of Wal-Marts Health Care Program (November 13, 2007) Health Plans Compared Wal-Mart (pdf) Home Depot (pdf) Costco (pdf) Target (pdf) Across the country, politicians and labor groups derided the companys health plans for their high expense and bare-bones coverage. Two states, California and Maryland, even passed laws demanding, in effect, that the company spend more on employee health benefits. We want this giant to behave itself, one Maryland legislator, Anne Healey, said at the time. The giant, it turns out, was listening. All the criticism was hurting its reputation and its ability to expand. So now, after spending two years seeking advice from everyone from Bill Clinton to executives at Starbucks, Wal-Mart is overhauling its health plans. The company, according to data available for the first time, is offering better coverage to a greater number of workers. Wal-Mart, the nations largest private employer, provides insurance to 100,000 more workers than it did just three years ago  and it is now easier for many to sign up for health care at Wal-Mart than at its rival, Target, whose reputation glows in comparison. Wal-Mart has hardly become a standard-bearer for corporate America: it still insures fewer than half its 1.4 million employees in the United States. But the changes in its policies have accomplished what once seemed impossible. Many of its most ardent critics have put down their pitchforks. Andrew L. Stern, whose Service Employees International Union set up an advocacy group to attack Wal-Mart three years ago, now concedes that there is clearly a focus on covering more people. Given Wal-Marts unparalleled track record of sharply cutting prices and wringing out inefficiencies, its focus on providing more affordable health care also holds significant promise in taming what has become a runaway expense for the nation. In one sign of its success so far, the company has pushed down the price of 2,400 generic prescription drugs to $4 a month for employees, starting next year, a program that it offers, in more limited form, to its customers. Now, the chain is even considering weight-loss clinics in its 4,000 stores and is toying with the idea of selling health insurance, hoping to finally bring coverage within reach of most Americans. The companys turnabout demonstrates the power of public pressure to change even the biggest corporations like Wal-Mart, which has based its business strategy on low costs at all costs. What Wal-Mart discovered is that the chorus of critics it had long ignored or blithely rebutted had a point. We were spending a lot of energy, and we werent making any headway, said H. Lee Scott Jr., the companys chief executive, who once traveled the country defending the retailers practices. Retrospectively now I say, yes, that plan needed to be improved. For a company whose mantra is to pinch every penny, the improvements have not come without a struggle. For decades, tens of thousands of its employees were never eligible for coverage, and what was offered was too costly for a work force whose average wages amounted to roughly $20,000 a year. The cheapest plan for a family cost about $1,500 a year in premiums and required workers to pay $3,000 in medical bills before Wal-Mart began paying any of their expenses. Even fewer could afford the more than $10,000 in bills they could end up responsible for under the plan. By 2000, as Wal-Mart became the largest retailer in the country, its health insurance drew heightened scrutiny. Labor groups like the United Food and Commercial Workers, which has members in grocery chains that compete with Wal-Mart, called attention to the companys meager coverage. The evidence was compelling: Wal-Mart workers routinely showed up in large numbers on state Medicaid rolls from Georgia to Washington. Encouraged by the passage of the California law in 2003, dozens of states considered bills requiring Wal-Mart to spend more on employee health benefits. None of the laws remain on the books. In the fall of 2005, Wal-Mart made its first stab at responding to its critics, introducing a health plan with premiums as low as $11 a month. But even that attempt was undercut when, a few days later, The New York Times disclosed a company memorandum proposing ways to reduce health care spending by hiring more part-time workers and discouraging unhealthy people from working at Wal-Mart. One suggestion would have required cashiers to gather carts as exercise. A combination of embarrassment, political necessity and internal pressure led to changes inside Wal-Marts headquarters. Among those weighing in was Bill Clinton, a close Wal-Mart observer from his days as governor of Arkansas; he urged Mr. Scott to look beyond the motives of his critics and focus on making the company a better employer. In April 2006, Mr. Scott replaced M. Susan Chambers, the author of the health care memo, with a high-profile colleague, Linda M. Dillman, who ran the formidable information technology division. Ms. Dillman said the assignment gave her pause. Is this a good thing or a bad thing, she recalled asking herself. Did I make somebody mad? But she said Mr. Scott emphasized how important her task was, telling her, We need you to go make a difference in health care. Ms. Dillman began by surveying Wal-Marts workers, researching the health plans at the nations most progressive employers and reaching out to top health policy experts. The new advisers did not mince words. You can do better by your employees, Mark D. Smith, chief executive of the powerful California Healthcare Foundation, told Wal-Mart executives at one meeting. But in wide-ranging conversations with federal officials like Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and executives like Michael J. Critelli, the executive chairman of Pitney Bowes, best known for making postage meters but also a leader in employee health care, Wal-Marts executives began revising how they thought about benefits. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/business/11costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Shares Rise on Earnings<date>Published: October 11, 2007</date><text>SEATTLE, Oct. 10 (AP)  Shares of Costco Wholesale, the warehouse club retailer, soared Wednesday after it reported a 5 percent jump in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, driven by a rebound in same-store sales growth, cost cutting and a tighter returns policy for electronics. Excluding one-time charges, earnings for the 16 weeks that ended Sept. 1 were $408.2 million, or 91 cents a share, well above the consensus estimate of 83 cents a share of analysts polled by Thomson Financial. Quarterly revenue grew 3 percent, to $20.48 billion, from $19.88 billion, missing Wall Streets estimate of $20.73 billion.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Falling Prices Podcast Weekend Business This week: The subprime crisis goes global, Robert Shiller on irrational exuberance, the plight of American industrial workers, and hedge fund contagion. How to Subscribe This Weeks Podcast (mp3) Enlarge This Image Liz O. Baylen for The New York Times Georgio Malouf and his sisters, Murielle, right, and Valentina, ponder TVs at a New York Costco. They will see more name-brand models along the wall and a lot fewer of the second-tier brands that also happen to carry lower price tags. They may also find themselves accosted by sales employees pushing expensive but nonessential services like extended warranties and professional installation. Liberal return policies are getting tougher at some stores. Were abandoning the entry-level price point, said Joe McGuire, who was the chief executive of the regional electronics chain Tweeter Home Entertainment Group until stepping down this week. Compared to last year, well be very much focused on models with superior picture quality and large sizes. To increase profits, the company will also push customers to purchase its $399 professional installation package and its $79 picture calibration service. Electronics retailers are doing this because, although they are selling more HDTVs than ever, they are making less money on them. Indeed, even as consumers inexorably move toward buying ever-larger screens and retailers revenues climb, competition is forcing price cuts. And as the low-price, high-volume mass merchants like Wal-Mart or Costco become major vendors of big-screen HDTVs, all retailers are forced to keep their prices  and their profit margins  as low as possible. Prices have continued to drop substantially this year. According to the research firm iSuppli, the average retail price of 42-inch HDTVs  one of the most popular sizes this year  has declined to $1,522 from $1,844 last Christmas, an 18 percent drop. Prices will continue to fall, industry analysts say, because the retailers are powerless to prevent the declines. Not only is retail competition fierce, but flat- panel TV manufacturers, especially the Taiwanese contract manufacturers, continue to build new plants and expand production, which has created a glut in panels. The price promotions by the minor makers propelled Vizio from the No. 4 L.C.D. television maker in the American market in the first quarter of 2007 to the best-selling maker in the second quarter of 2007. Half the reason that consumers buy our sets is because of lower prices, said William Wang, Vizios chief executive. But our goal was never to compete on price only. We have a great product. While this is great news for consumers, it is not what retailers want to hear. The impact of the low, sometimes negative, profit margins has been devastating to many of them. For example, Tweeter increased its unit sales of televisions during last years Christmas selling season by 15 percent over the previous Christmas. Profit margin in the video category, said Mr. McGuire, was down substantially on a year-over-year basis due to the intense competition in the category and in June, the company sought protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. It was sold in July to Schultze Asset Management, an equity buyout firm. Other chains were affected as well. At Circuit City, video sales dropped from 42 percent of overall sales in 2006, to 39 percent in its first quarter, ended May 31. To cut costs, the company laid off some of its higher-paid veterans in sales. In some cases those people were not any more productive than lower-paid people, said Bill Cimino, a Circuit City spokesman. During Best Buys quarter ended June 2, its gross profit rate declined 6 percent, to 23.9 percent of revenue compared with 25.4 percent in the year-earlier period. The company attributed the decline partly to the promotional environment in home video. Even Costco, which operates on a 9 percent profit markup on television or about half what big-box retailers manage, has been negatively affected by plummeting flat-panel TV prices. The company said that because of its liberal return policy  almost anything can be returned at any time, no questions asked  its effective profit margin on TVs was more than halved, according to Richard A. Galanti, Costcos chief financial officer. Customers would buy a large flat-panel TV, use it for one year, then return it for a larger, less-expensive one. I spoke to one customer who had bought four TVs and returned three of them for lower prices, Mr. Galanti said. The company often got stuck with used TVs, or had to sell them to salvage companies for a fraction of their price. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/13/business/13shops.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Retail Sales Are Better Than Analysts Expected<date>Published: July 13, 2007</date><text>Retailers, including the industry leader, Wal-Mart Stores, yesterday reported June sales that topped Wall Streets lowered expectations. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in June Wal-Mart, the worlds largest retailer, posted a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent gain in June sales at its United States stores that were open at least a year and said its previous forecast for higher second-quarter earnings was attainable. In June, sales at 50 United States retailers rose a combined 2.4 percent, according to a tally by the International Council of Shopping Centers. The results beat its most recent forecast of a 1.5 to 2 percent rise, but trailed the advance of 3 percent in June 2006. The Goldman Sachs retail composite index rose 2.1 percent for June. While they were by no means stellar results this month, they certainly were better than the gloom that was expected, Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc., a retail tracking company, said of the monthly sales figures. Retail sales have been trending lower this year as weakness in the housing market ripples through the economy and high fuel prices take a larger bite out of shoppers wallets. Retailers have struggled to persuade shoppers to spend despite a dearth of popular fashion items. The trend has raised concerns about whether the strength of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of national economic activity, would hold up. That concern was magnified this week when Sears Holdings and Home Depot, the largest home improvement chain, issued profit warnings. The final June sales results may have beat diminished expectations, but there were notes of caution, with Wal-Mart saying that gas prices were a top concern for shoppers. Consumers continue to be challenged financially, with more pressure on discretionary spending, Eduardo Castro-Wright, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart in the United States, said in a statement. With gasoline prices remaining high, consumers were concentrating on commuter shopping  doing their shopping on the way to and from work, eliminating extra trips to the mall, said Craig Johnson, president of a retail consulting company, Customer Growth Partners. That was evident in the June sales results, with discount retailers and warehouse clubs posting strong results, but certain mall-based retailers, like department stores and some specialty apparel stores, lagging. Wal-Marts domestic same-store sales in June rose 2.4 percent  topping an average forecast of 0.9 percent among analysts polled by Reuters. The company had forecast sales would be flat to up 2 percent. June same-store sales at its namesake stores rose 1.6 percent, while sales at its Sams Club warehouse division jumped 6.9 percent. A Wal-Mart rival, Target, said its June same-store sales rose 3.3 percent, near the low end of its forecast for a gain of 3 to 5 percent. Costco Wholesale, the No. 1 United States warehouse operator, and BJs Wholesale Club, the No. 3 warehouse operator behind Sams Club, also posted June results that beat analysts view. But AnnTaylor Stores, the womens apparel retailer, reported a larger-than-expected 8.4 percent decline in June same-store sales, citing slow customer traffic and continued weakness at its Loft chain. The department store operator Macys also struggled, reporting a bigger-than-expected 2.7 percent decline in June same-store sales, and it reduced its quarterly profit outlook. Also posting disappointing sales were the clothing retailer Gap and the department store operator Bon-Ton Stores. Gap said its same-store sales fell 5 percent in June, hurt by weakness at its Old Navy and Gap chains.

Normally I dont bring my son to blind play dates with Internet strangers. But my Internet friend writes a good blog about childrens music, so I figured it was safe. The party started at 6. He promised Popsicles and a Slip n Slide  which are to a 4-year-old what beer and chicken wings are to a frat boy  but no food, so he advised us to eat beforehand. Skip to next paragraph I didnt dwell on the strange custom of a dinnertime party without dinner. In the nonstop ticker-tape parade that has been my life, Ive encountered much weirder. Instead, I set out to find the perfect restaurant that would make my son love me more than he already does. I came up with the Chicago Hamburger Company, a Phoenix institution famous for its hot dogs and Original Windy City Sliders. Plus: a Pac-Man machine. Elijah, I said. Would you like to go to a restaurant that has famous hot dogs and the game where the yellow guy eats the ghosts? He nodded his head in a gee, mister! kind of way. And maybe we could look for predators in the desert on the way? Maybe, I said. When I told my dad we were going for hot dogs, he said, You should go to Costco. My dad is the only person on the planet who is known by his first name at Costco. He once worked as a quartermaster in the Army, so he feels at home among large pallets of canned foodstuffs. And hes quick to share the good news about their hot dogs. Never, I said. On the scale of filial rebellion, I rank below Prince Hal and James Dean, but I was determined to purchase a hot dog from an independently owned business. The Chicago Hamburger Company turned out to be just a 10-minute drive from my parents house. It was also closed. Why is everything always closed in Phoenix? Elijah asked. I dont know, son, I said. Im hungry, he said. Well find another place. I will only eat hot dogs. O.K. And also shrimp. That expands our options somewhat. But I will only drink water. The retail options near the party were limited. One local tavern boasted the Best of Phoenix Wine Burger. If Id taken Elijah there, I would have reported myself to Child Protective Services. So I drove around Central Phoenix in a state of existential dread. It had been 20 years since I left this desert dump, and here I was again, lost in a scorching maze of car dealerships and crummy strip joints. Then I saw the sign: Costco. It didnt occur to me to not pull into the lot. My kid wanted a hot dog, and here was salvation. I, the son, had at last become the father, or maybe it had happened long before. The truth is, Ive been a Costco member since 2003. Elijah, I said. Were at Costco. Its a miracle, he said. Inside, I ordered him a hot dog and got myself a dubious slice of pizza. I want to sit somewhere clean, Elijah said, walking around the tables.The one he found was the exactly the same as all the others, though maybe they all just looked dirty under the flickering grayish fluorescent light that gave the eating area the ambience of an Eastern-bloc interrogation room. I went to get a couple of bottles of water and turned around just in time to see the hot dog slip out of Elijahs hand and onto the floor. FIVE-SECOND RULE! I shouted. Though five-tenths of a second probably would have been too long on that floor. Luckily, I got the second dog free. Elijah began to nibble, eagerly. And then he paused. There was a little blond hair hanging between his lips. Please tell me thats your hair, I said. No, he said. Its a mystery hair. For Gods sake! I said. I think Costco might be a magic place. Twenty minutes later, we were at the party. To my relief, it was not some deranged, television-newsmagazine sting. The adults were mostly from my Internet friends church, and they were all mellow, kind and wholesome. There was indeed a Slip n Slide, with kids playing on it. Elijah couldnt have been more excited if there had been camel rides. He slipped and slid and ate two Popsicles, a bowlful of popcorn and some goldfish crackers. Meanwhile, I learned that my Internet friends wife had grown up near me. And their house reminded me a lot of the houses Id played in during my childhood in Phoenix. I felt oddly comfortable. A game of Wiffle ball broke out. I pitched underhand, and the kids took turns hitting. In one evening, I had been the rebellious son, the responsible dad and then the child again. I had lived the entire circle of life, minus death. But that slice of pizza began to take care of that. As it churned in my guts I started to feel very old, and yet strangely at peace. Then it got dark, and it was time to go home.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Retail Sales in May As the nations merchants reported results yesterday, the disappointments included Wal-Mart Stores, Macys and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Costco Wholesale, Kohls and luxury retailers like Saks beat expectations. It wasnt a blowout, but the gains were a solid snap back, said Ken Perkins, president of RetailMetrics, a research company in Swampscott, Mass. Still, Mr. Perkins and other analysts said that the performance reflected a slowing consumer spending trend. Its a slowing trend that we have been seeing since February, said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group. From February through May, the index averaged a 2.2 percent same-store sales gain, compared with the 4.1 percent average in the comparable period a year ago. Analysts are closely monitoring sales in June, the second most important month on the retail calendar behind December. But most analysts believe the modest spending pace will continue. The mixed performance in May followed one of the worst sales slumps ever for the retail industry. While one-time factors like an early Easter and rainy weather hurt sales in April, business was so bad it fed worries that higher gasoline prices and a weaker housing market were eating away at consumer spending. In May, same-store sales rose 2.5 percent, down from 4.5 percent a year earlier but a sharp improvement from the 1.9 percent drop in April. The sales in May benefited from warmer weather and the Memorial Day shopping weekend, which was not included in the results a year earlier. Wal-Mart had a 1.1 percent same-store sales gain, below the 1.4 percent predicted by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. The figure excluded fuel sales; including fuel, same-store sales rose 1.3 percent. Wal-Mart, which reported a 3.5 percent drop in same-store sales in April, its worst performance on record, continues to struggle with its apparel and home businesses. Store executives said yesterday that those categories should see big improvements in the fourth quarter. The company said it expects same-store sales in June to range from unchanged to up 2 percent. Its rival, Target, whose cheap but stylish merchandise appeals to a broader shopper base beyond the lower-income customer, had a 5.8 percent gain in same-store sales, just below the 5.9 percent estimate. Costco had a 7 percent increase in May same-store sales. Analysts expected 5.6 percent. Among moderate-price department stores, J. C. Penney posted a 2 percent decline in same-store sales in its department store business, worse than the 0.3 percent gain analysts had expected. Macys continued to struggle with the transition of former branches of May Department Stores to the Macys brand. The company said same-store sales fell 3.3 percent, missing its own expectations and the 1 percent forecast by analysts. While we were disappointed with sales in the month of May, the increased promotional marketing support currently being implemented for the Macys brand is expected to improve sales trends in June and July, Terry J. Lundgren, the chief executive of Federated Department Stores, the parent company of Macys, said in a statement. Kohls reported a 10.5 percent gain in same-store sales, beating the 6.2 percent estimate. Upscale stores shined. Saks, which operates Saks Fifth Avenue, reported a 37.5 percent gain in same-store sales, better than the 13.9 percent estimated by analysts. Saks said Mays results benefited from a shift in the promotional calendar, a move that will hurt June results. Nordstrom had a 6.3 percent same-store gain, better than the 2.6 percent estimate. Gap Inc. continued to languish, posting a 3 percent decline in same-store sales, although results were better than the 4.4 percent drop Wall Street had expected. Limited had a 2 percent same-store gain, much better than the 1.6 percent decline forecast by analysts. Among retailers focused on younger shoppers, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch posted a 5 percent drop in same-store sales, worse than the 1.2 percent forecast.

C. Penney and Kohl’s, while earnings at Costco Wholesale fell 4.9 percent on the cost of a new return policy. Sears, owner of the Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company and Kmart chains, said sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.9 percent in its first quarter, the eighth consecutive quarterly drop. Costco said revenue rose 10 percent in its fiscal third quarter. Shares of Costco, based in Issaquah, Wash., fell 6 cents, to $56.47, on Nasdaq after the company forecast full-year profit of as much as $2.56 a share, matching the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Shares of Sears dropped $3.23, to $180.02. Excluding the gains and charges, Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said that it earned $1.10 a share. That trailed analysts’ estimates of $1.21 a share, the average of seven projections compiled by Bloomberg. Net income at Sears increased 20 percent, to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Costco’s net income dropped to $224 million, or 49 cents a share, from $235.6 million, also 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Pretax profit was reduced by $48.1 million after Costco added reserves to account for the possibility of more shoppers bringing back their older digital music players and cameras. The company started limiting returns to 90 days this year.

Now the queen of all things domestic is turning her voracious appetite to perhaps the riskiest industry of all: groceries. Beginning in 2008, Ms. Stewarts name  and reputation  will adorn a line of fresh, refrigerated and frozen foods sold at Costco, the nations largest warehouse retailer. The partnership, disclosed yesterday, could test the limits of Ms. Stewarts appeal and present a set of perils that her company has never before encountered. After all, drapes and paints cannot spoil in the refrigerator. Ms. Stewart cooks everything from soufflés to duck breasts on her syndicated television shows but producing a line of packaged food is not exactly in her comfort zone. So why would Ms. Stewart sell frozen dinners at Costco? One obvious reason would be to try to improve her companys disappointing bottom line. The deal with Costco was announced along with first-quarter financial results that showed a net loss of $11.9 million, wider than the $6.8 million loss in the same quarter last year. Although revenue rose, because of higher advertising income, to $66.7 million, from $62.1 million in the first quarter of 2006, it was more than offset by costs like investments in Blueprint, a lifestyle magazine introduced last year, and in the marthastewart.com Web site, which was recently renovated. Martha Stewart shares, which have been closing below $20 since late January, closed yesterday at $18.70, down 5 cents a share for the day. In a conference call yesterday, Susan Lyne, the chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, called food the greatest untapped opportunity for the company. Food, she said, is the No. 1 area for visits on the companys Web site, which features recipes and cooking tips, suggesting that Ms. Stewarts fans trust her on matters of gastronomy. In an interview, Howard Hochhauser, the chief financial officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, said the company had a ton of credibility in food, adding of the new Costco line, we think this can be pretty big. For now, the most tantalizing question  what exactly Ms. Stewart will cook up for Costco  remains unanswered. Executives at both Martha Stewart Living and Costco said they were still in the testing and tasting phase of their collaboration and had not yet chosen products for the new line. Based on what Martha Stewart Living executives have said before, the company is expected to favor prepared foods (think of nine-layer lasagna), rather than everyday commodities like a pie crust. Products in the line will bear two names on the label  Ms. Stewart and Kirkland, the name Costco gives to its in-house products. The line is expected to be called Kirkland Signature by Martha Stewart. Celebrity food lines are relatively rare, but they have succeeded before. Paul Newmans line, Newmans Own, has turned into a major brand over the last 20 years. Bill Bishop, chairman of Willard Bishop, a retail marketing consultancy near Chicago, said Ms. Stewarts wide name recognition  even with its baggage, which includes her stint in jail  would bolster any food line. There would be a huge amount of awareness of Martha Stewart at Costco, he said. Ms. Stewart has a habit of succeeding in unlikely businesses. Last year, for example, she signed a deal with KB Home to design suburban subdivisions inspired by her three personal residences. So far, sales of the homes are strong. Martha Stewart Everyday, her line of bedding, cookware and dishes, is a hit at Kmart. Several months ago Ms. Stewart signed an agreement to produce high-end furniture for Macys. Costco is an unexpected choice for Ms. Stewart, given its exposed-metal-shelves and raw warehouse feel, all a bit at odds with her country-home image. Mr. Hochhauser said the company picked Costco  known for its generous wages and benefits  because the retailer really respects their employees and customers. More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/business/06schism.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">New Urgency in Debating Health Care<date>Published: April 6, 2007</date><text>Since Hillary Rodham Clintons effort to overhaul the nations medical system was rejected in 1994, most big employers have stayed out of the debate on health care reform. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Divided on Health But with their medical costs ballooning, top executives of large companies are starting to speak up again  and many are calling for a national approach to fixing health care. Few advocate a wholesale shift to government-directed medicine, but most are seeking broad changes in the employer-subsidized health system, which they regard as unsustainable in its current form. Business executives are motivated in large part by health insurance premiums that are rising much faster than inflation, adding to their costs at a time when many are facing more intense competition from abroad, where companies rely on government-supported health care systems largely financed by taxes. A 2006 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates found that premiums in the United States had risen about 87 percent since 2000. Five years from now this problem will have to be cured, or the competitiveness of the United States will be dramatically affected, said J. Randall MacDonald, senior vice president for human resources at I.B.M. But companies are by no means speaking with one voice. Everybodys problem  the growing cost of health coverage  can be felt differently depending on the size of a company and whether it has promised health benefits to retirees. Older companies, for example, are more likely to welcome government help on coverage for workers who leave before they are eligible for Medicare and may find they cannot afford insurance. But Silicon Valley technology companies that do not have or need retiree coverage are wary of new taxpayer-financed subsidies. The health care debate is heating up as candidates polish their positions for next years presidential primaries, and as Democrats in Congress assert their newfound power. In general, employers are more interested in reform today than at any time since the Clinton effort in the early 1990s, said Robert S. Galvin, global health care and policy director at General Electric, which provides health benefits for 460,000 employees and dependents and 240,000 retirees and dependents. The surge of interest, Mr. Galvin said, is driven by compounding health cost increases at three times the general inflation rate, plus the entrance of Wal-Mart and other retailers that are beginning to feel the pain of out-of-control increases in costs. Wal-Mart Stores introduced lower-cost coverage for its huge work force last year, after state officials and editorial writers criticized the numbers of Wal-Mart employees on state Medicaid rolls. Many retailers, with large staffs of low-paid, temporary and part-time workers, would welcome a larger government role. The way its going, there will be 75 million uninsured in another 10 years, said James D. Sinegal, chief executive of Costco Wholesale, which subsidizes health care for 81,000 of its 100,000 workers in the United States. The federal government has to lend some assistance. Mr. Sinegal said he had agreed to support an unlikely coalition of businesses and labor unions that recently called for achieving a new American health care system by 2012. The group, the Better Health Care Together campaign, includes Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T, Intel and Kelly Services, the temporary-staffing company, as well as the Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of America. The system is going to break, warned Carl T. Camden, president and chief executive of Kelly Services. You can only put so many uninsured people through the emergency rooms before employers stop offering coverage. Indeed, a bill proposed by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would scale back the role of employers while requiring individuals and companies to share in the costs. President Bushs proposal would treat high-cost health care plans paid by employers as wages subject to income tax, and would also offer a new tax deduction to people who buy insurance on their own. Economists say that employers would raise wages if they did not have to pay for employee health care. The Treasury would stand to gain $140 billion a year in personal income taxes if the benefits were treated as wages, said Len Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center in Washington. There would be about $70 billion more in additional payroll taxes due on those wages, he said. But taxes would have to go up to keep the health care system functioning. Leslie Dach, executive vice president for corporate affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart, said that the companys message to elected officials is: The time to act is now.  Mr. Dach, a public relations specialist based in Washington and a frequent adviser to Democratic presidential candidates, joined Wal-Mart last year. While employers generally agree that steps must be taken to control health care costs, they are divided over whether or not the solutions should come from the government. That is the elephant in the room, said Mr. Galvin of General Electric. Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, another participant in the Better Health Care Together campaign, is skeptical about a new government role. He said the private sector could do the best job at improving efficiency in the system. Corporate purchasers could use their buying power, he said, to insist on technological aids like electronic prescriptions, remote monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses and electronic health records for Americans. Companies like General Motors argue that government agencies, which spend about half of the $2 trillion in annual health spending, should join with employers in pushing for changes to lower costs. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on April 6, 2007, on page C1 of the New York edition.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/opinion/05sachsnunziato.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Spinning Into Oblivion<date>Published: April 5, 2007</date><text>DESPITE the major record labels best efforts to kill it, the single, according to recent reports, is back. Sort of. Youll still have a hard time finding vinyl 45s or their modern counterpart, CD singles, in record stores. For that matter, youll have a tough time finding record stores. Todays single is an individual track downloaded online from legal sites like iTunes or eMusic, or the multiple illegal sites that cater to less scrupulous music lovers. The album, or collection of songs  the de facto way to buy pop music for the last 40 years  is suddenly looking old-fashioned. And the record store itself is going the way of the shoehorn. This is a far cry from the musical landscape that existed when we opened an independent CD shop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 1993. At the time, we figured that as far as business ventures went, ours was relatively safe. People would always go to stores to buy music. Right? Of course, back then there were also only two ringtones to choose from  riiiiinnng and ring-ring. Our intention was to offer a haven for all kinds of music lovers and obsessives, a shop that catered not only to the casual record buyer (Do you have the new Sarah McLachlan and ... uh ... is there a Beatles greatest hits CD?) but to the fan and oft-maligned serious collector (Can you get the Japanese pressing of Kinda Kinks? I believe they used the rare mono mixes). Fourteen years later, its clear just how wrong our assumptions were. Our little shop closed its doors at the end of 2005. The sad thing is that CDs and downloads could have coexisted peacefully and profitably. The current state of affairs is largely the result of shortsightedness and boneheadedness by the major record labels and the Recording Industry Association of America, who managed to achieve the opposite of everything they wanted in trying to keep the music business prospering. The association is like a gardener who tried to rid his lawn of weeds and wound up killing the trees instead. In the late 90s, our business, and the music retail business in general, was booming. Enter Napster, the granddaddy of illegal download sites. How did the major record labels react? By continuing their campaign to eliminate the comparatively unprofitable CD single, raising list prices on album-length CDs to $18 or $19 and promoting artists like the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears  whose strength was single songs, not albums. The result was a lot of unhappy customers, who blamed retailers like us for the dearth of singles and the high prices. The recording industry association saw the threat that illegal downloads would pose to CD sales. But rather than working with Napster, it tried to sue the company out of existence  which was like thinking youve killed all the roaches in your apartment because you squashed the one you saw in the kitchen. More illegal download sites cropped up faster than the associations lawyers could say cease and desist. By 2002, it was clear that downloading was affecting music retail stores like ours. Our regulars werent coming in as often, and when they did, they werent buying as much. Our impulse-buy weekend customers were staying away altogether. And it wasnt just the independent stores; even big chains like Tower and Musicland were struggling. Something had to be done to save the record store, a place where hard-core music fans worked, shopped and kibitzed  and, not incidentally, kept the music businesss engine chugging in good times and in lean. Who but these loyalists was going to buy the umpteenth Elton John hits compilation that the major labels were foisting upon them? But instead, those labels delivered the death blow to the record store as we know it by getting in bed with soulless chain stores like Best Buy and Wal-Mart. These big boxes were given exclusive tracks to put on new CDs and, to add insult to injury, they could sell them for less than our wholesale cost. They didnt care if they didnt make any money on CD sales. Because, ideally, the person who came in to get the new Eagles release with exclusive bonus material would also decide to pick up a high-speed blender that frappéed. 1 2 Next Page » Tony Sachs and Sal Nunziato own an online music retail business.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Podcast: Weekend Business Reporters and editors from The Times's Sunday Business section offer perspective on the week in business and beyond. How to Subscribe Its more than impulse buying. It is a calculated part of the companys business plan. Call it the Costco effect. We always come out with too much, said Linda Curtis Schneider, who lives in Nashville. Its hard to get out of there for under $200. Even when they are on vacation, the Schneider family seeks out the nearest Costco to gas up their rental car, grab a familiar lunch and browse for local specialties to bring back home. They have bought cases of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts from a Costco in Hawaii, gallon-sized salsa in Tucson, Ariz., and a crate of ruby red grapefruits in Marina del Rey, Calif. The Costco Wholesale Corporation, based in Issaquah, Wash., aims to offer an inviting mix of necessities and indulgences  bulk detergent and megapacks of yogurts, stocked along with giant plasma TVs and crystal stemware. From its first Seattle warehouse in 1983, Costco has grown to more than 500 warehouse stores worldwide and finished the 2006 fiscal year with its highest-ever sales, $58.96 billion. Costco is the largest player in the warehouse market. The rival Sams Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores, operates more than 670 warehouse clubs worldwide, with a sales volume of approximately $40 billion. Richard A. Galanti, Costcos chief financial officer, said that while a grocery store might stock 40,000 separate types of items, and a Wal-Mart might stock 100,000, Costco will stock only the 4,000 most popular items it can find. We try to figure out what people really want, he said. So, along with purchases of jumbo packs of paper towels and other supplies, impulse buying can be a big part of the Costco experience, because only the most well-liked, trendy, and fast-moving items are stocked. Those items include iPods, individually wrapped cheese sticks to put in a childs lunch box, as well as a few of the latest fashions. Recently, Ms. Schneider and her college-age daughter were excited to find Ugg boots, Smashbox makeup in leather cases and Seven jeans at their Costco in Nashville. Costco seems to go for the upper crust in taste, she said. Some offerings rotate in and out of the warehouse based on the season, sales volume and other factors. As a result, people may go to Costco more often than necessary to see what is new, said Steve Hoch, a retail professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. When they see something they want, he added, theyll be likely to go ahead and buy it, because next time they return, the item may be gone. While most consumers become annoyed when something they expect to find at a store is out of stock, a Costco shopper is likely to think, I should have gotten it last time, Professor Hoch said. Other retailers may also seek to entice shoppers by setting limits and creating scarcity. For example, Target offers limited-edition designer clothing and home furnishings that are unique to its stores, and that are often stocked for a period of only 60 to 90 days. And at BJs Wholesale Club, customers may come for their everyday grocery items, but if they spot some jewelry or the new capri pants at a great price they will be happier, said Teleia Farrell, a company spokeswoman. BJs uses items like 42-inch televisions and topaz rings to turn ho-hum shopping into an exciting environment, she said. It is the same at Sams Club, where members enjoy looking throughout the club for unexpected deals, said Susan Koehler, a spokeswoman for the company. Temporarily stocked surprises are also a calculated part of the Costco shopping experience. We try to have hundreds of items that are different each time a customer comes to the warehouse, to create a treasure-hunt atmosphere, said Joel Benoliel, a senior vice president. Well always have the same staples  the cereal, the detergent  and then we add in the wow items. But at the same time, there can be a comforting sameness to each cavernous location. Psychological factors can strongly influence buying behavior, according to Pamela N. Danziger, author of Shopping: Why We Love It and How Retailers Can Create the Ultimate Customer Experience (2006). Shoppers can experience an emotional thrill when they spot a deep discount, or find a particular item before it disappears from the shelves, she said, and creating those kinds of feelings has helped Costco. Shopping is recreational there, she said. People seek out this psychological reward. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/business/12bias.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Bias Suit Is Given Class-Action Status<date>Published: January 12, 2007</date><text>A federal judge granted class-action status yesterday to a lawsuit filed on behalf of more than 700 female workers at Costco Wholesale claiming that the retailer had systematically discriminated against women seeking jobs as managers. In the lawsuit, the lead plaintiff  a former assistant store manager who was upset about not being made a store manager  asserts that Costco discriminated against women in promotions because 13 percent of the companys store managers were women, while nearly half of its employees were women. The lawsuit undercuts Costcos image as one of retailings most benevolent companies, with generous wages and benefits that make it more attractive for employees than competitors like Wal-Mart Stores. In her ruling yesterday, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of Federal District Court in San Francisco concluded that the case should be certified as a class action because plaintiffs have presented strong evidence of a common culture at Costco which disadvantages women. The lawsuit, filed in August 2004, contends that at Costco, the highest-paid store management positions  assistant general manager and general manager  are doled out through an informal, word-of-mouth system that favors men over women. Unlike most competitors, Costco neither posts openings for such positions nor accepts applications for them, the lawsuit said. Instead, it said, a largely male group of senior executives handpicks managers. Brad Seligman, the plaintiffs lead lawyer, said, Costco has a blind spot in its employment policies, which has allowed a glass ceiling to fester. He called on the company, based in Issaquah, Wash., to start posting jobs and to adopt objective standards to determine who should qualify to be a store manager. Richard A. Galanti, chief financial officer at Costco, declined to remark on yesterdays ruling, saying the company does not comment on lawsuits. With 370 stores and 90,000 employees in the United States, Costco is the nations largest warehouse store chain. In the past, Costco has denied any discrimination. The company gave the judge statistical studies asserting that women were not underrepresented in managerial positions and that if they were, it was limited to two regions. Two experts hired by Costco asserted in declarations that any gender disparities that might exist were based on factors like womens lack of interest in jobs requiring early morning hours. In what the lawsuit said was the embodiment of a paternalistic system of promotions, Costco maintains an office inside its headquarters, called the Green Room, where the photographs of up-and-coming leaders are posted. Only senior managers have access to it, the suit said. As a result of this and other practices, the lawsuit maintains, women make up only 12.9 percent of store managers and 16.6 percent of assistant managers at Costco, although they represent 45 percent of the chains employees. In a deposition, James D. Sinegal, Costcos chief executive, said that, more than men, women chose not to take management positions within the company, preferring jobs like cashier. Our experience is that the women have a tendency to be the caretakers and have the responsibility for the children and for the family, he said, according to the lawsuit. Judge Patel ruled that the class of plaintiffs in the case should consist of all current and former female employees nationwide who have been denied store manager or assistant store manager positions since Jan. 3, 2002. Mr. Seligman is also the lead lawyer in a sex discrimination lawsuit against a Costco rival, Wal-Mart. In that lawsuit, federal courts have granted class-action status on behalf of 1.6 million current and former female employees, making it the largest employment-related class action in the nations history. Wal-Mart is appealing that class certification.

The company, which operates warehouse club stores, also said it would take a $70 million charge related to stock options. Costco said in October that it had found certain imprecisions in its stock options practices, and had formed an options review committee. It gave a second-quarter forecast that was below analyst estimates and trimmed the upper range of its full-year forecast. The company also said it had stopped filling certain generic drug prescriptions for $4 for a 30-day supply, but would instead offer 100 pills for $10. For the fiscal first quarter that ended Nov. 26, Costco reported earnings of $236.9 million, or 51 cents a share, compared with $215.8 million, or 45 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected 50 cents a share. Net sales for the quarter rose 9 percent, to $13.85 billion. Membership fees were $299.3 million, bringing total revenue to $14.15 billion. Shares of Costco jumped 1.8 percent, or 97 cents, to $54.11.

Its hard to say, mainly because of the lack of a yardstick to measure the value of most Internet companies. Skip to next paragraph Alex Eben Meyer Related Scripting News: Bubble Burst 2.0 Guardian Unlimited: When Will the Bubble Burst? VentureBeat: BitTorrent Trys to Avoid Squeeze  Strikes Deals, Raises More Cash? Digg.com: Customer Confidential Compared with the late-90s technology boom, there are few initial public offerings and thus it is harder to determine when a downturn has begun. Back then, when Internet companies like Pets.com and Webvan went south, the market reaction was readily apparent and immediate. But Dave Winer, the protoblogger and technology maven, thinks he has discovered a yardstick.  Google stock will crash, he wrote this week. Thats how well know (scripting.com). Shares of Google recently crossed $500 and settled at $480.80 yesterday. Web 2.0, according to Mr. Winer, is nothing more than an aftermarket for Google. So many start-ups rely on Google  both as a basis for creating Web sites and as a channel for selling Google ads  that the entirety of Web 2.0 (the new generation of sites that rely on interactivity and open systems) will stand or fall with Google, Mr. Winer says. When Google crashes, he wrote, thats the end of that, no more wave to ride, no more aftermarket, Bubble Burst 2.0. And the flip of this is also true  as long as Googles stock stays up, no bubble burst. There is a hole in this theory, writes Charles Arthur, who blogs about technology for The Guardian (guardian.co.uk), the British newspaper. A fall in the stock price, he notes, doesnt affect how much cash the company has in the bank. Still, Mr. Arthur says there is a ring of truth to Mr. Winers idea. If Googles stock craters, venture capitalists will see the sector as one which doesnt have such great promise, and Google as being unable to jump at acquisitions. Googles price-earnings ratio is bonkers, Mr. Arthur writes. Yesterday its P/E ratio was 61.17. Its strictly a share for speculation, which could make it the canary in the Web 2.0 coal mine. Dave said it first. BitTorrents Stand BitTorrent announced this week that it had made deals with several big studios to offer their videos for downloading. As with Napster and its free music before it, BitTorrent became popular as a vehicle for peer-to-peer sharing of pirated movie content, and is now hoping to succeed legitimately. And it may just succeed about as well as Napster has, that is, as an also-ran. Matt Marshall of VentureBeat, a blog that tracks technology and the venture capital business, noted that BitTorrent has never gained mass appeal among regular consumers and that it works best as a back-end distribution protocol (venturebeat.com). With so many big players ( Apple, AT&amp;T, Amazon, Microsoft and, most recently, Wal-Mart) already offering video downloads, BitTorrent should be more focused on becoming the distribution partner for some of these players, rather than try to become the consumer destination, Mr. Marshall wrote. Headaches in Store Retailers often dont seem to know whether to treat their customers as friends or enemies. Witness the practice of checking store receipts. You know the drill: Your merchandise is bought and paid for, and you just want to be on your way. But first, you must show your receipt to a security guard, sometimes having to line up to do so. David Pelfrey, who writes the customer confidential column for Black and White, a newspaper in Birmingham, Ala., has had enough. Last week, he recounted his many efforts to escape from stores without showing his receipt, and his many confrontations with security personnel (bwcitypaper.com). A sign at his local Costco explains the policy as being in part to assure that you paid for and are not overcharged or undercharged for any item. Mr. Pelfrey saw through that statement (how would the guard know whether anyone was overcharged?) and bolted. The employee reviewing receipts left the line and cheerfully said, Im going to have to see your receipt first,  he wrote. Adopting her happy demeanor, I replied, And you are going to have to chase me in order to do so. DAN MITCHELL Complete links are at nytimes.com/business. E-mail: whatsonline@nytimes.com.

Not at Wal-Mart, it seems. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Retail Sales in October The New York Times Wal-Mart Stores was one of several large retailers, along with Target and Costco, to post disappointing October sales totals yesterday. The results suggest that lower- and middle-class Americans are holding on tightly to their wallets even as energy prices fall and wages rise. With the holiday shopping season approaching, the consumers reluctance to spend raises questions about how robust holiday sales will be. As Wal-Mart reported a meager 0.5 percent rise last month in same-store sales  those at stores open at least a year  the company, the worlds largest retailer, also warned that November was probably going to be even worse. In a statement, it said sales this month were estimated to be approximately flat. That would be the companys worst performance in more than 10 years. In response, Wal-Mart is expected to make sharp price cuts weeks before the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, the Friday after Thanksgiving. The company, which has already cut the prices of 100 popular toys, is expected to focus its next round of price cuts on electronics. The unimpressive retail results helped deflate stock prices on Wall Street yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average, in which Wal-Mart is a large component, closed lower for the fifth straight day. Wal-Mart shares fell 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $48.29. The drop accounted for about a third of the Dows 12-point loss yesterday. Stocks also fell yesterday as the Labor Department reported that worker productivity did not improve in the third quarter as wages rose and a measure of inflation ticked higher. Target and Costco also reported October sales yesterday that fell short of Wall Streets expectations. While both reported gains from a year earlier  3.9 percent and 4 percent, respectively  they were outperformed by many major department stores, which have recently been among the strongest performers in the retail industry. Federated Department Stores, owner of Macys and Bloomingdales, said its same-store sales jumped 7.7 percent. J. C. Penney reported an 8.1 percent sales gain. Nordstrom, the high-end department store based in Seattle, said sales grew 10.7 percent. The slowdown in business at big-box retailers like Wal-Mart is one sign that some consumers are cutting back as the weakening housing market is dragging down overall economic growth. But even as the economy continues to downshift, wages are increasing and Americans are finding themselves with more disposable income, in part because of falling gas prices. Instead of spending that money, low-and middle-income consumers appear to be sticking to their budgets. Energy prices have come down, so wouldnt that give a lift to the lower-income consumer who has been most hurt by the rise? said Michael P. Niemira, chief economist of the International Council of Shopping Centers. Its a little bit of a question mark. Mr. Niemira said one possible explanation was that lower-income Americans were spending that extra cash at department stores. Is that consumer shopping elsewhere? Are they now moving to Pennys and Kohls, which are having booming sales? There is some evidence to suggest that Americans are putting more money aside. This week, the Commerce Department reported that the national personal savings rate in September came the closest it has in a year and a half to being positive. It was negative $15 billion, its healthiest level since May 2005. Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at the investment firm ITG, said that the reaction of consumers to falling gas prices had been a mirror image of what they did when prices soared: by and large, they did not alter their spending habits. They ignored it on the way up, and theyre ignoring it on the way down. Recent surveys have given a split picture on consumer confidence. Last week, the University of Michigans index of consumer sentiment hit the highest level since July 2005. But numbers released by the Conference Board this week showed that consumer confidence waned in October. Consumers arent expecting the economy to take off, nor are they expecting it to head into a recession, said Lynn Franco, director of the consumer research center at the Conference Board. Ms. Franco said that consumer spending was not likely to show big gains in the next few months. She forecast growth through the rest of the year as basically more or less the same. For the holiday shopping season, that could spell trouble for retailers. But the always-resilient American consumer is a hard animal to predict. Betting against Christmas is a loser, Mr. Barbera said. Despite the restrained consumer spending and conflicting signals on consumer confidence, wages have risen. The Labor Department reported yesterday that the average hourly wages of American workers rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter. But productivity was surprisingly unchanged; economists had expected about a 1 percent gain. Economists said that two forces appeared to be at work: a slowing economy that was dragging output down and a tight labor market that was driving costs up. Slowing growth leads to falling productivity, and that is exactly what is now happening, Joel L. Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors, said in a research note. Even though labor compensation increased less rapidly, it was still fast enough to continue the ominous surge in unit labor costs that began last year. Though rising labor costs mean that American workers are earning more, higher wages can also lead to higher prices for goods and services. And the Federal Reserve is closely watching data on inflation as it decides whether to resume raising interest rates, keep them steady or start cutting them to stimulate the economy. The Labor Department report showed that higher pay and flat productivity combined to produce a higher jump than expected in one measure of inflation, unit labor costs, which rose 3.8 percent in the third quarter, at an annual rate. The broader slowing of the economy also manifested itself in new statistics on manufacturing released yesterday by the Commerce Department. Factory orders rose 2.1 percent in September, less than expected, and nearly all of the increase was accounted for by a cluster of orders for large aircraft.

Even so, the cruise lines are barely keeping up with demand for around-the-world trips, Travel &amp; Leisure writes. Fifteen years ago, only one company offered world itineraries; today four do, Jeff Wise reports, adding that capacity will nearly double by the end of next year. Whats driving demand? In large part, aging baby boomers who have free time and disposable cash. Theyre getting to that phase of their life where they have more time and money, says Andrew Poulton, the director for marketing at Regent Seven Seas Cruises. The article continues that theyre not at a time in their lives when theyre looking to endure great physical rigors in their pursuit of new experiences. Despite the name, world cruises dont necessarily go all around the world. Mr. Wise notes, however, that they usually have several features in common: They always leave in the first half of January, to take advantage of the most favorable weather in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. They cross the equator at least twice, and usually cover more than 30,000 miles and 30 to 45 ports in between. The journeys typically last 80 to 126 days. (EXTREMELY) FINE DINING It seems every celebrity chef has opened a restaurant in Las Vegas. But if you want the best Chinese food in town, you need to be a very aggressive gambler, Gourmet reports. The highest of the high rollers  the so-called whales  are taken with utmost seriousness, by the casinos and so is what they eat, writes Max Jacobson. And since, as Mr. Jacobson explains, the majority of the whales now hail from Chinese-speaking parts of Asia, the casinos have created exclusive Chinese restaurants where the largest bettors can order anything they want  be it cognac that goes for $5,000 a bottle at retail, sea horse soup, or sweet and sour pork  free. Just how big a gambler do you need to gain entry to one of these restaurants? The Paiza Club, a by-invitation-only facility on the top of the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, caters to players who gamble at the million-dollar-plus level. THE CHATTY SKIES? Ready or not, cellphone use in airplanes is inching closer to reality, Condé Nast Traveller reports, adding that sometime early in 2007, if all goes according to plan, several European airlines will take part in an experiment that permits thousands of passengers in Europe to use their cellphones at 30,000 feet. And while the test will be confined to Europe, on select Air France, BMI and TAP Portugal flights, Barbara S. Peterson reports that the Federal Communications Commission is now reconsidering its ban on cellphone use after the development of a new technology that reduces the chances that calls made in the sky will cause interference with those made on the ground. The F.C.C.s announcement that it was rethinking its ban generated some 8,000 comments. Most of those were opposed to a change in policy because of the prospect of hundreds of passengers simultaneously shrieking, Can you hear me? into their phones. FINAL TAKE.

The results from the company, which is the nation’s largest wholesale club operator, beat Wall Street estimates. Shares of Costco rose $3.83, or 7.7 percent, to close at $53.90. Also on Thursday, Costco said that a special committee, an independent counsel and forensics experts had found no evidence of fraud in an internal review of the company’s stock option grant practices. But the company did note that in several cases, the review could not precisely determine the date on which certain options were granted  only a range of dates. The company said its net income was $355.6 million, or 75 cents a share, for the 17-week period ended Sept. 3, compared with $354.7 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. The year-ago period was a week shorter and included several one-time expenses. Excluding those items, the company said it earned 66 cents a share in the 2005 quarter. Revenue, including sales and membership fees, increased 19 percent, to $19.9 billion, compared with $16.7 billion last year. Sales at warehouses open at least a year increased 8 percent. In a conference call with analysts, James D. Sinegal, the chief executive, said the company’s expectations for the holiday shopping season had improved in recent weeks. “At the moment, we think Christmas looks promising, certainly more promising than we thought five or six weeks ago,” Mr. Sinegal said. Costco, based in Issaquah, Wash., opened 27 stores in fiscal 2006. Costco expects to open 37 stores in fiscal 2007 and even more in 2008. In the options matter, the company said the panel found that none of the options in question was issued to Costco’s chief executive, chairman or nonemployee directors, except in April 1997, when the chief executive and chairman received grants that may have benefited each by up to $200,000. While giving Costco credit for being forthcoming about the investigation, Bob Toomey, senior vice president at E. K. Riley Investors, said that he was concerned and that he thought the disclosure might prompt a government investigation. “When there’s imprecision there, you wonder, ‘Is there more to it than this?’ ” Mr. Toomey said.

Skip to next paragraph Thomas McDonald for The New York Times Kathy Augistitus and her daughter, Marissa, 4, scan a bar code with a Shopping Buddy device at the Super Stop &amp; Shop in Seymour, Conn. Readers’ Opinions Share Your Thoughts What features would you like to see in the supermarket of the future? Post a Comment I HAD just pushed my shopping cart past a pyramid of Wheat Thins when the global positioning device attached to the handle went off like a slot machine. My Shopping Buddy demanded attention. Wheat Thins were 50 cents off! I reached for a box, and with a swipe of a wireless wand the crackers were mine. I wouldnt even have to talk to a checker on the way out the door. The Shopping Buddy did a lot more before my trip through the Super Stop &amp; Shop was over. I punched in an order for a half pound of freshly sliced turkey, and the device told me when it was ready. It offered a map of the store, showing me where I was in relation to the deli. It kept a running total of my purchases, and every item I scanned was recorded and stored in case someone needed it later. (I didnt want to think about who.) The store had plenty of services beyond my Buddy. I could rent a DVD, browse the olive bar, do some banking, design a bouquet, pick up a dozen pens from the Staples office supply section, and fortify myself with a cruller and a cup of coffee from Dunkin Donuts. And, being that I was there for groceries, I could also buy bread and milk. The modern supermarket, which began when King Kullen opened in Queens 76 years ago, is suffering from an identity crisis. Specialty markets and the eco-juggernaut that is Whole Foods are peeling off customers, and low-price superstores like Wal-Mart and Target and warehouse clubs like Costco are taking others. Even Home Depot and Amazon.com are getting into the grocery game. At the rate things are going, traditional stores will have only a 44 percent share of the food market by 2010, down from the current 51 percent, according to a report on the future of food retailing by Willard Bishop, an industry analysis company in Barrington, Ill. The classic supermarket is adrift, unsure of how to hold shoppers who are demanding nicer stores, organic produce, hearth-baked bread and artisanal cheeses (and the implied affluence that comes with them), all without paying too much. After all, everyone likes a bargain at the grocery store. The traditional supermarket is struggling to not only find an identity for itself but also to find an identity with shoppers, said Phil Lempert, an industry consultant from Southern California who is known as the Supermarket Guru. I think they got lazy for a long time. Thats why were seeing these problems. Supermarkets, of which there are about 34,000 in this country, are throwing everything they can think of at shoppers. And the range of services is as impressive as it is improbable. Kroger shoppers can buy gasoline. The health-minded customer at Giant Super Foods in Camp Hill, Pa., can consult with a staff nutritionist. At a Food Lion in North Carolina, an automated health clinic spits out blood pressure information and reads glucose meters. At some Publix stores in Florida, ornery children can wile away the shopping trip in car-shaped carts equipped with small screens that run episodes of shows like Bob the Builder. And some changes are actually about the food. Grocery marketers believe the way to a shoppers wallet is to provide meal solutions, a phrase that implies that meals are some kind of problem. To that end, stores are collecting all the ingredients for one meal at a kiosk, offering samples and the recipe so shoppers dont have to cruise the aisles. The noncook is being avidly courted, too. Sections devoted to prepared foods are becoming more elaborate, and they are as likely to offer Mexican, Indian and Thai food as they are rotisserie chicken. In the produce department, where the offerings have grown from about 40 items in the early 1980s to more than 400 in some stores, the power of produce has become a rallying cry. Ninety-seven percent of supermarkets have vowed to improve perishables as a way to pull out of the slump, according to the Food Marketing Institute. Freshness, and a desire to lure Hispanic customers, who spend on average $40 more a week than other shoppers, are driving some stores. They include the ones in the Liborio Markets chain, which is based in Pasadena, Calif., and which plans to open several stores in Colorado. Liborio features agua fresca bars, tortilla-making stations and a room where chickens can be slaughtered and sold the same day. 1 2 3Next Page » More Articles in Dining &amp; Wine »</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/17/nyregion/17costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Fails Again in Bid for a Manhattan Foothold<date>Published: September 17, 2006</date><text>For nearly a decade, Costco, the popular national wholesale club, has been trying to enter the lucrative Manhattan market. In the 1990s, after encountering vocal opposition from local residents and politicians, Costco abandoned several efforts to open on the West Side  on 14th Street, 23rd Street or 55th Street  with a smaller model about half the size of its typical warehouse store. Despite those failed proposals, which the company attributed to construction costs rather than community reaction, Costco had counted on being one of two anchor stores at East River Plaza, the long-stalled shopping center along Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in East Harlem. Costco, along with Home Depot, was part of the deal when the City Council approved the land-use plan for the 485,000-square-foot shopping center in 1999. Last month, however, Jeffrey H. Brotman, Costcos chairman, took a call at his headquarters in Issaquah, Wash., from Bruce C. Ratner and Edward Blumenfeld, the developers of East River Plaza. Target, not Costco, would open a 135,000-square-foot store on the second floor of the shopping center, and there was no chance for a counteroffer because the lease had been signed. I was really angry, Mr. Brotman said. From Bruce I didnt expect it. In blunt terms that retailers rarely use in public, Mr. Brotman said there was only one explanation for why his company lost the chance to lease space at the shopping center, which is scheduled to open in about two years. Its all about money, he said. Thats all its about. Referring to Target, he said, I suspect they didnt care what they had to pay for entry into Manhattan. But Mr. Blumenfelds son, David, who has shepherded the project since their company bought the site in 1994, said Costco was never able to close the deal because Mr. Brotman kept coming up with new issues to argue about, including the width of the parking spaces, the thickness of the floor, and the number of elevators. He was told numerous times: We cant wait. Weve got to move this project along,  Mr. Blumenfeld said. He said Costco was informed in February that if the deal was not completed in a month, a replacement tenant would be found. It wasnt a rent issue, Mr. Blumenfeld said. It was about, What is this project going to cost?  It took only 45 days to negotiate the Target lease, he said. Executives at Forest City Ratner, which is also the development partner in building a Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company, declined to comment. Target officials did not return telephone calls, but Peter Ripka, the companys New York broker, said, When retailers and developers are motivated to close out deals, things can happen very quickly. Putting a big-box store in a densely packed urban neighborhood usually poses challenges that retailers do not encounter in the suburbs, where space is easier to come by and stores are not usually stacked on top of one another. The Blumenfeld Development Group lined up Costco, Home Depot and Best Buy years ago for the shopping center, on the site of the former Washburn Wire Factory between 116th and 119th Streets. But then a snag developed over the financing of a $45 million parking garage. The retailers eventually agreed to charge customers a parking fee of $3 for the first two hours, but then negotiations over the leases had to begin anew. Late last year, Home Depot agreed to take 110,000 square feet of space, slightly more than its typical suburban store. Mr. Brotman said in January that he, too, was on the verge of signing a lease. But Mr. Brotman said the lease had been held up because the design was modified to support residential units above the stores. Though housing was not part of the plan that was approved by the City Council, city officials asked for a structure that would be strong enough to accommodate extra floors at some point in the future, Mr. Blumenfeld said. Mr. Blumenfeld said Costco took its time because it was a sought-after tenant. Theyre the 800-pound gorilla in the retail world, he said. They do it at their pace, their speed. He said Target had more experience than Costco with urban settings. Target has six stores in the city, including one in the Bronx that straddles a piece of the Marble Hill section of Manhattan, and two more are under construction. Their mentality is: Weve lived with this before. Lets get it done,  Mr. Blumenfeld said. But Mr. Brotman said Costco, which has three other stores in New York City, occupies basement space in Vancouver. Were well aware of the issues of coexistence with other stores and with residential above, he said. He said the wholesale club was still determined to open in Manhattan. Over the years, he said, weve probably looked at 50 different possibilities. He said he would be in New York next month  once again to search for a Manhattan site.

For many shoppers, particularly mothers with small children, it is the first organic product they try. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Growing Sales Enlarge This Image Matthew Staver for The New York Times Aurora Organic Dairy has a 3,200-cow farm in Kersey, Colo., designed to allow for daily access to pasture. Now organic milk is about to become much more widely available, as Wal-Mart rolls out its own organic brand, which will be cheaper than similar milk on the market. But critics worry that what consumers will be getting is a diluted form of organic milk. Sold under Wal-Marts popular Great Value label, half-gallon cartons of the milk have been quietly introduced at 1,200 supercenters and Neighborhood Markets, according to a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Karen Burk. Wal-Marts own organic milk is likely to create stiff competition for many other makers of organic milk  which comes from cows that have not been treated with hormones or antibiotics  and even sellers of conventional milk. Harvey Hartman, president of the Hartman Group, a market research firm working with Wal-Mart on its organic initiatives, said Wal-Marts own brand of organic milk will mean a lot more will be sold in the United States. Theyre creating incremental users because theyre removing one of the big inhibitors to buying organic, which is price, he said. Last year, organic milk sales increased by 25 percent from the year before and Mr. Hartman predicts that Wal-Marts brand could lift annual growth to as much as 35 percent. Currently, organic dairy represents 3.5 percent of all dairy products sold in the United States, according to the Organic Trade Association. The organic milk Wal-Mart is selling under its own label comes from Aurora Organic Dairy, which also supplies Safeway, Costco, Target and Wild Oats with their store brands of organic milk. But Wal-Marts entry into the market stirs greater attention from critics. Activist groups, as well as some organic food retailers and dairies, contend that the company where Wal-Mart and the other big retailers get their milk operates large factory farms that are diluting the principles of organic agriculture and delivering customers a substandard product. They argue that Auroras cows do not spend any significant time roaming pastures and eating fresh grass; instead they live on a diet high in grains. They are trying to cut corners in the interest of producing milk as cheaply as possible, said Mark Kastel, senior farm analyst at the Cornucopia Institute, which represents organic family farmers. Wal-Mart and its supplier say that those allegations are misleading and that Auroras two farms in Colorado and Texas are in full compliance with Agriculture Department standards for organic dairy. Executives at Aurora, which is based in Boulder, Colo., acknowledge that their farms, with 4,000 cows in Platteville, Colo., and 3,300 in Dublin, Tex., are among the largest organic dairy operations in the country. But they say their animals are healthy and contented and that the companys organic milk is of the highest quality. Wal-Marts buying power is certainly cutting the cost of its organic milk. An informal survey of organic milk at Denver area grocery stores found that Wal-Marts label was 8 percent to 35 percent cheaper than other brands. At Wal-Mart, it was selling for an average of 10 percent less than Horizon Organic milk, the brand Wal-Mart has been carrying for three years. The controversy turns on how closely Aurora adheres to the principles behind the organic food movement. Many organic farmers say grass feeding is essential for organic dairy production because it is part of a cows natural behavior. Milk from grass-fed cows, they say, is also higher in beneficial fatty acids than milk from cows fed grain, making it more nutritious. At Auroras Platteville operation, about 40 miles north of downtown Denver, 4,000 cows are put on grass only when not being milked or when they are nearing the end of a lactation cycle. That totals about two to three months a year. The rest of the time they stay in dirt-lined outdoor pens where they eat from an ample trough filled with a mixture of hay, silage, corn and soybeans. Clark F. Driftmier, head of marketing at Aurora, said the company planned to reduce the number of cows in Platteville to 1,000 by next summer so all the animals could graze. In addition, he said, the number of acres of pasture at the Texas farm will triple by next spring. The company, he added, is opening a 3,200-cow dairy farm in Kersey, Colo., that has been designed to allow for year-round daily access to pasture. Mr. Driftmier acknowledges these changes are being made partly in anticipation of the Agriculture Departments plans to tighten rules requiring more grazing for milk to be called organic. Mr. Kastel of Cornucopia calls Auroras efforts greenwashing. He says the farms acreage per cow will still be low and that the company is overtaxing its animals by milking them three times a day instead of twice, which is the norm at organic farms. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/nyregion/08mbrfs-005.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Manhattan: Change in Anchor Store for Shopping Center<date>Published: September 8, 2006</date><text>East River Plaza, the long-delayed shopping center that is being built along Franklin D.

The retailer said that it expected earnings of 68 to 71 cents a share for the fourth quarter, which ends Sunday, including 3 cents a share in costs for an income tax reserve. Analysts, on average, had expected 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The warning took analysts by surprise; Costcos sales growth has been among the strongest in the retail sector. The company posted another solid performance for August yesterday, with sales up a better-than-expected 7 percent at stores open at least a year. Anthony Chukumba, an analyst with Morningstar, said, This could be an early sign that the higher-income consumer is finally starting to feel a bit of a pinch. Those higher-income shoppers have proved resilient in the face of steep energy prices over the last year, but as the housing market slows, Wall Street has been worried that upscale retailers would start to suffer. Lower-priced chains like Wal-Mart Stores have been feeling that pressure for more than a year because their lower-income customers are most sensitive to rising costs. Costco executives said they were also seeing some signs of a spending pullback, particularly on expensive, nonessential items like furniture costing more than $1,000, electronics and jewelry. The company said total sales for the four weeks that ended last Sunday rose 11 percent, to $4.55 billion, with particularly strong demand in its foreign stores. An analyst with Lazard Capital Markets, Todd Slater, said the sales growth was in line with his expectations and better than many on Wall Street had expected. The company could begin to suffer from a decline in higher-margin discretionary spending due to slowing economic growth and a deceleration in the housing market, causing a less favorable sales mix and pressuring margins, he wrote. Shares of Costco declined $2.07 yesterday, to $47.18.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia This year, the number of TV models in the United States that use glass cathode-ray tubes to produce an image has been reduced sharply. By next year, even fewer C.R.T. televisions will be made, and fewer retailers will sell them. After the holidays, the days of picture-tube TVs are gone, said Geoff Shavey, the TV buyer for Costco. One year from now, we will not sell picture-tube TVs. Costco, a discount warehouse chain, , has already cut its picture-tube offerings to three models this year, from 10 in 2005. Instead, Costco and other retailers are selling growing numbers of wide-screen plasma and liquid-crystal display flat-panel TVs, which are more expensive than traditional TVs. But prices for both types continue to drop: 42-inch plasma TVs can be bought for less than $2,000, and the smallest flat-panel sets will soon be fairly close in price to their tube counterparts. Mr. Shavey said that a 32-inch wide-screen L.C.D. television was available for $700 at his stores, within striking distance of a tube set of similar size. But he added, The demand for picture-tube TVs is far off from what it was one year ago. One reason is that flat-panel TVs make a strong design statement, prompting women to want to swap their old sets for sleeker ones, said Mike Vitelli, a senior vice president at Best Buy. For the first time in history, women care about the TV that comes in the house, Mr. Vitelli said. Men are not just getting permission to buy a flat-screen TV  theyre getting directed to do so. Soon, he said, Best Buy will sell picture-tube TVs only under its Insignia house label. Consumer electronics companies also want out of the tube TV business, in part because profit margins have become so thin. The government has mandated that all TVs eventually include a built-in digital tuner to receive over-the-air digital broadcasts, and while even picture-tube sets are being made compliant, manufacturers would rather switch to selling thin-panel TVs, which can generate bigger profits. The end of picture-tube TVs is accelerating faster than a lot of us expected, said Randy Waynick, a senior vice president for Sony Electronics. The company, which offered 10 tube models two years ago, will pare that number to two next year, both of them wide screens. Picture-tube TV sales reductions were far greater than forecast, Mr. Waynick said. Even if the profit margins were healthy, picture-tube TVs would be ill-suited for a market that wants ever-larger screens. Picture-tube TVs were once made as large as 40 inches corner to corner, but the units were the size of baby elephants, sometimes weighing hundreds of pounds and protruding several feet from the wall. Panasonic is getting out of the picture-tube business altogether. A year ago, the company offered 30 picture-tube models in the United States; now it sells one, a 20-inch analog set. This year will be the last year for Panasonic picture-tube TVs, said Andrew Nelkin, a Panasonic vice president. Toshiba has cut its picture-tube models to 13  from 35 last year  and expects the number in 2007 to be significantly reduced, said Scott Ramirez, a vice president of marketing. Beyond 2007, the picture-tube business is very questionable for any company, he said. Picture-tube TVs represented 78 percent of the market in 2004 but will account for only 54 percent this year, according to the Consumer Electronics Association, a trade group. In the same period, sales of flat-panel units have jumped from 12 percent of all TVs sold to an expected 37 percent this year. Front- and rear-projection TVs will account for about 9 percent of sales in 2006, according to the group. C.R.T. as a technology is fading out of the market, said Sean Wargo, director of industry analysis for the association. The ascendance of flat-panel TVs signals another sea change for the TV industry: the switch from somewhat square screens to wide rectangular ones. The vast majority of flat-panel TVs are built in a wide-screen shape that allows movies to fill all or most of the screen. More television series are being produced for this format, and consumers are growing more accustomed to viewing programs this way, electronics executives say. A wide screen gives a much more impressive picture, Mr. Shavey said. New technologies seldom replace their predecessors entirely, and picture-tube TVs will still be available for those who prefer them. But they will increasingly be available only in discount stores, where they will be sold under house brand names and by less prominent manufacturers like Funai, which owns the Symphonic, Sylvania and Emerson brands. We think there is a continual business for us in C.R.T. TVs, said Greg Bosler, executive vice president of the TTE Corporation, which owns the RCA brand. Mr. Bosler, who counts Wal-Mart as a key customer for its TVs, noted that a 27-inch L.C.D. TV was still priced around $800, while an RCA digital picture-tube set of the same size could be bought for $350; an analog version was $240. Even so, the company expects to double its flat-panel offerings next year. It will reduce its tube models to about 15 in 2007, from 26 this year.

The company also increased its revenue forecast, and shares closed up 5.2 percent for the day. Kroger's net income for the quarter increased to $306.4 million, or 42 cents a share, from $294.3 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 8.2 percent, to $19.4 billion. Same-store sales, or stores open at least a year, set the best pace since 1999, climbing 5.6 percent in the quarter, excluding fuel sales. Kroger raised its estimate for same-store sales growth to 4.5 percent, from 3.5 percent, for the 12 months ending Feb. 3. The company, which is based in Cincinnati, has cut prices, reduced wait times at checkout counters, and added more organic foods and fuel stations to compete with companies like Wal-Mart Stores and Costco Wholesale. "The sales growth we achieved was solidly across all store departments and across geography," David B. Dillon, Kroger's chief executive, said in a conference call with investors and analysts. "We are getting our best customers to shop more often with us." Excluding a 3-cent expense for legal costs, Kroger said, it would have earned 45 cents a share. Kroger said it was putting aside money related to accusations that it illegally hired hundreds of workers during a labor dispute in 2003 and 2004. Prosecutors may seek as much as $100 million in back pay for union workers and additional fines, according to a 53-count federal indictment issued in Los Angeles in December.

The shopper, 38, whom the police declined to name, left the Costco discount warehouse on Route 110 in Melville about 1:45 p.m. After strapping her sleeping daughter into a car seat and turning on the air-conditioning, she then loaded her groceries into her 1997 black Grand Prix and returned her shopping cart to a carrel about 20 feet away, the police said. When she turned back to her car, she saw a man behind the wheel, said Detective Sgt. Bruce Markgraf of the Suffolk County Police Department. The carjacker locked the doors and tried to drive away, but the mother grabbed the door handle. She was dragged a short distance before falling to the ground, receiving cuts and bruises, he said. The police were notified right after the carjacking and began searching the neighborhood. They found the Grand Prix about 10 minutes later, behind a factory a half-mile east of the shopping center on Ruland Road. The child was still in her car seat. She was uninjured but had awakened. "She was crying hysterically," Sergeant Markgraf said. The carjacker was described as a white male in his 30's, at least six feet tall and clean shaven. He was wearing a dark baseball cap and either a denim jacket, a hooded sweatshirt, or both. If found, he could be charged with robbery, unlawful imprisonment and endangering the welfare of a child, the police said. The police said that there had been no other carjackings in that area in recent memory.

The company reported net income of $235.6 million, or 49 cents a share, versus a prior-year profit of $209.8 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue in the period, which ended May 7, rose to $13.27 billion from $12 billion. Sales in stores open at least one year rose 7 percent during the quarter. The profit fell short of the 50 cents a share expected by analysts, and shares of Costco fell 72 cents, to $52.84. The company, which is based in Issaquah, also reported that in May sales at stores open at least a year increased 10 percent.

Skip to next paragraph Peter DaSilva for The New York Times Picasso's daughter said this week that both the drawing and its authentification certificate, above, were fakes. The pronouncement came three weeks after Ms. Widmaier-Picasso declared two other drawings offered as Picassos at Costco's Web site to be fake: a sketch of a face, sold in 2005 to a man from Newport Beach, Calif., and one of a bullfight, which was not sold and has been withdrawn from the site, www.costco.com. Costco officials said this week that they were conducting an inquiry into the authenticity of the three drawings and had offered customers full refunds for the two disputed Picasso drawings that were sold. The San Francisco physician, Dr. Frank Zhang, who paid $37,000 for his drawing, contacted The New York Times after reading about the two other sketches that Ms. Widmaier-Picasso declared to be copies. He said he was worried that his sketch might also not be genuine. In a telephone interview this week, he said he had long been a fan of both Picasso and Costco, where he has shopped frequently. While Costco is better known for its bulk offerings of paper towels and other household staples, it has successfully sold fine art, mostly lithographs, for several years on the Web and at road shows. Dr. Zhang said that when he learned of Costco's art offerings, he contacted the wholesaler and was among the first customers to buy an original work. "You feel so proud to have a real Picasso piece," he said of his crayon drawing, dated Nov. 23, 1964, on a title page torn from a book about Picasso. After reading articles in The Times about the two other drawings, Dr. Zhang sent the newspaper digital photographs of his own sketch and its accompanying certificate, which appeared to be written and signed by Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, who lives in Paris. The photos were printed out in Paris and mailed this week to Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, 70, who said in a telephone interview that "the certificate is a fake, ditto the signature, ditto the spelling, ditto the drawing." Last month, she explained to The Times that she wrote her authenticating certificates with no breaks between paragraphs and always spelled the month out in letters, never in numbers. The certificate for Dr. Zhang's drawing has breaks between paragraphs and is dated with numbers and slashes. In the interview this week, she also pointed to several similarities between Dr. Zhang's certificate and the ones that accompanied the drawings she had viewed last month and declared to be fakes. These included two recurrent French grammatical errors and a similar handwriting. All three Picasso drawings offered by Costco were supplied by Jim Tutwiler, a dealer in Boca Raton, Fla., who bought them from Rick Yamet, a fine-art vendor in Peekskill, N.Y. Mr. Yamet has said that he bought them from a dealer in Rome. Costco's senior vice president for Internet commerce, Ginnie Roeglin, said this week that the company was looking into the dealer in Rome, whom she declined to identify. Reached by phone, Mr. Tutwiler refused to comment about Dr. Zhang's drawing, saying he had been asked by Costco not to speak about the issue. But he did say that he had hired a private detective to investigate Ms. Widmaier-Picasso. In an e-mail message to Dr. Zhang in 2004 shortly before the physician bought the drawing, Mr. Tutwiler referred to Ms. Widmaier-Picasso as "the world's utmost authority on the work of her father." But in an interview this week he described her as unreliable. Art scholars have occasionally dissented from her attributions and de-attributions, although rarely publicly, and she continues to authenticate works for Sotheby's and Christie's. Dr. Zhang said he fervently hoped his Picasso was authentic. He even offered to fly to Paris with Costco officials or with Mr. Tutwiler to seek a second opinion from Ms. Widmaier-Picasso. Costco demurred, however, and has instead offered to return his money so it can take possession of the sketch to seek a definitive verdict on its authenticity. If the drawing turns out to be real, Costco would then give him the first chance to buy it back. On Thursday, he agreed to the proposal. "I still love Costco," he said. "I know they will do the right thing." Ms. Widmaier-Picasso said Dr. Zhang's drawing "is an imitation of a Picasso, that's all." She sighed. "My father made thousands of drawings, lots of which were similar," she said. "This is a head that must have been copied, but it was badly copied." Noting that the faun had no horns, she added, "Don't worry, they'll grow!" Randy Kennedy reported from New York for this article, and Daphné Anglès from Paris.

Trader Joe's, a California-based grocer of antic charm and discount prices, opened its first store in the city, in Union Square, to the giddy excitement of the long-since converted and a few startled novices. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Lucian Read for The New York Times The foodies lined up for the premiere of Trader Joe's, which opened 10 minutes early. Our new blog takes a look at the race for mayor in New Jersey's largest city, and the colorful characters and moments that drive the campaign.  Video: Newark Primer Enlarge This Image Lucian Read for The New York Times Employees welcomed shoppers with applause Friday as New York City's first Trader Joe's opened in Union Square, Manhattan. A store is a store, and Manhattan has plenty of them: specialty foods, discount foods and everything in between, from caviar emporiums to Bangkok grocers. But foodies have been looking forward to Trader Joe's for weeks, and while the crush may soon lessen, the crowd was cheek-by-jowl for opening day. Everyone was happy, for 40 minutes at least. Under sunny skies, scores of Trader Joe's fans lined up on East 14th Street an hour before the store's scheduled opening at 9 a.m. They smiled at television camera crews and bounced up and down on the balls of their feet. Some begged for the store to begin business early. It did, by 10 minutes. But this being New York, with lines for the cash registers already snaking around the store, an annoyed middle-aged woman bellowed to those in front of her  at 9:30 a.m., to be precise  "So, you going to move or what?" And thus the day went, Manhattan impatience mixed with dried hibiscus flowers, a specialty sweet of Trader Joe's. "It's my favorite store in the world," declared Barry Lapidus, 47, a freelance writer in Brooklyn. "I used to take a train and a bus for two and a half hours to the Trader Joe's in Hartsdale" in Westchester County. Why? "Why?" he exclaimed. "They have the best minestrone soup and egg rolls. The egg rolls are better than you can get in a Chinese restaurant." Loni Sherman, a retired food-service manager who lives nearby in Peter Cooper Village, said her friends were planning a Trader Joe's party, at which mass quantities of Trader Joe's products would be consumed at will. Steven Arvanites, 40, a Manhattan screenwriter, had never been to a Trader Joe's. "This is like a designer Costco," he said. Trader Joe's built its reputation, in part, on Two Buck Chuck, a wine that sells for $1.99 a bottle in most places, but costs more on the East Coast. (The nearby wine shop is still being built and will open soon.) Shoppers love the prices. "Daffodils, $1.49; I'm saving a buck," said Dr. Jacqueline Stevens, a physician who lives on the Upper East Side. Of course, not everything at Trader Joe's is inexpensive. The organic free-range chicken costs $2.49 a pound, or $12.33 for a whole chicken. Walnut halves, for tossed salads, cost $5.29 a pound. The Union Square store is the 253rd of a chain based in Monrovia, Calif., that has spread to 19 states. The original Trader Joe was Joe Coulombe, who started a chain of convenience stores called Pronto Markets in the Los Angeles area. By the 1960's, he expanded the stores' offerings and emphasized in-store labels (more than 80 percent of its products are now Trader Joe-related brands) and health foods. Mr. Coulombe, who sold the company, introduced a tiki-room theme, with employees wearing Hawaiian shirts and leis. The chain is now owned by the two billionaires who own the Aldi Group, a food conglomerate in Essen, Germany. Doug Rauch, Trader Joe's president, said yesterday that the chain had long had its eye on the city. But it was hard to find a spot with high foot traffic that would also not charge ruinously high rent, Mr. Rauch said. Trader Joe's, however, found an agreeable landlord in New York University. "We were able to work out a deal with N.Y.U. that made sense for them and made sense for us," Mr. Rauch said. "It's a deal that allows us to have the same prices here that we have everywhere else on the East Coast. We haven't raised our prices a nickel for Manhattan." Trader Joe's plans other stores soon in the city, if it can find equally agreeable landlords. John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said the university is charging market rent for Palladium Hall, where Trader Joe's 12,000-square-foot store is located. He declined to be more specific. But, he added, "We wanted to add luster to the Union Square neighborhood." One thing worrying shoppers yesterday is where Trader Joe's could find friendly clerks in flinty Manhattan. Jennifer Swanhart, 32, a Trader Joe's clerk, commutes for an hour from Brewster, N.Y., more than 45 miles away, to work in Union Square. Finding suitable Manhattan employees will not be hard, she said, because "there are nice people everywhere." Frank Iacovello, a senior clerk, noted there is a store dress code. "Anybody who likes to wear a Hawaiian shirt is going to be cool," he said. Rachel Metz contributed reporting for this article.

Skip to next paragraph Forum: Artists and Exhibitions Costco A contested Picasso sketch purchased through Costco last year. Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, 70, was asked to view a digital image of the 1970 drawing three days after she pronounced two other Picassos inauthentic that had been offered by the same American dealer who sold the drawing. Those two works, photographs of which were shown to her by The New York Times, were offered by the dealer with certificates in French saying that Ms. Widmaier-Picasso had authenticated them. Pointing to anomalies in the certificates  grammatical errors, wording that departed from her style, handwriting that did not match hers and the placement of words on the page  the artist's daughter said both documents were forgeries. One of the sketches, a 1963 drawing of a bullfight that was being offered through Costco for $146,000, was removed from the company's retail Web site, www.costco.com, after The Times informed Costco of Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's contention. Since then, Costco has been bombarded with inquiries about how it screens the fine art offered through its Web site and at "special events" at its store outlets. As the company investigates Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's assertions, it has emphasized that any of its merchandise can be returned. The other drawing that Ms. Widmaier-Picasso examined on Tuesday was presented to her in error. The drawing's supplier, Jim Tutwiler of Boca Raton, Fla., had provided it to The Times and misidentified it as the one sold through Costco to the California man, Louis Knickerbocker of Newport Beach. Yesterday, upon viewing the correct image of the work that Mr. Knickerbocker owns  a crayon drawing of a face dated 1970  Ms. Widmaier-Picasso said immediately, "Ah yes, Arias, my father's barber." After inspecting it rapidly, the artist's daughter, a stocky, ebullient woman who strongly resembles her father, declared the work to be a fake  a copy of a genuine Picasso. She arose, went into another room and returned with a catalog depicting works from the Eugenio Arias Collection, which resides in the permanent collection of the Picasso Museum of Buitrago del Lozoya, a town near Madrid. The museum was founded in 1985, three years after Mr. Arias, the artist's longtime barber and a native of Biutrago, donated his small Picasso collection  "lots of little things given to him by my father," Ms. Widmaier-Picasso said. She turned to a catalog page with a sketch of Mr. Arias's face that closely resembled the one sold to Mr. Knickerbocker. It bore the same date: Nov. 29, 1970. She explained that Picasso sketched the barber's face on the title page of a short play he had written, "The Burial of the Count of Orgaz," a copy of which he dedicated to Mr. Arias. Picasso's handwriting was markedly different from the writing on the work sold through Costco, Ms. Widmaier-Picasso pointed out  especially the way he formed the R and the S in "Arias." In the sketch reproduced in the catalog, she noted, the R had a loop, and the S was rounded; in Mr. Knickerbocker's drawing, the letters are not articulated as clearly. And in the date, Picasso's 9 had a full circle at the top of the vertical line, she noted, whereas the circle in the image shown was open. Throughout the works in the catalog, the lettering of every "Arias" was consistent  and unlike the "Arias" scrawled on Mr. Knickerbocker's drawing. Told of Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's finding by telephone, Costco's senior vice president for e-commerce, Ginnie Roeglin, abruptly ended the conversation. Later she released a statement saying: "To the best of our knowledge, Maya Picasso has not reviewed the certificates of authenticity bearing her signature for two Picasso pieces that we have sold. Our sources continue to assure us that the certificates as well as the art are genuine." It was not clear exactly what Picassos Ms. Roeglin was referring to  the ones viewed by the artist's daughter on Tuesday and Friday, or others sold through Costco. Calls to her later were not returned. Her statement said that Costco was still investigating "to resolve the questions" raised by Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's remarks and that any Picassos sold by the store chain could be returned for a full refund. Calls to Jim Sinegal, Costco's chief executive, were not returned yesterday. Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, who has authenticated works for Sotheby's and Christie's, says she keeps a detailed record on every photographic certificate she issues. She staples a sticker to the back of each one, marked with one or more of her fingerprints, she says, and keeps a record of which fingers were used in each case. Art scholars have occasionally dissented from her attributions and deattributions, although rarely publicly. But in any case, Ms. Widmaier-Picasso has challenged certificates of authenticity bearing her name that she was shown this week in digital form. She has not seen a photograph of the one provided to Mr. Knickerbocker. Costco declined again yesterday to provide an image of the certificate, and Mr. Knickerbocker did not return phone calls. Repeated knocks on the door of his Spanish-style house in Newport Beach went unanswered late yesterday morning. Mr. Tutwiler has said that the bullfight drawing that he consigned to Costco was supplied by Rick Yamet, an art dealer in Peekskill, N.Y. Mr. Tutwiler refused to speak with a reporter on Thursday, and Mr. Yamet did not return calls Thursday or yesterday. On Wednesday, Mr. Yamet said he was "beside himself" over the situation and would investigate the matter with an associate in Rome. By Thursday afternoon, two days after Costco removed Mr. Tutwiler's Picasso bullfight drawing from its Web site, the rest of Mr. Tutwiler's fine-art inventory at Costco, including three prints attributed to Picasso and three to Miró, had been removed. Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's Left Bank apartment overlooking the Seine, meanwhile, was largely bare of Picassos yesterday  indeed, of any paintings or other works. She said the walls had been bared in preparation for redecoration. Asked if she knew roughly how many drawings or sketches Picasso had left behind, Ms. Widmaier-Picasso fired back, "You tell me how many hairs you have on your head!"

Art Sale in Doubt<date>Published: March 16, 2006</date><text>Skip to next paragraph Forum: Artists and Exhibitions Corrections Appended From diamonds to dog food to Dom Pérignon Champagne, Costco is known as an astute marketer of high and low. Recently, it even ventured into the rarefied world of Picasso, selling a crayon drawing at its Web site for a bargain $39,999.99. The buyer, Louis Knickerbocker, a meat distributor from Newport Beach, Calif., had never fancied himself a big-league collector. But as he was cruising to work in his sport utility vehicle one day, a radio news report about the Costco offering roused him to action. Mr. Knickerbocker, 39, quickly called his wife, Diana, on his cellphone and asked her to race to the Web site and charge the purchase to his American Express card. "They just sell the top quality  whatever you buy at Costco, whether it's a washing machine or a vacuum cleaner," he said in an interview. "I just thought, if it's a Picasso, you can't go wrong." "Worst-case scenario, we can always return it," he recalls telling his wife. Actually, the worst-case scenario may be that the drawing is not a Picasso  an assertion that has Costco scrambling to live up to its consumer-friendly image. The work, "Drawing Arles," depicting a faun, came ready-to-hang in a gold frame; the store even provided a photographic certificate of authenticity signed by Picasso's daughter Maya Widmaier-Picasso, who also authenticates his works for auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's. But as Mr. Knickerbocker discovered this week, navigating Costco's fine-art offerings can be a tricky business. Interviewed in Paris by The New York Times on Tuesday, Ms. Widmaier-Picasso, 70, said the certificate was forged. As of Tuesday, a Picasso drawing titled "Picador in a Bullfight" was being offered at Costco's Web site for a much steeper $145,999.99  also with an authentication certificate bearing Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's name. Bristling at a grammatical error in French and the spiky handwriting, she pronounced that document a forgery as well. "It's not at all my way of expressing myself," she said in an interview, referring to the wording of the certificate. Peering at the signature, Ms. Widmaier-Picasso added, "It's really ugly, really really." The artist's daughter, 70, also cast doubt on the authenticity of the drawings. "My father knew that bulls have two testicles, in addition to something very masculine," she said impishly, referring to the bull. Contacted about Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's remarks, Liz Elsner, a vice president for merchandising for Costco's Web site division, said the company would promptly investigate. "Obviously we're very concerned with what you're telling us," she said. She emphasized that, as with all Costco merchandise, Mr. Knickerbocker was free to return the artwork. A few hours later, the bullfight drawing had been removed from Costco's Web site. Ms. Elsner emphasized that Costco had the Picassos independently verified by Jerry Bengis, an art appraiser in Coral Springs, Fla., who specializes in Dali prints. (Reached by telephone, Mr. Bengis said he provided documentation stating only that the certificates were consistent with others issued by Ms. Widmaier-Picasso.) Ms. Elsner said the two Picassos were provided by reputable dealers with whom Costco has done business since it entered the fine-art market. The vendor is Jim Tutwiler of Boca Raton, Fla., who bought them from Rick Yamet, a fine-art vendor in Peekskill, N.Y. Told of Ms. Widmaier-Picasso's contention, Mr. Tutwiler said, "Are you serious?" and quickly provided Mr. Yamet's telephone number. Mr. Yamet said he obtained the drawings from a partner in Rome. "I'm beside myself," he said. "Of course I have to take them back, and I have to go back to the source I got them from and get my money back." When buying Picassos accompanied by his daughter's certificate, he said, he routinely has Ms. Widmaier-Picasso examine the certificate, he said. He said he had faxed the certificates for both Picassos to her, but this time she had not responded. "I was getting no response for months and months. It became like an exercise in futility," Mr. Yamet said. So an associate of his in Rome showed the drawings and certificates unofficially to an expert at Christie's in Paris, who gave them a verbal nod, he said. "This is terrible for my reputation," he said, sounding distraught. "Costco's not responsible, of course." 1 2Next Page &gt; Correction: March 21, 2006 An article on Thursday about doubts raised over two Picasso drawings that were offered through Costco, the nation's largest warehouse club, misidentified one that was purchased for $40,000 by a California man in January 2005. It was a crayon drawing of a face, from 1970  not a drawing of a faun's face, from 1952. The 1952 drawing was not sold through Costco; a photograph of it, published with the article, was provided to The Times by the seller of the 1970 piece, who has also sold numerous other works through Costco in recent years. A correction on Friday misspelled the surname of the Picasso daughter who disputed the authenticity of a drawing attributed to him that was not sold through Costco. She is Maya Widmaier-Picasso, not Widmayer-Picasso.

Wal-Mart Stores and the Target Corporation were among those reporting that sales growth slowed from January. Apparel retailers, including Gap and chains catering to teenagers, posted the worst results. Department stores had a 1.8 percent gain, the slowest rise since November. Consumer confidence in the United States slid to a three-month low in February because of higher heating bills and a drop in home sales. Sales at stores open at least a year  known as same-store sales  rose 2.9 percent, according to the Goldman Sachs retail composite index. The gain was 5.0 percent in January. The major stock indicators fell yesterday, in part because of the report, and individual stocks including Wal-Mart, Target, Gap and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch also posted declines. Wal-Mart said same-store sales rose 3.2 percent, within its forecast range. Sales gained 2.9 percent at Wal-Mart's main chain of discount stores and 4.6 percent at Sam's Club. The company forecast a gain of 1 percent to 3 percent for March. Target, the second-largest discount retailer after Wal-Mart, said sales rose 3.6 percent last month, beating estimates. It forecast an rise of 1 percent to 3 percent for March. Same-store sales at the Kohl's Corporation rose 3.4 percent, more than twice the estimates of analysts. The Costco Wholesale Corporation, the nation's largest warehouse club, said sales climbed 8 percent. Gap said same-store sales plunged 11 percent. Sales declined 7 percent at Gap stores in North America, 11 percent at Banana Republic and 14 percent at the Old Navy chain. The results led to significantly lower merchandise margins, Gap said. Limited Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret and Express, had a 5 percent increase. The results were led by a 9 percent gain at Express. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, which sells casual clothing for teenagers, posted its smallest same-store sales gain in more than a year. Sales rose 5 percent, less than the 14 percent estimate of analysts. Its stock fell $6.20, or 9.2 percent, to close at $61.05 Among department stores, same-store sales at J. C. Penney climbed 2.3 percent. Federated Department Stores posted a 1 percent gain. Saks said sales dropped 6.4 percent.

But really, is that reasonable at all? In figurative terms we are more precisely walking backward into the future. After all, we can really see clearly only the past that is behind us and only guess at the road that lies ahead. Skip to next paragraph Jodi Hilton for The New York Times Daniel Gilbert. Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard, would like to outfit this metaphor with a side-view mirror, one reading: "Objects in future appear much larger than they are." A pioneer in the research of affective forecasting, Dr. Gilbert has illuminated a startling and fundamental mistake that both men and women make: they overestimate how future successes and failures will affect their happiness, for the better or worse. Not that people are easily disappointed by a promotion or apathetic about being fired. Rather, as Dr. Gilbert has found in charting his subjects' lives and reactions, "the good isn't as good, and the bad isn't as bad as we think it's going to be." A corollary finding is that a single big payoff - a fat raise, an Hermès Kelly bag, a hot cha cha date - affects people's essential happiness much less than a routine of small delights. And Dr. Gilbert, for one, is sold. He has found, for example, that one of the best things about being at Harvard is not the prestige of his position but that he can walk to work from his house in Cambridge. Much as you might embrace a chance to rebut the assertion that you would be happier with daily foot rubs for life than with $100 million, Dr. Gilbert, whose data is winningly compiled in "Stumbling On Happiness," due from Alfred A. Knopf in May, said his research clearly supported that message. But wouldn't you get bored? Wrong again. Dr. Gilbert's research also indicates that people who indulge in "false variety seeking" - that is, incessantly trying something new for variety's sake - are generally less happy than people who stick to their tried-and-true favorites. "The joys of variety are vastly overestimated in every domain of pleasure," he said. So as dull as you might think it, Dr. Gilbert's greatest luxury is an utter lack of fashion imagination. It is expressed neatly in a great big load of cargo pants, bought 5 or 10 at a swipe, size 35 by 30, in different colors at Costco. "My students all mock me," he said. "They think it's always the same pair." He is unruffled. "I never have to figure out what to wear," he said happily. "My life is full of decisions, and any time I can eliminate one, I feel that I have scored a victory." He added, "We haven't even begun to talk about the virtues of loose fit and big pockets." Is there a brand he prefers? He twisted around as far as he could. "Let me see," he said. "It says Union Bay." It probably does not shock too many people that money is not the answer. But with a steady drumbeat from self-help books telling us to embrace change, it is a relief to hear that there is much to be said for staying right where we are, in our happy little ruts. Change, and the future, will arrive whether we chase them down or not, so why not make the most of today? It might sound dull, but at least we know what to expect.

The project, known as East River Plaza, is moving forward because a major retailer, Home Depot, recently signed a 30-year lease for 110,000 square feet of space, slightly more than its typical suburban store. The second anchor would be Costco Wholesale Club's first warehouse store in Manhattan, a market the discount retailer has been trying to enter for years. Costco is on the verge of leasing 135,000 square feet at East River Plaza, said Jeffrey H. Brotman, the company chairman. Though Home Depot already has two stores in Manhattan, those are multistory, "with more of a design feel," said Yancey Casey, a company spokesman. The one-story East River Plaza store will carry lumber and serve contractors as well as residential customers, he said. Both retailers were on board in 1999, when the 485,000-square-foot shopping center worked its way through the city's complex permit process, despite some opposition from neighborhood residents who raised concerns about traffic and air pollution. Then the project stalled when public officials refused to subsidize a parking garage for 1,250 cars. With no groundbreaking date in sight, the lease agreements lapsed. In May 2004, Blumenfeld Development Group, the Syosset, N.Y., developer that came up with the idea of bringing suburban-style retail to Manhattan, acquired a new partner, the Forest City Ratner Companies, which is also a development partner for the new Midtown office tower being built for The New York Times. By then, the cost of the garage was no longer an issue because prospective tenants had agreed that customers could be charged $3 for the first two hours of parking. Richard Pesin, an executive vice president at Forest City, said the developers had spent much of the past 18 months negotiating with owners and tenants over the last of several buildings and parcels. The partners have also brought in a Pritzker-prize-winning architect, Kevin Roche, to inject some "flair" into the design for the facade, said David Blumenfeld, a vice president of his family's company. The project will take up three blocks, from 116th Street to 119th Street, from the highway west to Pleasant Avenue. "This is going to be one of the most important pieces of property when people drive into Manhattan," Mr. Blumenfeld said. "We wanted something out of the norm." Mr. Roche's design, which would replace the brick facade with color and graphics, has yet to be approved by the City Planning Commission. "If they say 'no,' we're going to build what they approved," Mr. Blumenfeld said. The permit issued in 1999 will have to be renewed, but the project will not have to undergo the same extensive review if the proposed changes are not considerable, said Rachaele Raynoff, a spokeswoman for the Department of City Planning. Though housing was not part of the city-approved plan for East River Plaza, the developers say that officials have asked that the structure be able to support additional stories. Since 1999, East River Plaza's price tag has doubled, to more than $300 million, because of rising construction costs, Mr. Pesin said. But Benjamin Fox, an executive vice president at Newmark Retail, a brokerage company, predicts success. "They are really filling a void," he said.

Above the fireplace is "Iris Garden," a triptych of colored 19th-century Japanese wood-block prints. Nearby hangs a six-foot-high vintage advertising poster that depicts the big red Laughing Cow of cheese fame - a cow with horns and dangly earrings. By the front door is a drawing the British illustrator David Hughes executed in watercolor, pen and hair. I like to think diversity is plucky. Others might call my walls a mishmash. Either way, my enthusiasm for taking risks ought to make me an ideal candidate to shop online for original art. So why was I so terrified by the idea? For an amateur like me, art is intimidating enough in a bricks-and-mortar setting, where I can feel creases in an 80-year-old poster or see how the shades of green and blue complement each other in a print. Online, there's far less to go on, just a tiny image that diminishes the power of even Picasso to postage-stamp quality. What if I make a mistake? How do I know if I'm dealing with a reputable dealer? How can I decode the complexity of language like "posthumous impression" and "lift-ground aquatint" in an arcane world where a lithograph is a print but a print is not necessarily a lithograph? These are the same questions that Costco Wholesale set out to answer a couple of years ago when the giant discount retailer made room for art alongside the 20-pound boxes of dog food and toaster ovens it sells under the home and pets listing at Costco.com. The experiment was a success, with the site's art category expanding from a handful of limited-edition lithographs by artists like Picasso, Miró and Chagall to its current multidealer incarnation. This week, 28 items were for sale, ranging from $499.99 lithographs by the Italian figurative artist Bruno Di Maio to an original Picasso crayon-on-paper drawing for $145,999.99. Now Greg Moors, the Bay Area art dealer who started Costco's art category, has embarked on a similar venture with ShopNBC.com, the online arm of the 24-hour television shopping network. Last month, Mr. Moor started to sell original lithographs by artists like Chagall, Picasso and Max Cohn in the site's house and home category, alongside 400-thread-count sateen sheets and 45-piece stainless steel flatware sets. Mr. Moors's goal is to make art accessible to everyone. "The creation of art will always be a mystery, but the buying of it shouldn't be," he said. "I originally got the idea of selling through big discount retailers one day when I was walking through a Target store, looking at all the terrible poster work they have for sale, and I wondered, 'Why do people have to have bad art when there are lots of high-quality lithographs for less than $1,000?' " The trick to buying art online, Mr. Moors said, is to find a trustworthy seller who will guarantee authenticity and allow you to return a piece for any reason. And buyers should take the time to educate themselves about what they like by looking at pictures in art books, visiting museums and talking to dealers. Online galleries like Spaightwoodgalleries.com, Lockportstreetgallery.com and Farrellfineart.com have images and descriptions of hundreds of prints they sell online. If you don't understand the difference between, say, an original lithograph and an after-print, ask the dealer to explain. "More than half the customers who buy online from me phone first," Mr. Moors said. Questions include those on the condition of the paper - is it watermarked or is there foxing? - to whether a piece was hand-signed by an artist. For a beginner like me, the images on the ShopNBC site were not alluring. Was I missing something? I drove to Mr. Moors's house, a few miles away from mine in Northern California, to look at the pictures he was selling online. I found his cottage on a winding side street in west Marin County. In front was a whimsical gnome guarding the garden; in the back, a creek ran beneath his deck. Inside, the scene was just as charming. A framed, untitled Miró color lithograph ($1,399.95 at ShopNBC) was vivid, bold and arresting on a wall above Mr. Moors's kitchen table. The composition of a $1,099.95 framed Max Cohn color screen print called "On the Beach," in which the outline of a prone sunbather mimics the contours of the distant shoreline, was immediately distinctive when I looked at the color screen print hanging on a bedroom wall. Chagall's colors were luminous. Marcel Vertes's figures had life. And a series of three framed black-and-white Picasso bullfighting scenes ($1,499.95 apiece) were irresistible. I left as quickly as possible to avoid spending money. Back at home, while viewing the ShopNBC site, I read the description of "Pass With Cape" by Picasso: "Created by Pablo Picasso for 'A Los Toros.' It was produced at Mourlot Studios in Paris in 1961." A keyword search for the lithograph turned up other copies of the same "Los Toros" lithographs for sale for $1,100 apiece (framed) at Georgetownframeshoppe.com. I phoned Georgetown Frame Shoppe and learned that one of the lithographs, described by Georgetown as "Jeu de La Cape" and by ShopNBC.com as "Pass With Cape," had been sold. The other two were available, unframed, for $800 apiece. Mr. Moors said that such price discrepancies were not unusual. "You can track down those black-and-white lithographs in galleries at prices anywhere up to about $3,000 apiece," he said. "Art is kind of like antiques in that way. There's a range in price, depending on what the dealer paid." He thought about it for a minute. "You know, there was a time when you probably could have gotten those Picasso lithographs for $20 a piece," he said. "These artists are dead. There's not going to be any more of their work. If you love it and plan to keep it for a lifetime, you can't go wrong." Was I ready to buy a Picasso lithograph online? Yes. Thanks to Mr. Moors, I wasn't the least bit terrified anymore. I could picture the little bullfighter hanging happily in the same room with my Chinese propaganda posters. The only obstacle that stood between me and Picasso's "Pass With Cape" was $1,499.95, which if you think about it, is nothing compared with fear.

When Ms. Gardiner, who lives in a Denver suburb, wants fresh fish, meats, produce, and other perishables, she drives 25 minutes to the nearest Whole Foods Market. When she needs products like canned beans, pasta and paper towels, she stops at a Wal-Mart Supercenter, which has a full grocery store. It has been at least a year, she said, since she entered a Safeway or Kroger, the two national supermarket chains that operate in the Denver area. "Once you go to start eating organic foods, you can't go back," said Ms. Gardiner, 61. Whole Foods may be "more expensive, but it's worth it," she added. "Anyway, I make up some of the difference at Wal-Mart." Skip to next paragraph Sandy Huffaker for NYT Nikki Shelton shopped with her grandchildren, Niamijah, center, and Kajime Means at Food 4 Less, Kroger's no-frills warehouse store in South Central Los Angeles. The Grocery Market Further Data on the Grocery Industry Forum: Food Culture Forum: Markets and Industries Top, Stephen Chernin/Getty Images; Chris Hondros/Getty Images A fruit display at Whole Foods in New York City, top; Wal-Mart in Troy, Ohio. Ms. Gardiner and a growing number of shoppers like her are the supermarket industry's worst nightmare. Faced with a seemingly endless array of food shopping choices, consumers are increasingly shunning the neighborhood supermarket and going to Wal-Mart, Costco or other discounters for rock-bottom prices or to places like Whole Foods and Wild Oats for specialized quality and service. Traditional supermarkets, caught in the middle, are struggling to survive. And the pressures on them may only intensify: Wal-Mart and Whole Foods have ambitious expansion plans, and Target says it wants to become a big player, too. Now, the traditional supermarkets are trying everything they can think of to turn things around and win back customers. In a nod to Whole Foods, they are adding more organic and natural food items and selling more prepared foods for quick lunches and dinners. And they are cutting prices. The nation's 56,000 supermarkets remain dominant in food shopping, of course, but their share of the business has been steadily declining. Americans are making fewer trips down their aisles and spending less each visit. The average American household made 95 trips a year to the supermarket in 1996; in 2004 it was 70, according to a study by UBS, an investment bank. In that eight-year span, annual trips to stores like Wal-Mart jumped to 26 from 13, and trips to club stores like Costco increased to 11 from 8. "Supermarkets are facing an identity crisis," said Harvey Hartman, chief executive of the Hartman Group, a consulting firm in Seattle. In the last five years, Wal-Mart has emerged as a dominant force in the grocery business, selling almost twice the amount of food and grocery items as Kroger, the country's largest supermarket chain. Wal-Mart undercuts supermarket prices by as much as 20 percent but is still able to generate considerable grocery profits because of its enormous volume and huge buying power. Wal-Mart's labor costs are also lower because, unlike workers at most supermarkets, its employees are not unionized. "Wal-Mart just keeps growing," said David B. Dillon, chief executive of Kroger, which regularly compares the performance of its stores against Wal-Mart Supercenters. "And I don't see any signs of a slowdown in the number of stores." Wal-Mart, with 1,866 supercenters in the United States, all with grocery stores, does not break out food sales, but Retail Forward, a research firm in Columbus, Ohio, estimates that in 2004 the company sold $109 billion in groceries, taking a 19 percent share of the market. Retail Forward has projected that the number of Wal-Mart supercenters may triple by 2010 and that its share of the grocery business may rise to 35 percent. Supermarkets are feeling the squeeze. In February, Winn-Dixie Stores filed for bankruptcy; at 92 percent of its stores, a Wal-Mart Supercenter is within a 20-mile radius. Last month, Albertsons, whose market share has declined in Wal-Mart strongholds like Dallas and Fort Worth, announced it had hired investment bankers to explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale. Other chains are faring only slightly better. Over the last five years, sales at Kroger, Albertsons and Safeway, the country's three largest supermarket chains, have stagnated and profits have been dismal. With 177 stores and less than 1 percent of the market, Whole Foods is not yet much of a financial threat. But analysts say that supermarket executives are anxiously watching the company, the fastest-growing grocery chain in the United States, because of how its success has pressured supermarkets to improve their offerings. "Whole Foods has redefined the landscape of what a grocery store is," Mr. Hartman said. "That means more fresh items, bigger produce sections, more selection for natural and organic foods and more prepared foods. It also means creating an enjoyable experience for shoppers." 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/national/11rv.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">R.V. Owners Skip Camp and Park at Wal-Mart<date>Published: September 11, 2005</date><text>Correction Appended SHERIDAN, Wyo. - Frank Sharpski Jr. surveyed the Wal-Mart parking lot near his R.V. campground on a recent afternoon. "There are six of them today," he said, counting the rigs that he figured would not be spending any time or money at his campground that night. "And that's a slow night." R.V. campground owners like Mr. Sharpski, co-owner of the Big Horn Mountain KOA Kampground here, say they are increasingly feeling financial pain caused by the growing popularity of parking R.V.'s at nationwide chains like Wal-Mart. It is a debate pitting R.V. owners against R.V. campground operators that is played out on vast expanses of asphalt, a controversy fueled by rising gas prices and intensified by R.V.-oriented Internet chat sites. R.V. camping is the nation's fastest-growing tourism segment and is expected to grow strongly as baby boomers retire. There are now seven million R.V.'s on the roads, and that number is expected to continue to grow, industry groups say. Wal-Mart is not the only chain store allowing free overnight R.V. camping - Kmart, Costco, and Flying J truck stops do as well - but Wal-Mart remains the most popular destination. Campgrounds charge between $25 and $40 a night. The growing number of R.V. owners looking for a place to spend the night has helped force the issue into the public debate in cities including Fairbanks, Alaska; Rapid City, S.D.; and Burlington, Wis. Prompted by complaints from campgrounds and others, several communities have decided to begin actively enforcing laws banning parking-lot camping. In Sheridan, however, Mr. Sharpski's efforts to restrict the practice ran straight into the influence of Wal-Mart, he said. "It was like banging my head against a wall," he said of a meeting last year with the Chamber of Commerce to encourage enforcement of existing parking restrictions. "They're not going to step on Wal-Mart's toes." Mr. Sharpski did not get a warmer reception the other day from the R.V. campers at the Wal-Mart when he suggested that parking-lot camping should be banned. "Would you shut down grocery stores if they were putting restaurants out of business?" a camper, Marvin Boehme, asked him. Phyllis and Tom Force emerged from their 26-foot Flair R.V. to add their opinions. "You wouldn't have to be out here if people liked your camp," Mr. Force told Mr. Sharpski. Mrs. Force was more practical. "The other day I needed a haircut so I went in and got one," she said. "Can't do that at a KOA." Most Wal-Marts provide only space for the R.V.'s to park, not electrical hookups or dumping stations. The company says its invitation to R.V.'s, which has been in place for decades, is not predatory competition. "It is very simply an extension of customer service," said Sharon Weber, a spokeswoman. Many R.V. owners agree, and Wal-Mart camping has drawn an informal but enthusiastic following. Many belong to Wal-Mart Bound International, an R.V. club whose only requirement for membership is having camped in at least five Wal-Mart parking lots. To help these so-called Wally Worlders find the nearest Wal-Mart, a couple from Carlsbad, Calif., published a book called "Wal-Mart Locator." Whenever restrictions loom, an R.V. owners group called the Escapees keeps its 35,000 members abreast of developments on its Web site, www.escapees.com, and by an e-mail newsletter. Communities considering a crackdown are often barraged with e-mail messages threatening a boycott by R.V. owners. Chuck Woodbury, editor of freecampgrounds.com, believes that Wal-Mart has become the largest R.V. campground in the country. It is impossible to confirm that claim because Wal-Mart does not keep track of the number R.V.'s parking in its lots, but it would only take about three R.V.'s a night at each of Wal-Mart's roughly 4,000 North American stores to surpass the industry's biggest campground chain, KOA, which has 450 locations in the United States and Canada. The debate about Wal-Mart camping began as early as 1999, when the Escapees Web site excoriated supposedly restrictive camping policies by the Illinois Campground Owners Association and encouraged members to avoid any campground that belonged to the group. "We got over 800 negative e-mails; it was really miserable," says Craig Weber, co-owner of the Geneseo Campground in Geneseo, Ill., whose wife, Shari, was president of the campground owners association at the time. "There were threats saying they would come to our campgrounds, plug up our toilets and set our garbage Dumpsters on fire." Lori Vavak, the owner of the Double Dice RV Park in Elko, Nev., has decided to fight back in court. Ms. Vavak is suing the City of Elko for refusing to enforce an ordinance that bans overnight parking-lot camping. She is suing for $1 million, seeking reimbursement for lost business, which she estimates at $250,000 a camping season for the last four seasons. She must comply with 37 rules to retain her campground license, she says, and believes that anyone offering camping should do the same. "We are happy to compete with legal competition," Ms. Vavak said. "We cannot compete with free, illegal competition." Ms. Weber of Wal-Mart said: "We are not a campground and haven't claimed to be. Being able to have R.V.'ers park overnight is simply a customer convenience." In Billings, Mont., a crackdown on parking-lot camping began in July when complaints about the large numbers of R.V.'s at the local Wal-Mart spurred the city into enforcing a 1960's-era parking ordinance. Security officers hired by Wal-Mart now hand fliers to R.V. drivers who pull in for the night. Complaints from the R.V. community have been swift. "It's been a tempest," says Nicole Cromwell, the supervisor in charge of enforcing city codes. Ms. Cromwell said the city had received hundreds of protest e-mail messages, and the local newspaper had published a steady stream of letters about the conflict. Ken Stellmacher, a spokesman for KOA, said his company would prefer to peacefully coexist. "We've extended an olive branch to Wal-Mart to see if we can find common ground," Mr. Stellmacher said. It is unclear that any olive branch could resolve the issue, however, and so the battle continues. And that is not likely to change anytime soon, said Mr. Woodbury of freecampgrounds.com. "These people have a lot of time on their hands," he said of his readers. Correction: An article on Sunday about chain stores that allow free overnight parking for recreational vehicles included one company erroneously. Costco says it does not allow overnight parking in its lots.

The two of them were stuffing their clothes into lockers and slipping on robes when her mother saw the cherry-patterned underwear her daughter was wearing. Skip to next paragraph Doug Jones "Where did you get those?" Ms. Wilkner's mother said. "Those are mine." "Huh?" she replied. But it was pointless to deny it. The red cherries were unmistakable. Ms. Wilkner, 24, a fashion model in Manhattan, had come across the brand-new Brazilian-cut briefs in a basket in her mother and stepfather's home in Providence, R.I. Assuming her mother had accidentally bought sexy underwear instead of her usual granny style, Ms. Wilkner had simply helped herself. It was not the first time Ms. Wilkner had swiped something from her mother. She often appropriated socks, spices, oatmeal, once even a chest of drawers she found in her mother's bedroom that had yet to be assembled. "That was a pretty good steal," Ms. Wilkner said. "Oh, I took a bookshelf, too. Clocks. I took artwork, a bunch of Monet prints. But my parents have plenty of artwork." A generation ago, adult children visiting their parents' homes might have left with a Tupperware container of lasagna. Today, many of them stealthily make off with toiletries, groceries, sometimes clothing and even furniture. It is an apparently widespread practice, born of a sense of entitlement among young adults - and usually amusedly tolerated by parents - that gives new meaning to the phrase "home shopping." Like most adults, the pilferers have set up their own households, but they seem not to have given up the expectation that their parents should provide for them in certain ways. They loot their parents' houses to cut costs, or because they would rather not pay for incidentals. Or because they want things with sentimental value. Sometimes the children ask if they can take things. Often they do not. Dan P. McAdams, a professor of psychology and human development at Northwestern University, said this kind of filching was one more example of the way grown children were putting off adulthood: living at home longer than they did a generation ago, staying in school longer and getting married later. "A lot of people in their mid and late 20's do not think of themselves as adults," Dr. McAdams said, "even if they make a lot of money." The result is a period of life that has come to be known among some sociologists and psychologists as emerging adulthood. "It's like a new stage in life," Dr. McAdams said. "They're not teenagers, and they're not really adults." Stephen Kunken, 34, an actor in New York who is an admitted "pillager" of his parents' possessions, said he rationalized that his parents had too much stuff and that he was both "trimming the fat" and "liberating" things. "I thought: 'These poor things. These are never going to get used. I'm going to liberate them and bring them into the city,' " he said. Through the years Mr. Kunken has taken briefcases, a slide projector, an electric toothbrush, razors, blank tapes, paper towels, soap and bottles of wine. His parents did not know their wine was missing until he served it to them at a party at his Brooklyn apartment. "We had our own wine that he stole," his mother, Ginny Kunken, said. "It was very nice that he invited us." His parents are accustomed to finding things missing. "What have they taken?" said her husband, Fred Kunken, a dentist from Upper Brookville, N.Y., referring to Stephen and his 37-year-old brother, Jeffrey. "What haven't they taken? They've taken just about every bit of my clothing, from my underwear and socks to --" "Bathing suits," his wife interjected, laughing. "All of a sudden my razors disappear," Dr. Kunken said. "Shaving cream disappears. It's gotten to the point that if I see them coming, and if it's something I just got that I want to wear, I hide it." That parents find their grown children's thieving humorous is a reflection of how family dynamics have changed, some experts said. Parents of previous generations maintained an authoritative stance toward their adult children, but now relationships are more equal, more like friendship, said Frank F. Furstenberg, a professor of sociology at the University of Pennsylvania and the chairman of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Transitions to Adulthood, which examines the changing nature of early adulthood. "That's been a secular trend throughout the whole 20th century," Dr. Furstenberg said. 1 2Next Page &gt; More Articles in Fashion &amp; Style &gt;</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/17/business/yourmoney/17costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">How Costco Became the Anti-Wal-Mart<date>Published: July 17, 2005</date><text>ISSAQUAH, Wash. JIM SINEGAL, the chief executive of Costco Wholesale, the nation's fifth-largest retailer, had all the enthusiasm of an 8-year-old in a candy store as he tore open the container of one of his favorite new products: granola snack mix. "You got to try this; it's delicious," he said. "And just $9.99 for 38 ounces." Skip to next paragraph Defying the Analysts Enlarge This Image Peter Yates for The New York Times A Costco store in Issaquah, Wash. Some 60 feet away, inside Costco's cavernous warehouse store here in the company's hometown, Mr. Sinegal became positively exuberant about the 87-inch-long Natuzzi brown leather sofas. "This is just $799.99," he said. "It's terrific quality. Most other places you'd have to pay $1,500, even $2,000." But the pièce de résistance, the item he most wanted to crow about, was Costco's private-label pinpoint cotton dress shirts. "Look, these are just $12.99," he said, while lifting a crisp blue button-down. "At Nordstrom or Macy's, this is a $45, $50 shirt." Combining high quality with stunningly low prices, the shirts appeal to upscale customers - and epitomize why some retail analysts say Mr. Sinegal just might be America's shrewdest merchant since Sam Walton. But not everyone is happy with Costco's business strategy. Some Wall Street analysts assert that Mr. Sinegal is overly generous not only to Costco's customers but to its workers as well. Costco's average pay, for example, is $17 an hour, 42 percent higher than its fiercest rival, Sam's Club. And Costco's health plan makes those at many other retailers look Scroogish. One analyst, Bill Dreher of Deutsche Bank, complained last year that at Costco "it's better to be an employee or a customer than a shareholder." Mr. Sinegal begs to differ. He rejects Wall Street's assumption that to succeed in discount retailing, companies must pay poorly and skimp on benefits, or must ratchet up prices to meet Wall Street's profit demands. Good wages and benefits are why Costco has extremely low rates of turnover and theft by employees, he said. And Costco's customers, who are more affluent than other warehouse store shoppers, stay loyal because they like that low prices do not come at the workers' expense. "This is not altruistic," he said. "This is good business." He also dismisses calls to increase Costco's product markups. Mr. Sinegal, who has been in the retailing business for more than a half-century, said that heeding Wall Street's advice to raise some prices would bring Costco's downfall. "When I started, Sears, Roebuck was the Costco of the country, but they allowed someone else to come in under them," he said. "We don't want to be one of the casualties. We don't want to turn around and say, 'We got so fancy we've raised our prices,' and all of a sudden a new competitor comes in and beats our prices." At Costco, one of Mr. Sinegal's cardinal rules is that no branded item can be marked up by more than 14 percent, and no private-label item by more than 15 percent. In contrast, supermarkets generally mark up merchandise by 25 percent, and department stores by 50 percent or more. "They could probably get more money for a lot of items they sell," said Ed Weller, a retailing analyst at ThinkEquity. But Mr. Sinegal warned that if Costco increased markups to 16 or 18 percent, the company might slip down a dangerous slope and lose discipline in minimizing costs and prices. Mr. Sinegal, whose father was a coal miner and steelworker, gave a simple explanation. "On Wall Street, they're in the business of making money between now and next Thursday," he said. "I don't say that with any bitterness, but we can't take that view. We want to build a company that will still be here 50 and 60 years from now." IF shareholders mind Mr. Sinegal's philosophy, it is not obvious: Costco's stock price has risen more than 10 percent in the last 12 months, while Wal-Mart's has slipped 5 percent. Costco shares sell for almost 23 times expected earnings; at Wal-Mart the multiple is about 19.Mr. Dreher said Costco's share price was so high because so many people love the company. "It's a cult stock," he said. Emme Kozloff, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, faulted Mr. Sinegal as being too generous to employees, noting that when analysts complained that Costco's workers were paying just 4 percent toward their health costs, he raised that percentage only to 8 percent, when the retail average is 25 percent. "He has been too benevolent," she said. "He's right that a happy employee is a productive long-term employee, but he could force employees to pick up a little more of the burden." Mr. Sinegal says he pays attention to analysts' advice because it enforces a healthy discipline, but he has largely shunned Wall Street pressure to be less generous to his workers. 1 2 3Next Page &gt; More Articles in Business &gt;</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/nyregion/14chester.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">For the Wealthy, Bargains Near Home May Be Luxury<date>Published: June 14, 2005</date><text>PORT CHESTER, N.Y. - One of the best views in town here is from the Costco parking lot, which looks out on the dozens of sailboats on the Byram River and the pristine mansions along Long Island Sound.

The Waterfront at Port Chester, a $100 million big-box retail complex, will soon be home to several national chain stores in addition to Costco and Marshalls. Designer Shoe Warehouse, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Michaels are all scheduled to open in July. In this working-class village, officials are putting their hopes for the future in discount stores. "This is going to put us on the map again," said Gerald Logan, mayor of Port Chester. Like other supporters of the project, Mr. Logan can hardly talk about future prospects without gushing. "This is really revitalization," he continued. "People are going to come here from all over, and we are going to benefit." Port Chester is an island amid some of the wealthiest communities in Westchester and southern Connecticut. Once a hub of Italian immigrants and factories, the community now has a booming Latino population, evident by the dozens of South American restaurants that line Main Street here. The new retail complex is toward the end of that strip, on land that was first rezoned for a retail project in the 1950's. While many communities in the region battle over large waterfront developments, there has been little outcry in Port Chester. In fact, the loudest criticism came from residents and business leaders who say the development should have been completed years ago. Since it opened in 2002, Costco has attracted customers from Rye and Harrison in New York and from Greenwich, Conn. "It's no secret that those communities would have put up a big fight," said Robert F. Weinberg, one of the partners in the project. "They don't want it in their own communities, but they definitely want to shop here. That shouldn't surprise anybody." If people's wealth can be judged by the kind of car they drive, Mr. Weinberg is likely to be proved correct. On its opening day, the Marshalls parking lot looked promising: a Lexus, two Escalades and four Mercedes-Benzes were parked in one row. Connecticut license plates were abundant. Rochelle Einsidler, 44, said she had received several mailings at her home in Rye Brook, N.Y., announcing Marshalls's opening. Her neighbors were expecting the opening, she said. "We all get tired of going to White Plains and fighting traffic," she said. "This is going to be convenient for so many people. And I'll probably be spending a lot of time here." To some, the 300,000-square-foot complex might be described as little more than a glorified strip mall. With construction continuing, it is difficult to tell how the project will look when it is completed this August. A 14-screen luxury Loews movie theater is expected to open then, as the Waterfront's crown jewel. "This is going to be better than anything else in the county," said Greg Wasser, the lead developer of G &amp; S Investors, based in Long Island. Mr. Wasser has more grand plans for the future of Port Chester. He talks of helping to update the facades on buildings downtown and creating more retail space in the area. "You're not going to see this happen overnight, but we're going to stay for the long haul," he said. Mayor Logan estimates that the stores will generate $2.5 million in tax revenue and create more than 800 jobs. While the real impact is yet to be seen, many residents say the Waterfront will be an improvement. Dina Sopon, 31, can remember what the village looked like when she moved here as a 10-year-old. "There was nothing here, nothing really at all," she said. "This gives you a sense that something is going on and that more people are going to see this place. I just hope it's not too many people or too many cars." The shopping center, just off Interstate 95, is easy to drive to - at least by Westchester standards. Developers are happy to point out that "all roads lead to Port Chester." But that is what worries some residents and existing merchants. Jorge Kan Long, who helps run his parents' Main Street restaurant Rinconcito Ecuatoriano, said the area might not be able to handle the cars that were likely to zoom past on their way to the stores. "We want them to stop here, and give us more business too," he said. "But we don't know if that will happen. We don't know yet how much this will help us." While shoppers streamed out of Marshalls recently, most restaurants on Main Street had a trickle of customers. Those visitors may have been more interested in good bargains than a bite to eat. Lisa Keppler was happy to show off her bargains. She was particularly pleased with the $39.99 price tag on a pair of Franco Sarto shoes. "I don't think anyone is ashamed of getting a bargain anymore," said Ms. Keppler, 49, of New Rochelle, N.Y. "They should be ashamed of paying full price."

The Costco Wholesale Corporation is starting a pilot program in California to offer individual health insurance policies to members who pay $100 a year for the store chain's executive membership. The pilot program is aimed at people who cannot get group insurance, like the jobless and the owners of mom-and-pop businesses. The program will begin next month at 34 stores in Los Angeles and Orange Counties, although it could expand statewide by year's end, said Dellanie Fragnoli, Costco's assistant vice president for insurance services. There are no plans to offer the insurance to all 18 million Costco members, and it may prove impractical to offer it nationwide. "It's a challenge because of all the regulations surrounding insurance and because they differ by state," she said. "Everything we do has to be a state-by-state initiative," and some states may lack the customers who would make it worthwhile, she said. Costco's move to sell health plans through its membership stores probably would not have much effect on the nation's estimated 45 million uninsured. But if other big-box discounters join in, it could do to brokers what Wal-Mart did to small retailers, translating into fierce competition for health insurance brokers, according to some analysts. "This could take substantial business away from them if it catches on," said Paul Ginsburg, president of Studying Health System Change in Washington. But, he added, "I just don't see it addressing any of the issues with the medical care system." Costco will offer two types of policies from PacifiCare Health Systems of Cypress, Calif., through which Costco already sells group health plans to small businesses. Costco, based in Issaquah, Wash., declined to disclose its premiums, which would vary depending on the participant's age, medical condition, number of dependents and other factors routinely taken into account when buying health coverage.

Everyone Wants Your Business<date>Published: June 8, 2005</date><text>HERYL CONTEE has owned a digital camera for five years, and until last month, she always printed photos the same way: at home, using her Hewlett-Packard printer. But on Mother's Day, just as she was about to print snapshots from a trip to California to show her grandmother later that day, Ms. Contee, who lives in Washington, discovered she was out of photo paper and low on toner. She didn't have time to get both things and print the photos, so she went to a digital printing kiosk at a CVS pharmacy down the street. Using the kiosk, she edited, cropped and enhanced the color on some shots the way she would have done at home, then shopped while the photos were printing. She walked out the door a few minutes later, prints in hand for just 29 cents each. "I thought it would be expensive and hard," Ms. Contee said of the kiosk, "but it wasn't at all." While she plans to buy a new printer soon and still produce some photographs at home, "the kiosk is definitely in my future, too." When cameras used only film, consumers didn't have much of a choice about where to get their photos printed, unless they had a darkroom at home. Now, with 80 percent of cameras sold this year projected to be digital models, consumers have more options than ever about where, or even if, to print their snapshots. One result is an all-out war among retailers, printer manufacturers and online companies like Snapfish for a piece of the $8.2 billion pie that the Photo Marketing Association International said consumers spent on printing photos last year. Each entity is trying to bill its services as the cheapest, easiest and, most important, the highest quality. Until recently, digital-camera owners favored printing their own photos at home. About 90 percent said they printed their own photos, according to surveys by InfoTrends/CAP Ventures, a market researcher in Weymouth, Mass. But Kerry Flatley, a consultant with InfoTrends, said the share of those printing at retailers grew rapidly in the last two years - 37 percent in 2004, up from 14 percent the year before. "More retailers have the equipment, so now they're advertising," Ms. Flatley said. There are now 75,000 photo kiosks in the United States, she said, and that number is expected to increase to 121,000 by 2008. What's more, she said, early adopters of digital cameras were mostly consumers adept at using technology who were often content to print at home. Now that the cameras have become mass-market gear, new owners are more likely to want ease and convenience. Price is also a big factor. In recent months, retailers like Wal-Mart and Costco have cut their prices for digital prints. A standard 4-by-6-inch print from a digital camera currently costs 19 cents at Wal-Mart, 17 cents at Costco and 15 cents at Sam's Club, the warehouse club of Wal-Mart. By the end of this month, Costco plans to finish rolling out a service that allows its members to upload images from their computers to Costco's Web site and then pick up the prints at the store within the hour. At the same time, printer manufacturers like Hewlett-Packard are trying to combat the perception that home printing is expensive and time-consuming. Hewlett-Packard sells packets of ink and photo paper that make the cost of 4-by-6-inch prints as low as 24 cents (not including the cost of the printer, of course). While Larry Lesley, a senior vice president at the company, conceded that the price was higher than some retailers charge, he said the "small incremental difference for the convenience, choice and control you get in the home is well worth it" for many customers, who sometimes need to print photos immediately. To get that speed before the arrival of digital cameras, he noted, people used to pay $1 apiece for Polaroid prints. The price advantage that retailers hold over printing at home often disappears when it comes to larger prints, said Lowrie Beacham of Durham, N.C. He produces 5-by-7-inch and 8-by-10-inch prints on his Hewlett-Packard printer because "the stores never advertise those prices in large print on their advertisements like they do the prices for 4-by-6." A 5-by-7 at Costco, for instance, costs 69 cents; it's $1.99 for 8-by-10. But for people like Mr. Beacham who like to print at home, it's more than just about price. Bill Brown of Arlington, Va., said he liked to play around with his images, mainly to correct the color by adjusting brightness and contrast in Photoshop. "When I show my photos to co-workers, they can't believe that I printed them on a creaky desktop inkjet printer that I paid $120 for," Mr. Brown said. Indeed, by printing at home, Mr. Lesley of Hewlett-Packard said customers could exercise their creative juices by using software to stitch together panoramic shots, make a video or add music. Next for the company is easing the transfer of photos from camera cellphones. "There is a sense of pride of creation about printing at home," Mr. Lesley said. Mr. Beacham and Mr. Brown agree. Mr. Brown prints his own photo Christmas cards at home "although I know it costs me a fortune, because I like the challenge." Mr. Beacham said he was not creative, "so printing at home is my one chance to be." Still, he is not totally wedded to home printing. When he wants to print a stack of 4-by-6 photos, he sends them to the online photo site Shutterfly, which charges 29 cents - or 19 cents prepaid - and mails them to him in a day or two. Another online photo site, Snapfish, owned by Hewlett-Packard, recently announced that it was lowering the price for printing a 4-by-6 digital photo to 12 cents (or 10 cents for prepaid plans). Digital photos, of course, never have to see paper to be shared, or even tossed out. Mr. Beacham notes that he prints only about one of every 20 pictures he takes. He is not alone. About 80 percent of digital pictures taken are never developed, Mr. Lesley of Hewlett-Packard said. The overall number of prints made at home and in stores last year fell 4.5 percent to 27.4 billion, according to a survey by the Photo Marketing Association International. So no matter how easy or cheap it is to print digital photos, some people seem content collecting many of their photos virtually. "A hard drive and CD's take up less space than shoeboxes and photo albums," Mr. Beacham said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/27/business/27costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco Posts Higher 3rd-Quarter Earnings<date>Published: May 27, 2005</date><text>CHICAGO, May 26 (Reuters) - The Costco Wholesale Corporation, the nation's largest warehouse club operator, reported on Thursday that its third-quarter earnings rose 5.6 percent, its smallest increase in more than a year, as steep oil prices cut into profits at its gas stations. The company maintained its profit forecast for the current quarter. Costco had warned in April that poor gasoline profits would hurt earnings for the rest of its fiscal year. Costco posted a net profit of $209.8 million, or 43 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter ended May 8, compared with $198.7 million, or 42 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 42 cents. Costco warned in April that earnings would be in the range of 41 cents to 43 cents a share, which was below Wall Street expectations at the time. Shares of Costco fell 16 cents, to $45.26.

Not to mention fresh vegetables and frozen foods. Supermarkets, long the domain of paperback romances, pulp thrillers and astrology guides, are the new frontier of book selling. Chains like Wegmans, Kroger and Albertsons have greatly expanded their book sections, adapting the techniques that move large amounts of Velveeta and Count Chocula and applying them to Nora Roberts and John Grisham. Grocery stores have gone beyond the traditional spinning racks of pocket-size paperbacks, adding mahogany fixtures, sitting areas and cafes, and often placing their book sections in the center of the store, where shoppers are likely to stroll. Eye-catching displays of new hardcovers are sprinkled throughout the stores, encouraging impulse purchases: a big display near the entrance, cookbooks near the spice aisle and, in summer, beach reading near the seasonal displays of sunscreen. Publishers have taken notice. "Supermarkets are definitely taking a bigger share of our business," said Josh Marwell, president of sales for HarperCollins, the country's third-largest publisher of general-interest books. "Hardcover bestsellers have become more of an everyday commodity. So it's a question of having books available where consumers are." In part, this shift reflects publishers' desperate search for new outlets as book sales tumble. It also reflects changes in bookselling culture: now, television advertising or a mention on "Oprah" can spur huge sales for a very narrow slice of the market. For the grocers, it is part of an increasingly uphill struggle to match wits on every front with warehouse clubs like Costco and mass merchandisers like Target and Wal-Mart, which now feature groceries in their supersize stores. "When you look at our business versus a bookstore, we have the opportunity to capture the same customers three times a week," said Lance Parsons, a senior category manager who oversees the book business for the Kroger Company, the country's largest grocery chain. "Now publishers are beating down our doors." Stores like the 130,000-square-foot Wegmans here in Sterling regularly feature author signings and sell newly released hardcover books at 20 percent to 40 percent off the cover price, discounts similar to those at Barnes &amp; Noble and Costco. On April 10, the mother-and-daughter suspense novelists Mary Higgins Clark and Carol Higgins Clark signed books and posed for photographs for five hours here, with some fans waiting in line for up to two hours. Women, who typically do most of a family's grocery shopping and book buying, easily made up 90 percent of the crowd. (The store sold 500 books at the event.) Over all, the number of books sold at grocery stores is still small when compared with book superstores and online booksellers, accounting for just 3 percent of the 1.7 billion general-interest books sold in 2004, according to Ipsos BookTrends, a market research service based in New York. Nearly 32 percent were sold in bookstores, 29 percent directly to consumers through book clubs and the like, and 19 percent through other retailers, including Amazon.com, warehouse clubs and mass-market stores. (The remaining 17 percent were sold through other outlets.) But the percentage of all hardcover and trade paperback books being sold in supermarkets has jumped by 50 percent since 2001, to nearly 1 percent of hardcovers and 1.4 percent of trade paperbacks, said Barrie Rappaport, chief analyst and manager of Ipsos BookTrends. Viewed another way, hardcovers accounted for 11 percent of the books sold in food and drug stores in 2004, up from 7 percent three years earlier. Over the same stretch, trade paperbacks climbed to 13 percent of sales from 7 percent, and mass-market paperbacks fell to 74 percent from 83 percent. (The remainder consisted of audio and digital books.)

High Fashion? No, a PC Laptop.<date>Published: April 21, 2005</date><text>thin and light laptop with a full complement of features is a rare find. Apple has scored high marks for its PowerBook, but PC devotees still lack a front-runner. The latest candidate is Portege S100 from Toshiba ($1,600). By including all desirable laptop features - even a DVD burner in a drive bay that allows for peripheral swaps - Toshiba may have produced a popular choice for PC users wary of Macs. The laptop, available at Costco stores and online at www.toshiba.com, is roughly an inch thick and weighs just over four pounds. It houses a Serial ATA 40-gigabyte hard drive, Wi-Fi wireless networking (802.11b/g) and a 1.73-gigahertz Pentium M processor. It comes with only 256 megabytes of RAM, but that can be upgraded for an additional fee. And you can relax if it slips out of your hands: the laptop's hard drive is encased in shock-absorbing materials, and a 3-D accelerometer detects erratic movements and stops the drive from spinning until the computer becomes stable. Rarer yet in today's laptop market is a keyboard that thwarts liquid spills. It will protect the computer's innards from moisture for several minutes, at least until you have closed your files. That could be the most coveted feature for anyone who has tried to work while drinking coffee on a turbulent flight. ADAM BAER</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/technology/circuits/17kios.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Meet You at the Photo Kiosk<date>Published: March 17, 2005</date><text>AMMY JACKSON of the Bronx likes to print her digital photos at the Costco Wholesale store in Brooklyn, where, on a recent Saturday, the lines in front of two Noritsu desktop kiosks moved quickly. That is largely because Costco does not allow editing of 4-by-6-inch prints, priced at 19 cents each, reserving the privilege for more expensive enlargements. That does not bother Ms. Jackson. "I'm a plain Jane," she said. "I don't do a whole lot of fancy stuff." She said she preferred the interface on the kiosk at Costco to one she had tried at a drugstore, which asked her to make more choices. "It's faster," she said. But not every kiosk user takes Ms. Jackson's approach. At Concord Camera in Concord, N.H., customers are invited to perch on stools and sip coffee while customizing images from their digital cameras on one of the store's five Agfa Image Box desktop kiosks, each placed on its own cafe-style table. Coloring books are provided for children. "Customers bring friends and show them how much fun it is to make prints," said Michael St. Germain, owner of the 2,600-square-foot independent store, where customers pay 39 to 49 cents for a standard-size print, depending on the quantity ordered. That is more expensive than at chain stores in his area and around the nation, where the price for a 4-by-6 print is typically 29 cents. Yet business is flourishing at Concord Camera because, the owner says, he allows his customers, mostly women, to work on images at their leisure. He plans to add more kiosks to reduce wait times. Mr. St. Germain invested in his first digital-printing machine seven years ago, fearing what he called the erosion of film as digital-camera sales took off. His hunch proved correct: last year, as film sales nationwide continued a four-year decline, according to Photo Marketing Association International, his store produced 200,000 digital prints on only four kiosks, and he expects the figure to be more than double that this year. "Digital printing is a high-margin product," far more profitable than selling cameras, he said. Far bigger companies, too, believe that kiosks could turn film's demise into an advantage. And change is afoot in the kiosk industry, as manufacturers and retailers aim to please both the customer in a rush and the one who likes to play. "A real issue now is lines," said Bing Liem, president of Agfa Photo, noting that a growing number of retailers have multiple kiosks. Some Costco stores have six. Kiosks are also appearing in convenience stores, in maternity wards and on cruise ships. Eastman Kodak, which now has 15,000 Picture Maker digital printing kiosks in the United States, expects to ship 5,000 to 10,000 more this year. Those figures do not include Kodak's older print-to-print Picture Maker machines, which the company says it has ceased distributing. Some of its new machines will include scanners, but the trend at Kodak and other kiosk makers is in a different direction: equipping the units to accept images from camera phones, now that some, like the 1.3-megapixel Sony Ericsson S700i, take pictures good enough to print. "While all forms of digital printing are growing, none is growing faster than kiosks," said Alex Hodges, Kodak's director of kiosks for the United States and Canada. According to Kodak, kiosk printing increased by 356 percent last year. A few years ago, nearly all digital printing was done at home. Now, even with the proliferation of home printers designed specifically for photos, many camera owners are content to go out. Last year, Kodak said, 1.9 billion digital images were printed by all methods, with 57 percent done at home, 33 percent at retail locations and 10 percent through online services. The company predicts that by 2007 the number of printed images will rise to 10.7 billion a year and that the share printed at kiosks will grow to 37 percent. Market researchers say a single consumer is likely to print at multiple locations, turning out one or two snapshots on a home printer but bringing large jobs to a store. Economics is one factor. "Consumers are saying home printing is O.K., but once they've used up their first batch of paper and ink, they get sticker shock," said George Briggs, the president of Pixel Magic Imaging, which supplies kiosks to Eckerd Drugs and Carnival Cruise Lines. Francie Mendelsohn, president of Summit Marketing, which follows the kiosk industry, estimates a print made at home with high-quality ink and paper might cost $1. And, she adds, "it takes time." But kiosk printing can take time, too. In the coming months, consumers could see changes at kiosks, including wider availability of automatic red-eye reduction, eliminating the need to locate problem eye areas individually on a touch screen. Moreover, print speeds will increase for some instant-print kiosks that produce prints through dye-sublimation or other fast-acting processes. (Kiosks networked to a store lab using silver-halide chemicals will most likely remain one-hour photo services, with actual print delivery time dependent on work flow.)

Reflecting an improving economy, consumers took advantage of stores' final clearance sales and stocked up on the newest fashions for spring. Sales increased 4.2 percent at retail stores open at least a year, according to the Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company retail composite index, released yesterday. That exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who had predicted a rise of 3.3 percent. Advertisement "Clearly, the consumer is faring better than myself or a lot of analysts on the Street expected," said Kennard Perkins, the president and chief statistician at Retail Metrics, a research firm that compiles analysts' estimates. "Certainly, in the first quarter the economic picture improved, and weekly employment results were better; they broke out of a sideways trend they had been in for roughly a year." Tax refunds, running a little more than 9 percent higher than a year earlier, also fattened consumers' pocketbooks and wallets last month, adding to the surprising strength in spending. Merchants who cater to teenagers - a fickle group of customers - got it right in February, analysts said, racking up sales numbers that surprised even the most optimistic. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, with its scantily clad male models, continued its turnaround with a 19 percent increase over February 2004. American Eagle Outfitters, heavily into color and denim, kept roaring with a 32.4 percent increase from a year ago. "Teen apparel retailers turned in a tremendous month and were the clear-cut standouts," Mr. Perkins said. Comparable-store sales figures for the group rose 17.3 percent, he said, "an incredible 11.3 percentage points above expectations." Even department stores did better than analysts - and some of their own executives - had thought they would: sales were up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, a full two percentage points more than expected. Federated Department Stores, in the news this week because of its announced $11 billion acquisition of May Department Stores, was up 1.8 percent for February. While that did not come close to American Eagle's result, Federated's chairman, Terry J. Lundgren, had predicted that sales would be flat or slightly down for the month. At May, sales were down 4.2 percent. J. C. Penney reported a 6.1 percent increase; it had estimated flat sales. On a seemingly never-ending roll, the luxury emporiums struck it rich again, with Saks Fifth Avenue, a division of Saks, reporting a 7.1 percent increase for February. Results at Nordstrom were 7 percent higher than last February's. At Neiman Marcus they were up 6.6 percent, though in February 2004, Neiman gained 24.9 percent. The discounters also did surprisingly well. Wal-Mart Stores, the country's largest retailer, reported an unexpectedly strong 4.1 percent rise for the month, exceeding its own 2 percent to 4 percent guidance. Costco beat expectations with a 7 percent rise. February recorded healthy selling at full price, analysts said. During the holiday season, fall and winter fashions did not fare as well; merchants started marking them down even before Thanksgiving. Rachel Schechter, a retail analyst at Thomson Financial, said some of the overall rise could be attributed to those holiday clearance sales, and also the continuing redemption of gift cards. There were other reasons, too, enumerated in reports issued yesterday by analysts. "The Super Bowl boosted sales, particularly in the discount sector," said Ms. Schechter, who said customers stocked up on party goods and football paraphernalia. Because of the late Super Bowl, she explained, these sales were not recorded until February. (Other analysts said the game lifted Target's numbers, in particular, by 9 percent, past a 6.4 percent estimate.) As good as February's overall 4.2 percent increase was, not everybody was a winner. The Gap stores reported a 3 percent decline, and its Banana Republic stores fell 6 percent. Limited Brands' Limited stores were flat, and its youth-oriented Express division declined 20 percent. There were a few other notes of caution. Last year's overall February gain was even higher, the analysts pointed out: sales increased 7 percent from February 2003. Still, that does not explain why American Eagle Outfitters, a chain of casual clothing shops for young people, keeps climbing. Executives there were not available for comment yesterday. Todd D. Slater, a retail analyst for Lazard, said the momentum could not last forever. "Teen concepts, brands, they tend to rise and fall when they catch a wave," Mr. Slater said. "We haven't seen performance like this since the dot-com era - not that this is a dot-com." American Eagle Outfitters closed yesterday at $57.90, down 97 cents. The company, he said, has been helped by greatly improved execution. In addition, he said, the clothes are "more on target and the deliveries, the inventory management, the way they are sourcing, all have become more efficient." Yet he cautioned that the preppy trend, which American Eagle mined so richly, may be nearing its end. And how high, he asked, can the operating margins go? Performance at youth-apparel chains, he said, rarely exceeds the mid-teens, "and these guys are already at 19.3 percent." "You'd have to go back to 1999, when they had 18.0 operating margins - and that was a stronger period, economically, for consumer spending." Mr. Slater cautioned that American Eagle's strength may well wane in the second half, because the comparison with past performance will be much more difficult. "It's not just 'tougher,' it's record levels of profits and same-store sales growth," he said. "Two years ago, the executives were all going to be thrown out. It shows you specialty retailers can refocus very quickly. Nothing's easy in retailing, but its easier to turn around a specialty chain than a giant department store chain."</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/03costco.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Costco's Profit Short of Estimates<date>Published: March 3, 2005</date><text>y Reuters The Costco Wholesale Corporation said yesterday that its quarterly profit rose but missed analysts' forecasts, sending its stock down 3.6 percent.

Profit for the second fiscal quarter ended Feb. 13 rose to $305.5 million, or 62 cents a share, from $226.8 million, or 48 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding the impact of a $52.1 million income tax benefit and a $16 million cumulative charge to pre-opening expenses, Costco said net income would have been $263.3 million, or 54 cents a share, for the quarter. Analysts, on average, expected the company to earn 55 cents a share. Costco said second-quarter sales increased to $12.41 billion, from $11.33 billion. On average, analysts were expecting sales of $12.58 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure for a retailer, rose 7 percent. While Costco was affected by some accounting changes, its selling, general and administrative expenses were also disappointing, said Jeff Stinson, analyst at the FTN Midwest Securities Corporation. "It was a little bit below expectations from a sales and earnings standpoint," Mr. Stinson said. The company's profit margin improvement also was not as good as some were expecting, a Piper Jaffray analyst, Mitchell Kaiser, said. The chief financial officer, Richard A. Galanti, said forecasts for the club's third-quarter and full-year profit were at the high end of the company's expectations. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 47 cents a share for the third quarter and $2.11 for the full year. Shares of Costco fell $1.69, to $45.02. Costco has warehouses in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Britain, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Mexico.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/09/business/09diamonds.html?ref=costcowholesalecorporation">Competition Is Forever<date>Published: February 9, 2005</date><text>ichael Smyth, who works for a pharmaceutical company, was peering not long ago at three large diamonds perched on the tops of metal rods, balanced above pure white paper in a shop in the Manhattan diamond district. Like countless young men in the generations before his, Mr. Smyth was looking for an engagement ring. But Mr. Smyth is different from earlier suitors, who often trembled at the approach of a salesman. Before he started out, he had carefully researched diamond sizes, cuts and quality on the Internet. He knew the wholesale prices, and he was ready to bargain. Plenty of his friends actually bought their rings on the Web, he said, "but since I'm here in New York, I figured I'd take a look." "If I were in Iowa, I'd probably buy it online." From mine to merchant to customer, the diamond business is changing while it expands like never before - and the Internet is only part of it. Consumers, both men and women, are demanding better stones, often for lower prices, in a wider variety of locations. Mom-and-pop stores are being squeezed by giant chains like Wal-Mart Stores, now the world's largest jeweler, and Costco, which increasingly sells diamonds over two carats. Department stores, too, are upgrading their jewelry counters. (Jewelry did much better than clothing in many of them over the holidays.) And sales of diamonds, for all the predictions from critics that the industry has long been riding for a fall, are continuing to thrive. In 2003, the last year for which data are available, $20.5 billion in diamonds and diamond jewelry was sold in the United States, according to the Jewelers of America, up nearly 10 percent from $18.7 billion two years before. Eighty-three percent of the brides in the United States say that they want a diamond engagement ring - and their grooms, in turn, spent $4.3 billion last year on them. And diamonds have spread well beyond engagement rings. Right-hand rings are promoted to women looking to flaunt their independence. Pop stars like Sean Combs wear watches with 1,200 cut stones on their faces that cost tens of thousands of dollars. While the number of stones sold is increasing, complex changes are taking place. Wholesalers in the diamond district, on 47th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, which was once the epicenter of diamond wholesaling in the United States, are laying off dozens of stone-cutters, commissioning the work in India and China, and using the former factory space as showrooms for jewelry they never sold before. Everyone is trying to cut out the middlemen distributors, who are now regarded as extraneous. Most of the Internet sites do not even buy the diamonds; they act as a clearinghouse for dealers. The prices, meanwhile, have gone to two extremes. At the low end, the discount chains and many online diamond sites are offering prices that - even the Main Street jewelers admit - are at least 20 percent lower than in their own shops. At the other end, to satisfy the cravings of rock stars, Russian millionaires and others with bottomless pockets, prices for the much bigger, much rarer stones have soared as supplies have tightened. For diamond retailers, branded diamonds and new cuts have become hot. Luxury retailers like Tiffany, and even some 47th Street dealers, are patenting cuts to differentiate their diamonds from other retailers' and, they hope, add cachet. To give more guidance to an increasingly confused marketplace, the Gemological Institute of America, the industry's lead rating service, plans to update this year its 1950's-era grading system for diamond cuts. As part of the effort, the institute will for the first time use computers to define what gives a diamond its beauty, measuring the light patterns that create "scintillation" and the color flashes that make "fire." Some dealers are doing their best to capture both the wholesale and retail ends of the business. Aber, a Canadian diamond company that owns 40 percent of the Diviak mine not far from the Arctic Ocean, bought the controlling interest last spring in Harry Winston, the Fifth Avenue jeweler.

For the three months ended Nov. 21, the company reported earnings of $193.2 million, or 40 cents a share, up from $160.2 million, or 34 cents a share, in the period last year. Sales rose 10 percent, to $11.34 billion, up from $10.31 billion in the period a year ago. Costco's results met the expectations of Wall Street analysts, but its stock price fell 80 cents, to $48.10 a share. Same-store sales, which look at Costco warehouses that have been open at least a year, rose 7 percent from the year-earlier period. Costco is based in Issiquah, Wash.</text></article></page></root>
