Profit excluding costs related to the acquisition of Danisco, a seed license payment, and tree damage caused by the Imprelis herbicide was 69 cents a share. That surpassed the 56-cent average of 14 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 32 percent, to $9.24 billion, beating the $8.88 billion average estimate. Full-year earnings excluding some costs will be $3.97 to $4.05 a share, compared with a July prediction of $3.90 to $4.05, DuPont said. DuPont has surpassed expectations in each of the 11 quarters that Ellen J. Kullman has been chief executive. Profit more than doubled in the performance-chemicals unit, the world’s biggest maker of titanium dioxide, which is also known by its chemical formula TiO2. Prices for the white pigment used to add opacity to paints and plastic have climbed 38 percent in a year amid globally tight supplies, according to data from ICIS. “TiO2 did really well,” said Mark Gulley, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in New York. “It exceeded my expectations.” DuPont shares fell 2.5 percent on Tuesday, to $44.94. The company’s stock has dropped 9.9 percent this year, giving the company a market capitalization of $41.9 billion. Global economic growth will slow in the fourth quarter and customers will use up some of their inventories, DuPont said. DuPont raised third-quarter product prices an average of 15 percent, the biggest increase in at least a decade, the company reported.

The chemical manufacturer DuPont has set up a process through which people can make monetary claims for trees that have been damaged or killed by its product Imprelis, a new-generation herbicide that was used by commercial applicators on lawns across the country this spring for the first time. At first Imprelis was thought to be more environmentally friendly than Roundup and other weedkillers, particularly because of its low toxicity to mammals. It was only sold to lawn care professionals, and they welcomed it as a way to green the image of lawn care. While it may not harm mammals, Imprelis has been deadly to trees. After it was first applied on golf courses and home lawns, largely around the Midwest and in the East, trees, mostly Norway spruce and white pine, began to turn brown, and many died. Some experts believe that hundreds of thousands of trees may have died or been seriously damaged because of the herbicide applications. Only the states of New York and California never approved the chemical for use. The company pulled the product off the market in early August, and a few days later the Environmental Protection Agency banned sales of it. DuPont has set up a program for paying homeowners and lawn care professionals for the removal of dead and dying evergreen trees and for replacements. The claims can be made through landscapers who applied the chemical, although homeowners can call DuPont directly at (866) 796-4783. (Details on the claims process are available at a company Web site.) Some deciduous trees have also been affected, including willows and poplars. “We have noticed some injury to deciduous trees,” said Kate Childress, a spokesperson for DuPont. “But they are resilient and may come back in the spring.” DuPont says it will also pay for tree care after the new trees are replanted, and then provide a warranty covering those new trees and future impacts on other trees. Ms. Childress said the company had no estimate of the numbers of trees killed or damaged. Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the company for damages, and some big old trees that were killed could cost as much as $25,000 each to replace. One attorney involved in the lawsuits suggests that the damages could top $1 billion. Questions about what happens to Imprelis in the soil and trees persist. DuPont says homeowners can burn the wood from their dead trees for heat or take it to a dump. But if the trees are chipped, they warn that they should not be composted or used for mulch because the chemical does not break down when composted and remains active for a long time. Once the trees are chipped, though, it seems that they could wind up anywhere. As for planting new trees, DuPont officials say that if Imprelis was applied before June 1, it is safe to plant a new tree at that location after Oct. 1. If the herbicide was applied between June 1 and June 30, a tree should be planted after Nov. 1, they say, so that the active ingredient, aminocyclopyrachlor, has time to break down. They also warn that when a tree is replanted at the site of the old tree, new soil should be used to fill in the hole. However, Dan Sullivan, managing editor of Biocycle Magazine, which covers the composting and recycling industry and has written several articles about this class of herbicide, said that at least one researcher had found that aminopyrachlor has a half-life of 200 days. “This stuff is persistent, that’s one of the things they tout,” he said. “They say you can plant after 120 days — I have to question that.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/dupont-is-sued-over-new-herbicide/?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont Is Sued Over New Herbicide<date>July 19, 2011, 4:24 pm</date><text>Andrew Spear for The New York TimesA Norwegian spruce in Columbus, Ohio. Its owners said that it began to wither after Imprelis, an herbicide manufactured by Dupont, was applied to their lawn. A Pennsylvania homeowner and an Indiana golf course company have filed a class-action lawsuit against DuPont charging that the chemical giant was either negligent or reckless in putting a new weedkiller on the market. The suit, filed on Monday in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserts that the high-profile herbicide, Imprelis, is killing trees, shrubs and ornamental plants across the country. A similar lawsuit was filed on Friday against Dupont by a golf club in Michigan that has reported thousands of dead and dying trees on its properties. As The Times reported last week, Imprelis, which received conditional approval from the Environmental Protection Agency last October, was marketed by DuPont as a “low environmental impact” herbicide sold to professionals only for use on lawns, golf courses, sod farms, schools, parks and athletic fields. While extremely effective at killing stubborn dandelions, clover, ground ivy and wild violets, Imprelis is now suspected by many landscapers to be equally effective at attacking trees, even when applied in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Thousands have been dying in areas in close proximity to grass that was sprayed with the herbicide, they say. Most at risk are willows, poplars and conifers, which have shallow root systems, close to the turf where the product is applied, they add. In a statement on Tuesday, DuPont said: “We are working with our customers to investigate reports of unfavorable symptoms observed on certain tree species, primarily Norway spruce and white pine.” Yet it added, “We are evaluating our response to the complaint, but are confident that this purported class action lawsuit is unfounded, and we will oppose it vigorously.” The suit filed on Monday seeks compensation for all property damage suffered as a result of applications of Imprelis, an injunction barring DuPont from selling the product and unspecified punitive damages. The complaint argues that DuPont was either negligent in testing Imprelis or reckless in bringing the product to market. It also asserts that DuPont provided consumers with inadequate warnings, cautioning users against direct application of the product to some plants but refraining from suggesting that the chemical had the potential to migrate through the soil and come into contact with root systems. “DuPont’s refusal to acknowledge its responsibility for damage to tens of thousands of property owners and continued marketing of ImprelisTM as environmentally friendly is highly reprehensible” and “demonstrates nothing less than a reckless indifference to the public well-being,” it says. In separate interviews, Jonathan Selbin of Lieff Cabraser Heimann &amp; Bernstein and Mario Massillamany of Starr, Austen &amp; Miller, who represent the plaintiffs, recommended that homeowners and others educate themselves about Imprelis and its alleged potential to migrate through the soil. “If people’s trees are dying, they shouldn’t immediately blame drought or extreme weather,” Mr. Massillamany said. “Even if they have never used this product on their property, it may have drifted through the soil.” Although property owners’ first instinct might be to get rid of a dead or withering tree, he urged that they document the damage by taking photos and samples of the vegetation. He predicted that the class-action would unfold for two or three years. The E.P.A. says it is investigating the reports of tree deaths.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/science/earth/15herbicide.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Imprelis Herbicide Suspected in Tree Deaths<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>A recently approved herbicide called Imprelis, widely used by landscapers because it was thought to be environmentally friendly, has emerged as the leading suspect in the deaths of thousands of Norway spruces, eastern white pines and other trees on lawns and golf courses across the country.Manufactured by DuPont and conditionally approved for sale last October by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, Imprelis is used for killing broadleaf weeds like dandelion and clover and is sold to lawn care professionals only. Reports of dying trees started surfacing around Memorial Day, prompting an inquiry by DuPont scientists. “We are investigating the reports of these unfavorable tree symptoms,” said Kate Childress, a spokeswoman for DuPont. “Until this investigation is complete, it’s difficult to say what variables contributed to the symptoms.” DuPont continues to sell the product, which is registered for use in all states except California and New York. The company said that there were many places where the product had been used without damaging trees. The E.P.A. has begun gathering information on the deaths from state officials and DuPont as well as through its own investigators. “E.P.A. is taking this very seriously,” the agency said in a statement. In a June 17 letter to its landscape customers, Michael McDermott, a DuPont products official, seemed to put the onus for the tree deaths on workers applying Imprelis. He wrote that customers with affected trees might not have mixed the herbicide properly or might have combined it with other herbicides. DuPont officials have also suggested that the trees may come back, and have asked landscapers to leave them in the ground. Mr. McDermott instructed customers in the letter not to apply the herbicide near Norway spruce or white pine, or places where the product might drift toward such trees or run off toward their roots. For some landscapers, the die-off has been catastrophic. “It’s been devastating,” said Matt Coats, service manager for Underwood Nursery in Adrian, Mich. “We’ve made 1,000 applications and had 350 complaints of dead trees, and it’s climbing. I’ve done nothing for the last three weeks but deal with angry customers.” “We’re seeing some trees doing O.K., with just the tips getting brown, and others are completely dead and it looks like someone took a flamethrower to them,” he said. So far, the herbicide seems to affect trees with shallow root systems, including willows, poplars and conifers, he said. Underwood Nursery is replacing the trees, which its liability insurance covers, but faces a $500 deductible for each incident. “It’s already cost us $150,000,” Mr. Coats said. Some landscapers are finding that their insurance does not cover the tree deaths at all. The chemical name of the product is aminocyclopyrachlor, one of a new class of herbicides that has been viewed as safer than earlier weed killers. DuPont, landscapers and others had high hopes for the product. It has low toxicity to mammals, works at low concentrations and can kill weeds that other herbicides have trouble vanquishing, like ground ivy, henbit and wild violets. It works on the weeds’ roots as well as their leaves. No firm estimate exists on the extent of the tree die-off. But Bert Cregg, an associate professor of horticulture and forestry and an extension specialist with Michigan State University who has fielded many calls from landscapers and inspected affected trees, said the problem existed across the country. Many extension services have issued warnings, Dr. Cregg said. “This is going to be a large-scale problem, affecting hundreds of thousands of trees, if not more,” he said. Imprelis is used on athletic fields and cemeteries as well as on private lawns and golf courses, he noted. While landscapers are replacing some of the trees, they cannot replace large mature ones, meaning that some homeowners have lost some of their biggest and oldest trees. “I’m very concerned,” said Amy Frankmann, executive director of the Michigan Nursery and Landscape Association, who has heard from many members and who says the disaster could threaten the livelihoods of landscapers whose insurance will not cover the cost. “Absolutely. One member is looking at having to replace a thousand trees.” Mark Utendorf, owner of Emerald Lawn Care in Arlington, Heights, Ill., has seen dozens of customers’ trees turn brown. “It’s unfortunate, because the product works exceedingly well on turf,” he said. “It kills creeping Charlie, and that’s something that’s very hard to kill,” Mr. Utendorf said, referring to a type of ivy that has been known to take over lawns. 1 2 Next Page »A recently approved herbicide called Imprelis, widely used by landscapers because it was thought to be environmentally friendly, has emerged as the leading suspect in the deaths of thousands of Norway spruces, eastern white pines and other trees on lawns and golf courses across the country.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/elliott-raises-danisco-stake-on-eve-of-dupont-deadline/?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Elliott Raises Danisco Stake on Eve of DuPont Deadline<date>April 29, 2011, 6:59 am</date><text>Elliott Advisors, the activist investor, now owns just over 5 percent of Danisco, the Danish food ingredient company said Friday, making it one of the Danisco’s largest shareholders next to the Danish pension fund ATP. The announcement follows reports this week that the hedge fund was building up its 1.2 percent stake in Danisco, which is the takeover target of a $6.3 billion bid by DuPont that expires Friday night. Sources close to Elliott, which now holds 2,407,083 Danisco shares, have said the firm is “extremely confident” that DuPont will not secure the necessary 90 percent acceptance of its offer at the current price, a sentiment echoed in Denmark. Morten W. Langer, co-editor of the Danish stock market weekly AktieUgebrevet, said in an interview that he believed DuPont would “raise their price, but not so much.” “ATP wanted 10 to 15 percent more,” he said, but added that he thought DuPont might seek a compromise price 5 percent to 7 percent higher than its current one. “That way no one will lose the game. It would be a bad outcome of the deal fails.” Mr. Langer noted that the Danisco management and board, which have supported the offer, might have difficulty continuing to manage the company if it was shown that shareholders questioned their judgment. “If DuPont offers a much higher price,” he said, “they will spoil their acquisitions for the next 10 years, because investors will look at what they did here, and expect them to raise their price in similar deals.” The DuPont bid, made in January, was extended more than once as the company sought and won regulatory approval for the acquisition in Europe, the United States and China. Now the sole potential obstacle to the transaction is shareholder support. In Denmark, bidders normally need to acquire 90 percent of the target company before they can conduct a so-called squeeze out, and require that the remaining shares be sold. DuPont’s bid of 665 Danish crowns per share, or 31.7 billion crowns altogether, represents a 25.5 percent premium to where Danisco shares were trading Jan. 7, the last trading day before the offer was announced. Danisco last traded at 654.50 Danish crowns, reflecting market fears that the deal might not go through. If DuPont retracts its offer, which it has called “ full, fair and firm,” investors like Elliott that have recently increased their stakes could see losses as the share price settles to pre-bid levels. DuPont has maintained its original offer despite a deteriorating economic situation after the earthquake in Japan, where multiple divisions of Danisco do business. The price for the deal in dollars has been rising as the currency has weakened. On Jan. 7, 31.7 billion Danish crowns were worth just $5.6 billion.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/dupont-extends-6-billion-danisco-bid/?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont Extends $6 Billion Danisco Bid<date>March 30, 2011, 9:05 am</date><text>DuPont said Wednesday that it had extended its $6 billion offer for the Danish food ingredients company Danisco for a second time, giving shareholders an additional four weeks to act on the bid. DuPont, the chemicals conglomerate, said regulatory approval was still pending in the European Union and China, leading the company to push back the deadline to April 29. American regulators have already signed off on the deal. The company noted in the same statement that only 6 percent of all Danisco shareholders had taken up its tender, which had been due to expire on Friday, saying the acceptance rate was “consistent with similar past voluntary tender offers in Denmark at this stage of the offer.” “We believe Danisco shareholders are recognizing that our offer is full, fair and firm and, moreover, it is the best offer available and provides certainty to shareholders,” Ellen Kullman, DuPont’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We continue to make good progress on the necessary regulatory approvals and we look forward to completing the tender process promptly once regulatory approvals are received.” DuPont needs 90 percent of Danisco shares before it can oblige the remaining shareholders to give up their stakes. The company said the bid was “proceeding toward an early second quarter closing.” DuPont is offering 665 Danish kroner ($125.67) for each share of Danisco, a 58.7 percent premium to the company’s average trading price in the 12 months before the bid. But Hans Gregersen, an analyst at Nordea Markets, which is adviser to DuPont on the deal, has estimated Danisco to be worth about 46.4 billion kroner ($8.7 billion), according to an article published last week in the Danish financial daily Boersen. That value would translate to an offer about 45 percent higher than DuPont’s present bid. Mr. Gregersen did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Boersen also reported that a number of Danisco’s largest shareholders have already declined the DuPont offer, including SEB Asset Management, LD Invest Asset Management, Danske Capital, Nordea and Nykredit.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/us/politics/24peterson.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Russell W. Peterson, Scientist Turned Environmentalist, Dies<date>Published: February 23, 2011</date><text>Russell W. Peterson, who helped develop Dacron as a DuPont research scientist before becoming a champion of environmentalism as governor of Delaware, a White House adviser and president of the National Audubon Society, died Monday at his home in Wilmington, Del. He was 94.He suffered a stroke a few hours before he died, his daughter, Elin P. Sullivan, said. Mr. Peterson, who had a Ph.D. in chemistry, worked for 26 years for the DuPont Company, rising to lead its research and development division, before entering politics after working with a citizens’ group for prison reform. As a one-term Republican governor from 1969 to 1973, he ignored the opposition of DuPont and other companies and pushed through a law to protect the state’s coastline from industrial development. The immediate victim of Governor Peterson’s Coastal Zone Act was the Shell Oil Company, which was stopped from building a $200 million refinery. He rallied environmentalists by wearing a lapel button saying “To hell with Shell.” He took a more nuanced approach when Maurice H. Stans, secretary of commerce in the Nixon administration, summoned him to Washington to complain that the coastal protection law threatened the nation’s prosperity and security. Mr. Peterson answered with a dozen ways the heavy industries in question might achieve their purposes without destroying Delaware’s 28 miles of relatively clean coast. His answers were apparently persuasive enough that President Richard M. Nixon appointed him chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality, a post he continued to hold under President Gerald R. Ford after Nixon resigned. Mr. Peterson helped lead a task force whose work contributed to the global phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, the organic chemicals widely used as refrigerants that contribute to depletion of the ozone. The best-known fluorocarbon is Freon, a DuPont product. In addition to being the president’s principal adviser on environmental policy, Mr. Peterson helped shape the extensive environmental reviews, known as environmental impact statements, that were mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970. As president of the National Audubon Society from 1979 t0 1985, Mr. Peterson vigorously fought President Ronald Reagan’s efforts to weaken enforcement of environmental regulations to help business. When Reagan said conservationists would not be happy until the White House was a “bird’s nest,” Mr. Peterson snapped back that it was already “a cuckoo’s nest.” Mr. Peterson pushed Audubon well beyond its traditional mission of protecting wildlife into newer environmental battles like population control, energy policy and curbing toxic chemicals. He hired more scientists, established an environmental curriculum for elementary schools and recruited Ted Turner to finance a film series, “The World of Audubon,” which used narrators like Robert Redford. Mr. Peterson endorsed Jimmy Carter for president in 1980 and became a Democrat himself in 1996. His many roles in the environmental movement included being president of the International Council for Bird Preservation, now BirdLife International, and chairman of the Center on the Long-Term Biological Consequences of Nuclear War. In a 1993 speech, Mr. Carter said, “Every time something wonderful has happened when I was president and since then in the field of environmental quality in this country or on a global basis, Russ Peterson has been intimately involved in it.” Russell Wilbur Peterson, the eighth of nine children of a Swedish immigrant bartender and barber, was born on Oct. 3, 1916, in Portage, Wis. Unlike his brothers who dropped out of school, he was determined to get an education, and he worked as a dishwasher in the chemistry laboratory of the University of Wisconsin to pay his tuition. After completing his doctorate in 1942, he accepted a job with DuPont in Wilmington. He was $5,000 in debt to doctors and hospitals because his wife, the former Lillian Turner, had been seriously ill. Within five years, he had paid his bills and was climbing the ranks of DuPont, where he helped develop products like Dacron polyester fiber and nylon carpet yarn. He became director of research and development in 1963. As governor, his first act was to order the National Guard to withdraw from Wilmington, where it had been since riots after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in April 1968. Mr. Peterson said the troops had bred “fear and suspicion and hate” among black people. Mr. Peterson reorganized Delaware’s government, eliminating more than 100 commissions and boards; appointed the first blacks to the Delaware State Police; and eased restrictions on abortion. He was defeated after announcing an unexpected tax increase in the middle of his 1972 re-election campaign. His interest in birding preceded his appointment as president of the Audubon Society in 1979. He had begun bird-watching after he took his young son to the Everglades 25 years earlier and they saw 75 kinds of birds in one day. By the time he took the Audubon job, he had identified nearly 1,000, a fine number for almost any birder. Mr. Peterson’s wife of 57 years, Lillian, died in 1994. In addition to their daughter Elin, he is survived by their sons, R. Glen and Peter J.; another daughter, Kristin P. Havill; 17 grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his wife of 15 years, the former June Jenkins. Mr. Peterson was eloquent in discussing ambiguity and risk in setting government policies, pointing out, for example, that China eliminated sparrows, only to experience an unexpected increase in crop-eating insects. But one law he demanded as governor permitted no parsing: under Russell Peterson’s insistent leadership, Delaware in 1972 became the last state to outlaw the punishment of flogging.Russell W. Peterson, who helped develop Dacron as a DuPont research scientist before becoming a champion of environmentalism as governor of Delaware, a White House adviser and president of the National Audubon Society, died Monday at his home in Wilmington, Del.

Danisco, the Danish food ingredients company, said Friday that DuPont had extended its $5.7 billion bid from Feb. 22 until April 1 because it had yet to receive regulatory approval in the European Union and China for the deal. Still, the extension serves other purposes, like giving investors more time to respond to DuPont’s tender offer of 665 Danish crowns per share, a price that some shareholders, including the activist fund Elliott Associates, see as too low. Tom Knuzen, chief executive of Danisco, said Friday that the 5 percent acceptance so far announced for the bid was not representative of anything, and that he continued to support the offer, according to Reuters. That said, people close to the situation in Denmark, who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said that many investors in Denmark remained undecided, and that skepticism to the offer was growing. The Danish shareholders’ association published a survey of 2,000 shareholders on Feb. 4 saying that 8.9 percent would definitely reject the offer, and another 18.4 percent were inclined to oppose it — both numbers up from 7.7 percent and 16.1 percent, respectively, in January. About 58 percent remain undecided, among them the Danish pension fund ATP, which is the only shareholder with more than 5 percent of Danisco stock. ATP is known as one of the most sophisticated investors in Denmark, and other shareholders are likely to follow its lead. In Denmark, the bidding company normally needs to acquire 90 percent of the equity before it can proceed to a squeeze-out. In this case, Danisco management has agreed to let DuPont take the company over if the 80 percent threshold is met, although Danisco would still remain a public company. But even 80 percent may be out of reach, if the 27.3 percent cited in the last survey still oppose to the bid. “The offer price is not as good as it might appear,” Bruno Japp, an analyst with the Danish financial media firm AktieUgebrevet, wrote in a note to shareholders. Mr. Japp acknowledges that for short-term investors, a no vote does not make sense. Danisco shares were trading below 550 crowns before the bid was announced, and were at 658 crowns at their last close — a gain that would be lost in the absence of the bid. But, Mr. Japp writes, anyone prepared to hold on to the shares for three to six years should reject the offer, given Danisco’s growth prospects. “Either there will be a new and higher offer, or will the stock price pass the current offerings in a few years,” he writes. He also notes that a raised bid is likely, if recent trading in Danisco shares is any indication. “DuPont’s main adviser, JPMorgan, the last week has been by far the largest net buyer,” and “foreign financial houses have generally been among the biggest net buyers,” he wrote. His editor at AktieUgebrevet, Morten W. Langer, said in an interview that according to trading data, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Nordea, another adviser, were the biggest net buyers over the last month. “They know the game,” Mr. Langer said. The biggest sellers were Danske Bank and smaller Danish banks, probably acting on the part of small Danish shareholders, who Mr. Langer said had been scared by DuPont’s statement that it would not raise its bid and feared it would be withdrawn. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are the joint lead arrangers and bookrunners of the tender offer.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/hedge-fund-urges-higher-bid-for-danisco/?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Hedge Fund Urges Higher Bid for Danisco<date>February 11, 2011, 8:57 am</date><text>Danisco, via Bloomberg News Danisco’s headquarters in Copenhagen. 10:31 a.m. | Updated Elliott Associates is back on the war path. The $17 billion hedge fund, which last week assailed the board of the Swiss pharmaceutical Actelion for a lack of transparency, has fired off another letter, this time to Danisco. Danisco, a Danish company that makes food ingredients and enzymes, unanimously recommended in January that its shareholders accept a takeover offer from DuPont for 665 Danish kronor per share. The offer values Danisco at 31.2 billion kronor, or $5.7 billion, which Elliott considers far too low. A sale of Danisco at the price offered would represent a shameful betrayal of shareholders’ interests,” the hedge fund wrote, “and we see very little prospect of shareholders accepting a price of DKK 665 per share.” A spokesman for Danisco confirmed the Elliott letter had been received, and said the company was in discussions with the hedge fund, but declined to comment further. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Danisco shares rose 4.5 kronor, or 0.684 percent, to 662 kronor in Copenhagen on Friday. “The price ignores the strength of Danisco’s unique market position and the opportunities for significant margin improvements, takes no account of the synergies available to a DuPont/Danisco combination, and fails to attribute any control premium on a successful offer,” Elliott argued. The fund, which holds about 1 percent of the company, said Danisco was worth 675 kronor now, and by analyst estimates could reach merit a valuation of 702 kronor per share this year, which would put the company at 33.5 billion kronor ($6 billion). It accused DuPont of claiming to bid at a premium, when in fact its offer was at a “material discount.” Danisco, Elliott wrote, is the second-largest player in an industry with high barriers to entry, and is “at the cusp of benefiting from significant changes in the way the world feeds its population.” Elliott predicts the DuPont offer, regardless of its recommendation, will meet with a low take-up, given that the board’s valuation is at odds with investors’. “Based on our conversations with other shareholders and with other market participants, it is our firm belief that a large proportion of the company’s institutional shareholders share our views,” the hedge fund wrote. Jorgen Tandrup, chairman of Danisco, said in an interview Friday that the Elliott letter wasn’t convincing. “It hasn’t changed my mind, and I still recommend the offer,” he said. “We’ve been through a very thorough process analyzing synergies, and based on our three-year business plan, we think this is fair value.” He said he expected to sit down with Elliott next week to discuss their concerns. Sources familiar with the progress of the offer said that people were tendering, but that Danish law provided no incentive to do so until the final days of a bid. That meant that tenders were backloaded, most occurring in the last 48 hours before an offer expired. Reuters reported last week that seven out of 10 analysts had advised shareholders to accept the offer, while half thought that DuPont might raise its bid. DuPont said Friday that its offer was “fair, full and firm.” People familiar with the deal said that DuPont had been contacted by Danisco, with which it already had a joint venture, after the Danish company had received an unsolicited and credible bid from a third party. The DuPont bid, they said, had been increased several times in competitive circumstances before the final announcement, and was part of a highly organized process orchestrated by Danisco itself.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/business/11views.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont's Muscle Is Revealed in Bid<date>Published: January 10, 2011</date><text> Merger activity has resumed in 2011 with a textbook deal: DuPont’s $5.8 billion cash offer for the Danish company Danisco, disclosed on Monday. Initially, the market got carried away with the transaction, pushing Danisco stock above DuPont’s offer of 665 kroner ($115.42) a share. But expectations of a counterbid proved short-lived.

That’s rich for the sector, though justified largely by the target’s above-average growth and profitability. The offer is also at a 90 percent premium to Danisco’s market value a year ago. Meanwhile, the cost-cutting benefits are unclear. While earnings are forecast to grow rapidly, DuPont’s likely return on the acquisition, worth $6.3 billion in all, would be less than 5 percent in Year 1. That means the American company hasn’t found a bargain, though there are strategic reasons for expanding into food science at a time when feeding the world is an increasing challenge. As for Danisco, a maker of food ingredients and additives like artificial sweeteners and cellulose gum, it’s easy to see why its board has recommended the offer, having run an auction which, astonishingly, did not leak to the media. For the same reason, it is hard to see any counterbidding action. There is always a chance that a new buyer will emerge, or that this deal will galvanize a failed suitor to return to the table. But any potential interloper is likely to be intimidated by DuPont’s show of commitment and its firepower. The deal is financed by $3 billion cash on DuPont’s balance sheet and a supporting facility from Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. DuPont was not the first bidder to signal interest in a deal. This transaction, therefore, provides evidence that corporate chieftains are ready to exploit favorable debt markets to pounce on targets that come into play — even when that means being dragged into an auction and having to pay a full “strategic price.” Expect deal flow to pick up. J.&amp;.J.’s Smart Move Smith &amp; Nephew looks nice, but not necessary for Johnson &amp; Johnson. News reports on the first meaningful Merger Monday of 2011 suggested that Johnson &amp; Johnson might be interested in buying Smith &amp; Nephew, a $10 billion-plus orthopedic group based in Britain. A deal could add to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s scale and provide a way to deploy cash stuck overseas. But there would be potential antitrust concerns as well as questions of valuation. An acquisition of Smith &amp; Nephew could give Johnson &amp; Johnson a needed bump. Sales at the health care products company are expected to rise less than 5 percent this year. Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s consumer and pharmaceuticals divisions aren’t likely to make many acquisitions anytime soon. The company has said it preferred co-licensing agreements to expand its drug business. And it is still reeling from a series of embarrassing recalls of Tylenol, Benadryl and other products. Buying Smith &amp; Nephew, on the other hand, would increase Johnson &amp; Johnson’s already dominant position in orthopedics. American hospital chains and governments globally are increasingly looking to hold down implant prices. The fewer suppliers there are, the less likely they are to succeed. Moreover, the price, for now, looks right. Suppose Johnson &amp; Johnson were to pay $11 billion for Smith &amp; Nephew. That would be three times trailing annual sales, which would make it below the average multiple of 3.7 times for similar deals, according to research by Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Furthermore, a large piece of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s $22 billion in cash and short-term investments is overseas. Bringing it home would generate a tax hit. Buying an overseas rival is a relatively more efficient use of the assets. Yet the concentrated orthopedic implant industry has run into problems with regulators before. Limited competition already means that surgeons grow accustomed to certain suppliers and tend not to switch. Greater consolidation might lead to antitrust objections. Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a history of walking away from deals over price. For example, it let Boston Scientific win Guidant in 2006 rather than outbid its rival. That was probably a smart decision, because the deal nearly pushed Boston Scientific into bankruptcy. So Johnson &amp; Johnson might not put forward an attractive enough offer to woo Smith &amp; Nephew. That would leave Johnson &amp; Johnson as the staid, low-growth company its investors have come to expect.

Barely more than a single business week into the new year, and companies have already inaugurated the first true “merger Monday” of 2011 with $21 billion in announced deals, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Among the transactions announced from Sunday night to Monday morning: Duke Energy‘s $13.7 billion merger with Progress Energy, DuPont‘s $5.8 billion deal for Danisco of Denmark, iGate’s bid of $921 million for a majority stake in Patni Computers and Hugh Hefner‘s $207 million management buyout of Playboy Enterprises.

DuPont agreed Sunday evening to buy Danisco, a Danish specialty food ingredients maker, for $5.8 billion in cash, marking the biggest deal by the chemical company in years. The deal also represents an effort by DuPont to expand the company’s offerings in more specialized areas like biofuels and food enzymes. Under the terms of the deal, DuPont will pay 655 Danish kroner, or $113.53, a share for Danisco, as well as assume $500 million of Danisco’s debt. DuPont expects to finance the deal with $3 billion in existing cash, as well as new financing. The two companies are already partners in a joint venture focused on cellulosic ethanol. Biofuels is one of the areas that DuPont’s chair and chief executive, Ellen Kullman, has identified as an important area of growth for the company going forward. “This transaction is a perfect strategic fit with our growth opportunities and will help us solve global challenges presented by dramatic population growth in the decades to come, specifically related to food and energy,” Ms. Kullman said in a statement. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release The deal is DuPont’s largest acquisition since its $7.7 billion for Pioneer Hi-Bred International, another biotechnology company, in 1999. As of Friday, DuPont had a market value of $45.4 billion. About 65 percent of Danisco’s sales come from its specialty food ingredients business, which includes cultures and sweeteners used in a variety of products: stabilizers for dairy products; antioxidants; and cultures for yogurts. The rest of its sales come from its Genencor unit, which makes enzymes for food and industrial uses. Based in Copenhagen, Danisco has nearly 7,000 employees in 23 countries. In December, the company estimated it would earn about 15.3 billion krone in revenue for its 2010-2011 fiscal year. The deal is expected to close early in the second quarter this year, and to begin adding to DuPont earnings per share next year. DuPont added that it expects the takeover to reduce its earnings-per-share outlook by about 30 cents to 45 cents per share.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/07brfs-SUITOVERPOLL_BRF.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">West Virginia: Suit Over Pollution Ends<date>Published: January 6, 2011</date><text>The DuPont Company will pay $70 million and finance long-term medical monitoring for residents of Spelter, who sued over pollution from a zinc smelter and its 100-foot-tall pile of waste.

About 320 miles north, near Midland, Mich., Hemlock Semiconductor is completing a $1 billion polycrystalline silicon plant to supply a basic raw material in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to electricity. The Hemlock plant will add 300 new jobs by the end of the year. In between the two plants are six more new solar facilities in Michigan and three others in Ohio. A number of conditions in the Midwest have allowed the sector to flourish. The upper Midwest has a history of advanced manufacturing, and machined parts and many of the basic materials of photovoltaic panels — polycrystalline in central Michigan, glass in the Toledo region, plastic films in Ohio — were already being made in the region. Both states have an abundance of shuttered plants that can be readily converted to new uses and are close to highway, rail and shipping supply lines in the center of the country. Equally important, both states have an army of unemployed or underemployed skilled manufacturing workers. The new DuPont plant, part of which encompasses a facility that was idled in 2009, is expected to open next year. “Frankly, an even bigger challenge we’ve had is to invest quickly enough to keep up with market demand,” said John Odom, global business director for DuPont Photovoltaic Fluoro Materials. This year the world will generate 38,000 megawatts of energy from the sun, 14,000 megawatts more than last year, according to a number of market research firms. The growth in the industry’s generating capacity is equivalent to 14 large coal-fired power plants. In comparison, in 1997 global demand for solar photovoltaic equipment totaled just 125 megawatts. Sales of photovoltaic cells and panels will reach $24 billion in 2010, according to the European Photovoltaic Industry Association. Much of that market is supported by incentives in the United States, Europe and Asia to build and install photovoltaic equipment. DuPont received $50.1 million in federal manufacturing tax incentives from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It also gained $7 million in state aid. Michigan has leveraged the 2009 federal stimulus bill and an array of state manufacturing incentives, tax credits and other public aid to produce $4.1 billion in public and private investment in the state’s solar manufacturing industry in the last three years, said Gregory Main, the chief executive of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, a state agency. In a national census of solar industry employment released last month, the Solar Foundation found that with 6,300 jobs, Michigan ranked fourth in solar sector jobs behind California, Pennsylvania and Texas. The Ohio Department of Development counts 1,500 jobs in its solar manufacturing sector. Toledo, Ohio, has become a center for the production of flexible sheets of photovoltaic cells called thin film that were developed from research programs at the University of Toledo. The sheets combine layers of hair-thin semiconductors with nonsilicon materials to generate power. First Solar just finished a 500,000-square-foot, $141 million addition to its existing photovoltaic thin film plant in Perrysburg, a Toledo suburb. The company, awarded a $16 million federal manufacturing investment tax credit, added 200 workers, bringing the plant’s employment to 1,100. Early next year, the Willard &amp; Kelsey Solar Group plans to start production in a 280,000-square-foot, $250 million thin-film plant in Perrysburg that will employ 100 people and that was built with nearly $20 million in state support. Michael J. Cicak, the company’s chief executive and chairman, said that the company had already sold out all its production from the plant and added that Willard &amp; Kelsey was looking 50 miles north to Tecumseh, Mich., for a second manufacturing plant. In Michigan, a center for solar industry is emerging in the Saginaw Valley around Hemlock Semiconductor’s polycrystalline silicon plant, which involves constructing multiple facilities on a 500-acre site. It is being built with the help of a $350 million state energy tax credit, Mr. Main said. Nearby in Midland, Dow Solar, a unit of Dow Chemical, plans a $249 million photovoltaic plant to make residential solar shingles, which generate electricity while serving as a conventional roof. The plant, which will open next year, was built with $17 million in federal manufacturing tax credits, and $123 million in various state aid programs. More plants are on the way, Mr. Main said. Clairvoyant Energy last year committed to a partnership with the Ford Motor Company to install a solar manufacturing facility in a shuttered Ford auto assembly plant near Detroit. But an industry that relies on government incentives and assistance is also vulnerable to the winds of political change. This fall, for instance, the value of Ohio’s public incentives and two-year-old state legislation to support solar and other clean energy manufacturing became an issue in the tight governor’s race. The incumbent, Ted Strickland, a Democrat, argued that state grants, loans and tax incentives in the last three years helped to prompt nearly $750 million in new solar investment in Ohio and hundreds of new jobs. But his Republican challenger, John Kasich, who on Nov. 2 defeated Mr. Strickland, said that Ohio’s 2008 clean energy standard, which requires utilities to produce 25 percent of their electricity from solar and other “advanced sources” by 2025, would raise costs and was a government intrusion. “You can‘t mandate invention,” Mr. Kasich said. Three weeks later in Washington, the United States Trade Representative’s office announced it would investigate Chinese government support for makers of solar, wind and other clean energy products that compete with similar equipment now made in the Midwest. Chinese officials responded that the investigation could set off an trade battle that the United States could not win. Solar industry analysts said that a confrontation with China could hit DuPont hard. The company’s new plant will manufacture Tedlar, a durable plastic film used to protect solar photovoltaic panels from moisture and ultraviolet radiation. Most of the Tedlar produced in Ohio will be sold to producers in China, who are now making half of the solar photovoltaic panels in a global market that is growing 30 percent annually. In both states, solar executives and political leaders expressed concern that the Democratic lawmakers both states sent to Washington, as well as the governors of both states that helped the solar initiatives had been replaced by Republicans who had expressed skepticism about publicly financed incentives. Rob Nichols, a spokesman for Governor-elect Kasich, said Mr. Kasich did not oppose Ohio’s renewable energy standard and would not seek to repeal it. “I know some people have said some negative things, but I suspect that we will continue to pursue alternative energy production,” said Mr. Main of Michigan’s development agency. “The track record in job growth has been so strong in our state. I can’t imagine us walking away.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/business/27dupont.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont’s Profit and Sales Surpass Expectations<date>Published: October 26, 2010</date><text>DuPont, the chemical maker, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and raised its 2010 earnings forecast as sales to the solar, auto and electronic sectors surged.The results reflect improving consumer demand in the United States and Asia, as well as DuPont’s ability to win market share, especially in the agricultural market, analysts said. DuPont said demand for car paint, electronic parts and genetically modified seeds were all strong in the third quarter, and the only area of weakness in its business was in the construction sector, which uses DuPont’s Tyvek house wrap. DuPont raised its forecast for 2010 profit to $3.10 a share from $2.90 to $3.05. Analysts had forecast $3.04. DuPont reported third-quarter profit of $367 million, or 40 cents a share, compared with $409 million, or 45 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 34 cents a share. Total revenue rose 14.8 percent, to $7.7 billion, above analysts’ expectations of $6.72 billion. Although the results beat expectations, shares of DuPont, which is based in Wilmington, Del., fell 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $47.23. DuPont said revenue from the United States, which has typically lagged other regions, rose 17 percent in the third quarter. But Asian sales remained DuPont’s breadwinner and rose 31 percent, while Europe rose 9 percent. Volume rose 14 percent, while local selling prices increased 5 percent. Sales rose in all of DuPont’s’s six business units. For example, sales in its safety unit, which makes Kevlar bulletproof vests and Nomex, a heat-resistant material popular with firefighters, jumped 30 percent. DuPont spent aggressively on agricultural research in the quarter, and the loss in that segment widened to $181 million from $113 million.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/business/28dupont.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Net Income at DuPont Nearly Tripled in Quarter<date>Published: July 27, 2010</date><text>The DuPont Company, the chemical maker, said Tuesday that its net income nearly tripled in the second quarter as revenue surged in most of its businesses and it raised prices.The company also raised its earnings forecast for the year, saying it expected to continue to benefit from higher prices, growing sales and better efficiency. DuPont, which makes Teflon and Kevlar, said its net income rose to $1.16 billion, or $1.26 a share, from $417 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain related to a tax settlement, DuPont earned $1.17 a share, topping the 93 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 26 percent, to $8.62 billion from $6.86 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $8.27 billion. Most of the increase was a result of higher volume, but higher prices were responsible for about 5 percent of the increase, DuPont said. The company said the economy was recovering, and several of its businesses were doing better than before the recession. Revenue was higher in all of DuPont’s regions, led by the Asia-Pacific, where revenue rose 47 percent to $1.8 billion. Emerging markets revenue also soared, improving 32 percent. Revenue in the United States, which makes up the biggest part of its business, rose 18 percent to $3.6 billion, while revenue in Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 24 percent to $2.1 billion.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/business/28dupont.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Profit and Sales Rise at DuPont<date>Published: April 27, 2010</date><text>DOVER, Del. (AP) — The chemical maker DuPont Company continued its turnaround with a strong first quarter performance, as business improved across all operating units and market regions.The company also increased its full-year earnings forecast as it reported earnings of about $1.14 billion, or $1.24 a share, for the quarter ending March 31, up from $488 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $8.48 billion, up 23 percent from $6.87 billion, for the corresponding period last year, as DuPont, benefited from volume gains, price increases and positive currency effects. The results beat expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, who predicted a profit of $1.06 a share on revenue of just over $8 billion. The company had been relying on results from its agriculture and nutrition business while units that sold coatings and other products to the automotive and housing markets struggled during the recession. Those businesses had strong gains in revenue and operating profit during the first quarter. DuPont’s strong first-quarter performance followed a turnaround in the fourth quarter of last year, when it swung to a $441 million profit from a $629 million loss in the final three months of 2008. As in the fourth quarter, DuPont’s performance chemicals unit saw increased demand for titanium dioxide in the first three months of this year. DuPont officials have said demand for products such as titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in consumer goods, house paint and automotive coatings, often indicates whether the economy is growing or contracting, particularly in the short term. DuPont on Tuesday cited a recovery in the automotive and industrial markets, and moderate strengthening in construction markets, for improved performance in its safety and protection unit, whose products include Kevlar aramid fiber and Tyvek house wrap. Overall sales volume increased by 19 percent, led by a 65 percent volume increase in the Asia-Pacific region. Performance among DuPont’s various business segments was led by the electronics and communications unit, which reported a 60 percent increase in volume on strong global demand, led by the Asia-Pacific region, and increased demand for photovoltaics.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/04/26/bofa-said-to-near-decision-on-chairman/?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">BofA Said to Near Decision on Chairman<date>April 26, 2010, 6:32 am</date><text>Bank of America has narrowed the contenders for chairman to the directors Frank Bramble and Charles Holliday, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Peter Applebome It seems every decade here has its own restaging of the same environmental horror story. It began with the old DuPont munitions plant that left behind a trail of lead and mercury, contaminated soil and water and a plume of toxic vapor still capable of leaking into at least 450 houses. The story has no end in sight. There was the initial wave of concern in the 1970s, the first serious opposition by the borough’s government in the 1980s, the $38.5 million settlement from DuPont in the 1990s, a smaller suit and ruling against the company in 2002. Still, the toxic legacy is as real now as it was decades ago. Hence the volatile mixture of newfound hope, raw anger and pent-up frustration Thursday night when residents gathered at the local Elks Lodge. “DuPont will try to get away with as much as they can get away with anytime they can,” John Sinsimer, the mayor of Pompton Lakes from 1988 to 1992, told the group. Citing advice he was given back then, he added: “First they try to buy you. Then they try to bully you. Then they try and bury you.” Maybe three decades on it’s not exactly the same. DuPont has a full-page ad in the local newspaper citing its cleanup efforts over 20 years, its focus on removing more than 200,000 tons of contaminated soil and sediment and its plans for groundwater cleanup systems. But at a time when everyone everywhere seems angry about something, the one undeniable lesson here, improvising on the old labor adage is: Don’t vent. Don’t mourn. Organize. From 1902 until 1994, the 570-acre DuPont Works in this tiny borough of lakes and streams manufactured blasting caps and explosives. The stream near the works became known as Acid Brook, its colors changing depending on what chemicals were in the water. People are still split between loyalty to the company that provided jobs to their community and anger at the company that polluted it. But the environmental concerns remain constant. A report released by the state Department of Health and Senior Services in December found “significantly elevated” rates of kidney cancer in women and non-Hodgkins lymphoma in men in the area most polluted. The report said it could not make a definitive link between the chemicals and the cancer (rates for 11 other cancers sampled were not similarly elevated), but trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene, two of the chemicals in the plume, have been found to increase the risk of kidney cancer and lymphoma. Officials reiterated a two-year-old recommendation that residents should install vapor mitigation systems designed to remove gases seeping into homes from a toxic plume in the groundwater under the homes. DuPont already has installed a system in about 170 of the 450 homes over the plume, but many questions and fears remain. It is, it seems, the same story, new act. But it is not. TWO years ago, when the dangers of the plume were identified, two friends from childhood, Lisa Riggiola and Regina Sisco, formed Citizens for a Clean Pompton Lakes, which sponsored last week’s meeting. In December 2009 both United States senators and the local congressman, Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., wrote to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, calling the situation “a serious public health concern that needs immediate attention.” In another letter to the E.P.A. last week, they recommended that the agency provide resources, including a team in town five days a week and mobile laboratories to monitor air quality and chemical concentrations, as well as other measures. State and federal environmental officials said last week that they would allow residents to pick their own vapor mitigation contractors. Solving the long-term problems, particularly the cleanup of the polluted groundwater, is a long way off. Bob Nelson, a spokesman for E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, said if the cleanup were a simple one it would have been done long ago. “Our intention is to do right by the people of the town, and DuPont is not going anywhere until the contamination is remediated,” he said. But people in town can be forgiven for thinking that sitting atop a toxic plume and living with a long legacy of contamination give a sense of urgency that the company and the state environmental officials don’t share. And, so, for the first time, people seem to think they have at least the potential for controlling their destiny. At the evening’s end, a voice from the crowd said some in town thought the organizers of the citizen’s group were loudmouths and troublemakers. “Thank you for being loudmouths,” she said, to loud and persistent applause.

In December 2009 both United States senators and the local congressman, Representative William J. Pascrell Jr., wrote to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, calling the situation “a serious public health concern that needs immediate attention.” In another letter to the E.P.A. last week, they recommended that the agency provide resources, including a team in town five days a week and mobile laboratories to monitor air quality and chemical concentrations, as well as other measures. State and federal environmental officials said last week that they would allow residents to pick their own vapor mitigation contractors. Solving the long-term problems, particularly the cleanup of the polluted groundwater, is a long way off. Bob Nelson, a spokesman for E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company, said if the cleanup were a simple one it would have been done long ago. “Our intention is to do right by the people of the town, and DuPont is not going anywhere until the contamination is remediated,” he said. But people in town can be forgiven for thinking that sitting atop a toxic plume and living with a long legacy of contamination give a sense of urgency that the company and the state environmental officials don’t share. And, so, for the first time, people seem to think they have at least the potential for controlling their destiny. At the evening’s end, a voice from the crowd said some in town thought the organizers of the citizen’s group were loudmouths and troublemakers. “Thank you for being loudmouths,” she said, to loud and persistent applause.

The Justice Department’s antitrust division “is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the seed industry,” a department spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, said. Monsanto will not block seed makers from creating generic versions of any of its gene-modified seeds as they lose patent protection, the chief executive, Hugh Grant, said. Starting in 2015, farmers can replant Roundup Ready soybeans saved from the last year’s harvest, and rival seed makers can create their own Roundup-tolerant seeds. “We understand why regulators would want to know more about competition in modern agriculture and how products are commercialized and used,” Scott Partridge, Monsanto’s chief deputy general counsel, said in the statement. “We believe that an objective review will show our business and our industry to be competitive.” The company said it had provided access to “millions of pages of documents” and it was cooperating with the inquiry.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Dan Gill/Associated Press In 2014, the patent for Monsanto's Roundup soybean seeds will expire, the first expiration on a widely used bioengineered crop. Related Times Topics: Monsanto Company Add to Portfolio Monsanto Co DuPont Company Go to your Portfolio » In letters to seed companies and farm groups this week, Monsanto said that it would allow farmers to continue to grow its hugely popular Roundup Ready 1 soybeans even after the patent protecting the technology expires in 2014. The letter countered a widespread impression in the agriculture business that Monsanto planned to force farmers and seed companies to migrate to a successor product called Roundup Ready 2 Yield, which will remain under patent and is more expensive. The issue has potentially broad implications for the agriculture industry because Roundup Ready soybeans will be the first widely grown biotechnology crop to lose patent protection since gene splicing became a mainstay of crop science in the 1990s. Because farmers and seed companies would no longer have to pay royalties to Monsanto on the gene after 2014, Roundup Ready soybeans would become agricultural biotechnology’s equivalent of a generic drug. Monsanto’s statement comes as the Justice Department is investigating possible antitrust concerns in the seed business, looking in particular at Monsanto, which dominates the business of supplying crop traits developed through genetic engineering. Critics, including some competitors, say that Monsanto has great leverage over the seed business and growers through restrictive contracts that must be signed to use Monsanto’s genes or to grow the genetically modified crops. Monsanto calls such criticisms baseless. But it certainly is getting harder for seed companies to avoid using the Roundup Ready bacterial gene, which makes the plants impervious to the widely used herbicide glyphosate, which Monsanto sells as Roundup. That allows farmers to spray their fields to kill weeds without harming the crops. More than 90 percent of the soybeans grown in the United States contain it. So do about two-thirds of the nation’s corn and cotton crops, though those are protected by different patents that expire later than the soybean patent. Gerald A. Steiner, executive vice president for corporate affairs at Monsanto, said Thursday that Monsanto was not changing its policy on how it would handle the soybean patent expiration, but was merely clarifying its intentions. “What’s different,” he said, “is we have made a very comprehensive communication of what we are going to do.” But the widespread impression in the seed business was that Monsanto was backing away from a previous policy. “The only thing we were told was that as of 2014 you would not be able to sell any more Roundup Ready 1,” said Jack Debolt, manager of Advanced Genetics, a coalition of small Ohio seed companies that license the Roundup Ready gene from Monsanto to put in their seeds. Monsanto’s biggest competitor, DuPont’s Pioneer Hi-Bred seed company, has also accused Monsanto of antitrust violations including, as it says in a lawsuit, an effort to “remove Roundup Ready from the market prior to the time when competitors will be able to produce a generic product.” Mr. Steiner of Monsanto said one reason for the company’s letters this week was to counter statements made by Pioneer, which Monsanto has sued alleging patent infringement. Roundup Ready seed can cost as much as $75 an acre compared with $30 to $35 for soybean seeds that are not genetically modified, according to James Beuerlein, a soybean specialist at Ohio State University. The difference in price is thought to reflect mainly royalties paid to Monsanto. While Monsanto sells Roundup Ready seeds itself, it also licenses the technology to other seed companies. Some seed industry executives and academic soybean specialists say that Monsanto was not planning to renew licenses for that Roundup Ready 1 trait that expired before 2014, so that seed companies would have no choice but to move to Roundup Ready 2. But in its letters this week, Monsanto said it would now extend all contracts for Roundup Ready 1 until the patent’s expiration date. It also said it would not enforce language in some contracts that would have required seed companies to destroy or return Roundup Ready seed when the patent expired. And Monsanto said seed companies could continue to sell seeds containing the Roundup Ready 1 trait without jeopardizing their access to the successor technology. Monsanto also said that after the patent expired it would allow farmers to save Roundup Ready 1 seeds from one year’s crop to plant the next. Monsanto said it would not enforce other patents that might protect those seeds. Many soybean farmers used to save seeds, but with Roundup Ready seeds they have been contractually obliged to buy new seeds each year. Monsanto has taken legal action against hundreds, if not thousands, of farmers it has accused of saving seed. “This is a pretty big concession for Monsanto,” said Shawn Conley, a soybean specialist at the University of Wisconsin, who said saving seed could save farmers a lot of money. Still, it is uncertain how long Roundup Ready 1 would survive in generic form. Some nations require licenses for the import of genetically engineered crops to be periodically renewed. Monsanto said it would maintain those licenses through 2017. But if they expired after that, American farmers would not be permitted to export the Roundup Ready 1 generic soybeans to certain countries, which would discourage them from growing those crops. Monsanto said it was confident that most farmers and seed companies would move to Roundup Ready 2, which uses the same bacterial gene but places it in a different location in the soybean DNA. Monsanto said that Roundup Ready 2 crops would have higher yields, and that other desirable traits would be added to those crops over time.

Sloan Sustainability Initiative. In that spirit, several major corporations have taken inspiration from the open-source software movement and are experimenting with forums for sharing environmentally friendly innovations and building communities around them. The first such effort, the Eco-Patent Commons, was started in January 2008 by I.B.M., Nokia, Pitney Bowes and Sony in collaboration with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. The concept is straightforward: Companies pledge environmental patents to the commons, and anyone can use them  free. Many patented environmental technologies are not strategic, so sharing maximizes the social benefit without sacrificing competitive advantage, says Wayne Balta, vice president of corporate environmental affairs and product safety at I.B.M. For instance, I.B.M. contributed a recyclable cardboard packaging insert that requires less fossil fuel to create and transport than the foam inserts that are now commonly used. Other examples include a DuPont method for better detecting pollution in soil, air or water by using a microorganism that produces light when exposed to a pollutant. There are also methods from Xerox for removing toxic waste from contaminated groundwater, as well as a cleaning technique for semiconductor wafers from I.B.M. that uses ozone gas and eliminates chemical contaminants that result from other processes. By assembling these patents in one easily accessible location  anyone can search through them on the council’s Web site  the hope is to encourage their widespread adoption, particularly in the developing world. Since its start, the commons has grown to 100 patents from 31, with 11 companies now participating. Although there are no formal mechanisms for tracking who has used the commons, participating companies are sometimes contacted by users. For instance, Mr. Balta said that Yale had put into effect an I.B.M. method for decreasing the use of hazardous solvents in its quantum computing device research. The Creative Commons, a nonprofit organization that previously developed licensing programs to help in sharing creative and scientific content, is also planning to branch out into the environmental arena. In collaboration with Nike and Best Buy, it plans to start a sharing initiative, the Green Xchange, in early 2010. The program will include both patented technologies and forums for continuing exchange of innovations such as Best Buy’s system for rating the sustainability of a supply chain. Companies that contribute patents to the Green Xchange will have the option of charging users a fixed annual licensing fee and can also restrict any licensing by rivals or for competitive use. In addition, even if no annual fee is charged, patent users must register so there is a record of who is using what technology. Though more complex than that of Eco-Patent Commons, the structure of Green Xchange will yield greater numbers of high-quality inventions, says John Wilbanks, GreenXchange coordinator and vice president for science at Creative Commons. “We don’t depend on altruism,” Mr. Wilbanks says. “This system helps the environment while enabling a firm to make money from patents in applications outside its core business.” For instance, Nike’s air-bag patent for cushioning shoes is crucial to its core shoe business, but may have environmental benefits in other industries  perhaps in prolonging the useful life of tires. Green Xchange could enable Nike to license the air-bag technology selectively to noncompeting companies. ACCORDING to Kelly Lauber, a global director in Nike’s Sustainable Business and Innovation Lab, sharing technology can have tremendous environmental impact. By sharing its water-based adhesive technology and working with footwear makers, Ms. Lauber estimates that average levels of environmentally harmful solvents used by Nike’s suppliers have decreased to less than 15 grams per pair of shoes from 350 in 1997. Perhaps the biggest upside of Green Xchange may come from the development of communities that collaborate in innovation and the exchange of ideas. To encourage that kind of interaction, Salesforce.com will provide a search engine, making it easy to find patents. And collaboration platforms from companies like 2degrees and nGenera should make it easy to identify companies with common interests. Despite the obvious advantages, sharing patents isn’t as easy as it might sound. “Numerous features of the intellectual property system, particularly the ability of companies to claim large swaths of technology through patents, play havoc with collaborative efforts,” says Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School. Henry Chesbrough, the executive director of the Center for Open Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley, says it is surprisingly hard to give away technologies. “If it is not done carefully,” he said, “the companies that use a donated technology might find themselves liable for infringement of another company’s patent.” Both the Eco-Patent Commons and the Green Xchange pose organizational challenges for participating companies. “Deciding which patents to pledge or license to a commons,” says Andrew King, a professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, “requires that the legal counsel, R.&amp; D. staff, business unit and corporate sustainability groups all work together, and most organizations just aren’t set up for that.” Weaving corporate togetherness, it seems, isn’t so easy  though green innovations offer many more reasons to try.

As U.S. farmers prepare to harvest billions of bushels of corn and soybeans — main ingredients in food, livestock feed and transportation fuel around the world — the two titans of seed technology, Monsanto and DuPont, are ramping up their rivalry to new heights. DuPont is accusing Monsanto of illegal anti-competitive practices, while Monsanto counters that DuPont is engaging in a covert smear campaign that borders on fraud. The chief executive of Monsanto, Hugh Grant, this week sent a letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, to the DuPont chairman, Charles O. Holliday Jr., accusing the company of a “serious breach of business ethics” and requesting that a special committee of DuPont’s independent directors investigate what Mr. Grant called an “attack” on Monsanto’s seed business. Monsanto executives claim that DuPont has supported forged documents and secretly financed Monsanto critics. “This is just the tip of the iceberg of dirty tricks. I have never seen corporate conduct of this nature,” said a lawyer at Monsanto, Scott Partridge. DuPont counters that it is trying to expose what it calls Monsanto’s “illegal monopoly” and the harm it says Monsanto is doing to farmers and others up and down the food chain. “This is not just a DuPont problem. This is a competition problem,” said a lawyer for DuPont, Donald L. Flexner. “They’ve gained illegal monopoly power.” The stakes have risen as both the U.S. Agriculture and Justice Departments said this month that they would start an examination of competition and antitrust concerns in the seed industry. “We understand that there are concerns regarding the levels of concentration in the seed industry, particularly for corn and soybeans,” said Philip J. Weiser, deputy assistant attorney general in the antitrust division at the Justice Department. Both companies have strong positions in the U.S. seed industry and have been racing each other and other competitors to develop higher-yielding crops through genetic modifications and other means. This spring, the competition spilled into the courts as Monsanto and DuPont sued each other over a soured licensing arrangement. Monsanto claimed DuPont was using the herbicide-tolerant technology of its Roundup Ready seeds outside the scope of the agreement. DuPont countersued, seeking relief under antitrust laws to end what it called “Monsanto’s multifaceted, anti-competitive scheme to unlawfully restrict competition.” Monsanto claims, and DuPont does not dispute, that DuPont has been aligning itself with, and in some cases financing, groups critical of Monsanto. Monsanto in turn has started an effort to discredit DuPont, working with a Washington law firm to circulate documents that lay out a series of scathing accusations. The documents accuse DuPont of misleading investors about certain product capabilities, as well as involvement in what Monsanto has said were several falsified letters to lawmakers and others who criticize Monsanto. A Monsanto spokesman, Lee Quarles, said the company wanted to protect itself against DuPont’s “smear campaigns” designed to “compete through deceit.” A DuPont spokesman, Anthony Farina, said Monsanto was engaging in a “campaign of diversion” and that DuPont was cooperating with a group of attorneys general from states including Iowa, the top U.S. corn grower, investigating Monsanto’s business practices. The biotechnology companies are battling while farmers, agricultural academics and consumer groups are growing increasingly concerned about climbing seed prices and industry concentration, which they say restricts the supply of seeds that have not been genetically modified. “We’re hearing lots of complaints from farmers about huge price increases and that non-G.M.O. seed availability no longer exists,” said Bill Wenzel, national director of the Farmer to Farmer Campaign on Genetic Engineering, which has been studying the sharp price increases in soy and corn seed in recent years. G.M.O. stands for genetically modified organisms. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »KANSAS CITY, Mo. — It’s getting dirty down on the farm. As U.S. farmers prepare to harvest billions of bushels of corn and soybeans — main ingredients in food, livestock feed and transportation fuel around the world — the two titans of seed technology, Monsanto and DuPont, are ramping up their rivalry to new heights. DuPont is accusing Monsanto of illegal anti-competitive practices, while Monsanto counters that DuPont is engaging in a covert smear campaign that borders on fraud. The chief executive of Monsanto, Hugh Grant, this week sent a letter, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, to the DuPont chairman, Charles O. Holliday Jr., accusing the company of a “serious breach of business ethics” and requesting that a special committee of DuPont’s independent directors investigate what Mr. Grant called an “attack” on Monsanto’s seed business. Monsanto executives claim that DuPont has supported forged documents and secretly financed Monsanto critics. “This is just the tip of the iceberg of dirty tricks. I have never seen corporate conduct of this nature,” said a lawyer at Monsanto, Scott Partridge.

They want to create varieties of corn, wheat and other crops that can thrive with little water. Skip to next paragraph The Food Chain Modified Crops Articles in this series are examining the growing demands on, and changes in, the world's production of food. Previous Articles in the Series » Enlarge This Image Wendy Carlson for The New York Times With worries over water supplies, there is a push for more crop per drop. Above, Monsantos research center in Connecticut. As the world’s population expands and global warming alters weather patterns, water shortages are expected to hold back efforts to grow more food. People drink only a quart or two of water every day, but the food they eat in a typical day, including plants and meat, requires 2,000 to 3,000 quarts to produce. For companies that manage to get “more crop per drop,” the payoff could be huge, and scientists at many of the biggest agricultural companies are busy tweaking plant genes in search of the winning formula. Monsanto, the biggest crop biotechnology company, says its first drought-tolerant corn will reach farmers in only four years and will provide a 10 percent increase in yields in states like Nebraska and Kansas that tend to get less rainfall than eastern parts of the Corn Belt. At a recent farm show here called Husker Harvest Days, a few thousand farmers were guided past a small plot on which Monsanto had grown its drought-tolerant corn next to a similar variety without the “drought gene.” A transparent tent had shielded the plants from any rain through the hot Nebraska summer. The results were, to be sure, less than miraculous. Both the drought-tolerant and the comparison plants were turning brown and shriveling, and they were about three feet shorter than the lush green irrigated corn growing nearby. But the drought-tolerant plants, which also contained a second gene to protect their roots from a pest, were a little greener and a few inches taller than the comparison plants, and their cobs were missing fewer kernels. Monsanto said the improvement was significant. And the Nebraska and Kansas farmers who toured Monsanto’s plot, many of them facing water-use restrictions and soaring pumping costs for irrigation, said any improvement would be welcome. “We pump water like there’s no end, and that’s not going to last forever,” said Tom Schuele, a farmer in Cedar Rapids, Neb. Monsanto’s competitors, including DuPont’s Pioneer Hi-Bred unit and Syngenta, say they also plan to introduce water-efficient corn in a few years. And companies are working on plants that can stand up to heat, cold, salty soils and other tough environments. A small California company called Arcadia Biosciences is trying to develop crops that need only half as much nitrogen fertilizer as a conventional plant. Fertilizer is crucial to modern food production, but the large quantities used today damage the environment. And because fertilizer is made from natural gas, its costs have soared along with other energy costs. Public sector scientists are also on the hunt. Researchers at the University of California and the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines are developing rice that can survive flooding, which causes major crop losses for poor farmers in the lowlands of India and other countries. While rice is typically grown in standing water, the plants will die if submerged for more than a few days. Many of these advanced crops are being developed using genetic engineering. The technology, already used to make crops that can resist weeds and insects, has spurred worldwide controversy. But in an era in which people are marching in the streets of many countries to demand more food at lower prices, low-water crops might win over areas that now shun biotech crops, such as most of Africa. “Drought tolerance to me is the most critical entry point,” said Calestous Juma, a professor of international development at Harvard who has advised African governments on biotechnology. “This is kind of reopening the window for genetic modification.” Critics accuse the biotechnology industry and its backers of exploiting the recent global food crisis to push a technology that has been oversold and that could have unanticipated health and environmental effects. Indeed, many past predictions of how biotechnology would create novel crops have not come to fruition. And some experts say Monsanto and its peers have not published enough information to prove they can make drought-tolerant crops. “I want to see more, I guess, from the Monsanto work before I’d be convinced they’ve got it,” said John S. Boyer, an emeritus professor at the University of Delaware. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on October 23, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.GRAND ISLAND, Neb.  To satisfy the world’s growing demand for food, scientists are trying to pull off a genetic trick that nature itself has had trouble accomplishing in millions of years of evolution.

The case involves thousands of residents in and around Spelter, W.Va., where DuPont operated a zinc-smelting plant. Last October, a jury in Harrison County ruled that DuPont deliberately endangered those residents by dumping toxic arsenic, cadmium and lead at the plant. In the largest civil penalty ever levied against DuPont, the court ordered the company to pay nearly $382 million to monitor nearly 8,000 residents in the area for signs of cancer, to clean up the site and pay punitive damages. On June 24, the company appealed to the State Supreme Court. Mr. Manchin, a Democrat in his first term who is up for re-election in November, filed his brief the same day, pressing the court to consider the case. (The court went into summer recess without indicating whether it would hear the appeal.) It was the first time a West Virginia governor had taken such action in a case in which the state was not a party, one expert said, and Mr. Manchin’s actions angered plaintiffs, who argued that the executive branch was inappropriately pressuring the judicial branch. The governor’s spokesman said that Mr. Manchin only wanted to ensure that cases involving punitive damages received a full airing from the Supreme Court and that he was not weighing in on behalf of DuPont. But new documents reveal a more complicated picture. On June 2, the governor met with the vice president of DuPont and one of the company’s lawyers to discuss the brief, according to records of the meetings obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. The governor also spoke on the phone with DuPont’s chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Holliday Jr., on Nov. 20, 2007, less than a month after the verdict, according to the documents. Shortly before the governor filed his brief, DuPont lawyers provided his office with two draft briefs that made many of the same arguments he later used in his brief, documents show. The day Mr. Manchin filed the brief, his office also requested assistance by e-mail from DuPont with the procedural requirements for filing. When questioned by the plaintiff’s lawyers about DuPont’s draft brief, the governor’s office said that some of the e-mail correspondence between the company and his office had been erased, according to documents from the governor’s office. In an interview, however, Carte Goodwin, Mr. Manchin’s lawyer, said that “any e-mails of note” between DuPont and the governor’s office had been preserved and turned over to the plaintiff’s lawyers. Mr. Goodwin also said that, as often happens, the draft brief from DuPont came to the governor’s office unsolicited. Mr. Goodwin, in an e-mail message, said Mr. Manchin, in his brief, had raised “a purely legal and technical question that is important to the citizens of this state.” Mr. Goodwin added, “The governor neither opines on the underlying merits of the case nor argues for the reversal or modification of the jury’s verdict.” But a DuPont spokesman, Daniel A. Turner, said in an e-mail message that it was the governor who had asked DuPont to provide a draft brief. Mr. Turner said DuPont simply wanted “a full and fair Supreme Court review of the trial court outcome,” and to that end, the company also asked the West Virginia State Medical Association in April to file a brief on DuPont’s behalf, which the association did. “Like any organization, DuPont is entitled to raise issues of public concern with public officials,” Mr. Turner said. The documents from the governor’s office also reveal overlap between Mr. Manchin’s staff and DuPont. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on August 13, 2008, on page A14 of the New York edition.When Gov.

The increase of as much as 25 percent -- the largest in the company's history -- comes after a 20 percent rise last month that the company said did not go far enough given the continuing surge in energy prices. Dow, which makes products ranging from pesticides to plastic wraps, also said it would impose freight surcharges of $300 for each truck shipment and $600 for each rail shipment beginning Aug. 1 in the United States. In addition, it will scale back production in plants across North America and Europe. Andrew N. Liveris, the company's chairman and chief executive, said the changes were ''extremely unwelcome but entirely unavoidable'' as oil and natural gas continue to set records. Oil prices are up more than 40 percent this year and have risen $9 a barrel since Dow's earlier price increase. Natural gas is up more than 70 percent this year. ''There came a point where the surge became so ridiculous that we had to raise prices,'' Chris Huntley, a company spokesman, said, adding that the latest price increase would affect everything from fabric and cushions to CD cases, Styrofoam and car parts. Analysts said they expected other companies to follow suit. When Dow announced last month's increases, it spurred a series of similar increases by other chemical manufacturers, including DuPont and BASF. Dow's announcement is the latest indication that companies are beginning to pass along the burden of high energy prices to consumers. Until now, those prices had largely been absorbed by company profits because market competition prevented retailers from increasing prices at their stores even as skyrocketing costs continued to strain earnings. But extreme pressure is building in the production chain. For example, Lowe's, the home improvement company, has been receiving ''unprecedented requests'' for price increases from its suppliers, Robert F. Hull Jr., the chief financial officer, said at a conference. Mr. Hull added that the company had been absorbing price increases itself ''to maintain the supply of product,'' which has put a strain on gross margins, but he forecast that some of that increase would be passed along later this year. In addition to soaring energy costs, companies are also having to deal with the increase in the cost of raw materials. Posco of South Korea, one of the world's largest steel producers, said Tuesday that it was raising prices by more than 20 percent. That followed an agreement Monday between the global mining company Rio Tinto Group and the biggest steel maker in China, Baosteel, to raise the price Baosteel pays for Australian iron ore by as much as 97 percent. ''It's clearly a global trend that the higher costs of raw materials are being passed on along the production chain,'' said Holger Schmieding, chief European economist at the London office of Bank of America. ''Companies have no alternative but to pass that along to their customers.'' Producer prices in the United States rose 7.2 percent in May from a year earlier, while comparable euro zone prices rose 6.1 percent in April, the latest month for which data were available. Chinese producer prices are rising at nearly a 12 percent annual rate. The rise in prices also partly reflects the weakness of the dollar, as producers outside the United States demand more of the currency for their goods as its buying power declines. In addition, a ripple effect has been created in which the rise in crude oil costs has carried over into other sectors. Economists say the $664 billion chemical industry has been among the hardest hit by soaring energy prices. Every $1 increase in crude oil prices costs the industry $660 million a year, said Kevin Swift, chief economist at the American Chemistry Council. For Dow Chemical, its feedstock and energy costs, which are up more than 40 percent since last year, have increased fourfold in the last five years, to more than $32 billion this year. Dow, whose shares fell nearly 3 percent on Tuesday, has been steadily increasing prices for the last several years, but it is only in the last month that consumers have been directly hit. ''These costs have surged so much that the middle guys say they can't absorb any more,'' Mr. Liveris said in an interview this month. ''There is no reason the middle of the supply chain should have to absorb it.'' PHOTO: A Dow Chemical complex in Midland, Mich.

But here in China, the world’s fastest-growing market for security and crime-control equipment, it is business as usual between Western multinationals and Chinese police agencies. At the recent China International Exhibition on Police Equipment here, sponsored by the Ministry of Public Security, DuPont had a large exhibit promoting Kevlar bulletproof fabric for riot police use. Motorola was selling police radio systems as well as wireless systems for transmitting vast quantities of video surveillance data. And with the slogan “dress to kill” on their black T-shirts, top executives from Magnum of Britain showed off their latest police boots. “Chinese police deserve the best  Magnum protects the protectors,” said Paul Brooks, the company’s president, in a speech to police officials. The most intriguing device offered at the show to senior Chinese security agency officials was the Image Masster RoadMasster, a powerful computer system that swiftly copies computer hard drives without leaving any trace and comes concealed in its own color-coordinated briefcase. Gonen Ravid, the chief executive of the device’s manufacturer, Intelligent Computer Solutions in Chatsworth, Calif., said that the company sells exactly the same equipment in the same briefcases to the Pentagon for use in Iraq, and to the Central Intelligence Agency and other Western intelligence agencies for use around the world. No company in China makes similar equipment, he said. “The U.S.,” he said, “is still leading with this.” The trade show coincided with increasing controversy in the United States over American exports of crime-control equipment to China. After the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, Congress passed a law that remains in effect today: it bans “the export to the People’s Republic of China of any crime control or detection instruments or equipment.” The Commerce Department drafted regulations in the early 1990s to put that ban into effect. But those initial regulations  which officials have said clearly apply to products aimed exclusively at law enforcement agencies, like fingerprint kits  paid little attention to the rising computer industry and have not been updated. The department did an internal review last winter of the rules. It is now seeking public comment on how and whether it should update its regulations on exports of crime control and detection equipment to any country subject to restrictions. Asked about the abundant American gear shown at the police equipment trade show, Mario Mancuso, the under secretary of commerce for industry and security, replied with a one-sentence written statement: “Enforcing U.S. regulations on crime control equipment, including the Tiananmen Square Sanctions, is a top priority, and we continually review our regulations to ensure that they effectively support our national security and foreign policy.” Another Commerce Department official said that questions from The New York Times about American equipment exhibited at the trade show had prompted the department to begin a review of whether American laws might have been broken. The official insisted on anonymity, in keeping with a department policy of not commenting on work that might lead to law enforcement actions. The department has officials in Beijing and Hong Kong who look for violations of export control laws, but did not try to send anyone into the police equipment trade show. A reporter for The New York Times was able to enter the show by filling out a routine questionnaire at the entrance about his interest in the security industry, identifying himself in English on the form as a correspondent for the newspaper and providing a copy of his business card. The trade show was held from April 16 to 19 at a small compound near the center of Beijing; the compound is reserved for commercial events with top-level government backing. At least two Hong Kong companies at the show set up booths to market fingerprint identification kits that were prominently marked as having been made in the United States by American companies. Many other products at the trade show were also from the United States, but their manufacturers said that they were complying with American laws. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »BEIJING  For the Chinese police agency boss who thought he had everything, the police equipment trade show here was a chance to scrutinize the latest offerings from manufacturers around the world for secretly copying computer hard drives, suppressing riots or collecting video surveillance of public streets.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show Chemistry Aimed at Conservation Enlarge This Image Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times John Frost, left, and his wife, Karen Draths, in their company lab. More Photos » Much of what you see in there comes from petroleum, too: the plastic dashboard, the foam in the seats. More than a tenth of the world’s oil is spent not on powering engines but as a feedstock for making chemicals that enrich many goods  from cosmetics to cleaners and fabric to automobile parts. In recent years, this unsettling fact has motivated academic researchers and corporations to find ways to make bulk chemicals from renewable sources like corn and switchgrass. The effort to tap biomass for chemicals runs parallel to the higher-stakes research aimed at developing biofuels. Researchers hope that the two will come together soon to help replace petroleum refineries with biorefineries. “As petroleum prices go up and climate change becomes a serious concern, the economy will have no choice but to switch to a chemical base derived from plant materials,” said Dr. Richard Gross, director of the Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. The chemical industry is beginning to make that transition, at least for a few products. One success story is a method developed by DuPont, with Genencor, to ferment corn sugar into a substance called propanediol. Using propanediol as a starting point, DuPont has created a new polymer it calls Cerenol, which it substitutes for petroleum-sourced ingredients in products like auto paints. Similarly, the biotech giant Cargill has begun manufacturing a polymer from vegetable oils that is used in polyurethane foams, which is found in beddings, furniture and car-seat headrests. Cargill says that using the polymer does more than save crude oil and reduce carbon emissions: the foam it produces has a more uniform density and load-bearing capacity. Researchers say these products are a good beginning, but that new cost-effective processes are needed before biorefineries can replace all petroleum-based chemicals. Many of the solutions, they say, could come from novel ways of harnessing biology. That’s what John Frost and Karen Draths, a husband-and-wife team of chemists, showed in the late 1990s when they engineered micro-organisms that could convert glucose into aromatic alcohols  compounds traditionally produced from a petroleum product and used to make plastics. Dr. Frost said that the research had been inspired by his fascination with microbes as a child, when his father, a dentist, described the work of patients who happened to be chemists. “I thought this was pretty cool stuff,” he said. Dr. Frost and Dr. Draths, who left their jobs as professors at Michigan State University in December 2006 to start Draths Corporation, have more recently developed a microbial process for making phloroglucinol, a chemical to replace formaldehyde, a carcinogen, in adhesive resins. The company is also commercializing a way to make nylon entirely from renewable feedstocks like starch and cellulose. “In this approach,” Dr. Frost said, “what was last growing season’s carbon dioxide is this quarter’s carbon used for the manufacture of chemicals and polymers.” To make biobased manufacturing economically appealing, researchers are also determining ways to reduce the energy costs of transforming hydrocarbon building blocks like sugars and alcohols obtained from biomass into polymers. Dr. Gross and his colleagues at Polytechnic University have been using enzymes for that goal  making, among other things, a biodegradable polyester coating. Some researchers are exploring renewable feedstocks as a source for novel materials, which could provide another economic incentive to companies to pursue biobased chemical production. Dr. George John, a chemist at the City College of New York, and others, for example, have designed a polymer gel for drug ingestion using a byproduct of the fruit industry as a starting point. By adding an enzyme to the gel, which breaks it down over a few hours, the researchers can control the release of the drug after it is swallowed. More players are expected to enter the field as rising oil prices force countries to increase production of biodiesel, providing a bigger supply of the byproduct glycerol. “It could prove to be a very valuable commodity,” said Keith Simons, a chemist who consults for the Glycerol Challenge, a project started by a group of British companies and universities. The $3.6 million-a-year effort is aimed at developing catalysts and other technologies that will use glycerol as a feedstock “for making various downstream chemicals,” Mr. Simons said. The payoffs from developing biobased chemicals could be huge and unexpected, said Dr. John Pierce, DuPont’s vice president for applied biosciences-technology. He pointed to DuPont’s synthesis of propanediol, which was pushed along by the company’s goal to use the chemical to make Sorona, a stain-resistant textile that does not lose color easily. Soon DuPont scientists realized that bioderived propanediol could also be used as an ingredient in cosmetics and products for de-icing aircraft. The high-end grades that are now used in cosmetics are less irritating than traditional molecules, Dr. Pierce said, and the industrial grade used in de-icing products is biodegradable, which makes it better than other options. “It looks like we found a bit of a gold vein,” he said. More Articles in Technology »THE next time you stop at a gas station, wincing at the $3.50-a-gallon price and bemoaning society’s dependence on petroleum, take a step back and look inside your car. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Slide Show Chemistry Aimed at Conservation Enlarge This Image Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times John Frost, left, and his wife, Karen Draths, in their company lab. More Photos » Much of what you see in there comes from petroleum, too: the plastic dashboard, the foam in the seats. More than a tenth of the world’s oil is spent not on powering engines but as a feedstock for making chemicals that enrich many goods  from cosmetics to cleaners and fabric to automobile parts. In recent years, this unsettling fact has motivated academic researchers and corporations to find ways to make bulk chemicals from renewable sources like corn and switchgrass. The effort to tap biomass for chemicals runs parallel to the higher-stakes research aimed at developing biofuels. Researchers hope that the two will come together soon to help replace petroleum refineries with biorefineries. “As petroleum prices go up and climate change becomes a serious concern, the economy will have no choice but to switch to a chemical base derived from plant materials,” said Dr. Richard Gross, director of the Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn. The chemical industry is beginning to make that transition, at least for a few products. One success story is a method developed by DuPont, with Genencor, to ferment corn sugar into a substance called propanediol. Using propanediol as a starting point, DuPont has created a new polymer it calls Cerenol, which it substitutes for petroleum-sourced ingredients in products like auto paints. Similarly, the biotech giant Cargill has begun manufacturing a polymer from vegetable oils that is used in polyurethane foams, which is found in beddings, furniture and car-seat headrests. Cargill says that using the polymer does more than save crude oil and reduce carbon emissions: the foam it produces has a more uniform density and load-bearing capacity. Researchers say these products are a good beginning, but that new cost-effective processes are needed before biorefineries can replace all petroleum-based chemicals. Many of the solutions, they say, could come from novel ways of harnessing biology. That’s what John Frost and Karen Draths, a husband-and-wife team of chemists, showed in the late 1990s when they engineered micro-organisms that could convert glucose into aromatic alcohols  compounds traditionally produced from a petroleum product and used to make plastics. Dr. Frost said that the research had been inspired by his fascination with microbes as a child, when his father, a dentist, described the work of patients who happened to be chemists. “I thought this was pretty cool stuff,” he said. Dr. Frost and Dr. Draths, who left their jobs as professors at Michigan State University in December 2006 to start Draths Corporation, have more recently developed a microbial process for making phloroglucinol, a chemical to replace formaldehyde, a carcinogen, in adhesive resins.

It was 2006, and Mr. Bronfman, the bearded scion of the Seagrams, seemed to have successfully reinvented himself as a music mogul after nearly losing his family’s fortune. It looked as if he had actually turned around Warner Music, which he had bought from Time Warner with a group of private equity firms. Warner Music had gone public, and its stock had nearly doubled. Mr. Bronfman had managed to cut $250 million in annual expenses at the company. His private equity partners had doubled their money. And EMI, the British record company, had put a bid on the table for Warner Music. Mr. Bronfman’s critics, and there are legions of them, were stunned. It was a classic comeback story  and all the more astounding because Mr. Bronfman had lost so big by selling Seagram, his family’s liquor-cum-entertainment company, to Vivendi in 2000. That deal went down as one of the worst mergers in history. And the Seagram sale wasn’t Mr. Bronfman’s first multibillion-dollar mistake. Many criticized his decision to sell the company’s $9 billion stake in DuPont to buy the entertainment giant MCA in the mid-1990s. He earned a reputation as a star-struck rich kid who made one bad deal after another. New York magazine famously called him “possibly the stupidest person in the media business.” Ouch. Now, though, this return-to-glory tale has taken a regrettable twist. Have you seen Warner Music stock’s lately? It pains me to tell you that it is trading at about $6 a share, less than half of its I.P.O. price. Richard Greenfield, a smart and entertaining analyst at Pali Research, recently wrote a note to investors with the headline, “Top 10 Reasons Not to Own Warner Music.” Mr. Bronfman, who moonlights as a songwriter (he’s written for Celine Dion and Dionne Warwick), has been castigated by investors for not grabbing the EMI bid: $28.50 a share in cash and stock. Warner Music dismissed that offer as being “not in the best interests of our shareholders.” Now, before we go any further, let me say a couple of things about Mr. Bronfman, whom I’ve known for nearly a decade. (I first met him, as fate would have it, in Paris on the day he sold Seagram.) First, his reputation is undeserved. He is a thoughtful, unpretentious, deeply engaged guy. Even his rivals are loath to call him names behind his back. They like him too much. Second, the digital onslaught is killing just about everyone in the music industry. And Mr. Bronfman has done a good job running Warner Music: the company is more profitable than it has been in years. Finally, while selling DuPont may have been a mistake, Mr. Bronfman deserves credit for merging MCA into Polygram to create Universal Music, the largest record company in the world. For a man who could have spent his life living off his trust fund, Mr. Bronfman works absurdly hard. He’s clearly feels he has something to prove. But all of that doesn’t explain how Warner Music ended up in this predicament and how Mr. Bronfman has seemingly let his shot at rehabilitating his reputation slip through his hands. As an aside, you should know that Mr. Bronfman says he doesn’t care about his public persona. “My needing redemption is really a press concept," he told BusinessWeek just after Warner Music’s I.P.O. (I don’t believe him for a second.) Mr. Bronfman declined to comment for this column. So what to make of Mr. Bronfman? That’s a tricky question. Warner Music’s stock aside, Mr. Bronfman’s deal is actually a huge success. Or at least that is the judgment of the smart money that backed him. Mr. Bronfman and his private equity partners have gotten their original investment back and are now playing with house money. They’re up some 130 percent  not bad for a company in a dying industry. (Note to Time Warner: No matter how you rationalize it, you sold the business cheap.) Public shareholders, of course, have been left holding the bag. So while the power brokers at Four Seasons  Mr. Bronfman is a part-owner of the Midtown Manhattan restaurant  may be happy for him, the investing public is hardly singing his praises. As it happens, this is not the first time that big money did well by Mr. Bronfman. Institutional investors privately praised him for selling Seagram to Vivendi at the peak of the market; they all cashed out immediately. Mr. Bronfman, ever the martyr, agreed to hold his shares to demonstrate his commitment to the deal. Unfortunately, he rode the stock down, as did so many everyday shareholders who did not know any better. His big mistake was not to accept EMI’s bid. Even here, though, the situation is more complicated than is often portrayed. While at $28.50 a share  at one point the offer was worth $31 a share  the deal seems like a no-brainer, the fact that the EMI bid was partly in stock created a lot of risk. There was a high probability that EMI’s stock might tank  and that Mr. Bronfman would find himself in the same situation as he was in with the Vivendi deal. Indeed, that is exactly what happened: EMI’s stock tanked before getting scooped up by Guy Hands, the private equity mogul, who everyone agrees wildly overpaid for it. Warner Music’s board did not help. Behind the scenes, the board is run by Scott Sperling, an aggressive silver-haired managing director at Thomas H. Lee Partners who is a board member and put the original deal together. Mr. Sperling and others convinced themselves that Warner Music was worth more and, barring a deal at a higher price, that Warner should be the one taking over EMI, not the other way around. There was a bit too much ego involved. What Mr. Bronfman should have done was to push harder for an all-cash deal, even if that meant a lower price. He should have seen the troubles in the industry and sold. He would have been a hero. There’s a book about Mr. Bronfman that was published in Canada with a title that captures him perfectly.

Enlarge This Image Michel Gangne/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images A protest in August against genetically modified crops in France. The modified corn that would be banned has been grown in America for years. The preliminary decisions are circulating within the European Commission, which has the final say. Some officials there are skeptical of a ban that would upset the powerful biotechnology industry and could exacerbate tensions with important trading partners like the United States. The seeds are not available on the European market for cultivation. In the decisions, the environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas, contends that the genetically modified corn, or maize could affect certain butterfly species, specifically the monarch, and other beneficial insects. For instance, research this year indicates that larvae of the monarch butterfly exposed to the genetically modified corn behave differently than other larvae. In the decision concerning the corn seeds produced by Dow and Pioneer, Mr. Dimas calls potential damage on the environment irreversible. In the decision on Syngentas corn, he says that the level of risk generated by the cultivation of this product for the environment is unacceptable. A decision by the European Union to bar cultivation of the genetically modified crops would be the first of its kind in the trade bloc, and would intensify the continuing battle over genetically modified corn. Since 1998, the commission has not approved any applications for the cultivation of genetically modified crops, but it has not actively rejected any applications, either, as would be the case with the genetically modified corn products. Banning the applications for corn crops also would mark a bold new step for European environmental authorities, who are already aggressively pursuing regulations on emissions from cars and aircraft, setting it at odds with the United States and angering industries. These products have been grown in the U.S. and other countries for years, said Stephen Norton, a spokesman for the United States trade representative. We are not aware of any other case when a product has been rejected after having been reviewed and determined safe by European food safety authorities, he said. In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority, a European agency based in Parma, Italy, that operates independently of the European Union, ruled that the products were unlikely to harm human and animal health or the environment. But in the draft decision, Mr. Dimas said that other studies had since come to light on the potential effects of the seeds and that further investigation was needed. Barbara Helfferich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dimas, declined to comment on the specifics of the procedure because commissioners had not yet made a final decision. But she said that the European Union was within its rights to make decisions based on the precautionary principle even when scientists had found no definitive evidence proving products can cause harm. The commission has the authority to be a risk manager when it comes to the safety and science of genetically modified crops, Ms. Helfferich said. She said that the decisions by Mr. Dimas could go before the commission within a few weeks, but she said that no date had been set. In the decisions, Mr. Dimas cited recent research showing that consumption of genetically modified corn byproducts reduced growth and increased mortality of nontarget stream insects and that these insects are important prey for aquatic and riparian predators and that this could have unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences. Although still preliminary, his decisions could drastically tilt the policy against future approvals of genetically modified crops, said Nathalie Moll, a spokeswoman for Europabio, an industry group with 80 members including Syngenta, Pioneer and Dow. The decisions would be setting a precedent for E.U. officials to reject products based on nonverified scientific data, Ms. Moll said. Europabio says that the crops grown using the genetically modified corn are already imported into several European countries, including France and Germany, where they are used to feed animals like cows and chickens. Rob Gianfranceschi, spokesman at the United States mission to the European Union in Brussels, said it was too early to comment on a decision that had not yet been formalized. But he made clear that the United States remained frustrated with European policies on genetically modified crops. The United States has consistently stated that the E.U. continues to lack a predictable, workable process for approving these products in a way that reflects scientific rather than political factors, Mr. Gianfranceschi said.

Banning the applications for corn crops also would mark a bold new step for European environmental authorities, who are already aggressively pursuing regulations on emissions from cars and aircraft, setting it at odds with the United States and angering industries. These products have been grown in the U.S. and other countries for years, said Stephen Norton, a spokesman for the United States trade representative. We are not aware of any other case when a product has been rejected after having been reviewed and determined safe by European food safety authorities, he said. In 2005, the European Food Safety Authority, a European agency based in Parma, Italy, that operates independently of the European Union, ruled that the products were unlikely to harm human and animal health or the environment. But in the draft decision, Mr. Dimas said that other studies had since come to light on the potential effects of the seeds and that further investigation was needed. Barbara Helfferich, a spokeswoman for Mr. Dimas, declined to comment on the specifics of the procedure because commissioners had not yet made a final decision. But she said that the European Union was within its rights to make decisions based on the precautionary principle even when scientists had found no definitive evidence proving products can cause harm. The commission has the authority to be a risk manager when it comes to the safety and science of genetically modified crops, Ms. Helfferich said. She said that the decisions by Mr. Dimas could go before the commission within a few weeks, but she said that no date had been set. In the decisions, Mr. Dimas cited recent research showing that consumption of genetically modified corn byproducts reduced growth and increased mortality of nontarget stream insects and that these insects are important prey for aquatic and riparian predators and that this could have unexpected ecosystem-scale consequences. Although still preliminary, his decisions could drastically tilt the policy against future approvals of genetically modified crops, said Nathalie Moll, a spokeswoman for Europabio, an industry group with 80 members including Syngenta, Pioneer and Dow. The decisions would be setting a precedent for E.U. officials to reject products based on nonverified scientific data, Ms. Moll said. Europabio says that the crops grown using the genetically modified corn are already imported into several European countries, including France and Germany, where they are used to feed animals like cows and chickens. Rob Gianfranceschi, spokesman at the United States mission to the European Union in Brussels, said it was too early to comment on a decision that had not yet been formalized. But he made clear that the United States remained frustrated with European policies on genetically modified crops. The United States has consistently stated that the E.U. continues to lack a predictable, workable process for approving these products in a way that reflects scientific rather than political factors, Mr. Gianfranceschi said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DD1639F936A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">WORLD BUSINESS BRIEFING; Approval For 4 Modified Crops<date>Published: October 25, 2007</date><text>The European Union has authorized imports of four genetically modified crop products for sale across its 27 national markets for the next 10 years, the European Commission said.

The guidelines are the most extensive effort yet to address a vexing issue surrounding the rapidly expanding field of nanotechnology: the lack of information about whether materials in such minute sizes can pose novel or unexpected hazards. Nanotechnology usually refers to materials with at least one dimension measured at 100 nanometers or less (a nanometer is one-billionth of a meter), a scale so small that the behavior of individual molecules begins to affect how the material performs. While particles of soot and other materials occur naturally on a nanoscale, businesses are now exploiting a recent explosion in the number of tools available to engineer nanoscale products. In doing so, they have shown that familiar materials sometimes have astonishing strength, flexibility, reactivity or other useful characteristics when manipulated in tiny dimensions. Hundreds of products, including stain-resistant clothing and textiles, advanced microchips and clear sunscreens already incorporate such technology. Technology skeptics have contended that some innovations are being deployed with too little attention to potential negative consequences. Scattered laboratory research programs have suggested that nanoscale particles can lodge in the brain, lungs and other organs, although the effects of that are not known. Tests also show that some may be toxic to plants and other organisms. Products are being invented much faster than toxicologists can fully test and describe all of their potential effects. For example, theres virtually no information on nanocomposites in the literature, said David B. Warheit, the leader of DuPonts basic research on nanotechnology toxicology, referring to products where nanoscale materials are embedded in plastics and other polymers to improve their performance. Mr. Warheit said he had no reason to expect that the new polymers posed hazards because of the nanotechnology, in part because, in materials that DuPont tested, even incineration did not create nanoscale polymer particles that could be inhaled. But thats just a hypothesis, he said. DuPont and Environmental Defense, which was supported financially in part by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, began working on the guidelines in September 2005. The 87-page document includes three examples of how DuPont applied the framework. One is a case study of titanium dioxide particles that DuPont is about to blend into plastics to protect them against ultraviolet light; another looks at how the company handles carbon nanotubes that it is researching but has not put into any products. A third is a study of nanoscale iron compounds that have been promoted as a novel way of cleaning up polluted water supplies. According to DuPont, the compounds have so many unknown risks that the company will not use them. The frameworks creators and many other nanotechnology experts said the processes outlined might be too complicated and expensive for some small companies and start-ups. Some environmental and labor groups that turned down efforts to help develop the framework see more fundamental flaws. Its voluntary and we think it will only delay whats really needed, government regulation and a wider debate, said Hope Shand, research director for the ETC Group, which has called for a moratorium on the commercialization of nanotechnology.

Shares of Dow had spiked on a number of occasions in the months before the dismissals on speculation about a deal, stoked by news reports that a buyout was in the works and possibly by leaks about talks the former executives were accused of holding. But the inquiry, still in the informal stage, may also look at a deal that the company actually pursued. Last fall, Dow made an overture to acquire DuPont in a deal worth more than $40 billion, according to people involved in the talks. If the approach had ultimately led to a deal, it would have combined the largest and third-largest chemical companies in the United States. ExxonMobil is No. 2. Shares of Dow and DuPont traded somewhat erratically at the time, though neither company disclosed the approach. From September to December, shares of DuPont climbed 15 percent. DuPont rebuffed Dows advances and never engaged in negotiations, these people said. Dows chief executive, Andrew N. Liveris, sits on the board of Citigroup with Alain J. P. Belda, the chief executive of Alcoa, who at the time of the overture was also a director of DuPont; Mr. Belda stepped down from DuPonts board in March. Dow declined to comment. A DuPont spokeswoman did not return a call last night seeking comment. In recent months, Mr. Liveris has denied that the company has held buyout talks. Dow said that all of the speculation about a deal was the result of two senior officials, Romeo Kreinberg and J. Pedro Reinhard, who, the company contended, held multiple meetings in multiple months in multiple locations, and with a number of different parties about such a takeover. JPMorgan Chase, one of Dows longtime banks, had been working on an unauthorized takeover proposal of Dow and had talked to the two men at least once. Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard have denied being involved in a plot to take over the company and have sued Dow, contending that they were defamed. The S.E.C. has sought information from Dow, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard, people briefed on the inquiry said. It is unclear whether the S.E.C. plans to pursue civil actions against either Mr. Kreinberg or Mr. Reinhard. Nor is it clear whether the S.E.C. has identified any investors that may have improperly traded on information related to the possibility of a buyout of Dow. The S.E.C. is also seeking other information from JPMorgan Chase about the work the bank had done on the takeover proposal and the people and companies it had held discussions with, these people said. According to Dows lawsuit against the two men, JPMorgan Chase, which in the suit is referred to only as a major international financial institution, had been working for a client in the Middle East. JPMorgan had also reached out to several of the largest private equity firms in the nation to inquire about their interest in a buyout of Dow, people briefed on the matter said. Spokesmen for Dow, JPMorgan, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard all declined to comment on the inquiry. A spokesman for the S.E.C. also declined to comment. The inquiries, and the dueling lawsuits between the company and the two men, are likely to turn on information provided by JPMorgan and its chief executive, James Dimon. Mr. Dimon had told Mr. Liveris that his firm was involved with Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard on a buyout of the company, according to Dows suit. The conversation between Mr. Dimon and Mr. Liveris was the basis for the firings of the men, Dow said. Still, other people and documents have suggested that Mr. Liveris had been seeking to oust Mr. Kreinberg before his dismissal and had several skirmishes with Mr. Reinhard. Both men had once been considered potential chief executives of Dow.

Pedro Reinhard, who, the company contended, held multiple meetings in multiple months in multiple locations, and with a number of different parties about such a takeover. JPMorgan Chase, one of Dows longtime banks, had been working on an unauthorized takeover proposal of Dow and had talked to the two men at least once. Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard have denied being involved in a plot to take over the company and have sued Dow, contending that they were defamed. The S.E.C. has sought information from Dow, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard, people briefed on the inquiry said. It is unclear whether the S.E.C. plans to pursue civil actions against either Mr. Kreinberg or Mr. Reinhard. Nor is it clear whether the S.E.C. has identified any investors that may have improperly traded on information related to the possibility of a buyout of Dow. The S.E.C. is also seeking other information from JPMorgan Chase about the work the bank had done on the takeover proposal and the people and companies it had held discussions with, these people said. According to Dows lawsuit against the two men, JPMorgan Chase, which in the suit is referred to only as a major international financial institution, had been working for a client in the Middle East. JPMorgan had also reached out to several of the largest private equity firms in the nation to inquire about their interest in a buyout of Dow, people briefed on the matter said. Spokesmen for Dow, JPMorgan, Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard all declined to comment on the inquiry. A spokesman for the S.E.C. also declined to comment. The inquiries, and the dueling lawsuits between the company and the two men, are likely to turn on information provided by JPMorgan and its chief executive, James Dimon. Mr. Dimon had told Mr. Liveris that his firm was involved with Mr. Kreinberg and Mr. Reinhard on a buyout of the company, according to Dows suit. The conversation between Mr. Dimon and Mr. Liveris was the basis for the firings of the men, Dow said. Still, other people and documents have suggested that Mr. Liveris had been seeking to oust Mr. Kreinberg before his dismissal and had several skirmishes with Mr. Reinhard. Both men had once been considered potential chief executives of Dow.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EEDE173FF935A15752C0A9619C8B63&amp;ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Corrections<date>Published: January 26, 2007</date><text>A chart in Business Day last Friday about recommendations by industry and environmental groups on how to limit greenhouse emission misstated a goal of the coalition.

Wednesday morning, he got up close and personal with it, poking his head through stalks of corn and wheat while scientists for DuPont gave him a crash course in ethanol production in a tour of their research greenhouse here. The presidential visit to the DuPont Experimental Station, which conducts federally financed research into the development of alternative fuels, amounted to a sales pitch for Mr. Bush’s plan to reduce projected gasoline consumption by 20 percent over the next 10 years. After hearing a minilecture on how plants are converted into sugars, and the sugars then distilled into fuel, Mr. Bush, a former Texas oilman who has proclaimed Americans “addicted to oil,” lifted up a glass beaker of switchgrass, a perennial grass that looks like hay, and stared into a bank of television cameras to drive his point home. “What our citizens need to know,” Mr. Bush said, with a microbiologist, Armando Byrne, by his side, “is that because of the research you’re doing here, with some of their taxpayer dollars, that switchgrass, that can be grown all across America, can end up being made into fuel that powers their automobiles.” Mr. Byrne nodded in agreement. “That’s important,” the president declared. Later, in a speech to DuPont employees, Mr. Bush said he had ordered the federal government to buy more hybrid vehicles that use ethanol or alternative fuels, and to buy hybrid plug-in cars “as soon as they hit the market.” Most federal agencies already have alternative-fuel vehicles. Of the more than 586,000 vehicles in the federal fleet, 866 are hybrids and 106,869 are alternative-fuel vehicles, White House officials said. “We set the goal,” Mr. Bush told the DuPont employees. “It doesn’t make much sense for the federal government to set the goal and not participate.” The trip itself, however, was hardly energy efficient. Mr. Bush made the short jaunt to Wilmington aboard Air Force One, spending a mere 30 minutes in the air on the way up and 20 minutes on the way back. On the ground, he traveled in the usual motorcade of about two dozen vehicles, including sport utility vehicles carrying gun-toting Secret Service agents, and vans carrying camera-toting members of the press. There was nary a hybrid among them.

The frothy mergers-and-acquisition market bubbled along, with bids, battles and, well, one bomb. TOUCH AND GO The American economy seems to have made a so-called soft landing after the housing market peaked last year, and appears to be taking off again, the latest economic data suggested. A tight labor market is pushing up many workers wages, consumers are spending more at shopping malls and the skid in the housing market is easing in some areas of the country. A survey of industrial production showed unexpected growth last month, and the Consumer Price Index, the nations best-known inflation gauge, rose at its fastest pace in eight months  on the surface, at least, an indication of robust demand. The numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when it meets at the end of this month, and may actually have to raise rates later in the year. ROLLING BACK BREAKS House Democrats passed legislation to rescind $14 billion in tax breaks and subsidies for domestic oil producers and use the money for alternative energy and conservation technologies. The bill would rescind $7.6 billion in tax breaks for oil companies that Congress passed in 2004 and 2005 and add $6.3 billion in royalties from companies that pump oil and gas in publicly owned waters of the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska. It would also correct errors in drilling leases signed by the Interior Department in the late 1990s that will let oil companies avoid paying billions of dollars in royalties over the next decade. Senate leaders say they have the votes to send the bill to President Bush. The president opposes the measure, but is not expected to veto it. STRANGE BEDFELLOWS General Electric, DuPont, Alcoa and seven other major companies joined with leading environmental groups to call for a firm nationwide limit on carbon dioxide emissions that would lead to reductions of 10 to 30 percent over the next 15 years. Members of the group  which also includes the utilities Duke Energy in North Carolina, PG&amp;E in California, the FPL Group in Florida and PNM Resources in New Mexico  have expressed concern that the absence of a national policy could lead to a scattershot system of state-by-state regulation or to even harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels. Earlier, a coalition of 16 business, medical and consumer groups  including AARP, the American Medical Association, Pfizer and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States  proposed to extend health coverage to people now uninsured by expanding federal benefit programs and offering new tax credits to individuals and families. The environmental groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, a day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address. BURST OF BUYING General Electric announced a pair of big acquisitions, agreeing to pay $8.13 billion for two Abbott Laboratories diagnostics units and $4.8 billion for Smiths Aerospace, an aviation electronics maker in London. Including its offer earlier in the month to buy Vetco Gray, an oil and gas drilling services company in Houston, G.E. has committed itself to almost $15 billion worth of takeovers in January alone. The New York Times reported on Jan. 9 that G.E. was in talks to sell its plastics unit, a slow-growing business that could nonetheless sell for as much as $10 billion. Additional deals may have to wait for a decision on the plastics business because G.E.s chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said last month that G.E. had $7 billion in cash on hand for industrial acquisitions this year. JUST SAY NO In a rare example of a board denying a request by a controlling shareholder, the directors of Cablevision Systems rejected an $8.9 billion buyout offer from its founding family, the Dolans. The board said in a letter to the family that the offer does not represent fair value for the companys public shareholders nor does it contemplate a transaction that is in their best interest. Cablevision remains publicly owned, but the Dolans, who own 20 percent of its equity but control 70 percent of its votes, have said they will not sell the company to anyone besides themselves. TRIBUNE BIDS Two firm bidders stepped up with offers to buy the Tribune Company, a media company with television stations and newspapers in the nations biggest media markets, but neither offered much of a premium over the companys flagging stock price. One bid came from Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, two billionaires in Los Angeles, where the Tribune Company owns The Los Angeles Times and KTTV. The other came from the Chandler family, which sold the Los Angeles paper and several others to Tribune in 2000. A private equity firm, the Carlyle Group, offered to buy only the TV stations. Tribune directors will review the situation this weekend and may ask for new bids. RAISING THE STAKES Express Scripts began a $24.8 billion hostile takeover attempt for a rival pharmacy benefits manager, Caremark Rx, prompting a competing bidder, the CVS Corporation, to raise its offer. Caremark rebuffed Express Scripts in favor of CVSs lower offer. Some shareholders sued Caremarks board, saying the directors put their financial interests ahead of shareholder interests. CVS, the drugstore chain, said it intended to conclude the takeover by April. STIFF SENTENCE A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., sentenced Walter A.

Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic A New Alliance in the Climate Debate Related The Pew Center on Global Climate Change World Resources Institute Environmental Defense Natural Resources Defense Council Introduction of this group, which includes industry giants like General Electric, DuPont and Alcoa, is aimed at adding to the recent impetus for Congressional action on emissions controls and the creation of a market in which allowances to emit carbon dioxide could be traded in a way that achieves the greatest reduction at the lowest cost. The diversity of the coalition  some members had already come out for other forms of emissions control, like a carbon tax or voluntary controls, but others had been silent on climate-change issues until now  could send a strong signal that businesses want to get ahead of the increasing political momentum for federal emissions controls, in part to ensure that their long-term interests are protected. Many energy producers and manufacturers have expressed concern that various state efforts, if not coordinated, could lead to a scattershot system of regulation. Others worry that harsher measures, like a stiff tax on fossil fuels, the biggest contributor to global-warming gases, could be imposed if they do not reach a consensus on a legislative approach. The groups formal announcement is scheduled for Monday, the day before President Bush is to deliver his State of the Union address and offer the administrations newest basket of proposals to promote energy security and combat global warming. Aside from General Electric and Alcoa, Caterpillar is the leading manufacturing company among the group, which also includes four utilities  Duke Energy, based in North Carolina; PG&amp;E of California; the FPL Group of Florida; and PNM Resources of New Mexico. The group counts the multinational oil company BP and Lehman Brothers as members as well. Jonathan Lash, the president of the World Resources Institute, said Thursday that this signals that the differences in the interests between these sectors and within these sectors can be resolved. Peter A. Darbee, chief executive of PG&amp;E, said, My hope and expectation is that Congress, the White House and the public will look at these chief executives and note that companies with a motive to oppose emissions controls are nonetheless saying, Heres a serious problem; it needs to be dealt with, and it needs to be dealt with now. The negotiations, conducted primarily by the chief executives of the companies, did not produce a model piece of legislation, but rather a detailed set of principles that they suggest as a guide to any legislation. In the Senate, there are already four Democratic proposals for limiting carbon emissions and creating a market-based system, under which the government gives or sells permits to businesses, allowing them a certain level of emissions. Once established, such a system would allow better-performing companies to sell or trade unneeded credits, and all companies involved would be able to determine whether it would be more efficient for them to clean up their own emissions or buy credits from others. The groups principles include recommending a range of emissions levels  from 100 to 105 percent of current levels within five years, then down to 90 to 100 percent of current levels in 10 years, and 70 to 90 percent of current levels in 15 years. In addition, the chief executives agreed after some discussion, to strongly discourage further construction of stationary sources that cannot easily capture carbon dioxide. This comes close to a rejection of almost all new coal-fired power plants on the drawing boards, including the 11 plants recently proposed by TXU, a Texas utility. The technology that would isolate carbon dioxide emissions and bury them is still in the earliest phases of development, so this near-repudiation of existing coal technology would have a disproportionate impact on utilities that depend largely on coal, like TXU and the Southern Company. But Jeff Sterba, the chief executive of PNM Resources, whose company gets about two-thirds of its power from coal and is a member of the coalition, explained why he supports such an approach. The most important thing for us is to have a viable, diverse portfolio of resources, and coal has got to be part of that mix, he said. Today, the biggest problem coal has is uncertainty about carbon. The group, called the United States Climate Action Partnership, had its origin in conversations last spring among Mr. Lash; Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense; and Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Lash had worked with Mr. Immelt on the rollout of GEs Ecomagination program in 2005  which combined pledges of emissions reductions with a new emphasis on energy-efficient and climate-friendly technologies. Mr. Sterba and the leaders of the other environmental groups, which also includes Frances Beinecke of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Eileen Claussen of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that an efficient, flexible cap-and-trade system would stimulate the development of new technologies to cut energy use and provide renewable energy. General Electric claims significant advances in these areas already. According to Peter OToole, a company spokesman, Revenues from the sale of energy-efficient and environmentally advanced products and services hit $10 billion in 2005, up from $6.2 billion in 2004. The chief executives in the group met for the first time in July. During the meeting, Mr. Krupp said, it became clear that cap-and-trade is an element of the deal that is good for everybody. Its good for the environmental community, he said, because a hard cap guarantees the integrity of the environment and industry likes it because its so efficient. Timing also played a role in the executives thinking. As Mr. Darbee said, We have the opportunity to construct something more pragmatic and realistic while President Bush is in office. A future political climate, after 2008, he said, might produce solutions less sensitive to the needs of business. Correction: January 26, 2007 A chart in Business Day last Friday about recommendations by industry and environmental groups on how to limit greenhouse emission misstated a goal of the coalition. The group wants to cut greenhouse emissions to 20 to 40 percent of current levels by 2050, not 60 to 80 percent of current levels.

In addition, the chief executives agreed after some discussion, to strongly discourage further construction of stationary sources that cannot easily capture carbon dioxide. This comes close to a rejection of almost all new coal-fired power plants on the drawing boards, including the 11 plants recently proposed by TXU, a Texas utility. The technology that would isolate carbon dioxide emissions and bury them is still in the earliest phases of development, so this near-repudiation of existing coal technology would have a disproportionate impact on utilities that depend largely on coal, like TXU and the Southern Company. But Jeff Sterba, the chief executive of PNM Resources, whose company gets about two-thirds of its power from coal and is a member of the coalition, explained why he supports such an approach. The most important thing for us is to have a viable, diverse portfolio of resources, and coal has got to be part of that mix, he said. Today, the biggest problem coal has is uncertainty about carbon. The group, called the United States Climate Action Partnership, had its origin in conversations last spring among Mr. Lash; Fred Krupp, the president of Environmental Defense; and Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Lash had worked with Mr. Immelt on the rollout of GEs Ecomagination program in 2005  which combined pledges of emissions reductions with a new emphasis on energy-efficient and climate-friendly technologies. Mr. Sterba and the leaders of the other environmental groups, which also includes Frances Beinecke of the Natural Resources Defense Council and Eileen Claussen of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said that an efficient, flexible cap-and-trade system would stimulate the development of new technologies to cut energy use and provide renewable energy. General Electric claims significant advances in these areas already. According to Peter OToole, a company spokesman, Revenues from the sale of energy-efficient and environmentally advanced products and services hit $10 billion in 2005, up from $6.2 billion in 2004. The chief executives in the group met for the first time in July. During the meeting, Mr. Krupp said, it became clear that cap-and-trade is an element of the deal that is good for everybody. Its good for the environmental community, he said, because a hard cap guarantees the integrity of the environment and industry likes it because its so efficient. Timing also played a role in the executives thinking. As Mr. Darbee said, We have the opportunity to construct something more pragmatic and realistic while President Bush is in office. A future political climate, after 2008, he said, might produce solutions less sensitive to the needs of business. Correction: January 26, 2007 A chart in Business Day last Friday about recommendations by industry and environmental groups on how to limit greenhouse emission misstated a goal of the coalition. The group wants to cut greenhouse emissions to 20 to 40 percent of current levels by 2050, not 60 to 80 percent of current levels.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/12/business/12dupont.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont to Reduce Pesticide Output and Cut 1,500 Jobs<date>Published: December 12, 2006</date><text>The DuPont Company will eliminate 1,500 agriculture jobs and cut output of herbicides and pesticides in a plan to increase spending on genetically modified seeds, the company said yesterday. The revamping will reduce fourth-quarter profit by $200 million, and an estimated $100 million in annual savings will be spent on faster development of seeds, the company said. DuPont is tying to stop the Monsanto Company from gaining a larger share of the nation’s corn-seed sales for the sixth consecutive year.

The company eliminated 1,500 auto-paint jobs in March and has a year-old goal to reduce fixed costs by $1 billion. “This says to me that the goal they set for 2007 of $400 million in cost reduction is achievable,” said an HSBC Securities analyst, Hassan Ahmed. The company raised its 2006 net income forecast to $3.25 a share, from $2.86. The revised estimate includes a number of one-time items, the largest being a $500 million gain from a tax benefit related to the repatriation of overseas earnings. Excluding those items, profit will be $2.85 a share, the same as previously forecast, a spokesman, Anthony Farina, said. Production at 10 sites that make herbicides and pesticides, or are part of Solae, a venture with Bunge, will be reduced, a spokesman, Doyle Karr, said.

Every once in a while when I reach up to grab a frying pan and my hand touches the nonstick one, I hesitate. Is Teflon coating bad? Should I not use it? These thoughts go through my mind, and then I usually just take down the pan that is closest to the size I need. Concerns about Teflon Teflon is a patented product of DuPont, but most people use the term generically to refer to nonstick pans  have been floating around for years. The coating was discovered in 1938 and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for cookware in 1960. It stirred a minirevolution in the American kitchen, according to a 1990 article in F.D.A. Consumer magazine. Nonstick pans allow cooking with less or no fat and make cleanup easier and faster. The article asked the question in its headline, Is That Newfangled Cookware Safe? The answer, the author decided, was yes. But that did not put the matter to rest  far from it. Concerns about the safety of Teflon-coated pots and pans popped up repeatedly over the next decade and a half. Just last year, lawyers for consumers in numerous states, including New York, filed separate class-action lawsuits based on state consumer laws on behalf of millions of Teflon cookware users. The lawsuits have been consolidated into one class action, which is now pending in Federal District Court in Des Moines. All of this is weighing on consumers like Penny Resnick, a dentist from New Rochelle, N.Y., who was examining cookware at a local Home Goods store recently. She said she threw away her Teflon frying pans a few years ago, after hearing about the possible dangers on a talk radio show. I still use it for baking, she said, holding a square pan with a nonstick coating. Maybe I shouldnt. Maybe you could say, why am I using one and not the other? It was the flaking on the frying pans that bothered her, she said. I cook a lot, she said. I found the coating peeled even with expensive pans. She said another plus was that she found that food cooks better in the no-Teflon skillets. One issue that can be confusing is the potential environmental and health dangers posed by chemicals used in manufacturing versus the risk possibly created when Teflon cookware is heated and fumes might be emitted. Of particular concern is perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA, also known as C-8, which is a crucial ingredient in the making of Teflon. In 2004, DuPont agreed to pay more than $100 million to settle another class-action lawsuit brought by Ohio and West Virginia residents who contended that releases of PFOA from a plant in West Virginia contaminated supplies of drinking water. A similar lawsuit was filed this year on behalf of additional West Virginia residents who were not included in the original lawsuit, but whose drinking water was later found to be contaminated. This year, DuPont, seven other manufacturers and the Environmental Protection Agency announced a voluntary program to virtually eliminate the release of PFOA into the environment by 2015. The class-action lawsuit filed last year focused not on the manufacturing process but on the cookware itself; the lawsuit does not claim personal injuries, but said that for decades DuPont failed to warn consumers of hazards from using its nonstick cookware. The suit contended that the pots and pans, when heated to very high temperatures, release toxic particles, including PFOA. The goal is to have DuPont stop making and selling Teflon cookware. In a news release, DuPont said the allegations were without merit, noting that the Food and Drug Administration had said the cookware was acceptable for conventional kitchen use. And that goes back to my internal monologue: Should I toss the Teflon pans or keep using them? What kind of risk am I exposing myself and my family to, aside from my own cooking? Some say none; some say the jury is still out. DuPont argues on its Web site (www2.dupont.com) that the PFOA is burned off in the manufacturing process of the Teflon coating and not present in the finished cookware. DuPont and the Cookware Manufacturers Association, a trade organization, maintain that Teflon is completely safe and actually helps people by lowering the amount of oil needed for cooking and reducing the risk of fire because there is less fat that might burst into flames. The Environmental Protection Agency says on its Web site (www.epa.gov/oppt/pfoa/) that routine use of nonstick cookware does not pose a concern and there is no reason for consumers to stop using it. That means do not leave a Teflon pan burning empty over high heat  a pretty sensible instruction for a number of reasons. But the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (www.ewg.org) says research has shown that Teflon cookware can harm birds and cause flu-like symptoms in humans by emitting toxic fumes when heated at high temperatures. Unfortunately, there is more that we dont know than we do, said Lauren Sucher, a spokeswoman for the environmental group. PFOA is found at a very low level in the blood of most Americans, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, and studies have shown it can cause health problems in laboratory animals. But the agency does not know exactly how people are being exposed to the chemical, nor how dangerous it is in the human body. Ms. Sucher said her organization recommended avoiding nonstick cookware. After all, she said, the old-fashioned kind was good enough for our grandmothers. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: shortcuts@nytimes.com More Articles in Business »HANGING from the pot rack in our kitchen are a variety of skillets and pans, some with nonstick coatings and some the kind you really have to scrub to get clean.

Last year, DuPont reached a $16.5 million settlement with the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to report information about the hazards associated with a substance used in making Teflon.

Last year, BusinessWeek named it No. 1 on its list of the Top Green Companies (businessweek.com) and the company has twice won the National Medal of Technology  most recently in 2002, for creating technologies that replaced the chlorofluorocarbons that had gotten it into trouble three decades before (technology.gov/medal). DuPonts 2015 Sustainability Goals (introduced via a Webcast linked at gristmill.grist.org) include plans to derive $6 billion or more in new revenue from products that create energy efficiency or reduce harmful emissions, as well as those made from nondepletable resources.

Whispers of Mergers Set Off Suspicious Trading 3. A Big Star May Not a Profitable Movie Make 4. Lockheed Wins Job of Building Next Spaceship 5. Bargains Are Near; Just Keep Waiting Corporate news was scarce during the last week before Labor Day, which symbolically draws summer to a close. At least good corporate news was scarce. There were several developments in criminal court. GLUM AND GLUMMER Consumer confidence plummeted last month amid slowing job growth, the weak housing market and stubbornly high energy costs. In its steepest one-month drop since Hurricane Katrina a year ago, the Conference Boards consumer confidence index fell to 99.6 in August, its lowest level since November. At the same time, three opinion polls found deep pessimism among American workers, with most saying that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, that they had less job security and more on-the-job stress and that they were worse off in many ways than a generation ago. The Labor Department issued a report saying that hourly wages are 1.9 percent higher than in 2000, taking inflation into account. Over the last two years, however, wages have failed to keep up with inflation for most workers. Using a different measure, the Census Bureau said the median household income rose slightly faster than inflation last year for the first time in six years. But it said the rise occurred because more family members were taking jobs to make ends meet and some people made more from investing. The bureau, part of the Commerce Department, confirmed that wages had fallen. Consumer pessimism suggests there will be a significant drop in consumer credit statistics that the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release on Friday. PENSION CUT DuPont, the giant chemical company, said it would reduce its contribution to workers pensions by two-thirds after 2007, becoming the first big company to cut its retirement benefit since Congress passed a law its sponsors said would make pensions safer. To partly compensate for current employees smaller pensions, DuPont said it would contribute 3 percent of each employees pay to a 401(k) plan beginning in 2008 and would match its employees own retirement savings up to 6 percent of their annual wage. Kenneth W. Porter, DuPonts director for global benefits, told The Wall Street Journal that the 401(k) plans would not fully replace the pension benefits, but that workers could come out ahead if their investment returns were exceptional. New workers will receive no pension, only help with 401(k) savings. Existing pensioners and employees abroad will not be affected. MUTUAL FUND SCANDAL In the first admission of criminal acts in the mutual fund market-timing scandal, Prudential Financial agreed to pay $600 million to settle charges with federal and state regulators that one of its units engaged in more than $2.5 billion worth of inappropriate trades. The payment is the second largest levied against a financial institution over the practice, which involves rapid-fire trading of mutual fund shares to capture price inefficiencies. The practice can hurt small shareholders by inflating administrative costs and disrupting investment portfolios. Prudentials admission is likely to end the investigation, which began in 2003 and resulted in $4 billion in fines and penalties against some big Wall Street firms, including $675 million from Bank of America in 2004 and $600 million from AllianceBernstein in 2003. CRIMINAL SELLING Schering-Plough, which makes Dr. Scholls foot products and Coppertone tanning lotions as well as prescription drugs, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge stemming from a federal inquiry into whether it had advocated using drugs for unapproved uses and had overcharged Medicaid. In addition to pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy, the company agreed to pay $435 million: $255 million in civil penalties and a criminal fine of $180 million. Two years ago, Schering-Plough agreed to pay $346 million to settle charges that it paid a kickback to a health insurer to protect the market for its allergy drug Claritin. The latest agreement is subject to the approval of a federal court in Boston. BIG PROBLEMS BP, the largest oil and natural gas producer in America, said federal investigators were looking into whether its traders had manipulated part of the crude oil market in 2003 and 2004 and the market for gasoline trading in 2002. Federal investigators had already started investigating whether the companys traders manipulated the market for propane. And a judge in Texas has ordered BPs chief executive, Lord Browne, to be available for questioning about an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas. Fifteen employees and contractors died in the blast last year. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will question BP executives next week about a large oil spill from the Alaska pipeline that BP operates. SALE OF THE CENTURY In what would be the most expensive American real estate transaction of modern times, Metropolitan Life said it wanted to sell Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a collection of 110 apartment buildings with 11,000 units spread over 80 acres in Manhattan.

Bargains Are Near; Just Keep Waiting Corporate news was scarce during the last week before Labor Day, which symbolically draws summer to a close. At least good corporate news was scarce. There were several developments in criminal court. GLUM AND GLUMMER Consumer confidence plummeted last month amid slowing job growth, the weak housing market and stubbornly high energy costs. In its steepest one-month drop since Hurricane Katrina a year ago, the Conference Boards consumer confidence index fell to 99.6 in August, its lowest level since November. At the same time, three opinion polls found deep pessimism among American workers, with most saying that their wages were not keeping pace with inflation, that they had less job security and more on-the-job stress and that they were worse off in many ways than a generation ago. The Labor Department issued a report saying that hourly wages are 1.9 percent higher than in 2000, taking inflation into account. Over the last two years, however, wages have failed to keep up with inflation for most workers. Using a different measure, the Census Bureau said the median household income rose slightly faster than inflation last year for the first time in six years. But it said the rise occurred because more family members were taking jobs to make ends meet and some people made more from investing. The bureau, part of the Commerce Department, confirmed that wages had fallen. Consumer pessimism suggests there will be a significant drop in consumer credit statistics that the Federal Reserve is scheduled to release on Friday. PENSION CUT DuPont, the giant chemical company, said it would reduce its contribution to workers pensions by two-thirds after 2007, becoming the first big company to cut its retirement benefit since Congress passed a law its sponsors said would make pensions safer. To partly compensate for current employees smaller pensions, DuPont said it would contribute 3 percent of each employees pay to a 401(k) plan beginning in 2008 and would match its employees own retirement savings up to 6 percent of their annual wage. Kenneth W. Porter, DuPonts director for global benefits, told The Wall Street Journal that the 401(k) plans would not fully replace the pension benefits, but that workers could come out ahead if their investment returns were exceptional. New workers will receive no pension, only help with 401(k) savings. Existing pensioners and employees abroad will not be affected. MUTUAL FUND SCANDAL In the first admission of criminal acts in the mutual fund market-timing scandal, Prudential Financial agreed to pay $600 million to settle charges with federal and state regulators that one of its units engaged in more than $2.5 billion worth of inappropriate trades. The payment is the second largest levied against a financial institution over the practice, which involves rapid-fire trading of mutual fund shares to capture price inefficiencies. The practice can hurt small shareholders by inflating administrative costs and disrupting investment portfolios. Prudentials admission is likely to end the investigation, which began in 2003 and resulted in $4 billion in fines and penalties against some big Wall Street firms, including $675 million from Bank of America in 2004 and $600 million from AllianceBernstein in 2003. CRIMINAL SELLING Schering-Plough, which makes Dr. Scholls foot products and Coppertone tanning lotions as well as prescription drugs, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge stemming from a federal inquiry into whether it had advocated using drugs for unapproved uses and had overcharged Medicaid. In addition to pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy, the company agreed to pay $435 million: $255 million in civil penalties and a criminal fine of $180 million. Two years ago, Schering-Plough agreed to pay $346 million to settle charges that it paid a kickback to a health insurer to protect the market for its allergy drug Claritin. The latest agreement is subject to the approval of a federal court in Boston. BIG PROBLEMS BP, the largest oil and natural gas producer in America, said federal investigators were looking into whether its traders had manipulated part of the crude oil market in 2003 and 2004 and the market for gasoline trading in 2002. Federal investigators had already started investigating whether the companys traders manipulated the market for propane. And a judge in Texas has ordered BPs chief executive, Lord Browne, to be available for questioning about an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas. Fifteen employees and contractors died in the blast last year. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will question BP executives next week about a large oil spill from the Alaska pipeline that BP operates. SALE OF THE CENTURY In what would be the most expensive American real estate transaction of modern times, Metropolitan Life said it wanted to sell Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, a collection of 110 apartment buildings with 11,000 units spread over 80 acres in Manhattan. Analysts said the property, which MetLife built during and after World War II to provide middle-class housing for veterans and their families, could fetch $5 billion, or almost $450,000 for each apartment. They also said the price would probably force a buyer to raise rents significantly as quickly as possible.

DuPont, the chemical company, decided that the week before Labor Day was the perfect time to announce that future workers — those who start in 2007 or after — would not get pensions, and that current ones would accrue benefits at just a third of the old rate. Those new workers, when they retire, will also get no help from the company in paying for health insurance, something current employees have come to expect. The company said it would offer a better defined-contribution plan, but that plan would go to all workers — to the baby boomers still eligible for the old pensions and to the younger workers deprived of them. DuPont is far from unique. Many companies have cut back their pension systems, and more are likely to follow, now that Congress has tightened the pension funding rules. What was jarring about the DuPont announcement was not that it happened, or that the company said the changes would improve profits. It was the claim that employees should be happy about it. “The planned changes reinforce our commitment to help employees provide for a secure retirement,” said James C. Borel, a DuPont senior vice president. “They also modernize the design of our savings and retirement plans for a new generation of employees, many of whom want more direct control and portability in their benefits.” If those new employees are really enthusiastic about a program that DuPont estimates will save it — and take away from employees — around $46 million a year, after taxes, then the state of economic education in this country is worse than you may have thought. What is really going on is a continuation of a trend that began a quarter-century ago. The risks to companies of pension promises had become obvious in the 1970’s, when the stock market went nowhere. Federal legislation had made it harder for companies to walk away from such promises and accounting rules were about to force somewhat better disclosures. The growth of defined-contribution plans happened to coincide with a prolonged bull market from 1982 to 2000 that obscured the risks of investing. Now those risks are clearer, and more companies want to avoid the risks in the future. DuPont deserves credit for changing executive pensions in the same way it is changing those for lower-level workers. Some other companies have not done that. But rules for bosses can be flexible. Consider the case of Gary M. Pfeiffer. He stepped down from his post as DuPont’s chief financial officer earlier this year, at the age of 56, and will retire in December, having earned an annual pension of more than $500,000. You might think that was enough for a man who saw DuPont’s stock lose about a third of its value in the nine years he served as C.F.O. But DuPont’s board did not. Just a few weeks before directors voted to reduce retirement benefits for employees, they decided to give $2 million to Mr. Pfeiffer “in addition to the payments and benefits to which he is otherwise entitled as a retiree.” Why? A DuPont spokeswoman said this was “a typical arrangement in the industry,” unrelated to pension policy. Mr. Pfeiffer and the company signed “a mutual nondisparagement clause,” which makes it sound like the $2 million was to get him to go quietly. You can assume that lesser workers forced out of their jobs are treated a bit less kindly. Employees may do very well in the new system, of course, if they choose to contribute to the retirement plan and if their investments do well. If not, it is their problem. One can envision a situation where companies will need to save money to keep paying the pensions they promised the baby boomers. That will require sacrifices by workers who are not in line to get such pensions when they retire. They may recall that the people in charge when those decisions were made were baby boomers. (For the record, I am also from that generation.) This is part of an international trend. European countries have made mild cuts in government-paid retirement benefits, but fears that there will be more cuts have helped to restrain consumer spending. Something similar could happen here. Companies that force their employees to take the risks could yet find that those employees are less willing to spend money on the employers’ products. Could that lead to a sales decline that, in turn, makes poor investment performance more likely? If so, it is not the baby boomers who will suffer, only those who come after.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/29/business/29dupont.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont to Cut Contributions to Pensions<date>Published: August 29, 2006</date><text>By Reuters The DuPont Company said yesterday that it would cut its contribution to workers’ pensions by two-thirds after 2007, part of a growing move by American companies away from traditional defined-benefit plans.

Skip to next paragraph Tim Shaffer for The New York Times Brittany Campbell John has cherry cabinets, an upgrade, in her new town house. Tim Shaffer for The New York Times At the Robino-Corrozi design center in Dover, Del., Karin Holston, talks with Bonnie Embry, the lead design consultant. FOR Brittany Campbell John, the high point of buying her first home, a new town house, was the day she had to make dozens of choices involving the fixtures and finishes that would go into it. Instead of poring over carpet and tile samples in the garage of a model home, Ms. John, 27, spent several hours alone with the builder's representative in a private showroom that resembles a high-end retail store. Located in a strip shopping center near the Dover Air Force Base, the six-month-old Robino-Corrozi design center employs all the unconscious triggers that say Home Sweet Home. A brick-faced hearth burns in the model kitchen. In the bathroom, the walls are finished with wainscoting reminiscent of grandma's old Victorian. "They had a whole room of wood floors and tiles; it just helps you see all the possibilities," said Ms. John, who with her husband, Gregory, 29, added $8,800 in upgrades to their $143,500 town house in a subdivision built by the Frank Robino Companies of Wilmington, Del. The Johns will pay for those improvements, including an upgrade to the kitchen cabinets, through their mortgage. "We didn't want to go overboard, but we still got to splurge," said Ms. John, who is a social worker. As the housing market softens, stand-alone design studios could give builders the competitive edge. The galleries, where dozens of options are featured in appealing room settings, add juice to the balance sheet, pump up sales and raise the level of buyer satisfaction, housing experts say. "Anything that makes it easier for somebody to buy a product is a good thing," said Georgette Chapman Phillips, chairwoman of the real estate department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "Gone are the days when you put it up and it sold. Builders are going to have to start working for their dollars." Although the nation's top builders began opening design centers in the late 1990's, the recently unveiled Dover gallery is unusual in that it represents a $700,000 investment by an old-line local builder. Robino built some of Wilmington's first suburban subdivisions after World War II to house workers for the expanding DuPont Company and other growing businesses. Today, Robino, with its Jack Corrozi Builder division, puts up about 300 homes annually in Delaware, including condominiums, town houses and detached homes. Prices range from $149,000 for a condo to $1.5 million for a semicustom home built by Corrozi Builder. While Robino is tiny compared with the nation's publicly traded builders, it is a sizable company in a small state whose single-family housing production in 2005 totaled 7,281 houses. With help from the design center, the company expects sales of about $100 million in 2006, said Jack Corrozi, the managing partner who spearheaded the design center project. Stephen J. Melman, director of economic services at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, said: "I'm sure every builder in the Delaware market is looking at it. Builders are going to have to be able to deliver exactly what the buyer wants." KB Home in Los Angeles, which opened its first gallery in the late 1990's, is credited with popularizing the design-center concept, said Alex Barron, a housing analyst with JMP Securities in San Francisco. KB, one of the country's largest builders, now has 30 centers and plans to open several more this year. Today, four out of five of the nation's top home builders have these selection centers. They tend to be in shopping centers or business parks, or next to a division office. Only Pulte Homes in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has moved away from design centers. "We found that the majority of our home buyers were choosing the same key options over and over," Melanie Hearsch, Pulte's corporate communications manager, wrote in an e-mail message. "As a consequence, we were spending considerable time dealing with a wide array of less-popular options that were driving up our costs and reducing our construction efficiency." 1 2Next Page » More Articles in Real Estate »DOVER, Del.

DuPont, which owns the Pioneer Hi-Bred International seed company, will become an equal partner in an existing Syngenta venture called GreenLeaf Genetics that licenses both conventional and genetically modified varieties to other seed companies in the United States and Canada. Syngenta will also use an experimental genetic engineering technology developed by Pioneer that allows crops to withstand glyphosate, the herbicide sold by Monsanto as Roundup. With both Pioneer and Syngenta offering that technology, it should have a better chance of competing against Monsanto's popular Roundup Ready seed technology. The partnership will "bring more choice, more options, to the growers," Michael Mack, the chief operating officer for Syngenta's seed business, said at a news conference at the biotechnology industry's annual convention here yesterday No financial terms were disclosed. The move marks a big departure for Pioneer, a company that is extremely proud of its long history as a corn breeder and which until now has sold seeds only under its own name. But Monsanto has been gaining market share in corn seeds over the last few years at Pioneer's expense, in part by licensing Monsanto's herbicide-resistant and insect-resistant crop genes to other seed companies. Pioneer executives said they would continue to sell their premium brands under the company's name. "Our long heritage is intact," Dean Oestreich, Pioneer's president, said at the news conference. But he and other Pioneer executives said there were some nonpremium varieties now just sitting on the shelf that could be licensed to others, allowing Pioneer to expand into the 40 percent of the market that does not buy premium seeds. Other seed companies will be able to cross lines provided by Pioneer to create new varieties, and seed retailers would be able to sell Pioneer varieties under their own brands. "What has changed is the time is right," Mr. Oestreich said. "Our biotechnology pipeline is now maturing. These important products really need to be driven across the industry." During a conference call held by DuPont, analysts questioned why the company entered a 50-50 joint venture, since Pioneer is much stronger in seeds than Syngenta. But DuPont officials said the deal was mutually beneficial. Monsanto accounts for the vast majority of biotech crops planted in the world, some under its own brands and the rest by other seed companies that have licensed its technology. Its biggest class of products has been soybeans, cotton, corn and canola genetically engineered to resist Roundup, enabling farmers to spray to kill weeds while leaving the crop intact. Both Pioneer and Syngenta license the Roundup Ready technology from Monsanto to impart glyphosate resistance to their own varieties. Developing their own herbicide-resistance technology would not only give them entry into a lucrative market but also relieve them of paying licensing fees and royalties to Monsanto. Pioneer executives said soybean seeds using its new technology would be ready for sale in 2009. The technology is called Optimum GAT, standing for glyphosate ALS tolerant. Crops using it would be even more resistant to glyphosate than Roundup Ready crops, the executives said, and would also be resistant to another widely used class of weed killers that use so-called ALS chemistry. ALS is an abbreviation for acetolactate synthase, a plant enzyme that the weed killers inhibit. In return for allowing Syngenta to use Optimum GAT, Pioneer is getting a license to insect-resistance genes from Syngenta. Pioneer now sells seeds for insect-resistant corn developed in partnership with Dow Chemical. Robb Fraley, chief technology officer for Monsanto, said it was too early to judge the effectiveness of the Optimum GAT technology or the impact of the new joint venture. "In the end it's going to come down to who has the best product in the marketplace," he said. DuPont shares rose 27 cents, to $42.97 yesterday, while Monsanto's fell 62 cents to $85.62. Syngenta's American depository receipts were down 24 cents in New York, to $27.71.

But Monsanto has been gaining market share in corn seeds over the last few years at Pioneer's expense, in part by licensing Monsanto's herbicide-resistant and insect-resistant crop genes to other seed companies. Pioneer executives said they would continue to sell their premium brands under the company's name. "Our long heritage is intact," Dean Oestreich, Pioneer's president, said at the news conference. But he and other Pioneer executives said there were some nonpremium varieties now just sitting on the shelf that could be licensed to others, allowing Pioneer to expand into the 40 percent of the market that does not buy premium seeds. Other seed companies will be able to cross lines provided by Pioneer to create new varieties, and seed retailers would be able to sell Pioneer varieties under their own brands. "What has changed is the time is right," Mr. Oestreich said. "Our biotechnology pipeline is now maturing. These important products really need to be driven across the industry." During a conference call held by DuPont, analysts questioned why the company entered a 50-50 joint venture, since Pioneer is much stronger in seeds than Syngenta. But DuPont officials said the deal was mutually beneficial. Monsanto accounts for the vast majority of biotech crops planted in the world, some under its own brands and the rest by other seed companies that have licensed its technology. Its biggest class of products has been soybeans, cotton, corn and canola genetically engineered to resist Roundup, enabling farmers to spray to kill weeds while leaving the crop intact. Both Pioneer and Syngenta license the Roundup Ready technology from Monsanto to impart glyphosate resistance to their own varieties. Developing their own herbicide-resistance technology would not only give them entry into a lucrative market but also relieve them of paying licensing fees and royalties to Monsanto. Pioneer executives said soybean seeds using its new technology would be ready for sale in 2009. The technology is called Optimum GAT, standing for glyphosate ALS tolerant. Crops using it would be even more resistant to glyphosate than Roundup Ready crops, the executives said, and would also be resistant to another widely used class of weed killers that use so-called ALS chemistry. ALS is an abbreviation for acetolactate synthase, a plant enzyme that the weed killers inhibit. In return for allowing Syngenta to use Optimum GAT, Pioneer is getting a license to insect-resistance genes from Syngenta. Pioneer now sells seeds for insect-resistant corn developed in partnership with Dow Chemical. Robb Fraley, chief technology officer for Monsanto, said it was too early to judge the effectiveness of the Optimum GAT technology or the impact of the new joint venture. "In the end it's going to come down to who has the best product in the marketplace," he said. DuPont shares rose 27 cents, to $42.97 yesterday, while Monsanto's fell 62 cents to $85.62. Syngenta's American depository receipts were down 24 cents in New York, to $27.71.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/business/22emission.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Study Says U.S. Companies Lag on Global Warming<date>Published: March 22, 2006</date><text>European and Asian companies are paying more attention to global warming than their American counterparts. And chemical companies are more focused on the issue than oil companies. Those are two conclusions from "Corporate Governance and Climate Change: Making the Connection," a report that Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmentalists, expects will influence investment decisions. The report, released yesterday, scored 100 global corporations  74 of them based in the United States  on their strategies for curbing greenhouse gases. It covered 10 industries  oil and gas, chemicals, metals, electric power, automotive, forest products, coal, food, industrial equipment and airlines  whose activities were most likely to emit greenhouse gases. It evaluated companies on their board oversight, management performance, public disclosure, greenhouse gas emissions, accounting and strategic planning. The report gave the chemical industry the highest overall marks, with a score of 51.9 out of a possible 100; DuPont, with 85 points, was the highest-ranking American company in any of the industries. Airlines, in contrast, ranked lowest, with a score of 16.6; UAL, the parent of United Airlines, received just 3 points. The study gave General Electric, American Electric Power and Cinergy among the highest scores in their industries. But over all, it concluded, American companies "are playing catch-up" with international competitors like BP, Toyota, Alcan, Unilever and Rio Tinto. "Dozens of U.S. businesses are ignoring the issue with 'business as usual' responses that are putting their companies, and their shareholders, at risk," said Mindy S. Lubber, president of Ceres and director of the Investor Network on Climate Risk, a group whose members control a total of $3 trillion in investment capital. "When Cinergy and American Electric Power are tackling this issue, and Sempra and Dominion Resources are not, that should be a red flag to investors." Art Larson, a Sempra Energy spokesman, took exception to Sempra's score of 24. He said that Sempra, based in San Diego, had been "aggressive in promoting energy efficiency and procuring renewable energy sources," and that "in the area of environmental responsibility, Ceres seems to give more weight to words over action." Hunter Applewhite, a spokesman for Dominion, a big electric utility in Richmond, Va., that scored 27, said the company had no comment on its ranking. Members of the Investor Network said they would take the report's conclusions seriously. "We need to continue to press poor-performing companies to clean up their act," said California's state treasurer, Phil Angelides, who is on the board of two pension funds that collectively manage more than $300 billion in assets. Connecticut's state treasurer, Denise L. Nappier, who administers a $22 billion investment fund, lauded the report as an "unprecedented window into how companies most affected by climate risk are responding at the board level, through C.E.O. leadership and strategic planning." The report does show progress since 2003, when a much smaller Ceres study concluded that most American companies were ignoring the threat of climate change. Since then, Ceres notes, Chevron Texaco has invested $100 million in developing cleaner fuels, Ford Motor introduced the first American hybrid car, American Electric Power has committed itself to "clean coal" technologies and G.E. has introduced its Ecomagination program stressing "green" products. And many companies including Dow Chemical, Anadarko Petroleum and Cinergy have board committees that oversee the curbing of greenhouse gases. "More U.S. companies realize that climate change is an enormous business issue that they need to manage immediately," Ms. Lubber said. Still, the top-scoring company, with 90 points, was BP, a British company that has said it will invest $8 billion in solar, wind and other clean-energy technologies in the next decade. "BP understands that all companies must work to reduce their carbon footprint, starting with fossil fuels," Ms. Lubber said.

The company has allocated nearly 10 percent of its $1.3 billion research budget to extracting ingredients from carbohydrates  things that grow and can be infinitely replaced  rather than from hydrocarbons, which are mined or drilled and readily depleted. DuPont already makes 10 percent of its products from nonpetrochemical substances, and Charles O. Holliday Jr., DuPont's chief executive, expects to increase that to 25 percent by 2010. By then, he says, such products will yield the equivalent of $3 billion in revenue in current dollars. The way Mr. Holliday sees it, so-called industrial biotechnology can solve myriad problems. It can insulate DuPont from the relentless rise in gas and oil prices. It can win kudos from environmentalists and shareholders who worry about the harmful effect of extracting and burning oil. It can play well in Washington, particularly since a quest for alternate energy sources was a crucial point in President Bush's State of the Union message. But during a nearly two-hour conversation in his spacious office above the Hotel DuPont, Mr. Holliday stressed his real motive in pushing for bio-based materials: his belief that they yield better products. He notes, for example, that the corn-based propane diol, a product used in carpet fibers that DuPont will begin selling this spring, offers better dye absorption and stain resistance than the petrochemical version DuPont now sells. "We're using biology to solve problems that chemistry can't," he said. It is not just bombast. DuPont is working with the Energy Department to turn corn plants  the husks, the ears, the stems, everything  into vehicular fuel. DuPont is close to developing plant-based hair dyes and nail polishes that will not adhere to skin, surgical bio-glues that can stanch internal bleeding and a textile fiber made from sugar that will act and feel like cotton. This spring DuPont will open a factory in Loudon, Tenn., that will make propane diol  trademarked as Sorona  from glucose. For now the output is earmarked for carpet fiber, but DuPont is exploring whether it can work in rigid plastics for automobile interiors or de-icing compounds for airplanes. The company has already converted many labs that once worked on pharmaceuticals or textiles  two businesses DuPont has shed  to now search for ingredients to replace oil and gas. Next year, it plans to cluster them all in one building and move a marketing staff in with them. "Industrial biotechnology is an area in which we can differentiate ourselves, so we're spending a lot more than any other company on it," said Thomas M. Connelly, DuPont's chief science officer. DuPont's optimism has other chemical industry executives scratching their heads. Dow Chemical pulled out of a joint venture with Cargill to make polylactic acid, a component of food packaging, from corn. Eastman Chemical sold its stake in Genencor International, a leader in industrial biotechnology. "We really do believe that industrial biotech is critical to our evolution, but the technologies of the foreseeable future just do not give the returns we expect from our research dollar," said Andrew N. Liveris, chief executive of Dow, which is looking for ways to make polyurethane from soybean oil, but has put a higher priority on extracting ingredients from coal. Friedhelm Balkenhohl, senior vice president for bio-catalysis research at the BASF Corporation, echoes that view. "Raw material change is one of our hot topics, but even 10 years from now, renewables will account for less than 10 percent of our ingredients," he said. Some companies are shrugging off bio-based ingredients entirely, and concentrating solely on using petroleum ingredients more efficiently.

In December, the Environmental Protection Agency reached a $16.5 million settlement with DuPont over the company's failure to report health risks from the chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA. Last month, the agency announced it had reached an agreement with eight companies, including DuPont and 3M, to eliminate PFOA and the chemicals that break down into PFOA from all consumer products by 2015. A few days later, the majority of the E.P.A.'s scientific review panel advised the agency that the chemical should be classified as a "likely" carcinogen. This designation means that a chemical is known to cause cancer in animals, though the evidence that it causes cancer in humans is suggestive but not conclusive. The recent negative publicity prompted DuPont, which manufactures Teflon nonstick cookware, to run full-page advertisements last week in newspapers (including The New York Times), telling the public that cookware coated with Teflon "is safe" and that "there is no reason to stop" using it. The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental research and advocacy organization, agrees that Teflon-coated pans are not a major source of PFOA, but says they should be used with care. An overheated empty Teflon-coated pan poses some risk because it can release toxic gases, which are especially dangerous for birds. DuPont says this is only likely to happen at 660 degrees while other scientists say 325 degrees. Fluorotelomers, chemicals used in packaging, can also break down into PFOA, but there is currently no way for consumers to tell if a package contains the chemicals. The F.D.A. has found that PFOA migrates to the oil from the packaging for microwave popcorn bags during heating. The chemicals are also found in packaging for pizza, bakery items, drinks and candy. The safe level for PFOA, found in the blood of 95 percent of all Americans, is unknown. If the E.P.A. decides to classify a chemical as a "likely" carcinogen, it would be required to conduct a full human health risk assessment for cancer. So until 2015, advice on how to reduce exposure has not changed: Use Teflon pans at lower temperatures and never put them over heat without food or liquid. Greasy food should not be heated in a microwave oven in a cardboard container: it should be transferred to glass or ceramic. For popcorn, advice from Alton Brown of the Food Network is worth repeating: Place one-quarter cup of good quality popcorn in a standard brown paper lunch bag; mix with oil and seasoning; seal the bag with a single staple and heat for two to three minutes in the microwave. Cast iron pans, seasoned and heated properly, require very little oil for browning. Professional chefs don't use nonstick pans because they do not brown as well as cast iron or stainless steel.

Hurricane Katrina damaged some of their plants, but repairs are proceeding quickly. Hurricane Rita left barely a physical mark. For the next few months, orders will drop but, the executives say, demand will probably ratchet up quickly as rebuilding along the Gulf Coast begins. "Net-net, it will be a wash, because our industry's products will be used to rebuild the devastated areas," said Andrew N. Liveris, chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. But while the industry may have dodged these immediate bullets, a thornier problem still interferes with executive sleep: natural gas prices that have been soaring since 2001. High prices are a double whammy for the chemical industry. Natural gas is both its main fuel and its main raw material, the starting point for the basic chemicals from which the fibers and compounds in shirts, eyeglasses and even the wrappers for single-serve soups are derived. "Chemical companies have been under assault for several years," said Robert Koort, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who has an attractive rating on the chemical sector. Diane H. Gulyas, chief marketing officer of DuPont, said that, if anything, the hurricanes "acted as a wake-up call." "It made us all realize how shocking the underlying fundamentals of our business have become," she said. The industry has passed along costs, and it is likely to continue doing so for now. Since Katrina, almost every chemical company has announced price increases. The trickledown effect to retail shelves is inevitable - soda and water come in plastic bottles, computers use plastic housings, even organic greenmarkets pack fruits and vegetables in plastic bags. "Consumers can expect to pay more for everything, from medicines to auto parts to computers to shampoo," said Kevin Swift, chief economist for the American Chemistry Council, a trade association. But industry specialists worry that if high gas prices curb consumer spending, the days of passing along constant price increases may end. "The uncompetitive natural gas price in the U.S. is a long-term problem," said Gordon E. Slack, business director for Dow energy business, who said that high gas prices had turned the chemical industry from a net exporter to a net importer. Those rising prices have effectively wiped out the American chemical industry's main competitive edge. Whereas most overseas chemical plants derive most of their raw materials from oil, gas has long been the feedstock of choice here. According to Mr. Swift, natural gas accounts for about 60 percent of the value of chemicals made here. Indeed, many chemical companies clustered their plants along the Gulf Coast, where so much gas is produced, to take advantage of what Mr. Slack called "the best natural gas prices in the world." As recently as 2000, natural gas was selling for $2 per million British thermal units. But since then, environmental regulations have impelled many companies to switch from burning oil or coal to gas, even as other rules restricted drilling for new sources of gas. Unlike oil, which is considered a global commodity, gas is generally moved through regional markets. Liquid natural gas can be shipped long distances, but the liquefaction process is expensive, and only about 3 percent of natural gas comes into the United States that way. Around 2001, demand began to exceed supply, and gas prices have soared since. On Aug. 26, the Friday before Katrina hit, gas prices had already topped $8 per million B.T.U.'s. Then Katrina knocked out natural gas rigs and otherwise stanched the flow of gas. Since then, gas prices have hovered around $12, the highest in the world. Few experts think they will drop again soon. "This unfortunate new reality of elevated oil and gas prices is going to be with us for at least the next 12 to 18 months," Ms. Gulyas predicted. The effect on chemical company costs has been huge. Most have already shuttered energy-guzzling plants and installed productivity-enhancing programs in the remaining ones. Yet the savings have not kept pace with the costs. Gas and oil accounted for 43 percent of Dow's costs this year; in 2002, they represented 29 percent. Jeff Worden, a spokesman for PPG Industries, which makes chemicals, glass and paints, described it another way. "We use between 60 trillion and 70 trillion B.T.U.'s of natural gas a year, so if the price goes up one dollar, our costs are up $60 or $70 million," he said. If the winter is severe, those costs could go even higher. In fact, the industry might even face shortages. "No utility will shut the gas off in someone's home to give it to a chemical company," Mr. Swift said. Few executives anticipate the situation to become that dire. "The industry's growth may be down a few percent this year, but it will increase by the same amount in 2006," said Klaus Peter Löbbe, chairman of BASF. William H. Joyce, chairman of Nalco Holdings, is similarly sanguine. Nalco, which makes water treatment and process chemicals, estimates that the effect of the storms will add $15 million to its costs, even as customers whose operations were hurt buy as much as $10 million less from them. Yet in a statement Mr. Joyce referred to the problems as a "short-term disruption" that will be resolved in 2006. Most analysts have lowered their estimates of chemical company profits this year, according to Thomson Financial, yet they still recommend that investors buy the shares. "Margins may be low now, but they'll be picking up by next quarter," said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical industry specialist at Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent research firm. "And this industry is going to have a good 2006." More Articles in Business &gt;In one sense, chemical industry executives should be sighing with relief.

"Consumers can expect to pay more for everything, from medicines to auto parts to computers to shampoo," said Kevin Swift, chief economist for the American Chemistry Council, a trade association. But industry specialists worry that if high gas prices curb consumer spending, the days of passing along constant price increases may end. "The uncompetitive natural gas price in the U.S. is a long-term problem," said Gordon E. Slack, business director for Dow energy business, who said that high gas prices had turned the chemical industry from a net exporter to a net importer. Those rising prices have effectively wiped out the American chemical industry's main competitive edge. Whereas most overseas chemical plants derive most of their raw materials from oil, gas has long been the feedstock of choice here. According to Mr. Swift, natural gas accounts for about 60 percent of the value of chemicals made here. Indeed, many chemical companies clustered their plants along the Gulf Coast, where so much gas is produced, to take advantage of what Mr. Slack called "the best natural gas prices in the world." As recently as 2000, natural gas was selling for $2 per million British thermal units. But since then, environmental regulations have impelled many companies to switch from burning oil or coal to gas, even as other rules restricted drilling for new sources of gas. Unlike oil, which is considered a global commodity, gas is generally moved through regional markets. Liquid natural gas can be shipped long distances, but the liquefaction process is expensive, and only about 3 percent of natural gas comes into the United States that way. Around 2001, demand began to exceed supply, and gas prices have soared since. On Aug. 26, the Friday before Katrina hit, gas prices had already topped $8 per million B.T.U.'s. Then Katrina knocked out natural gas rigs and otherwise stanched the flow of gas. Since then, gas prices have hovered around $12, the highest in the world. Few experts think they will drop again soon. "This unfortunate new reality of elevated oil and gas prices is going to be with us for at least the next 12 to 18 months," Ms. Gulyas predicted. The effect on chemical company costs has been huge. Most have already shuttered energy-guzzling plants and installed productivity-enhancing programs in the remaining ones. Yet the savings have not kept pace with the costs. Gas and oil accounted for 43 percent of Dow's costs this year; in 2002, they represented 29 percent. Jeff Worden, a spokesman for PPG Industries, which makes chemicals, glass and paints, described it another way. "We use between 60 trillion and 70 trillion B.T.U.'s of natural gas a year, so if the price goes up one dollar, our costs are up $60 or $70 million," he said. If the winter is severe, those costs could go even higher. In fact, the industry might even face shortages. "No utility will shut the gas off in someone's home to give it to a chemical company," Mr. Swift said. Few executives anticipate the situation to become that dire. "The industry's growth may be down a few percent this year, but it will increase by the same amount in 2006," said Klaus Peter Löbbe, chairman of BASF. William H. Joyce, chairman of Nalco Holdings, is similarly sanguine. Nalco, which makes water treatment and process chemicals, estimates that the effect of the storms will add $15 million to its costs, even as customers whose operations were hurt buy as much as $10 million less from them. Yet in a statement Mr. Joyce referred to the problems as a "short-term disruption" that will be resolved in 2006. Most analysts have lowered their estimates of chemical company profits this year, according to Thomson Financial, yet they still recommend that investors buy the shares. "Margins may be low now, but they'll be picking up by next quarter," said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical industry specialist at Fulcrum Global Partners, an independent research firm. "And this industry is going to have a good 2006."</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/national/nationalspecial/09toxic.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Residents Worry About the Threat of Hazardous Chemicals<date>Published: September 9, 2005</date><text>Correction Appended DeLISLE, Miss., Sept. 8 - When Hurricane Katrina's 13-foot storm surge crashed through the houses and businesses of this town on the Gulf Coast, it also rushed through a plant where DuPont stored dioxins and other hazardous materials.

"Would you rebuild your home if it had been on Three Mile Island?" asked Paul Stewart, whose house, across the street from the DuPont plant, was destroyed. "I'm nervous about even rummaging through the rubble to find my things." DuPont officials said that even though the plant sustained extensive damage from high winds and flooding, no harmful chemicals escaped the plant, which is about 60 miles northeast of New Orleans near the St. Louis Bay. "We had advance notice the storm was coming, and we went through an orderly, disciplined procedure to shut down," said F. Edmund Johnston, the safety, health and environmental manager for DuPont's titanium business, in a telephone interview from his office in Wilmington, Del. Before Hurricane Katrina, the Environmental Protection Agency had identified nearly 400 sites in the counties now declared disaster areas as possibly needing cleanup because of their potential impact on human health. Those sites contained toxic materials that may have been redistributed by the winds and water. Robbie Wilbur, a spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, said in an e-mail message that personnel from his department had visited the DuPont site and that he had no reports of a spill. But some local residents remain unconvinced. "I don't know how they can say nothing got out when I was down on the bayou the day after the storm and I saw white film all over things down there," said Lena Lizana, a housekeeper who lives across the street from DeLisle Elementary School on Whitman Road. The plant produces titanium dioxide, a pigment for white paint. In some form, the dispute in DeLisle will probably be repeated in about a thousand other places that, according to recent federal records, produce, store or manufacture toxic chemicals in the counties declared disaster areas in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and parts of Florida. Of those, 290 produce dioxins, like the DuPont plant, or other chemicals known to accumulate in the body. Like so much else in this battered region, the amount of chemicals that were dispersed by the floodwaters is unknown. Even before the storm, the DuPont plant had been regarded with suspicion. Nearly 2,000 lawsuits are pending against the plant, and last month a jury awarded $14 million to a local oyster fisherman with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. The company is appealing. Across the Gulf Coast - the petrochemical heart of America - regulators are only now beginning to inspect a variety of factories damaged by the storm. And while the rancid floodwaters being pumped out of New Orleans are laden with human waste, oil slicks and the household chemicals stored in the cabinets of hundreds of thousands of kitchens and garages, there are other places - like the one here in DeLisle, where the eye of the storm came ashore - with far more toxic hazards. The E.P.A. is flying a three-seat, single-engine plane around the Gulf Coast, looking for environmental problems. In a telephone interview, Stephen L. Johnson, the agency's administrator, said, "Obviously we are concerned about a lot of things, including chemical plants, the oil facilities, the gas facilities, the fact that we've got raw sewage in the floodwaters of New Orleans." The agency has taken water samples in New Orleans and elsewhere and is preparing to take soil samples, he said. Many houses that were damaged or destroyed used asbestos and lead paint, adding to contamination problems, he said. "We're going to be looking at chemical plants, and some Superfund sites in the path of the hurricane," he said. One site, the Agriculture Street Landfill, in New Orleans, is under water, he said. But when E.P.A. personnel first launched boats in flooded areas to look for environmental problems, he said, their first task was more immediate, to rescue 700 stranded people. Philip B. Bedient, a flood expert who is a professor in the civil and environmental engineering department at Rice University in Houston, said most chemical plants were not required to build waste pools in plateaus above ground level. Instead, he said, they usually built three- to six-foot earthen levees around the waste pools for protection. "Still, even if the levees worked as barriers, and the floodwaters didn't wash over these ponds, the 100-mile-an-hour winds hitting the surface of the ponds likely sprayed large amounts of the liquids from them into the surrounding area," he said. "On the other hand, the only upshot of the massive amounts of water and wind that came ashore is that it probably spread these chemicals far and wide and diluted them in the process." Becky Gillette, a spokeswoman for the Sierra Club in Ocean Springs, Miss., said, "I think there is good reason for people to be concerned along the whole industrial corridor here in Mississippi." Ms. Gillette said that along the Bayou Casotte Road in East Pascagoula, at least five major chemical plants had been flooded by storm surges above 20 feet. "Do you really think these places were sealed that tight?" she asked.

But more than nonstick frying pans are under scrutiny these days. Scientists are examining the chemical makeup of other products like food containers to gauge their potential hazards. Skip to next paragraph Forum: Fitness and Nutrition In each instance, the substance being questioned is perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA. Studies have shown that PFOA causes cancer and other health problems in laboratory animals, and it is under scrutiny by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. A class action suit filed last week against DuPont in several states, including New York, charges that Teflon releases PFOA under normal cooking use and that the company did not warn consumers about its dangers. DuPont says that while PFOA is used to make Teflon, none of it remains in the finished product, and all Teflon-coated cookware is safe. The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental research and advocacy organization financed by foundations including the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Joyce Foundation, says items other than pans are likely to be the major sources of PFOA. But the group, along with many scientists, points out a different problem: an empty overheated Teflon-coated pan does pose a risk by releasing toxic fumes. DuPont does not dispute that, but there is no agreement between the company and Teflon's critics over what temperature releases the fumes. The Environmental Working Group says 325 degrees, or a medium flame; DuPont says 660 degrees. DuPont tells consumers at its Web site that the fumes can injure pet birds and cause flulike symptoms in humans at "abnormally" high temperatures, a condition that the company says can last a couple of days. Other reports say that the fumes can kill birds. While DuPont defends its Teflon products, other companies are looking into their use of PFOA. Several animal studies, including one by the Environmental Protection Agency, show that fluorotelomers, chemicals used in food packaging as well as in rugs and clothing, break down into PFOA in the environment and when ingested. The Environmental Protection Agency began studying PFOA in 1999 and a draft report of its findings has been reviewed by an outside science advisory panel, which has said that PFOA is a likely human carcinogen. The E.P.A. disagrees and wants to describe it as a suggestive human carcinogen. The difference is important because if the panel's version is the final version the finding could call for a human cancer risk assessment. The final report will be released in the fall. What troubles the agency, and the Food and Drug Administration, is that PFOA can be found in the blood of 90 percent of Americans, according to a study by the 3M Company. Of the 600 children tested, 96 percent had PFOA in their blood; its source is unknown. Unlike dioxin and a class of chemicals known as polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, which have been banned as suspected carcinogens, PFOA does not break down, remaining in the environment indefinitely. Fluorotelomers are used in microwaveable popcorn bags, in packaging for fast foods like sandwiches, chicken and French fries, as well as in packaging for pizza, bakery items, drinks and candy. They are also found in paper plates. There is currently no way for consumers to tell if packaging contains fluorotelomers. According to Tim Kropp, a toxicologist with the Environmental Working Group, "paper plates with a really glossy look probably don't use it." The F.D.A. has looked at PFOA in microwaveable popcorn packaging and found that the chemical migrates to the oil from the packaging during heating. But George Pauli, associate director for science and policy in the office of food additive safety at the F.D.A., said the levels found in the microwave packaging are low. "We don't see anything at this time to say it's a safety issue," he said. "Food doesn't appear to be a major source." Dr. Kropp countered: "Any amount of PFOA you are ingesting may be a problem because we don't know what levels are safe." Julie DeYoung, a spokeswoman for Phoenix Packaging, a division of ConAgra Foods, said: "Studies on PFOA are preliminary, but we are taking the issue seriously and are talking with our paper suppliers about the issue. If the government tells paper suppliers to make changes, we'll support that." ConAgra makes Orville Redenbacher's and Act II microwave popcorn and private label brands. For those who don't want to wait for definitive answers from the government, the Environmental Working Group has some suggestions: Use Teflon pans at lower temperatures, and never put them on the stove to heat without food or liquid inside. Greasy food that is heated in a microwave oven in a cardboard container is a potential source of PFOA; take the food out of the container and heat it in glass or ceramic. For popcorn in the microwave, the group suggests the following: Place a quarter-cup of good quality popcorn in a standard brown paper lunch bag; mix with oil and seasoning; seal the bag with a single staple (one staple does not contain enough metal to cause a spark) and heat for two to three minutes. Alton Brown, who cooks on the Food Network, uses this method. Another solution is to cook the old-fashioned way. If cast iron pans are seasoned and heated properly, very little oil is needed for browning. Chefs generally do not use nonstick pans because they do not think they do as good a job of cooking as cast iron and stainless steel, especially for browning.

Va., had fouled local supplies of drinking water, some investors hoped to close the book on pollution caused by an important ingredient used in processing Teflon. Skip to next paragraph Tony Kemp for The New York Times DuPont agreed to pay $100 million to settle accusations that its Washington Works plant, on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River, polluted local drinking water. But that was before a group of scientists advising the Environmental Protection Agency determined earlier this month that the ingredient, perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or C8, was a "likely carcinogen," or cancer-causing agent. That finding could compel the E.P.A. to formally regulate the chemical. It could also complicate DuPont's position in two matters: a criminal investigation into whether it hid tests showing a public health threat, and a class-action suit filed last week on behalf of people who bought Teflon-coated cookware. There is no hard evidence that Teflon-coated cookware - or any other products that incorporate Teflon, from clothing to cleansers to fast-food packaging - poses the same threat as PFOA. For its part, DuPont has long maintained that there is no evidence that either Teflon or PFOA pose a serious threat. Still, increased regulation or a successful class-action suit would be a heavy blow to one of DuPont's most successful and profitable businesses. According to the suit, which was filed in several states by two Florida law firms, DuPont nets an estimated $200 million in profit a year from sales of Teflon. The scientific panel's finding could also be bad news for the chemical industry in general if it fuels debate over the use of chemicals in industrial and consumer products, and their potential link to diseases like cancer and to reproductive disorders. Such concerns have prompted the European Union and Canada to tighten controls on chemical use and labeling. The United States has not taken such steps, in part because the chemical industry offered in the late 1990's to start a voluntary testing program for chemicals produced in volumes of one million pounds or more a year. This month, the Government Accountability Office criticized the E.P.A.'s ability to ensure that tens of thousands of chemicals in commercial use - and new agents introduced at the rate of about 700 a year - did not pose a health risk. It said the E.P.A., which has used its authority to request health data on fewer than 200 chemicals since 1979, should have more authority. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has lined up six co-sponsors for legislation that would expand the agency's powers and require manufacturers to test their chemicals for health risks. DuPont has objected to the characterization of PFOA as a likely carcinogen, and said initial results from its study of 1,000 workers at its Teflon factory had found no adverse health effect, aside from higher cholesterol in some people. The company, which says PFOA itself is not found in Teflon cookware, added that it intends to vigorously defend itself in the class-action suit. "DuPont believes consumers using products sold under the Teflon brand are safe," said R. Clifton Webb, a DuPont spokesman. Critics point to PFOA as an example of the need to change how chemicals are regulated. In the 50 years that Teflon has been made, for example, little has been done to assess whether it affects human health - even though the chemical is present in the blood of more than 90 percent of Americans, according to samples taken from blood banks by the 3M Company beginning in the mid-90's. Chemical makers are not required to test their compounds for toxicity before asking the E.P.A. to clear them for sale, and the agency said that most companies did not test voluntarily. The E.P.A. relies instead on methods, like computer modeling, to prevent harmful compounds from entering the market. Even that screening, however, does not include chemicals that were already in use when Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, the E.P.A.'s main tool for policing industrial chemicals, in 1979. "The system does not work, and our blood and bodies and tissues are proof," said David M. Ozonoff, a professor of environmental health at Boston University's School of Public Health. Researchers are starting to look harder at how far PFOA has spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to include it and related chemicals in a nationwide survey of chemical exposure next year, and DuPont is paying for tests of people near its factory as part of the settlement. The E.P.A. is studying why PFOA is so pervasive and whether it is harmful. Even if PFOA were shown to cause cancer or some other illness, it would not be easy to ban. Asbestos provides some insight into how difficult it can be to ban a commonly used substance, even when there is evidence of risk. The E.P.A. banned asbestos in 1989 after reviewing more than 100 studies over 10 years and concluding that the substance was a potential carcinogen at all levels of exposure. But in 1991, a federal appeals court overturned parts of the rule, saying that there was not enough evidence; some products were no longer banned, but manufacturers took many of them off the market anyway. Some public health and environmental activists say PFOA could be the next test case. These critics say that PFOA does not break down in the environment or in the bloodstream, and some studies have found that elevated levels of PFOA coincide with some cancers and birth defects. "It's been produced for 50 years," said Jane Houlihan, vice president of the Environmental Working Group, an environmental organization based in Washington that has been a leading critic of DuPont. "Why only now are we studying it? That is a system that's completely backwards." If the E.P.A. were to take action against PFOA, it would be the first major regulation of a chemical in more than 15 years. Of the more than 80,000 chemicals that have been in commercial use since World War II, just five types are regulated: PCB's, halogenated chlorofluoroalkanes, dioxin, asbestos and hexavalent chromium. One company, 3M, has voluntarily discontinued making another member of the perfluorochemical family, PFOS, a chemical that some European countries may ban. More Articles in Business &gt;WHEN DuPont agreed to pay more than $100 million last fall to settle a lawsuit contending that its factory near Parkersburg, W. Va., had fouled local supplies of drinking water, some investors hoped to close the book on pollution caused by an important ingredient used in processing Teflon. Skip to next paragraph Tony Kemp for The New York Times DuPont agreed to pay $100 million to settle accusations that its Washington Works plant, on the West Virginia side of the Ohio River, polluted local drinking water. But that was before a group of scientists advising the Environmental Protection Agency determined earlier this month that the ingredient, perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as PFOA or C8, was a "likely carcinogen," or cancer-causing agent. That finding could compel the E.P.A. to formally regulate the chemical. It could also complicate DuPont's position in two matters: a criminal investigation into whether it hid tests showing a public health threat, and a class-action suit filed last week on behalf of people who bought Teflon-coated cookware. There is no hard evidence that Teflon-coated cookware - or any other products that incorporate Teflon, from clothing to cleansers to fast-food packaging - poses the same threat as PFOA. For its part, DuPont has long maintained that there is no evidence that either Teflon or PFOA pose a serious threat. Still, increased regulation or a successful class-action suit would be a heavy blow to one of DuPont's most successful and profitable businesses. According to the suit, which was filed in several states by two Florida law firms, DuPont nets an estimated $200 million in profit a year from sales of Teflon. The scientific panel's finding could also be bad news for the chemical industry in general if it fuels debate over the use of chemicals in industrial and consumer products, and their potential link to diseases like cancer and to reproductive disorders. Such concerns have prompted the European Union and Canada to tighten controls on chemical use and labeling. The United States has not taken such steps, in part because the chemical industry offered in the late 1990's to start a voluntary testing program for chemicals produced in volumes of one million pounds or more a year. This month, the Government Accountability Office criticized the E.P.A.'s ability to ensure that tens of thousands of chemicals in commercial use - and new agents introduced at the rate of about 700 a year - did not pose a health risk. It said the E.P.A., which has used its authority to request health data on fewer than 200 chemicals since 1979, should have more authority. Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, has lined up six co-sponsors for legislation that would expand the agency's powers and require manufacturers to test their chemicals for health risks. DuPont has objected to the characterization of PFOA as a likely carcinogen, and said initial results from its study of 1,000 workers at its Teflon factory had found no adverse health effect, aside from higher cholesterol in some people. The company, which says PFOA itself is not found in Teflon cookware, added that it intends to vigorously defend itself in the class-action suit. "DuPont believes consumers using products sold under the Teflon brand are safe," said R. Clifton Webb, a DuPont spokesman. Critics point to PFOA as an example of the need to change how chemicals are regulated. In the 50 years that Teflon has been made, for example, little has been done to assess whether it affects human health - even though the chemical is present in the blood of more than 90 percent of Americans, according to samples taken from blood banks by the 3M Company beginning in the mid-90's. Chemical makers are not required to test their compounds for toxicity before asking the E.P.A. to clear them for sale, and the agency said that most companies did not test voluntarily. The E.P.A. relies instead on methods, like computer modeling, to prevent harmful compounds from entering the market. Even that screening, however, does not include chemicals that were already in use when Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, the E.P.A.'s main tool for policing industrial chemicals, in 1979. "The system does not work, and our blood and bodies and tissues are proof," said David M. Ozonoff, a professor of environmental health at Boston University's School of Public Health. Researchers are starting to look harder at how far PFOA has spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to include it and related chemicals in a nationwide survey of chemical exposure next year, and DuPont is paying for tests of people near its factory as part of the settlement. The E.P.A. is studying why PFOA is so pervasive and whether it is harmful. Even if PFOA were shown to cause cancer or some other illness, it would not be easy to ban. Asbestos provides some insight into how difficult it can be to ban a commonly used substance, even when there is evidence of risk. The E.P.A. banned asbestos in 1989 after reviewing more than 100 studies over 10 years and concluding that the substance was a potential carcinogen at all levels of exposure. But in 1991, a federal appeals court overturned parts of the rule, saying that there was not enough evidence; some products were no longer banned, but manufacturers took many of them off the market anyway. Some public health and environmental activists say PFOA could be the next test case. These critics say that PFOA does not break down in the environment or in the bloodstream, and some studies have found that elevated levels of PFOA coincide with some cancers and birth defects.

I'm in the market for a countertop that is easy to care for but has more character than Formica and less weight than stone. What can you suggest? Skip to next paragraph Douglas Healey for The New York Times A. Consider a product called Richlite, which has an almost matte finish. A wood-fiber laminate that is also used for cutting boards and skating ramps, it is made with paper and resin, offering a tough surface and a warm touch. The material gets slightly darker over time, developing a patina after years of use. (If you're looking for something that will look the same 10 years from now, see below.) Richlite (pictured, top) is more forgiving than stone, so glasses put down less than daintily won't break or chip as easily, for instance. Trivets and cutting boards will add to its life expectancy, and a non-oil-base sealant, applied during installation, will also add a little extra protection. Richlite comes in seven colors including slate black, nutmeg and merlot. Prices start at $85 a square foot installed; for information, www.richlite.com or (888) 383-5533. Though Corian has been around for a while, its manufacturer, DuPont, has introduced a new set of colors, some multitoned in shades like sage, and new patterns that mimic concrete, sand and even suede.

Working with it can be tricky, however, so be sure to use a licensed, experienced contractor. Corian comes in more than 100 colors for those who want to go beyond white or ecru.

This is a job for a professional: plate glass, obviously, is fragile, and at least two sets of hands are needed to move it. A professional glass worker can also apply the paint. Look online or in the Yellow Pages under glass, auto, plate or window. Costs vary, but count on spending at least $500. A back-painted glass backsplash can be stunning. The paint, partly because it is on the back, offers a depth that ceramic and metal don't always have, giving a new dimension to an area that is often taken for granted. If the countertops and appliances are white or gray, a brightly colored piece of glass will provide punch. Its long, unbroken surface is not only easy to clean (no grout) but also gives an expansive feel to your cooking area. Depending on the size, the backsplash can be applied with adhesive (be sure it does not interact with the paint), screwed into the wall or attached with some combination of these means.

Rhode Island sued eight lead paint manufacturers and a lead industry trade group in 1999, saying they knowingly made a product harmful to public health and should be responsible for paying for removal of the paint and treating children sickened by it. Rhode Island was the first state to sue the manufacturers. The suit ended in a mistrial in 2002, and a judge ruled the state could retry the case. A new trial is scheduled to begin in September. DuPont said Thursday it would give millions of dollars to the Children's Health Forum, a nonprofit group that works to prevent lead poisoning in children. The money will be used for education, abatement of paint and landlord and homeowner compliance programs, the attorney general said. DuPont will donate $1 million to Brown University Medical School to research how best to treat poisoned children and an unspecified amount to the Dana Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center in Boston. The company will not pay the state, and the deal is not considered a settlement agreement. The state said the deal is worth $10 million but could climb depending on costs, while DuPont put the figure at $12.5 million. "We have reached a thoughtful and focused alternative to litigation that addresses the concerns of Rhode Island and enhances public awareness of the issues related to lead exposure," Stacey J. Mobley, DuPont's general counsel and chief administrative officer, said in a statement. The agreement will "make a real and lasting impact on the health and safety of Rhode Island's children," Attorney General Patrick C. Lynch said in a statement.

I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company said yesterday that strong sales of farm chemicals and plastics increased its first-quarter profit by 45 percent, but the results missed Wall Street estimates because of a steep rise in costs for energy and raw materials. DuPont also raised its dividend and stood by its forecast for higher 2005 earnings, saying strong prices, sales growth in China and the introduction of products would help offset surging raw materials costs. Shares of DuPont fell 3.2 percent, or $1.55, to $47.03, as Wall Street worried about the jump in prices for oil and natural gas, which are primary ingredients in chemicals. The rise in those costs in the first quarter reduced DuPont's earnings by 19 cents a share, the biggest quarterly impact ever for the company's current businesses. DuPont said sales volumes in the United States fell because of slowing auto production, which hurt sales of coatings and plastic parts, and a loss of sales.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/style/tmagazine/arad.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Design Resolutionary<date>Published: April 3, 2005</date><text>few years ago DuPont, trolling for designers to appear in a show that would demonstrate the joys of its synthetic material Corian, approached the designer Ron Arad, and Arad turned them down flat: ''I said, 'When you want to do a major project, come back.''' Playing hard to get worked. Arad, as it happened, had been experimenting with putting images inside an object  planting fiber optics in solid materials  and Corian turned out to be the perfect vehicle. ''It becomes translucent, but you can cut it or carve it,'' he says. In this case, he carved Corian into three parts  a 32-foot-wide wall, a 16-foot column and an M&amp;M-shaped table  for his Lo-Rez-Dolores-Tabula-Rasa. The three pieces look like blank surfaces when not in use, but when turned on, the images hug their curves without distortion but with a little pixelated mystery. Advertisement ''It is a bit of a mad idea,'' he says, chuckling about the low resolution of the images, while ''the rest of the world is working really hard to improve resolution.'' Arad, Israeli-born and London-based, has always been both a step ahead of and a step behind the rest of the design world. He's driven by the way things are made rather than the way things look. This shows up in Lo-Rez not only in the fuzzy images but also in the fact that the high-tech surfaces have to be handmade  each fiber threaded into the grid by hand. In May, design enthusiasts will have the opportunity to judge the low-res effect for themselves, when Arad has his first major New York exhibition since 1987. Barry Friedman Ltd. has organized a two-part show: a retrospective uptown at its gallery (May 5-June 24) and downtown at Phillips, de Pury &amp; Company (May 2-June 10). Arad has also asked the British director Mike Figgis to create a film montage for the project that will appear on the Corian screens. Accompanying the show will be a deluxe monograph featuring essays on Arad by devotees like Issey Miyake, Jean Nouvel and Reed Krakoff, the executive creative director of Coach (which is a cosponsor of the book and the exhibition). Krakoff has collected Arad's designs for years and in fact works at an elegant Arad paper honeycomb and carbon-fiber desk. ''It is a piece of sculpture, but you can use it every day,'' Krakoff says. ''It is covered with stacks of paper, markers, things from my kids.'' Arad, 53, has come a long way from his ready-made-object beginnings in a Covent Garden warehouse. The earliest piece in the retrospective will be his 1981 Rover Chair: a leather seat from that popular British car, mounted between semicircular steel-pipe supports. Arad bought the seats from local junkyards, thinking they were better made than any chair he could devise. He sold the first examples to Jean Paul Gaultier, for $:99 each. Only a few of Arad's other pieces involve ready-made objects, including the just-the-way-it-sounds Concrete Stereo. He has also been inspired by classic, even fusty furniture shapes. His Victoria &amp; Albert Chair (2001) looks like a cozy Deco-inflected club chair, but it comes in patinated steel. (At the palmbeach3 fair in January, Friedman sold five at $18,500 each.) His Chair by Its Cover series surrounds iconic modern chairs with a stainless-steel cloak. For Arad it's about the process. As the British architecture critic Deyan Sudjic has written, ''Simple good taste . . . has become disturbingly empty.'' Arad's pieces are too aggressive, too funny, even too ugly to be simple. Says Arad, ''I tend to go for different adjectives, like interesting or boring.'' ''If something is interesting, that's enough for me.''</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE6DB163BF935A15752C0A9639C8B63&amp;ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT EARNINGS LOWER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER<date>Published: January 26, 2005</date><text>The DuPont Company, the chemical maker, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago when it posted a large tax gain, but it predicted earnings growth in 2005.

On the soccer field, another adviser cheers on her client's child. And on the beach, the financial adviser is right there with the vacationing couple, discussing retirement options. These are vignettes from an advertising campaign for Morgan Stanley, the investment firm. Its advisers are not really moving in on their clients' lives. But the campaign shows that Wall Street's top firms are hoping to build tight client relationships, especially in the new year. Advertisement With modest returns expected from stocks in 2005, brokerage houses, many of which are now part of larger, diversified companies, will be increasing efforts to get clients to trade stocks and make new investments, and also to sign up for financial advice, tax help and retail banking. "This whole concept of life planning is one that brokerages will use more and more," said Eric Lang, a securities industry specialist and portfolio manager at DuPont Capital Management. "It may not be profitable for them at all, but it keeps the clients there and it keeps them happy, and it's a very competitive environment for clients right now." Even if profits are minimal, these extra services will be critical because Wall Street's core business - transactions of stocks, bonds and other securities - is expected to slow in the new year. After high single-digit returns in 2004, earned only after months of volatile trading that perplexed and confused many people, individual investors are not expected to make major portfolio moves as they did in past years. When trading volume is down, so are profits at brokerages. And the same factors that push stocks up or down - economic data, earnings reports, brokerage ratings - can also affect the securities industry. "Our industry moves with the market," said Joseph Moglia, chief executive of the Ameritrade Holding Corporation. "Of course, if we do our jobs right, we can have a good year despite what the market does. Right now, our costs are nearly flat and our earnings are up tenfold over the past two and a half years, and that took place in a fairly difficult market environment." Yet with another difficult year expected, some analysts say that the securities industry - particularly the discount brokerage portion - is poised for a price war in an effort to lure investors and their transaction fees. In November, the discount brokerage arm of Charles Schwab cut its base fee to $19.95, from $29.95. E*Trade Financial's fee stands at $19.99, plus a $3 charge per trade, but if a customer makes 27 or more trades a quarter the fee is reduced to a flat $9.99 each. Ameritrade currently charges $10.99 a trade. "Pricing competition really only took somewhat of a hiatus over the last four years after a massive round of cuts" in fees "from the mid to late 1990's but has recently intensified," said Michael Hecht, research analyst with Banc of America Securities. Other brokerages, including Fidelity and TD Waterhouse, have been courting retail investors alongside their usual high-end clients, he said. Wooing investors with life planning or investment packages could be perilous if firms are not mindful of regulations. The newly revamped enforcement arm of the New York Stock Exchange showed in October that it intended to be aggressive, levying a $19 million fine against Morgan Stanley for failing to send out prospectuses to potential investors and for other violations. "Companies have been good at identifying new opportunities, and they're good at fighting fires should problems come up," said Richard G. Ketchum, the chief regulatory officer for the exchange. "But they're only beginning to realize that a strong compliance system is just as critical to success." And the exchange, along with NASD and the Securities and Exchange Commission, is willing to remind Wall Street firms of their obligations. The fear of increased fines is one thing, but regulators are also looking at barring companies from entire lines of business - such as preventing them from signing up new clients or from underwriting stock offerings - for anywhere from a month to several months. "Certainly, companies will be spending more time and money this year on regulatory matters," said Mr. Lang of DuPont Capital Management. "The industry is enjoying new freedoms, but they have new regulations to contend with, and they have to make sure they're following the rules."</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0DF1739F93AA15751C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT TO BUY STAKE IN GERMAN MAKER OF SECURITY LABELS<date>Published: December 29, 2004</date><text>The DuPont Company agreed yesterday to buy a stake in a unit of November A.G., a German maker of genetically coded product labels.

The ruling, by Judge John E. Sprizzo of Federal District Court in Manhattan, came in response to suits originally brought in 2002 by three separate groups of plaintiffs in eight different federal courts across the country. They argued that the corporations, most of which are American, violated international law by actively helping to support the apartheid system. They tried to sue the corporations - Citigroup, General Electric, E.I. DuPont de Nemours, I.B.M., General Motors, Shell Oil and ExxonMobil, among others - under the Alien Tort Claims Act, which was passed in 1789 to protect American ships from pirates and American diplomats from attack when they were overseas. During the past two decades, some federal courts in the United States have agreed that they have jurisdiction in human rights suits under the act when the allegations involved egregious violations of international law like torture or genocide by foreign governments or their leaders. But Judge Sprizzo found that his court did not have jurisdiction under the act. "In a world where many countries may fall considerably short of ideal economic, political and social conditions, this court must be extremely cautious in permitting suits here based upon a corporation's doing business in countries with less than stellar human rights records," Judge Sprizzo wrote, warning that such suits could have "significant, if not disastrous, effects on international commerce." But Judge Sprizzo said he was adhering to a ruling by the Supreme Court in March, which determined that the alien tort act could be applied only in a narrow set of international law violations not too different from the ones named by the 18th century lawmakers who wrote it.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905E4D9153DF934A15753C1A9629C8B63&amp;ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT POSTS A PROFIT, AIDED BY ASIAN DEMAND<date>Published: October 27, 2004</date><text>The DuPont Company, the chemical maker, said yesterday that it had net income of $331 million in the third quarter on surging demand in the Asia-Pacific region and higher prices for its products.

The settlement, which is subject to approval from a circuit court judge, would include cash payments and other expenditures valued at $85 million as well as $22.6 million in legal fees and as much as $235 million for a medical monitoring program if an independent panel finds a link between the chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and human health. Advertisement "After two years of discussions, we are pleased to reach an agreement that places our combined priorities where they belong - on the community and not on lengthy and contentious legal proceedings," Stacey J. Mobley, general counsel for DuPont, said in a statement, adding that the settlement implied no admission of liability by DuPont. But Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, an organization that has focused on what it says are the adverse affects of chemicals used in making Teflon and a critic of DuPont, contended that thee company would not have settled "if officials didn't think they were guilty of polluting local tap water and the people themselves." The settlement grew out of a 2001 lawsuit against DuPont filed on behalf of people living in or near Parkersburg, W.Va., where DuPont has been making Teflon for 50 years. The suit accused the company of knowingly contaminating the land, air and water around the plant and said that excessive amounts of PFOA had been found in drinking water. The company responded by saying neither PFOA nor Teflon posed any health risks to human beings. In addition to the financial terms of the settlement, DuPont has agreed to provide six water districts in the Parkersburg area with water-treatment equipment to reduce the amount of PFOA to levels prescribed by the water districts. Also, the company has agreed to create a panel that will study any potential link between PFOA and human illness. Under the settlement, DuPont would be relieved of financial burdens for personal injury claims and for water-treatment technologies if no link is found. DuPont, meanwhile, faces other legal challenges to its Teflon-making operation. In July, in response to a complaint by the Environmental Working Group, the federal Environmental Protection Agency cited the company for two violations of the Toxic Substances Control Act and one violation of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The company, which is contesting the E.P.A. charges, is facing fines of $25,000 a day for violations before Jan. 30, 1997, and up to $27,500 a day for violations occurring after that date.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/08/business/dupont-now-in-the-frying-pan.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">DuPont, Now in the Frying Pan<date>Published: August 08, 2004</date><text>TEFLON has been hugely successful for DuPont, which over the last half-century has made the material almost ubiquitous, putting it not just on frying pans but also on carpets, fast-food packaging, clothing, eyeglasses and electrical wires -- even the fabric roofs covering football stadiums.Now DuPont has to worry that Teflon and the materials used to make it have perhaps become a bit too ubiquitous. Teflon constituents have found their way into rivers, soil, wild animals and humans, the company, government environmental officials and others say. Evidence suggests that some of the materials, known to cause cancer and other problems in animals, may be making people sick.While it remains one of DuPont's most valuable assets, Teflon has also become a potentially huge liability. The Environmental Protection Agency filed a complaint last month charging the company with withholding evidence of its own health and environmental concerns about an important chemical used to manufacture Teflon. That would be a violation of federal environmental law, compounded by the possibility that DuPont covered up the evidence for two decades.DuPont contends that it met its legal reporting obligations, and said that it plans to file a formal response this week.If an E.P.A. administrative judge does not agree, the agency could fine the company up to $25,000 a day from the time DuPont learned of potential problems with the chemical two decades ago until Jan. 30, 1997, when the agency's fines were raised, and $27,500 a day since then. The total penalty could reach $300 million. The agency is also investigating whether the suspect chemical, a detergentlike substance called perfluorooctanoic acid, is harmful to human health, and how it has become so pervasive in the environment. The chemical -- which is more commonly known as PFOA or C-8, for the number of carbon atoms in its molecular structure -- has turned up in the blood of more than 90 percent of Americans, according to samples taken from blood banks by the 3M Company beginning in the mid-90's. Until it got out of the business in 2000, 3M was the biggest supplier of PFOA. DuPont promptly announced it would begin making the substance itself.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/28/business/company-news-dupont-raises-full-year-outlook-despite-loss-in-quarter.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT RAISES FULL-YEAR OUTLOOK DESPITE LOSS IN QUARTER<date>Published: July 28, 2004</date><text>The DuPont Company said quarterly profit fell as a result of larger-than-expected charges for job cuts and the sale of its textiles business. But overall sales increased and the company raised its full-year earnings outlook. DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., posted second-quarter net income of $503 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with $675 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2 percent to $7.5 billion. DuPont's second-quarter charges mainly covered severance costs for the elimination of about 2,700 jobs in North America and Europe, part of a $900 million cost-cutting program announced in late 2003. DuPont raised its 2004 earnings forecast to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 a share, from a prior range of $2.10 to $2.30; its stock rose 41 cents, to $42.31 a share.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/09/us/epa-says-it-will-fine-dupont-for-holding-back-test-results.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">E.P.A. Says It Will Fine DuPont For Holding Back Test Results<date>Published: July 09, 2004</date><text>The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it would fine the DuPont chemical company for failing to report test results on a chemical related to the manufacturing of Teflon.DuPont conducted tests that showed that the chemical, known as C-8, was transmitted from a pregnant DuPont worker to her fetus and that traces of it were found in public drinking water in communities near DuPont facilities, but the company did not reveal that it had done the tests, the agency said.Congress cannot mandate such testing by a chemical company, but if testing is conducted, the results must be made public, according to the Toxic Substance Control Act.The E.P.A. also found DuPont in violation for failing to provide all of the toxicological data it had gathered on the chemical after a 1997 request from the agency.DuPont said it would contest the fines. ''We believe that we have complied with the guidelines and the reporting requirements,'' R. Clifton Webb, a company spokesman, said.A spokesman for the E.P.A. said the agency would impose a multi-million dollar fine, but he declined to be more specific.It is unclear whether C-8, or perfluorooctanoic acid, is harmful to humans. In one study, researchers concluded that it caused developmental defects in rats, but the results could not be replicated.In 1981, DuPont had results of blood tests conducted on pregnant workers, which showed that C-8 had been transmitted from a worker to her developing fetus, the E.P.A. said. The child appeared to be normal at birth, but the agency's complaint does not say if the child was monitored thereafter.In 1991, the agency said, DuPont compiled evidence that C-8 levels in drinking water in communities along the Ohio River, near the company's plant in Washington, W.Va., exceeded an exposure level set by company's internal guidelines.In March 2001, a lawyer representing residents along the river in a class-action lawsuit against DuPont sent copies of the test results to the agency.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/01/business/company-news-dupont-says-it-bought-biosentry-s-animal-health-unit.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">COMPANY NEWS; DUPONT SAYS IT BOUGHT BIOSENTRY'S ANIMAL HEALTH UNIT<date>Published: July 01, 2004</date><text>The DuPont Company, the chemical maker, bought the animal health business of BioSentry Inc. to expand sales in the United States and Latin America.

Her family has endured it all, and even makes jokes about it.''My ex-husband used to say the kids would grow up short because of all the work they do over there,'' said Ms. Nunn, 31, standing on her front lawn about a quarter-mile from the plant. ''But a plan to ship more chemicals here and then put them into the water -- where we swim and Jet Ski -- is really frightening.''The plan is not official yet; DuPont is bidding on the contract to treat the wastewater and a decision will not come until sometime this summer. But in the meantime, Army and DuPont officials have begun preparing the public, in a series of meetings minimizing the risk to people and nature. Some residents and environmentalists have responded just as forcefully, saying the wastewater would deal yet another blow to South Jersey, which is already struggling with more than its fair share of environmental and chemical problems.On Capitol Hill, a prominent opponent of the plan is Representative Robert E. Andrews, who criticized it last week as ''irresponsible and not credible.''''This has never been done before,'' said Mr. Andrews, a Democrat, ''and I respectfully ask the Army and DuPont how they know this will be safe for people. To put these chemicals into the Delaware River, even after the decontamination process, is madness, because there are too many unanswered questions.''The decontamination itself is required, under a chemical weapon treaty mandating that all such weapon stockpiles be destroyed, according to Jeff Lindblad, a spokesman for the Army Chemical Management Agency. He said the VX, an amber-colored oil, would be decontaminated in Newport, Ind., where it has been stored since the 1960's.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/17/business/technology-seed-concerns-donate-data-on-corn-gene.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">TECHNOLOGY; Seed Concerns Donate Data On Corn Gene<date>Published: March 17, 2004</date><text>The nation's two leading seed companies have agreed to make a vast amount of information about corn genes available to government and academic scientists, an effort that the companies and outside scientists said could greatly accelerate improvement of one of the nation's most important crops.The move by the companies, Monsanto and the Pioneer Hi-Bred International unit of DuPont, is at least partly aimed at persuading the government to undertake what could be a complex and expensive project to determine the entire DNA sequence of corn, something that could aid in efforts to develop crops with higher yields, resistance to drought or other desirable traits.''The technology exists to sequence the corn genome very rapidly,'' Tom Adams, the director for genomic technology at Monsanto, said in a conference call on Monday when the data donation was announced. ''It really is a matter of lining up all the efforts together.''Ceres, a small plant biotechnology company in California that collaborates with Monsanto, also said on the conference call that it would make its information available. The donation of the data was arranged in part by the National Corn Growers Association, which is also pushing for a project to sequence the corn genome.Academic scientists welcomed the decision, saying that the amount of corn gene sequences that will be put into the public domain by the companies vastly exceeds the amount that is there now.''For the public sector it will be a very valuable asset,'' said Joachim Messing, a professor at Rutgers University who has been active in government-financed projects to determine corn genes. ''We have been trying to persuade the companies to do that and it has been very difficult in the past.''The change of heart by the companies could reflect changing priorities in the agricultural biotechnology industry. A few years ago the companies, commanding budgets that public-sector scientists envied, were far ahead in the search for genetic information on important crops. But in the last few years the government has been financing gene sequencing projects for crops, helping the public sector catch up.Much of the information the companies developed is about specific genes, and the companies are believed to have already filed for patents on some of the information they are now making publicly available.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/27/business/media-business-advertising-dish-protein-with-side-comedy-being-used-promote.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; A dish of protein with a side of comedy is being used to promote foods with a soy additive.<date>Published: February 27, 2004</date><text>O.K., your personal jury is still out on whether carbohydrates are good or bad, and whether high-fat diets are a road to slimness or coronaries. But one thing you still believe: protein is good.So, what do you do? Eat steak and eggs and pray you are right? Or, hedge your bets and go for soy?It is not hard to guess which choice the Solae Company, a big maker of soy additives based in St. Louis, wants you to make. The company, formed last year as a joint venture between DuPont and Bunge, is already racking up $1 billion in annual sales of Solae, its protein additive, to packaged foods companies, which use it to turn drinks and other products into high-protein foods.Now Solae is taking its message directly to the eaters and drinkers, in hopes of making the phrase ''Solae inside'' as much of a selling point for foods as ''Intel inside'' has become for computers.It is no easy task. ''We have to persuade people not only to look for the Solae mark on foods, but to think of it as meaning both great taste and a healthy source of protein,'' said John J. McNeil, creative director for the Solae account at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. ''And we have to do it in 15 seconds.''How? Make them laugh, Ogilvy decided. Thus was born ''Protein in Unexpected Places,'' a series of four 15-second commercials that play off classic blind taste tests. In each, a white-toqued chef and dark-suited host waylay unsuspecting people, blindfold them and subject them to the Solae Protein Quiz, a taste test between a well-known protein source and a food item enriched with Solae.In one spot, a 30-something fellow is fed a bite of suckling pig and a slurp of Snapple-a-Day beverage (containing Solae, naturally). Mirabile dictu -- he correctly identifies each but is surprised to learn both contain protein. His response: ''Cool!''

Corzine, complained earlier this month that the Army planned to bring partially treated VX gas to Pennsville Township in Salem County, near the Delaware Memorial Bridge, without notifying the public. In response, Army officials said last week they were planning to hold one public meeting and possibly two by Feb. 18.VX was manufactured for military use as a nerve agent and is considered among the deadliest of all chemicals, causing paralysis and death within minutes when it is in its active stage. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the federal government accelerated disposal of chemical warfare stockpiles to prevent them from becoming targets.The DuPont Company, which is expected to get the contract to neutralize the VX, is conducting a ''treatability'' study to determine whether it can be safely disposed of in the Delaware. Officials said they hoped to have the results of that study in time for the public meetings.Environmentalists and elected officials have objected to the ways the project was proceeding. ''There's been a real lack of information here,'' said Maya Van Rossum of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, an environmental group. ''What in fact are they going to be doing? What are the possible threats to the river and to people? It's not DuPont's river. It's not the Army's river. It's our river. It's nature's river.''Army officials said they followed requirements about public notification by placing an advertisement in Today's Sunbeam, a Salem County newspaper, and posting information at a public library in Pennsville Township, where the DuPont Chambers Works, the plant that would handle the treated nerve agent, is situated. Residents and elected officials say the first they heard of the Army's project was in news articles in local newspapers, when it was almost too late to meet the Army's deadline for public comment.After their complaints, Army officials decided to extend the period for public comment by 60 days and to hold informational meetings by Feb. 18, said Col. Jesse Barber, the projects manager for alternative technology for the Army, who is in charge of getting rid of the stockpile of the VX nerve agent.Correction: January 29, 2004, Thursday Because of an editing error, an article and a picture caption on Tuesday about the Army's proposal to dispose of the nerve agent VX misidentified the substance that the DuPont Company would treat in southern New Jersey under an Army contract. It is hydrolysate, a nonlethal byproduct that will result when VX is neutralized at a depot in Indiana -- not the nerve agent itself.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/16/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-jersey-carneys-point-questions-on-nerve-agent.html?ref=dupontdenemoursandcompanyei">Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Carneys Point: Questions On Nerve Agent<date>Published: January 16, 2004</date><text>Several top New Jersey officials want the public to have more say on a plan by the Army to discharge the neutralized residue of a deadly cold-war-era nerve agent into the Delaware River.
