Developed by Disney Theatrical Productions from Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson’s popular children’s novel of 2004, “Peter and the Starcatcher” had a critically acclaimed run at New York Theater Workshop last spring, starring Christian Borle (“Legally Blonde”) as the pirate Black Stache (who will go on to become Captain Hook) and Adam Chanler-Berat (now starring in the Off Broadway revival of “Rent”) as Peter. No casting has been set for the Broadway run but executives involved with the production said they believe that Mr. Chanler-Berat, at least, is likely to return as Peter (“Rent” opened in August). Mr. Borle is a star of the much-anticipated new NBC series “Smash,” a fictionalized backstage look at the creation of a Broadway musical that begins airing in February 2012, so his availability next spring is unclear. Adapted by Rick Elice (“The Addams Family,” “Jersey Boys”), “Peter and the Starcatcher” will include the same creative team as the New York Theater Workshop production, with Roger Rees (now starring in “The Addams Family”) and Alex Timbers (“Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson”) directing. Broadway concluded last season with the opening of several widely praised new American plays, including “Good People,” “The _________ With the Hat” and “Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo,” while the British imports “Jerusalem” and “War Horse” provided additional attractive options to play-goers. For the 2011-12 Broadway season “Peter and the Starcatcher” is set to join new American works including David Henry Hwang’s “Chinglish,” Jon Robin Baitz’s “Other Desert Cities,” the one-act plays “Relatively Speaking,” David Auburn’s “The Columnist,” Katori Hall’s “The Mountaintop,” Lydia R. Diamond’s “Stick Fly” and David Ives’s “Venus in Fur.” The 2011 winner of the Pulitzer Prize in drama, “Clybourne Park” by Bruce Norris, is also being eyed for a Broadway run in the spring, as is Lisa D’Amour’s “Detroit” (which ran at Steppenwolf Theater Company last year). “Peter and the Starcatcher” will be produced on Broadway by Nancy Nagel Gibbs, Greg Schaffert (“Burn the Floor”), and Disney Theatrical Productions.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/15/business/media/disney-returns-to-the-original-winnie-the-pooh.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Returns to the Original Winnie the Pooh<date>Published: July 14, 2011</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Hollywood’s formula for freshening up old cartoon characters like Alvin and the Chipmunks and the Smurfs goes something like this: Reformulate them in 3-D, give them a skateboard and sunglasses, add some dance moves and inundate children and their nostalgic parents with advertising.And it has worked with one very notable exception. Winnie the Pooh. In 2007, the Walt Disney Company followed the blueprint, abandoning the character’s gentle hand-drawn look in favor of slick Pixar-style animation. Pooh got a scooter and a superhero outfit. Christopher Robin was jettisoned in favor of a 6-year-old tomboy named Darby. As it turned out, nobody wanted to see Eeyore breakdance. So Disney is re-introducing the classic Pooh characters across its empire, most notably in a new movie that arrives in theaters on Friday. It is a bid to capture a generation more accustomed to the special effects wizardry of Harry Potter, the smart-alecky knowingness of “Kung Fu Panda” and the fast pace of “Cars 2.” Because the bear with the rumbly tummy has traditionally been one of the first characters parents introduce to their children, Disney is reverting to what it does best — pushing the nostalgia button. In a nod to the character’s 1966 big-screen debut in “Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree,” the new movie, titled simply “Winnie the Pooh,” begins with a live-action sequence in Christopher Robin’s room and then becomes animated once the camera dives into a storybook, returning the characters to their old-fashioned, slower, water-colored roots. “We are constantly trying to evolve our characters, but in this case we want to get away from trying to make Winnie the Pooh in any way modern,” said Mary Beech, a Disney vice president and steward of the Pooh brand. The stakes are high for Disney. Global sales of Pooh merchandise — books, plush toys, T-shirts, potty chairs — have fallen 12 percent over the last five years, but still account for a staggering $5.5 billion. Branding experts say aging character franchises are among the most difficult to keep alive because they require continually walking a tightrope. “With Winnie the Pooh, Disney is going to continue to struggle with the tension of remaining relevant to kids versus maintaining a love-mark brand that parents trust,” said Matt Britton, a founder of Mr. Youth, a New York marketing firm. Pooh, which remains Disney’s second best-selling character after Mickey Mouse, is a vital cog in Disney’s ambition to move deeper into entertainment for preschoolers and merchandise for infants. But the company says internal research indicates that Pooh is also the No. 1 character that women want on clothing and accessories for themselves. As a result, Disney has been pursuing higher-end Pooh products, particularly in overseas markets, which represent 79 percent of the franchise’s annual retail sales. Designers in Japan, for instance, have licensed the character for $700 dresses and $400 bags; limited-edition plush toys run $299. Retro may be the rallying cry for the revitalization effort, but Disney executives emphasize that the execution has modern touches. For instance, a revamped Facebook page dedicated to the character has over 2.2 million followers, and a Pooh iPad and iPhone app called Puzzle Book is a hit. A few months ago, a Hundred Acre Wood-themed ride at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., was outfitted with oversize video touch screens; children can write on them by smearing virtual dripping honey. Still, the most visible of Disney’s efforts are notably yesteryear. Disney Channel in September will introduce “The Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,” a series made up of clips from “Honey Tree” and other old movies. (Disney Channel has canceled “My Friends Tigger and Pooh,” the ill-fated effort featuring Darby.) Stephen J. Anderson and Don Hall, the directors of the new movie, said they labored to distill the characters to what made them superstars in the first place. “A touch of cynicism is certainly prominent in movies today, and we were adamant that absolutely none of that could creep in,” said Mr. Anderson. Mr. Hall added, “People want these characters to be who they are and not grow and change, which is a real difference.” Pooh and his pals, created in 1926 by the British author A. A. Milne, also interact with letters and punctuation marks on the pages as the film progresses, another nostalgic touch. The movie, based on three of Milne’s original stories, follows the friends as they find Eeyore a new tail and fret about Christopher Robin, who they fear has been captured by a monster called a Backson. (In reality, Owl just misread a note reading, “Back soon.”) To recreate the old look, Mr. Hall and Mr. Anderson studied original illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard in the collection of Britain’s Victoria and Albert Museum. They also collaborated with Burny Mattinson, a veteran of the Walt Disney Animation Studios who was an assistant on “Honey Tree” and oversaw subsequent Pooh cartoons. Disney’s renewed focus on Pooh comes as the company has been freed from decades of legal entanglements related to the character. Milne sold the merchandising rights to Stephen Slesinger, a licensing entrepreneur, in 1930; Disney acquired those rights in 1961. But the Slesinger heirs sued Disney in 1991 over what they saw as inadequate royalty payments. Disney fought back, and the feuding continued until last year, when the media company emerged victorious. At a time when first graders watch Disney’s PG-13-rated “Pirates of the Caribbean” movies, will simplicity sell? The answer may not come on opening weekend. Disney is risking box-office suicide by releasing “Winnie the Pooh” against the final Harry Potter installment. But Disney’s film was cheap by Hollywood standards — about $30 million — and the company is not aiming for a Pixar-level blockbuster. “It sounds crazy, but as a G-rated film you can do a lot more matinee business in the summer,” Mr. Hall said. “And this is not just about making a successful movie.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/business/media/08disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney to Open Park in Shanghai<date>Published: April 7, 2011</date><text>SHANGHAI — The Walt Disney Company placed a huge bet on China’s shifting approach to Westernized entertainment on Friday as it broke ground here on a $4.4 billion theme park and resort — even if it is one without classic American features like a Main Street.Disney hopes the Shanghai Disney Resort will be as transformative for the company as the establishment of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., was in the 1970s. It wants to create an engine that will drive demand among China’s 1.3 billion residents for other products, like Pixar films and princess dolls. Like many global companies, Disney is putting its faith in the rise of the Chinese consumer, and at the same time it is counting on Shanghai’s specific ambitions to become a world-class city. There will be obstacles. Disney’s first foray into China — its theme park in Hong Kong — got off to a slow start after opening in 2005. It may be a small world, but cultural miscues, including a failure to understand how guests would use the park on holidays like Chinese New Year, resulted in angry customers and damaging media coverage. The Disney brand is also not as deeply ingrained in China as in other parts of the world. China is the only major country that does not have a Disney Channel, the company’s typical way of building its brand and stoking demand for its experiences and products. Even the concept of brand is a tough sell in China, where cheap knockoffs proliferate overnight. The Shanghai resort’s first phase — one of the largest foreign investments in China ever — will include a 225-acre Magic Kingdom-style park with a castle surrounded by themed areas. The park component alone will cost $3.7 billion. There will also be two hotels, a lake and a shopping district, bringing the total size of the first phase to about 963 acres. Disney hopes to have the complex open by the end of 2015, an ambitious time line. This resort has long been expected, but until now plans have been largely secret. They call for its eventually stretching across 1,730 acres in the Pudong district southeast of downtown. The Chinese media have estimated that the full resort, including upgrades to transportation infrastructure in the area, could cost about $15 billion. A resort of this scale would have a capacity like that of Disney World, which attracts about 45 million visitors a year. In acres, the Chinese resort will be vastly larger than Hong Kong Disneyland. Notably, Disney did not identify which of its classic rides — Space Mountain, It’s a Small World, Pirates of the Caribbean — it will bring to the Chinese mainland. One reason may be those knockoffs: When Disney unveiled detailed plans for Hong Kong Disneyland, rival parks in Asia quickly installed cheaper rides with striking similarities. Disney is also walking a careful line with the Chinese government, which approved the park, after two decades of off-again, on-again talks, on the condition that it would be sharply different from the original Disneyland, which has become a symbol of American culture. Disney agreed to heavily incorporate Chinese culture; dressing Mickey Mouse in a kung fu robe would not do. “Authentically Disney but distinctly Chinese” is how Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, described the resort in an interview. “There will certainly be familiar Disney elements, but it will also be quite different from the moment that you walk through the gates,” he said. Shanghai’s Disneyland, for instance, will not feature a Main Street-theme entrance, a staple of every other Disney resort. (The Main Street areas are designed to reflect Walt Disney’s idyllic childhood in a Missouri town at the turn of the 20th century.) Instead, guests will enter through a lush 11-acre area featuring water and trees, where they will be greeted by costumed characters, Mr. Iger said. The castle will be Disney’s biggest. Disney will shoulder about 43 percent of the initial cost, and its partner, Shanghai Shendi Group, a consortium of state-owned companies, will cover the balance. That split mirrors the resort’s ownership structure. But Disney will have operational control, holding a 70 percent stake in a management company created with Shendi to run the resort. 1 2 Next Page » David Barboza reported from Shanghai and Brooks Barnes from Los Angeles.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/not-disneyfied-enough-mickey-mouses-cruises-are-coming/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Not Disneyfied Enough? Mickey Mouse's Cruises Are Coming<date>April 6, 2011, 4:51 pm</date><text>Julienne Schaer/NYC &amp; Company Wednesday’s announcement was attended by Karl Holz, left, the Disney Cruise Line president; George Fertitta, the NYC &amp; Company chief executive; Seth W. Pinsky, right, the city’s Economic Development Corporation president; and Mickey Mouse, in cruise director attire. Visitors who do not believe the Times Square area has been Disneyfied enough will soon be able to put on their mouse ears, head a few blocks west and board a Disney Cruise Line ship to a Disney island. With Mickey Mouse in tow, city officials announced on Wednesday that, starting in May 2012, the Disney Magic will sail 20 times a year from the Manhattan Cruise Terminal on the West Side. Eight of the cruises will be eight-night trips to the Bahamas, including a day at Castaway Cay, an island controlled by Disney. Nine will be five-night trips along the New England coast to Canada. The other three will be weekends at sea. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been pressing the city’s tourism and economic development officials to find ways to bring more visitors to and through the city. The city’s Economic Development Corporation, which manages the cruise terminals in Manhattan and Brooklyn, estimated that cruise passengers spent about $145 million in the city last year. Disney Cruise Line would be the sixth big cruise operator to make regular calls in New York, joining Carnival, Cunard, Holland America, Norwegian and Princess. “The addition of Disney solidifies New York City’s place as one of the top cruise destinations in the world and will further increase the local economic impact of this important industry,” said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the development corporation. At 964 feet, the Disney Magic is longer than the retired aircraft carrier that houses the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum, which is docked at a pier adjacent to the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. The Disney ship, which has 10 decks, can carry 2,700 passengers and 950 of what Disney calls “cast and crew members.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/business/media/21adnewsletter1.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Will Mickey Mouse Wear a Milk Mustache?<date>Published: March 21, 2011</date><text>The Disney Channel is answering yes to the question “Got milk?”The Disney Channel cable channel is among the media properties owned by the Walt Disney Company that are carrying a campaign for a product sold by Horizon Organic called Horizon Organic Milk Plus DHA Omega-3. Other Disney properties running the ads include Radio Disney, Disney FamilyFun magazine, disney.com, kaboose.com, disneyfamily.com and familyfun.com. The campaign is the result of an agreement between the Disney media sales and marketing division and the media agency for Horizon Organic, which is Horizon Media in New York. Indeed, Horizon Media works for Horizon Organic, in a coincidence that may be unmatched on Madison Avenue — at least since the last time that KSL Media bought commercial time on the Salt Lake City television station known as KSL. After all, when the MEC media agency owned by WPP was known as Mediaedge:cia, the Central Intelligence Agency did not show up on its client roster. Nor does Universal McCann handle media for Universal Pictures. “When we were originally pitching the business,” Lori Wigler, brand group director at Horizon Media, says, laughing, Bill Koenigsberg, the president and chief executive of the agency, told the Horizon Organic executives that “‘we were the only agency to change our name for you.’ ” Horizon Media has been the media agency for Horizon Organic, which is part of the WhiteWave Foods Company division of Dean Foods, since 2009. The creative agency for Horizon Organic is Leo Burnett in Chicago, part of the Publicis Groupe. Burnett worked with the Disney media sales and marketing division to create a commercial for Horizon Organic Milk Plus DHA Omega-3 that is running on the Disney Channel. The commercial adheres to the policies of the Disney Channel regarding advertising messages; it lasts only 15 seconds and it ends with an announcer declaring that the Horizon Organic product is a “proud sponsor of Disney Channel.” Under that sponsorship model, the Disney Channel limits commercials to a maximum of two an hour. Other marketers that are Disney Channel sponsors include Hasbro and Nissan. Horizon Organic is the first maker of organic products to become a Disney Channel sponsor. The campaign also represents the first national television advertising for Horizon Organic, a brand that has primarily concentrated its marketing spending in the print media. The Disney media deal has “allowed us to reach into TV, radio, social media and print, across all those channels,” says Dustin Finkel, brand manager for Horizon Organic in Broomfield, Colo. “And the demographics between Horizon and Disney are a great match,” he adds, in that “our target audience is moms looking for better products for their kids and families.” “As the leading organic dairy brand, we were looking for ways to increase awareness and increase penetration,” Mr. Finkel says, which is another reason the Disney media agreement was so appealing. Brands against which Horizon Organic milk products compete include Organic Valley and Stonyfield Organic. And retail chains like Whole Foods Market also sell their own private-label organic milk. “The organic dairy industry had grown by double digits for many, many years,” says Mike Ferry, president of Horizon Organic, “until the recession hit.” That is not surprising because organic milk and other organic dairy products cost more than their conventional counterparts. In 2009, sales volume for organic dairy items “was essentially flat” compared with the year before, Mr. Ferry says, but in 2010 “it returned to growth, and grew faster and faster as the year went on, back to double-digit growth.” “And Horizon Organic was growing 5 to 7 points faster than the category,” he adds. Through the first two months of this year, “we have not seen any lessening of that rapid growth rate,” Mr. Ferry says. “The category continues to grow in low double digits,” he adds, “and Horizon Organic is growing five to six points faster than the category.” The company’s milk variety that is fortified with DHA omega-3 is “one of our key growth products in our portfolio,” Mr. Ferry says. It is aimed at families because DHA omega-3 is described as helping support brain development, which “is important for growing children,” he adds. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/the-risks-id-cards-may-carry/?ref=disneywaltcompany">The Risks ID Cards May Carry<date>March 22, 2011, 1:22 pm</date><text>Just about everyone who works in an office or retail outlet these days has some sort of identification tag dangling from a lanyard around their neck. But besides your name and photograph, what else is lurking on that laminated card? In some cases, it may have bar codes with your Social Security number — and that’s a potential problem, given that new smartphones, with the right apps, can serve as bar code readers. Several employees of Disneyland Resort in California recently sued the Walt Disney Company, claiming that the company was violating California law because the tags they used to clock in and out and to get employee discounts included bar codes with their Social Security numbers. They contend that puts them at risk for identity theft. The suit, which seeks class-action status, asks for redress, like credit monitoring, and seeks unspecified damages. It doesn’t allege any identity theft has actually occurred. The filing was first reported by The Orange County Register. A Disney Resort spokeswoman, Suzi Brown, said in an interview that the company disagreed with the legal premise of the lawsuit. The company, she said, takes seriously the protection of employees’ personal information. She added that the company had communicated with its “cast members” — its term for employees — about how to protect their ID cards as they would their own credit cards or A.T.M. cards. It has also changed its practices so that employees no longer need to “lose sight” of their cards when, for example, obtaining a discount. She said work was also under way on modifying the company’s computer systems “ to address ever-changing technologies, such as third-party smartphone apps.” Regardless of the suit’s outcome, Social Security numbers on any sort of card — whether it’s read visually or only with an electronic scanning device — is a bad idea, identity theft experts say. “It’s not a smart practice,” said Adam Levin, chairman and founder of the consulting firm Identity Theft 911. Such cards can be lost or stolen, like any other card, and new technology may mean that bar codes do not provide the protection they may have previously. Mr. Levin, a former director of the New Jersey consumer affairs division, said that the Social Security number could be combined with other data — like a birth date or address — to create “synthetic” identities that could then be used, for example, to obtain credit. For that reason, most states have stopped using Social Security numbers as driver’s license numbers, and health insurers are moving away from using them on benefit identification cards. To protect yourself, he said, you should ask your employer — or, your college or university, if you’re a student — what information is included on any ID card, and request that it use a “unique identifier” instead of your Social Security number. “The ultimate guardian is the consumer,” he said. “You’ve got to be alert and ask those questions.” Have you had a problem with your ID card? Do you have advice to other cardholders?</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/business/media/15mars.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">‘Mars Needs Moms’ Flops, and Some Blame 3-D Prices<date>Published: March 14, 2011</date><text>LOS ANGELES — In the movie business, sometimes a flop is just a flop. Then there are misses so disastrous that they send signals to broad swaths of Hollywood. “Mars Needs Moms” is shaping up as the second type.Walt Disney Studios spent an estimated $175 million to make and market “Mars Needs Moms,” which sold $6.9 million in tickets at North American theaters in its opening weekend. That grim result puts the 3-D animated adventure on track to become one of the biggest box-office bombs in movie history, on par with such washouts as “The Adventures of Pluto Nash,” “Cutthroat Island” and “The Alamo.” “Scary” is how Chuck Viane, president of distribution for Walt Disney Studios, described the audience rejection of the film. “Was it the idea? The execution? The timing? There are a lot of excuses being floated.” The financial impact on Disney’s studio will be severe. The company has already taken a write-down of about $100 million related to the film and the closing of ImageMovers Digital, a motion-capture animation division run by Robert Zemeckis, who helped produce “Mars Needs Moms.” Tens of millions more in losses are expected, pending worldwide box-office results. The film opened in 14 overseas territories, representing 25 percent of the international market, and attracted $2.1 million. Mr. Zemeckis, whose directing credits include seminal hits like “Back to the Future” and “Forrest Gump,” was unavailable to comment on Monday, a spokeswoman said. “Mars Needs Moms” also signals broader movie business problems. Computer animation has been Hollywood’s most reliable moneymaker over the last decade — so much so that nearly every studio, including Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures, has ramped up production of such films. As the first big-budget computer animated movie to flop, “Mars Needs Moms” tells some film executives that the market is becoming saturated. “Mars Needs Moms,” about a 9-year-old boy whose mother is abducted by Martians, followed quickly on the heels of “Gnomeo &amp; Juliet” and “Rango.” “Hop” will arrive on April 1; “Rio” arrives two weeks later. Close behind are “Kung Fu Panda 2” and “Cars 2.” “There’s only so much room in the market for family films,” said Phil Contrino, editor of BoxOffice.com. Movie executives also suggest that “Mars Needs Moms” can be seen as a consumer referendum on 3-D ticket pricing for children. While child tickets to traditional screenings run about $8.75 in large cities like New York and Los Angeles, child admission for 3-D screenings is $13. Imax charges $15.50 for children. Box-office analysts have been increasingly concerned that consumers in general and parents in particular are starting to rebel. “We believe exhibitors’ core strategy of raising ticket prices through 3-D premiums” is a “dangerous strategy,” Richard Greenfield, an analyst at the financial services company BTIG, wrote last Tuesday. It is quite rare for a Disney release to flop as badly as “Mars Needs Moms,” which is based on an illustrated book by Berkeley Breathed, best known for the comic strip “Bloom County.” Part of the problem may have been the story. What child wants to see a movie about his mom being taken away from him? But studio executives also pointed to the style of animation as a culprit. “Mars Needs Moms” may lead to the end for the Zemeckis style of motion-capture filmmaking, which has proven increasingly unpopular with audiences. Unlike the digital animation used by Pixar, in which movies are created entirely by computer, the Zemeckis technique requires actors to perform on bare sets while wearing uniforms outfitted with sensors to record their movements. Those movements are then transferred into a digital model that computer animators use to create a movie. Critics and audiences alike, with audiences voicing their opinions on Twitter, blogs and other social media, complained that the Zemeckis technique can result in character facial expressions that look unnatural. Another common criticism is that Mr. Zemeckis focuses so much on technological wizardry that he neglects storytelling. Despite his pioneering work with the technology, Mr. Zemeckis was leapfrogged by James Cameron and his megahit “Avatar.” Mr. Zemeckis’s previous motion-capture film, “A Christmas Carol,” released in December 2009, was a commercial disappointment and contributed to the ouster of Dick Cook, the Disney executive responsible for putting “Mars Needs Moms” into production and bringing Mr. Zemeckis into the Disney tent. Disney closed ImageMovers Digital last March after Mr. Cook’s successor, Rich Ross, viewed footage of “Mars Needs Moms.” About two months ago, Disney quietly pulled the plug on what was to be Mr. Zemeckis’s next directing project there: : “Yellow Submarine,” a 3-D adaptation of the 1968 Beatles cartoon. The company decided to proceed with “Mars Needs Moms” in part because it had already spent so much on it and in part because some executives, notably ones left from the Cook era, acted as cheerleaders for the project. The next big test for motion-capture filmmaking will come in December, when Steven Spielberg uses the technology in his big-budget “Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn.” Meanwhile, Mr. Cameron is working on two “Avatar” sequels.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/business/media/07disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">ABC Family Finds Formula in Spinning New Scripted Dramas<date>Published: March 6, 2011</date><text>BURBANK, Calif. — If Michael G. Riley, the new president of ABC Family, comes across as a bit nervous these days, cut him some slack. Only seven months ago he was working in radio. Now he’s about to lead a major expansion of one of television’s hottest brands.ABC Family, the Walt Disney Company’s cable channel aimed at older teenagers and young adults, plans to announce on Monday that it will add a third night of original programming each week. The channel will also start introducing original series year-round; until now it has almost exclusively introduced new programs in June. To help stock its expanding schedule, ABC Family has ordered three new scripted dramas, including “The Nine Lives of Chloe King,” about a girl who discovers she has special powers and is being hunted by an assassin. (Dan Berendsen, the force behind “Hannah Montana: The Movie” and several hit Disney Channel movies, is an executive producer.) A fourth new show will be a half-hour comedy starring Raven-Symoné of “That’s So Raven” fame. “We now have some beachfront television property in shows like ‘Pretty Little Liars,’ but there is so much more opportunity,” Mr. Riley said. “I’m focused on one thing, which is how are we keeping our foot on the accelerator.” The recent success of ABC Family has been nothing short of stunning. When Disney bought the channel in 2001 for a hefty $5.3 billion from the News Corporation and the media investor Haim Saban, it planned to show reruns from its broadcast network, ABC. But ratings plummeted without fresh programming. The cable channel, founded as the Family Channel by the evangelist Pat Robertson, also had a contractual obligation to retain the world “family” in its name and run Mr. Robertson’s “700 Club” talk show in perpetuity — not exactly conducive to creating a hip teenage TV brand. Undeterred, Disney in 2004 hired Paul Lee, a former British Broadcasting Corporation executive, to run ABC Family, giving him marching orders to focus on the so-called millennial generation. Mr. Lee delivered a string of hits, including “The Secret Life of the American Teenager,” a drama that stirred controversy by concentrating on a pregnant 15 year old. With the arrival in 2010 of “Pretty Little Liars,” a mystery centered on four best friends that became an immediate ratings success, ABC Family became a bona fide smash itself. It is now one of cable’s top 10 networks among adults 18 to 49. ABC Family attracted an average of 580,000 viewers ages 12 to 34, its target demographic, in prime time 2010, a 49 percent increase from 2005. The channel’s primary competitor, the CW, has struggled to find new hits during this time — it passed on “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” — and is seeking a new president. “ABC Family has been riding a train of increasing success,” said Kris Magel, a senior vice president at Initiative, a media-buying agency. “Advertisers value this channel. It delivers all the buzz and great ratings, with limited controversy.” Mr. Riley, 41, took over ABC Family in September after Mr. Lee was promoted to run the entertainment division of ABC. Overflowing with boyish charm — that is, when not in the presence of two Disney public relations executives, as he was during a recent interview here — Mr. Riley had been running Radio Disney, a string of 37 stations, for two years. His hiring puzzled Hollywood — radio? — but Mr. Riley had previous television experience, albeit not on the creative side. From 1997 to 2008 he worked for Turner Broadcasting System in Europe, with responsibilities like drafting brand strategy for channels like Cartoon Network and TNT. Mr. Riley has an M.B.A. from the London Business School. Mr. Riley, who is Canadian, quickly impressed Disney executives by throwing himself into learning and running the radio operation even though he wasn’t overly excited by the medium. (When Rich Ross, now chairman of Walt Disney Studios, recruited him for the radio job, Mr. Riley made it clear he wanted a future in television.) His accomplishments at Radio Disney included expanding online efforts, integrating its programming more heavily with that of Disney Channel and greatly improving morale. “Michael has a great understanding of brands and their importance in an ever-fragmenting media landscape,” said Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney/ABC Television Group. Because of the long gestation period for television shows, Mr. Riley has only begun to make his presence felt at ABC Family; all of the new series, for instance, were already in development at the channel when he arrived. He also has a strong lieutenant in Kate Juergens, executive vice president for original series programming and development. But Mr. Riley was deeply involved with the casting and scheduling of the new shows and will start wooing advertisers this week in New York. In addition to “The Nine Lives of Chloe King,” the new dramas Mr. Riley will be promoting this week include “Switched at Birth,” the story of two teenage girls who were mixed up as newborns. “The Lying Game,” meantime, is a mystery about twin sisters. The goal for “The Great State of Georgia,” in which Raven-Symoné stars as an aspiring actress with a larger-than-life personality, is to create a comedy block on Wednesday nights. It will be paired with “Melissa &amp; Joey,” a successful returning series starring Melissa Joan Hart and Joey Lawrence. “We love the authenticity of all of these shows, all of which have our hallmarks of heart, humor and optimism,” Mr. Riley said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/27/nyregion/27musicct.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Kicking Daisies Is Disney Radio’s ‘Next Big Thing’<date>Published: February 25, 2011</date><text>FAIRFIELD, Conn.THE pop-rock quartet Kicking Daisies was at the Fairfield Theater in December, preparing for a sold-out show, when the call from Radio Disney came. The band’s drummer, Caitlin Kalafus, 18, couldn’t believe it. “It’s the biggest thing that ever happened to us,” she said during a backstage interview minutes after hanging up. “It’s huge. I was like, ‘Oh my God!’ ” Radio Disney, the tween-friendly syndicated radio station based in Burbank, Calif., had chosen the quartet from an annual nationwide talent search that trains a Disney-sized spotlight on an unsigned band: it had been named Radio Disney’s Next Big Thing. Kicking Daisies, which began in the Kalafus family’s basement in Milford in 2008, includes Caitlin’s singer-bassist sister, Carly, 15, with whom she writes songs; Duran Visek, 15, a singer and guitarist; and another guitarist, Ben Spremulli, 14. That the announcement came when the four of them were off the road and getting ready to play for local fans — the mobs of tweens and teens who circulated in the lobby before the show — supercharged the thrill. “We are, like, on top of the world,” Caitlin said. Had she been asked to sum up the band’s overall outlook a few hours earlier, though, she might have said the same thing. For a fledgling act that not many people over 18 have heard of — all four members are home-schooled high school students — Kicking Daisies has already amassed a hefty amount of bragging points. The group landed a spot in the Bamboozle Festival lineup in New Jersey last May and played the Gathering of the Vibes festival in Bridgeport in July. They released “K.D.: The E.P.” in November. The Next Big Thing designation from Disney led to a December concert within days of that phone call — for a crowd of 20,000 in Celebration, Fla., opening for the popster band Allstar Weekend. On New Year’s Eve, Kicking Daisies opened for Natasha Bedingfield and Leona Lewis at the Orange Drive Festival in Miami. They are currently in Los Angeles meeting with television executives about developing a reality show; this weekend a music-video-style commercial for a new candy, starring the band, will begin appearing on Cartoon Network, Disney XD and ABC Family. Much of the credit goes to Mike Mangini, of Fairfield, a two-time Grammy-winning producer who has worked with Joss Stone and the Jonas Brothers. Mr. Mangini helped form the band after meeting Ben Spremulli, of Bethel, at the Chef’s Table in Fairfield. Mr. Mangini said the owner of the restaurant, Richard Herzfeld, had called him up and said: “Hey, I know you’re this producer guy — there’s this 12-year-old kid who’s been playing guitar at my restaurant. He’s like the next Eddie Van Halen.” “A lot of people call me and tell me to check stuff out, and I don’t really follow up that much,” Mr. Mangini said. “But I stopped by. And he was incredible — this kid was shockingly good.” Mr. Herzfeld, of Fairfield, is now the band’s tour manager. “I’ve had a lot of bands play here through the years,” he said, “but no one ever moved me like this kid.” Mr. Mangini said that when Mr. Herzfeld asked him, “What do you do with a kid like this?” he told him, “Well, if you find four young kids with that kind of ability and put them together, it could be pretty amazing.” A search through YouTube for a singer turned up Duran Visek, who was then living in Cape Coral, Fla. Mr. Herzfeld urged Mr. Mangini to call Duran’s father. “I didn’t make a big push,” Mr. Mangini said. “I told his father: ‘Your son is very talented. If you feel like coming up to Connecticut, we’d love to try him out.’ ” Duran now lives in Fairfield with his father. “My dad has been incredibly supportive,” he said from the Fairfield Theater green room. “All our parents have.” That includes Chris and Lisa Kalafus, whose basement became the launching pad for the group after Mr. Herzfeld showed Mr. Mangini YouTube videos of Caitlin Kalafus behind a drum kit. In 2007, Caitlin, who has been playing since age 8, attended the annual National Association of Music Merchants show in Los Angeles; while there, she entered a drumming competition. The organization clocked her speed and later pronounced her the world’s fastest female drummer in terms of her footwork on the bass drum (another girl was timed as having the fastest hands). Caitlin was 14. “The record still holds,” she said. But even though she said she admired the technical prowess of artists like Neil Peart, the drummer for the rock group Rush, Kicking Daisies might be recognized less for its virtuosity than for its chemistry and energy. All the band members, including Carly Kalafus, who was recruited to round out the rhythm section — she had never played bass and was mostly interested in gymnastics prior to 2008 — cite the pop-punk band Paramore as a group they look up to. “They’re not just musically tight — they really connect with their fans when they’re onstage,” Duran said. “We learned that from them.” That lesson was in full effect as Kicking Daisies took the stage at the Fairfield Theater to screams and cheers. “They just have very good stage presence,” said Miriya Noel, 14, who traveled to the show from Brookfield. “Duran will take breaks where he talks to everybody. It’s cool how they manage that, and then they’re all so amazing musically.” Mr. Mangini, who has been producing music for 22 years, backed up that assessment: “These kids are unbelievably talented, and what they do musically is real,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why they can’t be as big or bigger than any artist I’ve worked with.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E7DF123DF936A25751C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">ARTS, BRIEFLY; Extra, Extra! Paper Mill Has 'Newsies'<date>Published: February 15, 2011</date><text>Stop the presses! Or should that be, restart the presses? Either way, ''Newsies,'' the misunderstood but much-loved Disney movie musical about the New York City newsboys who organize a labor strike in 1899, is getting a second edition. On Monday, the theater said that a stage version of ''Newsies'' would be the opening production at the 2011-12 season of the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J., and would feature music by Alan Menken (the film's original composer) and Jack Feldman (its original lyricist) as well as a new book by Harvey Fierstein. ''The truth is, things have a life of their own,'' a mildly stunned Mr. Menken said in a recent telephone interview. Mr. Menken, who also composed music for Disney blockbusters like ''The Little Mermaid,'' ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''Aladdin,'' is hardly unaware of the reception that greeted ''Newsies'' when it was released as a film in 1992. The movie, which starred an 18-year-old Christian Bale as a singing, dancing, paper-pushing urchin named Jack (Cowboy) Kelly and was directed by Kenny Ortega (the future director of the ''High School Musical'' franchise), was torn apart by critics and spiked by audiences, grossing less than $3 million on a budget of $15 million. Not that Mr. Menken felt burned at the time. ''I won three Academy Awards within the course of three years and one Razzie,'' he said. ''The Razzie was for 'Newsies.' '' But in the years that followed, ''Newsies'' sold surprisingly well on home video, and Mr. Menken continued to see it turn up in the lives of his children. ''I'd come to a mall, and there would be one of those areas where people perform,'' he said. ''They'd be doing 'Seize the Day,' I'd go, 'Look at that!' And then I'd find out, 'They're doing ''Newsies'' at my school.' I said: 'They are? How are they doing that?' '' More recently, Mr. Menken said he was contacted by his agent, who told him that Disney was preparing a version for the stage. Recalling the conversation with his agent, Mr. Menken said, ''He told me: 'You don't have to get involved. They'll take your songs, and someone else will come and write new ones. I just want to let you know.' I said, 'Oh, no. No, no, no. It's my baby, no.' 'Alan, there's not going to be any money.' 'I don't care. I don't care, this is my baby.' '' The Paper Mill Playhouse production, which will run from Sept. 15 to Oct. 16 and has not yet announced its cast, has ''latched onto exciting elements of what we had in the movie'' and is ''minimizing the things that were not so great about the movie,'' Mr. Menken said. The principal newsboys, Jack, David and Les, will remain the main characters, and a new female character -- who will serve as a love interest for Jack -- has been created for the stage show. ''Newsies'' die-hards will also be pleased to hear that the newsboy Crutchy -- so named for the crutch he walks on -- is staying in the story. (''Crutchy's a bigger character than he ever was,'' Mr. Menken said. ''Crutchy's very pivotal. Very pivotal.'') On the advice of his younger daughter, Mr. Menken said he had been trying to work a female newsgirl character into the lineup as well. ''My daughter went to a girl's camp where they did 'Newsies,' and they invented a character of Swifty for her to play,'' Mr. Menken said. ''She said, 'Dad, if you ever do ''Newsies'' on stage, you've got to let Swifty be in the show.' I'm still working on that one with Harvey.'' Though his daughters, now 22 and 25, are not officially on the payroll, Mr. Menken said their input had been crucial to the development of the ''Newsies'' musical, even when it was not asked for. ''They are more protective about 'Newsies' than all the other projects I've done, combined,'' Mr. Menken said. ''It is ridiculous. It's really ridiculous. When I told them about a certain song that got cut, they got viscerally angry at me. 'Oh no you don't. Oh no. No, Dad, no.' It's like they own it and I don't.'' Mr. Menken said he had frequently encountered similar reactions from fans in their teens and 20s. ''It's like 'Newsies' is actually owned by this generation of kids,'' he said. ''Of course, I'll be the one to collect the royalties, thank you very much.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/business/media/09disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Reports 54 Percent Rise in Profit<date>Published: February 8, 2011</date><text>LOS ANGELES — People are in the mood to spend on leisure time again, if Mickey Mouse is any guide.The Walt Disney Company said Tuesday that its theme park business returned to positive growth in the most recent quarter after declining for nine consecutive quarters. Operating income in the unit, watched closely as a barometer of the broader economy, increased 25 percent, to $468 million. With strong attendance, Disney’s parks division was able to restore prices for tickets and hotel rooms to near-normal levels. Over the last two years, Disney imposed a series of steep discounts to counter the recession. Disney said per-capita spending increased 8 percent at its North American parks, which include Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Attendance increased 2 percent, despite bad weather on both coasts; room bookings were up 4 percent. Spending and attendance also increased at the company’s international parks. James A. Rasulo, Disney’s chief financial officer, told analysts on a conference call that hotel bookings for the second quarter were running above levels of a year ago. “Interest in travel is definitely coming back,” he said. Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told analysts that he was “extremely pleased” with the performance of the parks. Mr. Rasulo said consumers had been greeting a long-planned expansion of the company’s cruise business with notable enthusiasm. The first of two new ships, the Disney Dream, was delivered in January; the second is to arrive next year. Together, the ships cost more than $1.8 billion. “Blowing the doors off in terms of demand and interest” is how Mr. Rasulo described the impact of the Dream on Disney’s broader cruise business. Over all, Disney’s quarterly results easily beat Wall Street estimates of 56 cents a share, lifting the company’s stock price over 3 percent in after-hours trading to about $42.60. For the quarter, which ended on Jan. 1, Disney reported net income of $1.3 billion, or 68 cents a share, up from $844 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter, the first of Disney’s fiscal year, increased 10 percent to $10.7 billion. While the performance of Disney’s theme parks accounted for the most notable shift for the company, a mixture of businesses drove the strong results. ESPN, as usual, delivered outsize growth. Advertising sales at ESPN climbed 27 percent, after adjusting for the inclusion this year of the Rose Bowl and the Fiesta Bowl. As a result, operating income increased 47 percent to about $1.1 billion at Disney’s Media Networks unit. (Results at ABC were mixed: stronger political advertising perked up local stations, but lower ratings dented the network.) Operating income at Walt Disney Studios increased 54 percent to $375 million. “Tangled,” a modernization of the classic Rapunzel fairy tale that has sold over $477 million at the global box office, and DVD sales for “Toy Story 3” were primarily responsible. Disney’s consumer products unit recorded a 28 percent increase in operating income, to $312 million, primarily because holiday sales of toys tied to “Toy Story 3” lived up to high expectations. The quarterly results, released after the market’s close, revealed one important weakness. The Disney Interactive Media Group, a division that includes video games and Disney.com, widened its loss to $13 million from $10 million a year ago. Relatively robust sales for the game Epic Mickey were outweighed by accounting related to the July acquisition of Playdom, a maker of simple online games. Disney continues to overhaul the division, most recently laying off 200 workers. Mr. Rasulo told analysts that Playdom would “continue to impact results for the remainder of the year.” Still, Mr. Iger and Mr. Rasulo spent a significant amount of their time with analysts talking about theme parks, which are positioned as a driver of growth despite their exposure to broader economic conditions and expected higher labor costs. Rather than easing up on new rides and park expansions during the downturn, Disney decided — somewhat controversially — to double down on the division. The Disneyland Resort is halfway through a $1 billion expansion and renovation of its California Adventure section, while Disney World is preparing additions to its Magic Kingdom property. Overseas, work is under way on a $500 million expansion of Hong Kong Disneyland, while Paris Disneyland just opened a $100 million “Toy Story” attraction. Disney is awaiting final approval from the Chinese government to move ahead with a large new resort in Shanghai.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/02/07/armstrong-and-huffington-on-the-aol-huffington-post-deal/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Armstrong and Huffington on the AOL-Huffington Post Deal<date>February 7, 2011, 4:09 pm</date><text>AOL‘s chief executive, Tim Armstrong, and The Huffington Post‘s founder, Arianna Huffington, discuss on CNBC how the purchase of the news site fits into AOL’s strategy.

A representative visits a new mother and offers a free Disney Cuddly Bodysuit, a variation of the classic Onesie. In bedside demonstrations, the bilingual representatives extol the product’s bells and whistles — extra soft! durable! better sizing! — and ask mothers to sign up for e-mail alerts from DisneyBaby.com. More than 200,000 bodysuits will be given away by May, when Amazon.com is set to begin selling 85 styles for a starting price of $9.99 for two; Nordstrom and Target will follow with more Disney Baby items, including hats. “If ever there was an opportunity for a trusted brand to enter a market and provide a better product and experience, it’s this,” said Robert A. Iger, chief executive of Disney. “I’m extremely excited about it.” The endeavor dances close to a flame. Disney has suffered harsh criticism in recent years over products directed at the very young. The fiercest battle has involved Baby Einstein, the Disney-owned maker of “developmental and entertainment” videos and toys for babies and toddlers. The Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit organization, claimed victory in 2009 when Disney, apparently acknowledging that the products did not turn babies into geniuses after all, offered some Baby Einstein refunds. But Disney has moved on. In this new venture, the company gains access to the maternity hospitals through a company called Our365, a business that sells bedside baby pictures. Our365 pays hospitals for exclusive access, and companies like Disney pay Our365 to promote their own products. Our365 also has Fisher-Price and Procter &amp; Gamble as clients. It is unclear whether mothers know of Our365’s financial ties to these companies. Certainly hospitals have given new mothers gift bags for decades. In recent years, however, more have banned the practice, citing criticism that free baby formula, for example, discourages breast-feeding. Privacy also is a concern. “This is taking advantage of families at an extremely vulnerable time,” said Jeff McIntyre, director of national policy for the advocacy group Children Now. Elizabeth Carter gave birth to her daughter Olivia on Jan. 19 in Piedmont, Calif., and was given a Disney Cuddly Bodysuit as part of an Our365 photo package. “It surprised me that Disney was in there promoting something right as the baby was born, but we figured as new parents we weren’t in a position to turn free things down,” she said. Mrs. Carter put the garment on her hours-old baby immediately. “And I have to say Olivia looked fabulous, much better than the rough, bulky thing the hospital had her wearing,” she said. Disney estimates the North American baby market, including staples like formula, to be worth $36.3 billion annually. Its executives talk about tapping into that jackpot as if they were waging a war. “Apparel is only a beachhead,” said Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney Consumer Products. As such, the company does not intend to stop with bodysuits, which are playfully adorned with Disney characters like Simba from “The Lion King.” Also planned are bath items, strollers, baby food and an abundance of other products — all pushed with so much marketing muscle that Disney Baby may actually dent operating margins in Mr. Mooney’s division in the near term. But this is a long-term play, and it could have its greatest value far beyond the crib. Disney Baby is also intended to draw mothers into the company’s broader web of products and experiences. Mr. Mooney is working on a loyalty program, for instance, in which pregnant women might receive free theme park tickets in return for signing up for e-mail alerts. “To get that mom thinking about her family’s first park experience before her baby is even born is a home run,” Mr. Mooney said, adding that a surprisingly large number of families do not become consumers of Disney products until their children reach preschool age, when they start to watch Disney Channel programs like “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.” 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="4" href="http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/a-dreamworks-rout-in-a-flawed-contest/?ref=disneywaltcompany">A DreamWorks Rout in a Flawed Contest<date>February 6, 2011, 11:40 am</date><text>Paramount Pictures A scene from “How to Train Your Dragon.” LOS ANGELES— Think about a big homecoming football game featuring cross-town rivals. And then only one team shows up. Kinda makes for a lopsided victory, right? Something similar happened Saturday night as DreamWorks Animation walked away with 15 trophies at the 38th Annual Annie Awards, including best animated feature (“How to Train Your Dragon”) and best animated television production (a “Kung Fu Panda” holiday special). Walt Disney Animation Studios and its corporate sibling, Pixar Animation Studios, won just one, as Pixar’s “Day &amp; Night” took best short. Here’s the back story: Disney-Pixar said in August that it would no longer participate in the Annies, essentially meaning that the dominant force in animation these days wouldn’t buy tables at the ceremony anymore. (In recent years, as many as 100 Disney-Pixar folks have attended en masse.) The reason? It’s a long story, but essentially the two companies think the Annies, presented by the International Animated Film Society, are a sloppily run contest. At the time, Antran Manoogian, the president of the guild, told Variety, “The Annies are about honoring the best in animation, and we will continue to do so.” Which is kind of hilarious considering that “Toy Story 3,” which has taken almost every animation prize possible this season, was blanked on Saturday night. The Annies people put out a press release late Saturday declaring that their shindig is “often a predictor of the annual Academy Award for best animated feature.” With no offense to “How to Train Your Dragon” — a delightful film we’ve watched twice (and we don’t even have kids) — the money stays on “Toy Story 3.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/business/29insider.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Yonni Sebbag Sentenced in Disney Insider Trading Scheme<date>Published: January 28, 2011</date><text>A man who teamed up with his girlfriend, who was a Disney employee, to sell secrets about the company’s finances was sentenced on Friday to two years and three months in prison.Judge Kimba M. Wood of Federal District Court in Manhattan sentenced the defendant, Yonni Sebbag, after rejecting arguments that he deserved leniency because the scheme was so inept, it was laughable. “This offense is very serious,” Judge Wood said. Mr. Sebbag, 30, a Los Angeles resident and a citizen of Morocco, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. In a statement, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, called Mr. Sebbag “the latest person to learn the hard way that trying to earn a quick buck through insider trading will earn you a prison sentence instead.” The scheme occurred while Mr. Sebbag’s girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, 34, was the secretary to Disney’s head of corporate communications in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said she passed nonpublic information, like the company’s quarterly earnings, to Mr. Sebbag, who tried to sell it by sending anonymous letters to 33 hedge funds and other investment companies. Mr. Sebbag’s lawyer, Steven Kartagener, told the judge on Friday that his client had resorted to “an act of desperation” while struggling with a gambling problem and financial woes. Ms. Hoxie has also pleaded guilty and her sentencing is set for Feb. 22.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/business/media/20film.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Filmmakers Prepare for Oscar Competition<date>Published: January 19, 2011</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Hollywood’s message for moviegoers this month: “Eat your peas, or no dessert.”An unusually stingy roster of new January comedies and other potential light fare from the major studios appears to include just four films. Those are “No Strings Attached,” scheduled from Paramount Pictures, on Friday; “The Rite,” from Warner Brothers and its New Line Cinema unit, scheduled for Jan. 28; and “The Green Hornet” from Sony Pictures and “The Dilemma” from Universal Pictures, both of which opened last Friday. But at the same time, distributors are nurturing a crop of more substantial, Oscar-oriented films, some of which have been in the marketplace for months. Last weekend, “Black Swan” from Fox Searchlight Pictures, “True Grit” from Paramount and “The King’s Speech” from the Weinstein Company expanded into a combined total of almost 2,000 additional theaters. It was a surge that helped all three films build box-office receipts as the long-running awards season turns toward its conclusion with the Oscar broadcast on Feb. 27. Steve Gilula, a president of Fox Searchlight, said of the distribution for “Black Swan,” “We were able to get wider faster than we could have in a year as crowded as last year.” The film, which stars Natalie Portman as a ballerina caught in a death spiral, has sold had more than $75 million in domestic tickets since its release on Dec. 3. Mr. Gilula said its current array of about 2,300 theaters took it into “very small towns,” and probably gave it its peak expansion. Even more striking, Sony Pictures rereleased “The Social Network” in hundreds of theaters on Jan. 10, just days before the film was scheduled to appear on DVD. That helped push total domestic ticket sales for the movie, which was first released on Oct. 1, to about $95 million, even as it was being named best motion picture drama at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards ceremony. Film executives said theaters became available as a series of late-season studio films like “The Tourist” and “How Do You Know” faded more quickly than the previous year’s December hits, which included “Avatar” and “Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.” Over all, last year’s domestic box-office tally was about $10.6 billion, roughly matching that of 2009, though attendance fell about 6 percent. (Higher 3-D and Imax ticket prices helped to keep the box office from falling along with attendance.) What remains uncertain, because film schedules can readjust during the year, is whether the very slim roster of new January studio films — which are bolstered by a handful of wide releases from the larger independents, like Lionsgate and CBS Films — portends a year with fewer major movies over all. Over the last decade, the six major studios — Disney, 20th Century Fox, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner — have generally released around 110 films annually, not counting the fare from separate art-film units like Fox Searchlight. But declining attendance and eroding home video revenue have studios more cautious, prompting speculation that their film count will drop this year. (Companies can sometimes also improve profits in the near term by cutting releases, because they are spared the need to record big marketing expenditures for new films that may make money only over the very long haul.) Last year, the big studios brought at least six films in January. In 2009, nine films — a more typical count for recent years — included sleeper hits like “Paul Blart: Mall Cop” from Sony and “Taken” from 20th Century Fox, and provoked talk of a box-office resurgence and the seeming birth of a new winter filmgoing season. But this year, those who didn’t catch up with “The Fighter,” another awards contender, when it was released in mid-December, can breathe easy. The film is still in about 2,000 theaters as it heads into its seventh weekend, and will almost certainly be playing on Oscar night. As for Ms. Portman, the driven ballerina, she doesn’t have to worry about much in the way of competition this month. The only new female star vehicle from the major studios in January is the romantic comedy “No Strings Attached.” And she stars in that one as well.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/arts/video-games/15tron.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">‘Tron’ New and Old: Films and Video Games<date>Published: January 14, 2011</date><text>You’ve Googled yourself, right?Like it or not, there’s a digital you out there. In fact almost every aspect of your life is probably reflected in some computer somewhere. You could say that information, that data, has a life of its own. If you have anything to do with modern society, you are no longer a purely biological, analog being. The idea that a person could be represented inside a computer both thrilled and frightened me when I first saw “Tron” in the summer of 1982, when I was 9 and just starting to get into computers. As incredible as it may seem now, my friends and I would buy magazines that published short programs in Basic code. The ones we cared about were games, and I would enter them by hand into my Commodore VIC-20. Unlike kids today, we had no ability to create films or Web sites. But we could make little games, and we did. Seeing “Tron” certainly didn’t make me think there were little guys in neon spandex running around under my keyboard. It did, however, make me want to upgrade to a Commodore 64 when it was released later that summer. The idea that an evil Master Control Program (MCP) spawned by video games could first take over the virtual realm and then try to start running the real world was intriguing, if also disturbing. It became clear, though, that this vision of a single-minded electronic tyranny simply wasn’t going to happen. Instead, things went the other direction, toward mass digital empowerment and chaos rather than toward centralization. The entire premise of the original “Tron” is that the programmer Kevin Flynn must go to the office and store his personal game designs on the company server, which are then appropriated by the bad guy. In “Tron” the computer system is available only to the few. The original Encom (the fictional corporation in the film) seems based on the old I.B.M., not on Microsoft. In real life, personal computers, modems and the Internet have made the film’s concept ludicrous. And that may be why the “Tron” franchise never quite resonated or maintained much cultural influence over the years, though the film always remained an important technical achievement. “Blade Runner,” released two weeks before “Tron,” was a much richer and more intellectually challenging take on the responsibility and power of man when he finally meets his machine. “WarGames,” released the year after “Tron,” showed the public that even the hardest computer targets could be vulnerable to a creative teenager in his bedroom — which was accurate then and remains quite true. And William Gibson, who coined the word cyberspace, finally delivered the most prescient and accurate view of modern digital reality with his 1984 novel, “Neuromancer.” (I am announcing now that if someone messes up the inevitable film version of “Neuromancer” I will personally invest in pitchforks.) The one big idea from the original “Tron” that maintained relevance was that some binary version of you is running around out there in all those ones and zeros, to a certain extent under your control but also, in a profound way, forever beyond your reach. Now we can all have multiple identities all the time: just make another user name, and you’re someone else, right? That conceit is not always accurate, but of course it is through video games that we control the most direct and literal versions of our digital selves. And as it turns out, both “Tron” and “Neuromancer” ended up inspiring excellent games. In fact, the original Tron arcade game stands up much better now than the original film does. The arcade Tron was the first game I remember playing with a trigger built into the joystick. The integration between the use of the stick in the right hand and the cylindrical spinner in the left was tight and intuitive. It was also the first game I remember that was structured around a selection of mini-games — the tank, the light cycles, the spiders (technically grid bugs but always known as the spiders) and the MCP core — rather than the same thing over and over.

That result made Disney’s game the fifth best-selling console title leading up to Christmas. The top-selling release in December was Call of Duty: Black Ops, which sold 3.6 million units worth $193 million for Activision Blizzard. Disney says it is thrilled with the results for Epic Mickey, a game six years in the making. A spokeswoman for Disney Interactive Studios noted that the game, in which Mickey Mouse traverses a forbidding cartoon wasteland, was the fastest-selling single-platform game in the company’s history. Furthermore, of the five top-selling console games in December, Epic Mickey was the only one that was not a sequel. The spokeswoman also noted that worldwide sales, which NPD does not track, have been doing well. On a global basis, Epic Mickey could sell over four million units, according to Doug Creutz, an analyst at Cowen &amp; Company. That is the glass-half-full analysis. Viewed from other angles, Disney almost certainly left money on the table with its unusual Epic Mickey introduction, according to analysts. Disney released the game on Nov. 30, missing the all-important post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend. It was originally set to miss Christmas entirely until senior Disney executives stepped in and sped things up. Managers at Disney Interactive Studios also made the decision to limit the release of Epic Mickey to the Nintendo Wii, a console that has slumped in popularity since that decision was made. Disney decided to skip systems like the Sony PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Xbox 360 in part because the Wii was proving more popular with families; the Wii controls are also suited to the game’s narrative, which involves splashing paint and thinner. Epic Mickey came along as Disney began to overhaul its approach to gaming, placing less emphasis on expensive console titles and more on social games played over the Internet. In July Disney spent $563.2 million to acquire Playdom, at the time the No. 3 social game company on Facebook, with 42 million monthly players. Senior managers have paraded out the door recently, resigning or being fired from Disney’s digital media division as the company has tried to place it on stronger footing. Those leaving include Steve Wadsworth, the unit’s former president, and Graham Hopper, an executive vice president who shepherded Epic Mickey. Courtney Simmons, who led public relations for the division, was pushed out on Monday.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/theater/03arts-DISNEYTESTSB_BRF.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Tests Broadway Ticket Flexibility<date>Published: January 2, 2011</date><text>Beginning with performances this week the Broadway productions of “The Lion King” and “Mary Poppins” will allow ticket holders to exchange seats for other dates through March 10 for any reason, without penalty, as many times as needed. Disney Theatrical Productions announced its “worry-free winter 2011” exchange policy for the two musicals as an experiment to allow greater flexibility at the box office. Policies for Broadway plays and musicals vary for those who want to exchange tickets for another date; this pilot program is meant to help Disney evaluate how many theatergoers might use and appreciate such a policy as well as to offer peace of mind for those worried about making their shows when, say, a blizzard looms. “People have busy lives and need more flexibility when the unexpected happens and plans change,” David Schrader, executive vice president of Disney Theatrical Productions, said in a statement. “We recognize the time is right to reduce restrictions and put more power in the hands of the customer.” Customers who exchange tickets would not be able to receive a full or partial refund if a refund were offered for a specific performance. The policy covers a traditionally slow-selling stretch for many shows and comes during a time when tickets are relatively available for “Mary Poppins” and to some extent for “The Lion King,” which is the bigger hit.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F07E0DA1E39F932A05751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">ARTS, BRIEFLY; Playthings and Performers Get Stamps<date>Published: December 31, 2010</date><text>A new set of commemorative stamps announced by the United States Postal Service may not send your mail to infinity and beyond (barring any routing errors), but it can send your correspondence to its destination bearing the grinning lantern-jawed countenance of Buzz Lightyear.

But if you want computer-generated hair (or fur) to look convincingly real when it is twisted, clumped, matted, coiled, soaked, dusty, wind swept, singed — or just about anything else a film director could possibly think to do to it — then Mr. Grinspun is the man to consult.From a spacious office and workroom on the 10th floor of Columbia’s Schapiro Center in Morningside Heights, Mr. Grinspun and his team of graduate students have helped scientists from Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Weta Digital and Adobe Systems solve their toughest C.G.I. problems, whether recreating the dab of a bristled paintbrush or getting Rapunzel’s hair in the Disney film “Tangled” to float in an underwater cave. “There’s not a huge number of people who can do this,” said Alasdair Coull, head of Weta Digital’s software development team. “We’re essentially looking for the best in the world.” Weta has joined with a handful of universities, including a half-dozen or so in California, on C.G.I. — computer-generated imagery — and related projects. Mr. Coull, who traveled from Wellington, New Zealand, last year to spend a month at Columbia, contacted Mr. Grinspun after reading about his inventions in hair simulation and fur grooming. Let’s just say it is no coincidence that Weta (“Avatar,” “The Lord of the Rings”) is creating the computer-generated brainy apes who take over the world in “Rise of the Apes,” the back story to the classic 1968 movie “Planet of the Apes,” due to be released in 2011, as well as working on Steven Spielberg’s forthcoming version of the adventures of Tintin and his dog, Snowy. On this gray morning, however, Mr. Grinspun, 34, is putting out coffee and pastries for a meeting with Rasmus Tamstorf, a senior research scientist for Disney. As Mr. Grinspun scurries around in his stocking feet, his frame tall and lanky, with a curly mop of dark hair and large eyes that droop at the outer corners, it is easy to imagine him as an animated character: sweet-natured and a little goofy, but whip smart. What distinguishes his work from that of other computer scientists is that he creates not only beautiful pictures but also beautiful mathematics. Mr. Grinspun turns on one of the half-dozen or so computer screens in his office to show off the lifelike strands of animated hair that his lab helped create and stares lovingly at the screen. “The mathematics behind this is really gorgeous,” he says. Mr. Tamstorf uses another word —“principled” — to describe the Columbia group’s approach to problem solving. What he and others mean when they refer to work as “principled” or “beautiful” is that the images on screen are not the result of a patchwork of technical tricks, but of precise mathematical equations based on the way the world actually looks and operates — in a word, physics. They use what is known as discrete differential geometry, a field so new that the first textbook on the subject was published only two years ago. “We find equations that describe lots of different kinds of physical systems,” Mr. Grinspun explained, “the shape of a cable on a bridge, a spinning top, cilia.” He started pumping a large, colorful top that he keeps on his desk to illustrate. Those equations are then used to create a violent splash of waves or the layered folds of a skirt. Predicting and controlling flexible materials and collisions, however, is tricky. Very tricky. With hair, for example, you need to take into account how every one of the 150,000 or so strands on a head interacts with the other strands, gravity, friction, air and so on. Imagine trying to come up with a couple of equations for that. In general the process of animation involves painstaking trial and error that Mr. Tamstorf at Disney compared to “operating blindfolded.” The animators may get some of it right, but not all of it: a patch of scalp peeks out while a character is running, or a shirt keeps inching up a character’s belly even after he has stopped moving. Sometimes the studio is forced to resort to “brute force” to achieve a desired effect, he said, which could mean calling in Disney’s army of artists to paint over every single image in the film to satisfy the director. As long as it looked good on the big screen, though, no one cared much how a result was achieved. It was like patching a leaky roof by nailing on a wooden panel, tying down a tarp, taping over a crack, sticking an umbrella in a hole. As long as it kept the water out, no one complained. “That’s not our philosophy,” Mr. Grinspun said. “We said, ‘Let’s show the world you can have mathematically principled approaches.’ ”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/business/media/28disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Command Center Aims to Keep Lines Moving<date>Published: December 27, 2010</date><text>ORLANDO, Fla. — Deep in the bowels of Walt Disney World, inside an underground bunker called the Disney Operational Command Center, technicians know that you are standing in line and that you are most likely annoyed about it. Their clandestine mission: to get you to the fun faster.To handle over 30 million annual visitors — many of them during this busiest time of year for the megaresort — Disney World long ago turned the art of crowd control into a science. But the putative Happiest Place on Earth has decided it must figure out how to quicken the pace even more. A cultural shift toward impatience — fed by video games and smartphones — is demanding it, park managers say. To stay relevant to the entertain-me-right-this-second generation, Disney must evolve. And so it has spent the last year outfitting an underground, nerve center to address that most low-tech of problems, the wait. Located under Cinderella Castle, the new center uses video cameras, computer programs, digital park maps and other whiz-bang tools to spot gridlock before it forms and deploy countermeasures in real time. In one corner, employees watch flat-screen televisions that depict various attractions in green, yellow and red outlines, with the colors representing wait-time gradations. If Pirates of the Caribbean, the ride that sends people on a spirited voyage through the Spanish Main, suddenly blinks from green to yellow, the center might respond by alerting managers to launch more boats. Another option involves dispatching Captain Jack Sparrow or Goofy or one of their pals to the queue to entertain people as they wait. “It’s about being nimble and quickly noticing that, ‘Hey, let’s make sure there is some relief out there for those people,’ ” said Phil Holmes, vice president of the Magic Kingdom, the flagship Disney World park. What if Fantasyland is swamped with people but adjacent Tomorrowland has plenty of elbow room? The operations center can route a miniparade called “Move it! Shake it! Celebrate It!” into the less-populated pocket to siphon guests in that direction. Other technicians in the command center monitor restaurants, perhaps spotting that additional registers need to be opened or dispatching greeters to hand out menus to people waiting to order. “These moments add up until they collectively help the entire park,” Mr. Holmes said. In recent years, according to Disney research, the average Magic Kingdom visitor has had time for only nine rides — out of more than 40 — because of lengthy waits and crowded walkways and restaurants. In the last few months, however, the operations center has managed to make enough nips and tucks to lift that average to 10. “Control is Disney’s middle name, so they have always been on the cutting edge of this kind of thing,” said Bob Sehlinger, co-author of “The Unofficial Guide: Walt Disney World 2011” and a writer on Disney for Frommers.com. Mr. Sehlinger added, “The challenge is that you only have so many options once the bathtub is full.” Disney, which is periodically criticized for overreaching in the name of cultural dominance (and profits), does not see any of this monitoring as the slightest bit invasive. Rather, the company regards it as just another part of its efforts to pull every possible lever in the name of a better guest experience. The primary goal of the command center, as stated by Disney, is to make guests happier — because to increase revenue in its $10.7 billion theme park business, which includes resorts in Paris and Hong Kong, Disney needs its current customers to return more often. “Giving our guests faster and better access to the fun,” said Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, “is at the heart of our investment in technology.” Disney also wants to raise per-capita spending. “If we can also increase the average number of shop or restaurant visits, that’s a huge win for us,” Mr. Holmes said. Disney has long been a leader in technological innovation, whether that means inventing cameras to make animated films or creating the audio animatronic robots for the attraction It’s a Small World. Behind-the-scenes systems — typically kept top secret by the company as it strives to create an environment where things happen as if by magic — are also highly computerized. Ride capacity is determined in part by analyzing hotel reservations, flight bookings and historic attendance data. Satellites provide minute-by-minute weather analysis. A system called FastPass allows people to skip lines for popular rides like the Jungle Cruise. But the command center reflects how Disney is deepening its reliance on technology as it thinks about adapting decades-old parks, which are primarily built around nostalgia for an America gone by, for 21st century expectations. “It’s not about us needing to keep pace with technological change,” Mr. Staggs said. “We need to set the pace for that kind of change.” For instance, Disney has been experimenting with smartphones to help guide people more efficiently. Mobile Magic, a $1.99 app, allows visitors to type in “Sleeping Beauty” and receive directions to where that princess (or at least a costumed stand-in) is signing autographs. In the future, typing in “hamburger” might reveal the nearest restaurant with the shortest wait. Disney has also been adding video games to wait areas. At Space Mountain, 87 game stations now line the queue to keep visitors entertained. (Games, about 90 seconds in length, involve simple things like clearing runways of asteroids). Gaming has also been added to the queue for Soarin’, an Epcot ride that simulates a hang glider flight. Blogs that watch Disney’s parks have speculated that engineers (“imagineers,” in the company’s parlance) are also looking at bigger ideas, like wristbands that contain information like your name, credit card number and favorite Disney characters. While Disney is keeping a tight lid on specifics, these devices would enable simple transactions like the purchase of souvenirs — just pay by swiping your wristband — as well as more complicated attractions that interact with guests. “Picture a day where there is memory built into these characters — they will know that they’ve seen you four or five times before and that your name is Bobby,” said Bruce E. Vaughn, chief creative executive at Walt Disney Imagineering. “Those are the kinds of limits that are dissolving so quickly that we can see being able to implement them in the meaningfully near future.” Dreaming about the future was not something on Mr. Holmes’s mind as he gave a reporter a rare peek behind the Disney operations veil. He had a park to run, and the command center had spotted trouble at the tea cups. After running smoothly all morning, the spinning Mad Tea Party abruptly stopped meeting precalculated ridership goals. A few minutes later, Mr. Holmes had his answer: a new employee had taken over the ride and was leaving tea cups unloaded. “In the theme park business these days,” he said, “patience is not always a virtue.”</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/opinion/26rich.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Who Killed the Disneyland Dream?<date>Published: December 25, 2010</date><text>OF the many notable Americans we lost in 2010, three leap out as paragons of a certain optimistic American spirit that we also seemed to lose this year. Two you know: Theodore Sorensen, the speechwriter present at the creation of J.F.K.’s clarion call to “ask what you can do for your country,” and Richard Holbrooke, the diplomat who brought peace to the killing fields of Bosnia in the 1990s. Holbrooke, who was my friend, came of age in the Kennedy years and exemplified its can-do idealism. He gave his life to the proposition that there was nothing an American couldn’t accomplish if he marshaled his energy and talents. His premature death — while heroically bearing the crushing burdens of Afghanistan and Pakistan — is tragic in more ways than many Americans yet realize.But a third representative American optimist who died this year, at age 91, is a Connecticut man who was not a player in great events and whom I’d never heard of until I read his Times obituary: Robbins Barstow, an amateur filmmaker who for decades recorded his family’s doings in home movies of such novelty and quality that one of them, the 30-minute “Disneyland Dream,” was admitted to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress two years ago. That rare honor elevates Barstow’s filmmaking to a pantheon otherwise restricted mostly to Hollywood classics, from “Citizen Kane” to “Star Wars.” “Disneyland Dream” was made in the summer of 1956, shortly before the dawn of the Kennedy era. You can watch it on line at archive.org or on YouTube. Its narrative is simple. The young Barstow family of Wethersfield, Conn. — Robbins; his wife, Meg; and their three children aged 4 to 11 — enter a nationwide contest to win a free trip to Disneyland, then just a year old. The contest was sponsored by 3M, which asked contestants to submit imaginative encomiums to the wonders of its signature product. Danny, the 4-year-old, comes up with the winning testimonial, emblazoned on poster board: “I like ‘Scotch’ brand cellophane tape because when some things tear then I can just use it.” Soon enough, the entire neighborhood is cheering the Barstows as they embark on their first visit to the golden land of Anaheim, Calif. As narrated by Robbins Barstow (he added his voiceover soundtrack to the silent Kodachrome film in 1995), every aspect of this pilgrimage is a joy, from the “giant TWA Super Constellation” propeller plane (seating 64) that crosses the country in a single day (with a refueling stop in St. Louis) to the home-made Davy Crockett jackets the family wears en route. To watch “Disneyland Dream” now as a boomer inevitably sets off pangs of longing for a vanished childhood fantasyland: not just Walt Disney’s then-novel theme park but all the sunny idylls of 1950s pop culture. As it happens, Disney’s Davy Crockett, the actor Fess Parker, also died this year. So did Barbara Billingsley, matriarch of the sitcom “Leave It to Beaver,” whose fictional family, the Cleavers, first appeared in 1957 and could have lived next door to the Barstows. But the real power of this film is more subtle and pertinent than nostalgia. When the Barstows finally arrive at the gates of Disneyland itself and enter its replica of Main Street, U.S.A. — “reconstructed as it might have been half a century earlier,” as the narration says — we realize that the America of “Disneyland Dream” is as many years distant from us as that picture-postcard Main Street was from this Connecticut family. The almost laughably low-tech primitivism of the original Disneyland, the futuristic Tomorrowland included, looks as antique in 2010 as Main Street’s horse-drawn buggies and penny-candy emporium looked to the Barstows. Many of America’s more sweeping changes since 1956 are for the better. You can’t spot a nonwhite face among the family’s neighbors back home or at Disneyland. Indeed, according to Neal Gabler’s epic biography of Disney, civil rights activists were still pressuring the park to hire black employees as late as 1963, the same year that Martin Luther King Jr.’s march on Washington and Betty Friedan’s “Feminine Mystique” started upending the Wonder Bread homogeneity that suffuses the America of “Disneyland Dream.” But, for all those inequities, economic equality seemed within reach in 1956, at least for the vast middle class. (Michael Harrington’s exposé of American poverty, “The Other America,” would not rock this complacency until 1962.) The sense that the American promise of social and economic mobility was attainable to anyone who sought it permeates “Disneyland Dream” from start to finish. The Barstows exemplified that postwar middle class. Robbins Barstow’s day job was as a director of professional development for a state teachers’ union. His family wanted for nothing, but finances were tight. Once in California they cheerfully stretch their limited expense money ($300 for the week) by favoring picnics over restaurants. As they dive into the pool at the old Huntington Sheraton, the grand Pasadena hotel where they’re bivouacked, they marvel at its reminders of “bygone days of more leisurely and gentle upper-class style and elegance.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/25/movies/25grinch.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Holiday Movies Seem to Be Victims of the Grinch<date>Published: December 24, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Have a happy holiday. But don’t look for much help from Hollywood. For the first time since 2001, Christmas Day arrives without a holiday-theme movie from the major studios, or even most of the minor ones. Paramount is offering vengeance in “True Grit” and a bloody comeback in “The Fighter.” Disney has “Tron: Legacy,” its video game gone wild. Fox has released “Gulliver’s Travels.” But “Jingle Bells,” eggnog and family fights that turn into warm and fuzzy moments around the tree are almost nowhere to be found in the films left behind by executives, who have mostly abandoned Burbank for Brazil and all points of the compass. “I think it’s just weird, because it looks like a real missed opportunity,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who monitors film box office results for Hollywood.com. Every year in the last eight has brought a Christmas-theme film or two, including some real hits. In 2003, for instance, New Line Cinema went on to snag a startling $173 million in domestic ticket sales when it put Will Ferrell in tights for “Elf.” Disney took in $139 million at the domestic box office with “The Santa Clause 2” in 2002, and nearly $138 million last year with “A Christmas Carol.” The most impressive Christmas-theme hit in recent memory was “Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” which took in $260 million for Universal after its release in November 2000 and became that year’s best box office performer. Christmas films have an obvious advantage in that much of the audience has already warmed to the seasonal subject matter. But studio executives are somewhat wary of the genre, because even a slight hitch in the production process can force them to hold a movie for a full year. Something like that happened to DreamWorks SKG, for instance, when it shot “Surviving Christmas,” with Ben Affleck, in early 2003, then bumped the release to late 2004, to avoid competing with a thriller, “Paycheck,” in which Mr. Affleck also starred. (“Surviving Christmas” was a flop.) This year brings a dollop of Christmas-Hanukkah cheer at the end of Universal’s “Little Fockers,” in which a nurse, played by Ben Stiller, squares off against his ex-C.I.A.-operative father-in-law, played by Robert De Niro. “The Nutcracker in 3D,” from Freestyle Releasing, is also playing in a small number of theaters, as is “Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale,” from Oscilloscope Laboratories. (A Finnish import, “Rare Exports,” according to Jeannette Catsoulis, who reviewed it for The New York Times, “turns Santa into a savage troll and his elves into naked, wrinkly graybeards.”) And Warner Brothers is back in a few Imax theaters with another re-release of “The Polar Express,” which was the studio’s big Christmas hit in 2004. Otherwise, it’s a matter of waiting for Hollywood to get its holiday groove back. That will happen, Mr. Dergarabedian predicted, on Nov. 23, 2011, when Sony Pictures expects to release its “Arthur Christmas.” It is an animated extravaganza, in 3-D, about toys and elves and a high-tech distribution operation based at the North Pole. This year is probably just an oversight, Mr. Dergarabedian said, adding, “I don’t think there’s a conspiracy against Santa.”</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400EFD91F30F933A15751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">MEDIA DECODER; New Strategy for 'Tron' DVD<date>Published: December 20, 2010</date><text>Hide and seek has long been one of the Walt Disney Company's favorite strategies when it comes to home entertainment.

Multiple studios now find themselves forced to compete against themselves for awards. Focus Features has both Julianne Moore and Annette Bening nominated for best actress for their roles in “The Kids Are All Right.” Sony Pictures Entertainment has “The Tourist” and “Burlesque” vying for best comedy or musical. Paramount has both Amy Adams and Melissa Leo competing in the supporting actress category for “The Fighter.” For Disney, both “Tangled” and “Toy Story 3” earned nods in animation. How much firepower to focus on its various nominees is surely something Sony Pictures Entertainment will be chewing over. Sony, not typically in the awards race (with the exception of its Classics division), racked up the most nods of any motion picture operation this year: 18. Counting television, Sony’s total was 24 – the most the company has ever received, according to a studio spokesman. Leading Sony’s parade was “The Social Network,” which nabbed six nominations. The Weinstein Company – always successful in lobbying the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the Globes – was second with 10 nominations, including seven for “The King’s Speech.” The remaining nods came in acting categories for “Blue Valentine,” which stars Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling, and for “The Concert,” a contender in best foreign-language film. In other notable company threads, Universal Pictures, which in the past has been a major presence on the awards trail (backing pictures like “Frost/Nixon” and “Changeling”), had a lone nod, for “Despicable Me.” Disney, meanwhile, was thrilled its “Alice in Wonderland” picked up a best picture nomination, the first Disney-branded live-action film to make an appearance in that race since “Mary Poppins” in 1965.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/arts/video-games/14mickey.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Epic Mickey - Video Game Review<date>Published: December 13, 2010</date><text>I have a serious question for Robert A. Iger, the president and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company: Did you get both hands on a Nintendo Wii controller and personally play through several hours of Disney Epic Mickey?If so, perhaps you think that everyday game players have a lot more patience and a much higher tolerance for frustration than they do. And that is because Disney Epic Mickey is one of those enticing yet deeply flawed games that is a lot more fun to watch than to play. In its storytelling and overall design, Epic Mickey is an ambitious and often impressive re-imagination of the world’s first true animated star, Mickey Mouse. But as an entertainment experience for the person who has to control all of the jumping and running and spinning involved, it breaks down and fails in bafflingly basic ways. I suspect that many families are going to buy this game, get through a fraction of what ought to be a roughly 15-hour story and put it down forever in frustration at their inability to make Mickey survive. In other words, Disney Epic Mickey is a brilliant and sophisticated concept that isn’t very fun to play. Disney Epic Mickey is a platforming game: if you miss the jumps to the platforms, bad things happen, like having to start over. This may sound mundane, but it seems obvious that if you can’t see where you’re going in a game like this, nothing else matters. Not the clever characters. Not the endearing soundtrack. Not even the intriguing plot lines. Nope. If you fall into pits and die dozens and dozens of times simply because the game won’t properly maneuver the player’s eye-in-the-sky perspective, the fun disappears. This is basic technical and mechanical stuff that most of the game industry seemed to figure out a decade ago, but Disney hasn’t with Epic Mickey. How this could happen reveals a lot about why big international media companies like Disney generally continue to struggle to make great games. I believe it comes down to the fact that senior executive leadership at these companies generally has not had the inclination or the ability to engage with the creative reality of the product — actually to play the games. And that means they can’t make the final call on big-budget games with the same confidence they show in traditional media. Mickey Mouse, after all, is the embodiment of Disney. And yet here is a corporate symbol that has mostly been absent from popular entertainment for several decades. Epic Mickey, with such a grandiloquent name and its high profile on today’s most popular console, the Wii, is supposed to be part of Mickey’s reintroduction to a new generation of fans. So if this game were a major Disney film or a big new series on the company’s ABC network, can you imagine how personally involved Mr. Iger and the rest of the Disney brass would be? How many screeners and rough cuts they would have watched? How much guidance would they have felt not only justified but also obligated to deliver? Perhaps Mr. Iger would even have solicited the personal reactions of the members of the company’s board of directors. That’s their job. At the end of the day, the top executive of a major media company is responsible for watching the movie or television pilot or listening to the album or reading the book and making the final call on whether it’s good enough. Not with every single product, of course, but certainly when the brand involved (Mickey Mouse) is synonymous with the entire company and when the game represents the company’s most important investment in that brand in one of the world’s most important forms of new media (video games). To make Epic Mickey, Disney acquired the services — and the entire development studio — of one of gaming’s most respected designers, Warren Spector. Personally, I’m a huge fan. Mr. Spector’s System Shock and Thief games essentially defined the early generation of first-person stealth shooters. (System Shock and its sequel are science-fiction horror classics that are among the scariest games ever made.) Deus Ex, another Spector game, is one of the best cyberpunk games yet. What do these games have in common? They are all set in the first person. (You’re looking out from your character’s perspective.) In tone, they are all distinctly aimed at adults. And they were all originally made for PCs and mouse-and-keyboard controls. Now let’s look at Disney Epic Mickey. It is set almost entirely in the third person, with you looking down at your character. It has to appeal directly to children. (It is rated E for Everyone.) And it is made exclusively for a living-room console with limited silicon horsepower and a unique control system, the Wii. Moreover, the game revolves around a long-established system, platforming, that hardly appeared in Mr. Spector’s previous games. How could this possibly go wrong? The sad part is that Disney Epic Mickey gets all of the high-concept stuff right. The story involves Mickey’s journey to a dystopian version of the Magic Kingdom, where forgotten Disney creations of the past, led by Walt Disney’s original Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, languish in obscurity. Oswald is jealous of Mickey’s rise to fame, but the two eventually make common cause against the evil Shadow Blot. Mr. Spector’s storytelling influence is seen clearly in the fact that seemingly minor choices made early in the game can have vast, unexpected consequences later. Befitting a cartoon empire, your main weapons here are paint and thinner, which you can use to fill in and erase parts of the world around you. When everything is working properly, the game feels like the innovative smash hit it should have been. But along the way, I found myself becoming more irritated, not less, with the sloppy controls and camera. I came to feel as if I were fighting the game instead of enjoying the experience. If Mr. Iger actually played Disney Epic Mickey, he obviously didn’t make Mr. Spector’s team fix its glaring interface problems. If he didn’t actually play, that should tell you something about why Disney doesn’t make great games, and why Epic Mickey isn’t more, well, epic.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/business/media/09fcc.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">F.C.C. Ponders Ways to Avoid Cable TV Blackouts Over Fees<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Seeking to end the brinksmanship that left many cable television customers in the Northeast without access to the first two games of the World Series this year, the Federal Communications Commission will consider changes to the rules governing negotiations between cable providers and broadcast networks, an agency official said Wednesday.The official, William T. Lake, the chief of the F.C.C.’s media bureau, said in a speech that the commission would propose new rules aimed at preventing broadcast stations from removing their signals from cable companies if the parties were unable to agree on retransmission fees. By law, the F.C.C. cannot force the parties into binding arbitration or act to prevent a service disruption. But the commission is charged with ensuring that the parties negotiate in good faith. Mr. Lake said that the agency would consider new definitions of what constitutes good faith. The aim would be to “help to guide the negotiating parties and reduce the number of failed deals and dropped signals,” he said. Some consumer advocates welcomed the F.C.C.’s announcement. “These disputes between broadcasters and cable operators are becoming more frequent and increasingly bitter, and consumers are more than ever becoming innocent victims of those disputes,” said Gigi B. Sohn, president and co-founder of Public Knowledge, a nonprofit group. Disputes of this type have grown partly because of an ever-expanding array of alternatives to broadcast television. As the audience for broadcast networks has declined, the entertainment divisions of ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox have found it increasingly hard to keep profits flowing. The networks have long looked enviously at the dual revenue streams of cable channels like ESPN. The channels receive payment from cable companies like Time Warner for the right to carry their programming and sell advertising during that programming. A few years ago, the broadcast networks began to beat the drum that they, too, wanted payments from cable companies for carriage rights. They backed up their demands by pointing out that broadcasters reached far larger audiences than any of the cable channels — meaning that if a cable company did not carry a broadcast network, it would have legions of unhappy subscribers. With greater frequency, the disputes have come down to a deadline that involves a premier television event. Last January, a negotiation between Time Warner Cable and the News Corporation, the parent of the Fox Broadcasting network, was resolved just in time for broadcast of the Sugar Bowl. In March, a tussle between Cablevision and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, was resolved 14 minutes into the telecast of the Oscars. The two-week blackout in October of Fox, which interrupted coverage of the World Series for Cablevision subscribers, was the longest such blackout of a broadcast channel, drawing numerous calls for the F.C.C. to intercede. Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said in an October letter to Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the chairman of the subcommittee that oversees the commission, that he believed it was “time for Congress to revisit the current retransmission law,” and possibly give the commission better tools to deal with the disputes. But given the difficulty of Congress’s enacting legislation, combined with the expiration of some retransmission contracts near the end of the year, the commission decided to alert cable companies and broadcasters that it did not want the current trend to continue. Mr. Lake said the commission still would prefer that Congress act. But Mr. Kerry used the announcement as a reason to say there was no further need for Congress to act. “Our committee has been plugging away at this issue for the better part of a year, and there is broad agreement that there’s got to be a better answer than to again and again have consumers become collateral damage in the contract collisions between major corporate entities,” Mr. Kerry said in a statement Wednesday. “With the F.C.C. taking action and their experts focused on a solution, there’s no need to introduce legislation at this time.” Mr. Lake said in his speech Wednesday that the F.C.C. would consider whether some of its rules “interfere with market negotiations” by giving one side an unfair advantage. A rule that could be reconsidered is one that now forbids cable companies from importing the signal of a network affiliate from across the country if the local affiliate failed to provide its signal. That rule arguably gives an advantage to the broadcaster. Another rule requires cable companies to carry the broadcast channels in their basic tier channel lineup, perhaps giving broadcasters an advantage over nonbroadcast channels. Mr. Lake also said the commission might identify additional practices that would be treated effectively as violations of duty to bargain in good faith. That might include a broadcast network’s arrangements with its affiliates that reserves the network’s right to approve or disapprove a retransmission contract. The commission also may reconsider its notice requirements, which require cable companies — but not broadcasters or noncable distributors like satellite companies — to give customers 30 days notice of a possible interruption in service.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/us/07brfs-HOMELESSMANC_BRF.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Florida: Homeless Man Charged in Killing at Disney Town<date>Published: December 6, 2010</date><text>A homeless man was charged Monday with beating and strangling a man in what was the first homicide in Celebration, Disney’s master-planned community.

In the high-risk film business, sequels and spinoffs are the equivalent of insurance policies, but keeping these properties afloat requires expert handling of casting, tone and narrative. Once core fans turn away from a series, it is next to impossible to win them back. Twentieth Century Fox and Walden Media are trying to pull off just that feat with “Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” the third installment in the “Chronicles of Narnia” series based on the Christianity-themed novels of C. S. Lewis. Conservative moviegoers — what Hollywood calls the “faith” audience — powered “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” to $745 million in global ticket sales. But “Prince Caspian,” engineered with intense battle sequences to appeal to teenage boys, turned off the religious crowd and sold about $420 million at the global box office, a sharply disappointing result for a film that cost about $350 million to make and market. “Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” about three children who must resist temptation to free a fantasy world from evil, returns to overt religious imagery. At stake is the future of this once-promising movie property, and of course the lucre and luster it can deliver to the two companies most invested in it. If “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” does not succeed, it is unlikely that the remaining four books in the series will be produced. After a summer filled with disappointments like “The A-Team,” “Knight and Day” and “Marmaduke,” Fox, owned by the News Corporation, is under pressure to deliver a big hit. Walden, which has struggled with duds like “Ramona and Beezus,” has even more riding on the movie because it makes only about four films a year and did not turn a profit on its last major release, “Prince Caspian.” “We are holding our breath to see how it goes next weekend,” said David Weil, who oversees Walden as chief executive of the Anschutz Film Group, owned by the investor Philip Anschutz. An unusual game of Hollywood one-upmanship is also at play. Walt Disney Studios teamed with Walden Media, which owns the movie rights to the Lewis novels, to make the first two films but, deciding the franchise was beyond repair, walked away after “Prince Caspian.” Fox pounced, betting it could succeed where Disney failed. “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” is a PG-rated family adventure directed by Michael Apted, whose credits include the James Bond film “The World Is Not Enough” to “Gorillas in the Mist.” After falling into a mystical world, a young brother and sister and their cousin travel aboard the Dawn Treader, a royal ship, in search of the source of an evil green mist. Along the way they encounter dwarves, mermaids and a truly sinister sea serpent. It’s a world filled with talking animals like Aslan, a lion who acts as a Christ figure, and Reepicheep, a swashbuckling mouse. To repair the franchise, Fox first worked to reduce the budget — operating under the assumption that the next movie would perform no better than “Prince Caspian,” which would have been a solid success if it had not cost so much to make and market. While “Prince Caspian” was shot in four countries over 140 days, “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” would be filmed in Australia, where the studio could reap generous tax breaks, in just 90 days. Fox also cut the visual effects budget nearly in half, partly by reusing digital designs for the computer-generated animal characters. “It’s like any other movie — you’ve got to do it for a price that makes sense,” said Tom Rothman, co-chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment. (Mr. Rothman knows a thing or two about gambling with big budgets: Hollywood thought he was foolish when Fox and two partners spent more than $400 million to make and market “Avatar,” only to watch it sell $2.8 billion at the global box office.) The storyline for “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” was equally important. The Lewis novels represent a formidable storytelling challenge on screen because major characters do not carry over from one to the next. To make some of the most popular characters from “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” pop up in “Voyage of the Dawn Treader,” three screenwriters grafted on bits and pieces of narrative from other novels in the series. Battle sequences were not necessarily played down — there is sword fighting aplenty — but the companies and screenwriters did elevate the mystical and comical elements of the story. “We decided we had to get back to the magic and the wonder and the awe of Narnia,” said Mark Johnson, a producer of all three films. Marketing and distribution came next. Disney released “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe” at Christmas, an easy decision because much of the action takes place in a frozen Narnia. When the film became a giant hit, Disney overreached, figuring it could make even more money by moving “Prince Caspian” to summer — in a death-defying slot between “Iron Man” and “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Disney, figuring it had the family audience in the bag, focused on teenage boys with “Prince Caspian,” using taglines like “You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember.” In Mr. Apted’s assessment, “They got a little careless by taking the faith group for granted — and by neglecting it paid the price.” Mr. Apted paid attention. “We realized we can’t make the same mistake,” he said. “We’ve got to sell the film to everybody.” Besides screening “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” for family and religious groups, Fox moved the series back to December. “We came to the realization that this is a Christmas franchise,” Mr. Johnson said. “It’s a time of the year that is full of wonder and when families go see movies together.” If “Voyage of the Dawn Treader” is deemed a success — still a big if, since it must compete in a very crowded movie marketplace — Fox and Walden have two directions to go. “The Silver Chair” is the obvious choice since it is the fourth book in the series, and one major character carries over. But Mr. Weil said another option was “The Magician’s Nephew,” a prequel to “The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,” and more of a comic romp. “More important than what film is next is simply that the franchise continues,” Mr. Weil said. “Fingers crossed.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/movies/05tron.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">A First-Timer Directs ‘Tron: Legacy’ for Disney<date>Published: December 3, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELESTHE very first feature that Joseph Kosinski has ever directed — “Tron: Legacy” — cruises into theaters on Dec. 17, and it’s not exactly a cinematic baby step. A $170 million budget. State-of-the-art 3-D visual effects. A three-year marketing campaign. An extensive line of related toys, clothes, jewelry and electronics. A spinoff television show. Theme park tie-ins. Overt hopes for a sequel. Pressure? Just a little. But late last month, as Mr. Kosinski showed “Tron: Legacy” to his cast for the first time, he was the epitome of calm; an ice sculpture would have looked like a nervous wreck next to him. “I’ve got some bad news for you,” he said to Olivia Wilde, who plays a cyber warrior named Quorra. “You’re no longer in the movie.” Ms. Wilde looked at him, blinking. Mr. Kosinski, an architect by training, waited a beat and then smiled. “Just kidding.” Earlier that day Mr. Kosinski, 36, slouched on a sofa in his dimly lighted office, took a careful sip of mint tea and tried to explain his unflappable demeanor. “As a director, if you know what you want, then it’s not scary,” he said. “I had a very clear idea of what I wanted ‘Tron: Legacy’ to look like.” If he came across as more arrogant, you might believe that he is really this confident. But he doesn’t. Raised in Marshalltown, Iowa — population 26,000 — he is quiet, polite and interested in other people’s opinions in a way that is rare in moviedom’s major leagues. Instead the cool exterior seems designed to keep people out of his head. After all, when a reporter asked him a silly question — what kind of building best describes you? — he gave a revealing answer: “Tall and thin with no windows.” Handing over a major motion picture to a director with a very thin résumé is not unheard of, in part because vision matters even in risk-averse Hollywood. (Newbie directors can also be easier for studios to control.) Joseph McGivney Nichol, better known as McG, had only directed two shorts and several music videos when Sony gave him a $100 million budget to make “Charlie’s Angels.” Michael Bay was best known for directing a Meat Loaf video when he landed “Bad Boys,” the 1995 Will Smith vehicle. And David Fincher’s directing experience was mostly limited to commercials and music videos (Madonna’s “Vogue”) when he was given “Alien3.” But “Tron: Legacy,” as evidenced by the Category 5 marketing storm that Walt Disney Studios has whipped up on its behalf, is not just any multiplex behemoth. The goal is a juggernaut franchise on the scale of “Pirates of the Caribbean,” a series that appeals squarely to boys but is mainstream enough to lure everyone else and hit a cultural nerve. Disney has been taking more risks lately. A gutsy move to rename its Rapunzel movie “Tangled” to play down the princess paid off with stellar Thanksgiving ticket sales, for instance. But “Tron” marks one of its biggest movie gambles ever, not only because of its huge production and marketing cost (an estimated $150 million globally) but because Disney has moved forward with spinoffs — “Tron: Uprising,” an ambitious animated series for Disney Channel and Disney XD, is already deep in production — without waiting to see how the film is received. “Tron: Legacy,” written by the “Lost” alumni Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, also revisits sacred ground for science fiction fans. The first “Tron,” released by Disney in 1982, was a box office disappointment (as was “Blade Runner” that same year), but its computer-generated effects and story line — a hacker is pulled inside a computer and forced to play space-age gladiator games — deeply influenced a generation of techies. “It’s a science-fiction story that actually came true: inside a computer is a world where you, or a version of you, can go and live,” said Steven Lisberger, who wrote and directed “Tron” and served as a producer on the sequel. “I’m assuming you’ve heard of Facebook?” Another now-quaint notion: “Tron” was banned from the Oscar race for visual effects because using a computer was considered cheating. So the basic challenge for “Tron: Legacy” is twofold. It must be as cutting-edge as Mr. Lisberger’s movie, or the core fan base will crucify it. At the same time it must be accessible enough — warm enough despite all of the chilly white and blue neon — to attract rank-and-file moviegoers, particularly older ones. How did Mr. Kosinski convince Disney he was remotely qualified to shoulder this load? It sounds corny, but it all started back in 2007 with one guy who believed in him: Sean Bailey, a Disney producer who was trying to figure out how to reinvent “Tron.” Mr. Bailey had heard through the Hollywood grapevine about a director of commercials — that would be Mr. Kosinski — who had an unusual visual style.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/opinion/04frantz.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">It’s a Small Town After All<date>Published: December 3, 2010</date><text>RARELY has a town been conceived and constructed in the glare of publicity and aura of hope that greeted Disney’s master-planned, picture-perfect village of Celebration in central Florida. Expectations were so high that, in November 1995, 4,000 people entered into a lottery for the chance to win the right to pay 25 percent over the market price to move into one of the first 500 or so homes.Many of those pioneers expected Celebration to recreate the ideal of Disney World just a few miles away, not for a weeklong holiday, but for 52 weeks of the year. They thought their children would get straight A’s at the model school and that there would never be a weed in their lawns. For the solidly middle-class, overwhelmingly white population, this was the adventure of a lifetime, the chance to start over in a town paved with great expectations. Reality seemed to catch up with the utopian village, which Disney gave up control of a few years ago, when residents awoke on Monday morning to find that one of their neighbors, a 58-year-old retired schoolteacher, had been murdered. The yellow crime-scene tape surrounding his condo contrasted with the nearby town square, which was decorated for Christmas and awash in holiday music from speakers hidden in the foliage. Then, on Thursday, another resident fatally shot himself after a standoff with sheriff’s deputies. The apparently unrelated deaths showed the world what people in Celebration already knew: life behind the town’s white picket fences wasn’t perfect after all. We moved to Celebration with our two children in 1997. We were among the first residents, though we arrived with our eyes wide open and a contract to write a book about living in Disney’s brave new town. We found out just how strange a place we had chosen when a new neighbor told us that he and his family had considered going to Mexico for vacation, but found they had just as much fun at the Mexico pavilion at Epcot Center at Disney World. Another neighbor — a security guard at Disney — kept a six-foot-high Mickey Mouse in his front window, which our children found a little creepy. But there was a spirit of camaraderie that everyone embraced, even we skeptics. The town felt like a movie set. Architects like Michael Graves and Philip Johnson designed its public buildings. Rocking chairs lined the man-made lake in the center of town; they weren’t tied down and they were never stolen. Houses were variations on a limited number of designs, based on the architecture and feel of old coastal villages. They were clustered around parks, with porches hugging the sidewalks to encourage neighborliness. The community rulebook mandated the color of the houses and the varieties of plants in the pristine yards. Everything spoke softly of small-town America, family values and safety. But long before the schoolteacher’s body was discovered on Monday, many people in Celebration had already realized that Disney’s social imagineering couldn’t create a bubble of immunity. By the time we moved away in 1999, the pixie dust had begun to fade for some of the diehard believers. There had been a spate of divorces, a couple of domestic abuse cases, a handful of stolen bikes and even an armed robbery. The years have changed the footprint as well, and not for the better. Celebration’s initial design of a downtown core to emphasize walking over cars and friendliness over isolation started to disappear even before Disney ceded control. Ever-larger houses have spilled across hundreds of acres of reclaimed swamp, replacing the small-town feel with something closer to traditional suburban sprawl. The town now has about 10,000 residents. There was another kind of blight, too. When we drove down our old street a few months ago to visit friends, two of the 16 houses stood empty, the paint peeling and the once-pristine lawns burned out in the scorching sun — a story repeated on almost every street in the town. The housing foreclosures that has swept across Florida hit Celebration hard. One real estate Web site recently listed 492 foreclosures in town, and housing prices have dropped sharply from the highs of the middle part of the last decade. The movie theater, once a focal point of downtown, shut its doors on Thanksgiving Day. The wave of news coverage that accompanied the violence this week in Celebration says more about society’s enduring fascination with the unobtainable vision of utopia than it does about the town itself. Residents there long ago got over the idea that their home was another ride at the Magic Kingdom. They know that not everyone lives happily ever after, even in the town that Disney built.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/movies/homevideo/28kehr.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney’s ‘Fantasia’ and ‘Walt &amp; El Grupo’ on Blu-ray<date>Published: November 24, 2010</date><text>FOR generations now “Fantasia” has been both faulted for its highbrow pretensions and derided as low-brow kitsch, frequently by the same critics and sometimes in the same sentence. But this 1940 animated feature from Walt Disney remains unassailable, a cultural artifact that stands beyond simple categorization, perhaps Hollywood’s closest brush with the avant-garde.Over the course of eight animated segments covering a range of concert music from Bach (Toccata and Fugue in D Minor) to Stravinsky (“The Rite of Spring”), Disney and his artists explore a range of animation styles — from pure abstraction to academic realism — that sometimes illuminate the music and sometimes combat it, but always to dazzling effect. After a 10-year home-video moratorium, “Fantasia” returns this week in a magnificent Blu-ray edition, featuring a brilliance of color and clarity of sound that have probably not been recaptured since the film’s premiere at the Broadway Theater in New York City on Nov. 13, 1940. Of course even the high definition of the Blu-ray format can’t approach the radiant beauty of a first generation nitrate print, and even with 7.1 channels the Blu-ray “Fantasia” offers only a hint of the original sound quality. Fantasound, as Disney’s engineers called it, was the first commercial use of surround sound in a motion picture and required the installation of some 30 to 90 speakers (sources vary) at various points in the auditorium. (The Fantasound system was heard in only a handful of first-run engagements.) But as approximations go, this one will do very nicely. The basis of the new disc is Scott McQueen’s 2000 restoration of the original 124-minute version, which was edited down to 81 minutes when the movie went into wide release in 1942. All of the surviving interstitial material — with the music critic Deems Taylor introducing the individual pieces — has been reinstated, although the original optical recordings of Taylor’s voice have been lost, and his lines have been dubbed by the voice artist Corey Burton. The originality of “Fantasia” doesn’t lie in its attempt to translate music into visual terms. The movie is part of a long lineage of “visual music” films and light shows that begins with the “color organs” of the 18th century and includes work by a number of independent filmmakers of the 1920s and ’30s, like Mary Ellen Bute (whose 1938 “Synchromy No. 4” also uses the Bach Toccata) and Oskar Fischinger (who worked on the Bach sequence in “Fantasia” but left when he came to believe that Disney was making it too representational). What’s genuinely daring about “Fantasia” is Disney’s decision to forgo an overall audience-grabbing narrative in favor of a discontinuous series of episodes, each operating in a different style. Rather than depend on linear, what-next storytelling and characters that invite audience identification, “Fantasia” shifts through a series of moods. It goes from the playful (“Dance of the Hours,” directed by the great character animators T. Hee and Norm Ferguson, and probably one of the greatest pieces of full-scale cel animation ever committed to film) to the diabolical (“Night on Bald Mountain,” directed by Wilfred Jackson with references including Universal horror movies and medieval woodcuts). Midcentury modernist in many of its design decisions, “Fantasia” slips into postmodernist collage in its construction, while its lack of dialogue refers back to the cinema’s silent roots. Apart from the interstitials, the only human voices we hear come at the very end, when a chorus sings English lyrics to Shubert’s “Ave Maria,” written for the film by the novelist Rachel Field, a moment that never fails to provide a sense of transcendence and release. But for all of its time-shifting aesthetics, “Fantasia” necessarily remains a movie of its moment. The critic Arlene Croce has seen in the film’s depiction of a superhuman, authoritarian conductor (performed as a towering silhouette by Leopold Stokowski) an uncomfortable echo of the fascist leaders who had come to power in Europe. The original version of “The Pastoral Symphony” featured a black female centaur who functioned as a maid to her pin-up perky, light-skinned sisters, and who has been optically zoomed out of the image since the 1969 reissue. On a more progressive level the “Rite of Spring” sequence offers an unabashedly evolutionist history of life on earth that might not be welcome in certain Texas school districts today. Presented as a special event in the initial Fantasound engagements, with reserved-seat tickets and a 15-minute intermission, “Fantasia” seemed headed toward success, and played at the Broadway Theater for more than a year. But when RKO put the 82-minute version into general release in 1942, it failed to capture the attention of a public preoccupied by news of the war, and it soon became clear that “Fantasia” was a flop.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://movies.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/movies/24tangled.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">‘Tangled,’ the New Old-Fashioned Disney - Review<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>To watch “Tangled,” in three dimensions or two, is like entering a familiar old neighborhood that has been tastefully and thoroughly renovated. Not gentrified, exactly, and certainly not razed, but modernized.The architecture — in particular that castle, its tower garlanded with clouds — is more or less as you remember it, and among the inhabitants is the usual crew of princesses, emotive beasts (a horse and a chameleon), villains and buffoons. The ambient noises (music by Alan Menken) take you back to a charmed world of swoony longing and sprightly mischief. But the décor is shinier, the pace a little faster, the overall atmosphere slick and efficient, with a few welcome grace notes of self-conscious classicism. This is, all in all, a pleasant place to visit. Which is saying a lot, given how awful it could be in recent years. (Remember “Chicken Little”? “Treasure Planet”? I hope not.) “Tangled” is the 50th animated feature from Disney, and its look and spirit convey a modified, updated but nonetheless sincere and unmistakable quality of old-fashioned Disneyness. Hewing to a corporate tradition that is also, like it or not — and even if you say you don’t, you really do! — a glorious touchstone of American popular culture, this film, directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard from a script by Dan Fogelman, is a lavish, romantic musical fairy tale. In keeping with the company’s current Pixar-dominated aesthetic, it has a story that takes some liberties with the genre; a nimble, kinetic visual style; and a willingness to marry complex psychology with storybook simplicity. “Tangled” begins, like far too many animated features these days, with some annoyingly smart-alecky voice-over narration, courtesy of a charming rascal named Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). This temporary hijacking of a princess’s tale by her square-jawed love interest seems like a crude commercial calculation, a sign to the anxious boys in the audience that things aren’t going to be too girly, or to Disneyphobes that the studio can bring some DreamWorks-style attitude. (It may also be further evidence of the Pixar touch, since the guys in that super-cool animation club are notably reluctant to place female characters at the center of the action.) Luckily, Flynn shuts up before too long, allowing the story to find its proper center of gravity, which belongs to Rapunzel (Mandy Moore), an exiled princess shut up in a tower with only her magic hair and her pet lizard for consolation. Also living there is her mother, or at any rate the evil sorceress called Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), who snatched the girl from her real parents and has raised her in cruel, passive-aggressive physical and psychological captivity. On its long road to a theater near you, “Tangled” had a few different titles. As far as I know, none of them were “Rapunzel: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire,” but the film’s portrait of maternal monstrosity may remind you of “Precious,” albeit without the incest, the poverty or the violence. (A weaponized frying pan does come into play, but not as an instrument of domestic abuse.) The Disney pantheon is full of evil stepmothers, though none quite match Mother Gothel for sheer sadistic intensity. A classic underminer, she has brainwashed Rapunzel into loving her, and her brutal selfishness is camouflaged in sweet-voiced expressions of solicitude. Really, though, she keeps the girl around only because of that golden hair, which has the power to heal wounds, cure sickness and, most important for Mother Gothel’s purposes, reverse the aging process. But Rapunzel is young, curious and lively, and as she approaches her 18th birthday, she sets off on the usual heroic voyage of self-discovery, accompanied by Flynn and pursued by her mother, Flynn’s former partners in crime (he is a thief as well as a charmer) and a tireless police horse whose puffing, prancing and mugging represent the perfect marriage of Pixarian technical bravura and Disneyesque expressive cartooning. The action sequences are brisk and breathless, and the cute and grotesque secondary characters provide bits of comic diversion, but frankly you could get chases and gags of this kind from the animation division of just about any major studio these days. The heart of Disney animation lies in song and spectacle, and while none of the musical compositions here are quite at the level of “The Little Mermaid” or “Beauty and the Beast,” they are good enough, and made even better by the range and clarity of Ms. Moore’s voice. For the eye, there are sequences that have some of the ravishing beauty and exquisite detail of the great, old hand-drawn Disney features, including a few that make gorgeous use of 3-D technology. A scene of paper lanterns descending through mist onto water is especially breathtaking, partly because it departs from the usual 3-D insistence on deep focus and sharply defined images, creating an experience that is almost tactile in its dreamy softness. Like much of “Tangled,” this moment gives a new look to some very familiar magic. “Tangled” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Mild and sweet, but sometimes also rough and scary. TANGLED Opens on Wednesday nationwide. Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard; written by Dan Fogelman; music by Alan Menken, lyrics by Glenn Slater; produced by Roy Conli; released by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes. WITH THE VOICES OF: Mandy Moore (Rapunzel), Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider), Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel), Brad Garrett (Hook Hand), Jeffrey Tambor (Big Nose), M. C.

She’s got pluck, this teenage princess, but all that hair is an awful lot for one little animated head to carry. The real-life weight sitting on top of “Tangled,” set for release in 3-D on Wednesday by Walt Disney Animation Studios, is equally overwhelming. As the 50th animated movie created by the studio that invented the medium — but has lately had a hard time finding its voice — “Tangled” must answer an ethereal but important question: Exactly what is Disney’s animated identity these days? Disney animated movies used to mean something very specific. They were painterly fantasies, often centered on a young hero in generational conflict, that dripped with sophisticated visuals — think about the square edges in “Sleeping Beauty” or the swirling ballroom scene in “Beauty and the Beast.” The music was impossibly catchy. (Try to shake “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” from “Cinderella.”) Scenery-chewing female villains (Cruella de Vil, Ursula the Sea Witch) mixed with distinct, unexpected caregivers (the dwarfs, Rafiki from “The Lion King”) amid the songs, life lessons and comic business. As Walt Disney himself was fond of saying, “For every laugh, there should be a tear.” But the studio clung too long to the formulas that had worked before — particularly hand-drawn animation — and suddenly a snooze parade of releases (“Treasure Planet,” “Brother Bear,” “Home on the Range,” “Chicken Little,” “Meet the Robinsons”) sent audiences running for the dazzling new digital imagery pioneered by Pixar and DreamWorks Animation. People came to know that a Pixar film meant grown-up cinematic touches (nimble tracking shots, subtle changes in the texture of light), unconventional plots — a scream-processing factory, an old man on a balloon flight — and swiftly edited chase sequences, usually in the final act. DreamWorks Animation excelled at snarky, sequel-seeking romps brimming with pop culture references and vocal performances from big-name stars. A Disney animated movie? More often than not, that stood for rudderless mediocrity. “There has been no single guiding sensibility, and that is an enormous problem with this kind of cinematic endeavor,” said Neal Gabler, author of “Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination.” “To make art you need a sensibility.” “Tangled” could mark a turning point. For the first time since John Lasseter and Ed Catmull of Pixar were put in charge of Walt Disney Animation Studios, a duty that came with Disney’s $7.4 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006, the pair have had enough time with “Tangled” to pull off a masterpiece. Mr. Lasseter in particular has spent over three years working on the film — as much time as he has spent on some Pixar hits over the years. “I think we’re there,” Mr. Lasseter said of a creative turnaround at Disney. “This film is as good as a Pixar film, but it’s classic Disney, and I love that: heart, humor, beauty, music, wonderment, the love story.” He added, “Some people believe audiences today have grown past what is classic Disney storytelling, that they have become too cynical for it. I will never believe that.” Audiences expecting a solemn retelling of the classic Rapunzel tale will be disappointed. The core of the fairy tale is all there — “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair” — but the story has been greatly expanded. After a womanizing bandit crawls into Rapunzel’s prison tower, she convinces him to take her on a tour of the kingdom, a rollicking adventure that ends with love. By some measures this is classic Disney storytelling. There is a princess at the center, the mother figure is the villain, and the setting is magical. It’s loaded with physical humor. Rapunzel sings a score written by Alan Menken (“Aladdin,” “Beauty and the Beast”). And some moments seem direct nods to Disney classics; when Flynn and Rapunzel gaze into each other’s eyes in a slowly spinning rowboat, it recalls the lush “Kiss the Girl” number in “The Little Mermaid.” Rapunzel herself has a flow and grace — what old-time Disney artists call “the golden poses” — that is not typical of computer animation, which has a hard time with curves, but is a hallmark of the Disney princesses. (To achieve this look Disney developed a tool to allow artists to draw on a computerized screen with a stylus rather than using a mouse.) But “Tangled” is also a departure. There are modern story elements, never-before-seen technological advances and lots of Lasseteresque touches.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/12/business/media/12disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Ends Strong Year With Soft Quarter<date>Published: November 11, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company reported unexpectedly soft fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, hurt by a calendar quirk, the shift of some ESPN revenue to the third quarter and continued weakness in the theme park business.Disney was caught in a moment of uncharacteristic disarray on Thursday afternoon after an employee mistakenly posted its financial results early — during trading instead of after the market close, as is the company’s policy — and shares tumbled nearly 3 percent, to $35.93. (Shares perked up a bit in after-hours trading.) “We are investigating how this occurred,” said a Disney spokesman of the early release. “We do regret any confusion caused by this incident.” The timing may not have been as jarring had the company’s results been more in line with expectations, as has been the case for a string of quarters. For the quarter ended Oct. 2, Disney reported a profit of $835 million, or 43 cents a share, a 7 percent decrease from $895 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Those results reflected a series of one-time events, including the shift in ESPN revenue and a $58 million write-off of programming costs at Lifetime, a cable channel Disney partly owns. The latest quarter also was a week shorter than the equivalent one last year. “I agree it was a very messy quarter,” said James A. Rasulo, Disney’s chief financial officer, in response to analysts’ questions on a conference call. Results for the fiscal year, on the other hand, were unequivocally strong. Net income rose 20 percent, to $3.96 billion, from $3.31 billion. Revenue increased 5 percent, to $38.1 billion. Although Disney said holiday reservations at its hotels were strengthening, fourth-quarter operating income at its Parks and Resorts unit declined 8 percent, to $316 million. The division was hurt by higher labor costs and a decline in sales at the Disney Vacation Club, a timeshare business. Disney said it was optimistic that an improving economy combined with new attractions would buoy that part of its business in the quarters to come. Bright spots in the quarter included an advertising uptick at ABC, where the pricing of ads is running 23 percent ahead of rates set in the spring, according to Mr. Rasulo. He said that ABC also recorded lower costs for prime-time programming, sports and news operations. Disney’s movie operations swung to a profit of $104 million, from a loss of $13 million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase was primarily due to $648 million in international ticket sales for “Toy Story 3.” The movie studio, while typically a small contributor to Disney’s ultimate profitability, is considered critically important because its releases can lift other Disney divisions, notably consumer products. Indeed, merchandise related to “Toy Story 3” drove profit up 22 percent in that division, to $184 million. Marvel merchandise also contributed to the increase. Disney, following custom, gave little insight into what particulars the future fiscal year could bring. Mr. Rasulo noted that pension and post-retirement medical expenses would again hurt results at its theme park unit. The company will also record an increase in capital expenditures of at least $1 billion as a new cruise ship comes on line and various parks expand, particularly the Disneyland-adjacent California Adventure. “We are also optimistic about our creative pipeline,” Mr. Rasulo said, noting particularly high hopes for “Cars 2” from Pixar, which is set for a June release.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE6DB1339F930A35752C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">ARTSBEAT; Disney Star Enters Rehab<date>Published: November 3, 2010</date><text>Demi Lovato, the 18-year-old pop singer and Disney star, has withdrawn from a concert tour to check into a rehabilitation facility, The Associated Press reported. Ms. Lovato, a star of the Disney Channel series ''Sonny With a Chance'' and its popular ''Camp Rock'' television movies, and whose albums include ''Don't Forget'' and ''Here We Go Again,'' had been performing with the Jonas Brothers, another Disney act. But her representatives said in a statement she left the tour over the weekend to address ''emotional and physical issues.'' The statement added: ''Demi has decided to take personal responsibility for her actions and seek help. She is doing just that. Demi and her family ask that the media respect her privacy during this difficult time.'' The statement did not specify what treatment she was receiving or the location of the facility. In a 2009 interview with The New York Times, Ms. Lovato talked about her rapid ascent to fame, saying, ''Some days I get really excited, and some days I get scared because I feel like I have to live up to certain pressures.''

By the way, the kid is also a space alien, on the run from some other aliens who are anything but pretty.After two years in the throes of a financial restructuring, Steven Spielberg and his DreamWorks Studios are back with some typically Spielbergian stuff. And they are starting the next round with the sort of fanciful, scary, sometimes heartwarming movies they know best — and their new distribution ally, Walt Disney Studios, needs most. Success for DreamWorks might quickly return Disney to its former status as a “full service” studio offering a wide range of action movies and dramas, after it had focused for years on animation and family fare that paid the bills but kept the company out of the Hollywood mainstream. It would also vindicate both a new film management team, and the decision by the Disney chief executive, Robert A. Iger, to dismantle the company’s Miramax art film unit. DreamWorks Studios is completely separate from DreamWorks Animation, a publicly traded animation company whose films are still distributed by Paramount Pictures. But DreamWorks is not starting with challenging films like its Oscar winner “American Beauty” or its hit musical “Dreamgirls.” Instead, it plans to produce one or two outsize blockbuster-style movies each year, and four or five smaller films that stick with Hollywood’s more reliable genres. The caution is understandable. Founded in 1994 by Mr. Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, the original DreamWorks SKG took about three years to release its first movie. It was an international thriller called “The Peacemaker” with George Clooney, who had soft credentials as an action star. It fell flat, embarrassing the new studio, with just $110 million in worldwide ticket sales. This time, there are no long shots. The inaugural film from the revamped DreamWorks, “I Am Number Four,” with those hormonal teenagers and nasty aliens — and a heavy “Twilight” element — is set for release on Disney’s Touchstone banner on Feb. 18. Mr. Spielberg is not expected to take a credit on the film, remaining in his executive role. But neither is he taking chances with the first in a string of movies that will inevitably have investors, business allies and the audience watching for his trademark screen magic. “There’s a lot of him in there,” said Marti Noxon, who is among the writers of “I Am Number Four,” and is perhaps best known for her work on the television series “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.” More than once, said Ms. Noxon, she found herself laboring with Mr. Spielberg in a conference room in his adobe-style complex on the Universal Studios lot here in an effort to get the teenagers and aliens just right. DreamWorks — now owned by Mr. Spielberg and Stacey Snider, with financial backing from Reliance Big Entertainment of India and distribution via Disney — carefully picked the release date. It is the kind of winter slot that has been good to popcorn fare like “Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” which generated over $183 million at the global box office last year, and “Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,” which took in $226.4 million in February. The director of “I Am Number Four,” D. J. Caruso, gave DreamWorks a pair of PG-13 hits, “Disturbia” and “Eagle Eye,” during its unhappy tenure as a partner of Paramount Pictures. The producer is Michael Bay, who mixed teenagers and space creatures for DreamWorks and Paramount in the blockbuster “Transformers” series. In an e-mail, Mr. Bay said he brought the project to Mr. Spielberg, whom he described as a “mentor and friend.” That “I Am Number Four” should be first up from the new DreamWorks in many ways owes more to the accidents of moviemaking than any grand design. After finally securing about $850 million in financing from various sources about 14 months ago, company executives approved a half-dozen films, all of which were in production this year, according to Ms. Snider, who plays down the drama in starting anew. “DreamWorks has been doing this for 16 years, and I’ve been with Steven for four and a half years,” she said. “He’s made movies for every studio in town,” Ms. Snider added. “But if it feels like a debut, I guess that’s good.” “Cowboys &amp; Aliens,” the most expensive film on the new DreamWorks slate, will cost $100 million or more, but it is a co-production with Universal Pictures, which will release it next July. Directed by Jon Favreau, with Harrison Ford in a lead role, it is an action-fantasy about a fight among cowboys, Indians and aliens. A remake of “Fright Night,” which is directed by Craig Gillespie (whose credits include “Mr. Woodcock”) and written by Ms. Noxon, is also on the list. It puts teenagers and vampires in a 3-D horror romp, and is set for release by Disney in August.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/technology/18fame.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">FameTown, New Facebook Game, Puts Spin on Hollywood<date>Published: October 17, 2010</date><text>If being a virtual farmer or make-believe mobster is not for you, Michael D. Eisner hopes that playing the role of a movie star in a digital version of Hollywood will have its appeal.On Monday, Mr. Eisner, the former chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, will announce a new Facebook game called FameTown in which players will be virtual aspiring actors trying to make it big. FameTown, which is modeled after popular Facebook games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars, is the latest effort by Hollywood to capitalize on the soaring popularity of social games. Those efforts include Disney’s acquisition of Playdom, the third-largest maker of social games, for as much as $763 million in July. “We think there is an exciting business here,” Mr. Eisner said in an interview. FameTown, which will be released on Nov. 1, is being introduced in an increasingly crowded and competitive field, with hundreds of social games vying for the attention of Facebook users. The goal of FameTown is for virtual actors to move from the D-List to the A-List. Players can pick which make-believe movie star they want to be and then earn points by completing tasks like meeting the cast and director. They can also improve their social standing by attending the right parties or charity events, and they can hire assistants, agents or publicists to help their virtual careers. Like many social games, FameTown will make money through the sale of virtual goods; most of what can be earned by playing the game can also be bought with real cash. Mr. Eisner said the social dynamics of FameTown were not far off from those of Hollywood. “Half the people who work in the movies worked in the mail room or as waiters,” he said. FameTown was created by a start-up in Los Angeles called Diversion. Mr. Eisner, through his investment firm, the Tornante Company, is the sole investor in Diversion. He declined to comment on the size of the investment. The project was brought to him by Shawn Fanning, the founder of the music-sharing company Napster, who became friends with some of the founders of Diversion by playing online games. Mr. Fanning is an adviser and shareholder of Diversion. Mr. Eisner is not the only Hollywood mogul paying attention to the popularity of social games. During a recent conference, Jeffrey R. Katzenberg, the head of DreamWorks Animation, said that if he were starting his career all over, he would want to be Mark Pincus, who is chief executive of Zynga, the maker of FarmVille, Mafia Wars and other social games. It is the industry’s leader with nearly 220 million people playing its games.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406E6D7133FF931A25753C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">ARTSBEAT; An Appetizer of 'Tron'<date>Published: October 12, 2010</date><text>Borrowing a marketing ploy from 20th Century Fox and ''Avatar,'' the Walt Disney Company said it would preview more than 20 minutes of its forthcoming ''Tron: Legacy'' free at Imax theaters around the world.

But the bigger and truer stars of this enjoyable, sometimes accidentally entertaining movie are the five horses that take turns playing Secretariat — one was used for running, another posed for the cameras — along with the memory of that original breathtaking beauty. This was a champion whose races thrilled the usual society swells and off-track gamblers along with a larger public swept up by the story of the big red horse who could and did.Squeaky clean and as square as a military flattop, “Secretariat” doesn’t take the wide or long view when it comes to horse racing or anything else, despite an occasional oblique nod to Vietnam. Instead it sticks to the Disney gospel that life means following your dreams, which here belong largely to those who surrounded Secretariat in his glory years, including his owner, Penny Chenery (Ms. Lane, sincere and dulled down), and trainer, Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich, insincere and showboating). Don’t fret, though: there are plenty of pretty horses — and a few hilarious close-ups of Secretariat and a rival at the starting gate eyeballing each other like boxers in the ring — even if the triumph here is of the human spirit and not the horse. That tale gets swishing in Denver in 1969 with Penny, immaculately dressed and coiffed, whipping something up for her four children and husband, Jack Tweedy (Dylan Walsh). One phone call later and Penny and brood are back in her Virginia childhood home, burying her mother. She stays to care for her ailing father, Chris (Scott Glenn), a horseman whose mind and farm are slipping away. After a Kodak-moment flashback of her father and her as a child, Penny determines to save her patrimony, telling her husband that she’s taking care of business, a declaration of independence that might resonate more inspirationally if the movie actually showed you how she managed to care for the farm and her children (two of whom look under 12). But uplift is the name of the game in “Secretariat,” not little details like life. Directed by Randall Wallace with his previous lack of subtly (“We Were Soldiers”), it opens with a shot of the sky and Penny reading in voice-over a passage about horses from the Book of Job: “Do you give the horse his strength?” (That passage, in a different translation, is also used in Peter Shaffer’s play “Equus.”) The rest of the writing can be blamed on Mike Rich, whose screenplay was, as the credits put it, “suggested by” William Nack’s book “Secretariat: The Making of a Champion.” It’s hard not to think that the folks behind “The Blind Side” — last year’s inspirational about a steel magnolia of faith and a sports hero — deserve some credit too. Alas, Ms. Lane, smoothed and nearly emptied out, doesn’t have the material or direction that Sandra Bullock enjoyed in “The Blind Side” (or the flattering costumes). Penny Chenery’s story is not uninteresting, and she certainly doesn’t appear to have been the paper doll of the movie. The real woman hired the William Morris Agency to book Secretariat’s appearances, and said of her horse-racing life, “I love the prestige, the excitement and the money.” The movie’s Penny spends a lot of time fretting and every so often stares meaningfully into Secretariat’s eyes (or muzzle). That said, in one mad, delicious moment, she does bathe Secretariat alongside his black groom, Eddie Sweat (Nelsan Ellis, from HBO’s “True Blood”), the two humans working up quite the lather and harmonious vision to the sounds of “Oh Happy Day” (When Jesus Washed). What did Secretariat think at that moment? The question seems reasonable given how the movie treats its animal star (familiar Disney meat) as both a cute-and-cuddly and a spiritual messenger. It was said that Secretariat liked to be photographed, a delightful idea that the movie embraces by showing him turn to the cameras. And certainly the movie flirts with the standard Disney take on animals as sentient creatures in command of their destinies and serving human needs. Yet this fuzzy humanism is at odds with the movie’s other message — deliriously blasted during the final race of the Triple Crown with reprises of Job and “Oh Happy Day” — that Secretariat galloped down the stretch guided by something other than the jockey’s crop. What made Secretariat run? Sometimes it was the whip, which the movie omits, much as it elides anything really uncomfortable about horse racing. Money played a part, though it generally doesn’t in the movie, an exception being Penny’s shrewd decision to sell shares in Secretariat’s future as a sire. Every so often, mainly when one of the digital cameras is hovering right next to the horse as he tears down the track, his legs churning and breath hammering, you can pretend that Secretariat ran because he could and not because someone put a saddle on him and rode him out of the gate. It’s a pleasurable, seductive fantasy partly because, as we have known from the start of cinema, the sight of a running horse is a beautiful thing. “Secretariat” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The only dirty things here are the jockey silks. SECRETARIAT Opens on Friday nationwide.

Pitaro, vice president of Yahoo Media, and John Pleasants, chief executive of Playdom, a booming social gaming company that Disney bought in July, were named co-presidents of the Disney Interactive Media Group. Their hiring follows the departure on Sept. 24 of Steve Wadsworth as the division president. Mr. Pitaro, credited with building Yahoo’s sports and entertainment properties, will oversee Disney.com and related sites like Family.com, as well as DigiSynd, Disney’s social media marketing agency. Mr. Pleasants, whose experience stretches to senior roles at Electronic Arts and Ticketmaster, will run games, overseeing online, console, social and mobile. The reorganization is an acknowledgment that there is untapped opportunity in the division, which struggled under Mr. Wadsworth to find a winning strategy. Should Disney.com be more of a marketing portal or an entertainment destination? How do these disparate gaming entities work together? Why have internal efforts to build new online worlds failed? And perhaps most important: if Disney is so aggressive in interactive media, why is the division still losing money? The unit lost $65 million in the most recent quarter on revenue of $197 million. “We have embraced a strategy to adopt new technology and adapt to the changes it is creating. Now it’s time to create more focus,” Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, said. Mr. Iger added that splitting duties in the division was a reflection of growth; Disney has completed a string of digital acquisitions in recent months, including Tapulous, a maker of mobile games. In terms of Disney.com, he said the goal was to make the site into more of a stand-alone entertainment portal, with revenue coming from a mix of advertising, subscriptions and pay-per-view video. “It’s a work in progress but not the fault of anybody there,” he said. Disney’s interactive unit will be the focus of attention in the months ahead as the company tries to introduce its first major video game blockbuster, Epic Mickey. Although there has been early positive talk about the game, which involves Mickey Mouse in a subterranean world, it is not set for release until after the Thanksgiving weekend shopping period, which could dent sales. Also important is the response to World of Cars, Disney’s latest attempt to create an online world around a movie property. Analysts were encouraged, until recently, by Disney’s decision to delay the introduction of the virtual world in an effort to improve the product. (Previous efforts included a Pirates of the Caribbean world.) Mr. Pitaro and Mr. Pleasants will start work on Oct. 18. They will both report to Mr. Iger, with Mr. Pitaro based in Burbank, Calif., and Mr. Pleasants in the San Francisco area.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/27/business/media/27disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">New Team Alters Disney Studios’ Path<date>Published: September 26, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — When you spend 38 years producing movies, as Jerry Bruckheimer has, you see studio regimes come and go — out with the old, in with the new. The circumstances differ, but one aspect, he said, is always the same: “Hollywood kills you when you bring in an outsider.”Walt Disney Studios risked it anyway, firing its longtime chairman, Dick Cook, last September and replacing him — to dropped jaws in the movie world — with Rich Ross, a children’s television executive from within Disney, who cites “Tootsie” as his favorite film. As Mr. Ross began ripping apart the studio, Hollywood’s chattering class — agents, publicists, rival executives — started to tear into him, albeit in the strictly off-the-record way typical of the industry’s culture. The sniping, largely developing around Mr. Ross’s early marketing decisions, is rooted in self-preservation: The last thing the broader movie industry wants is a television guy showing that its way of conducting business is antiquated. Just who is this outsider who is talking about revolutionizing our business? Mr. Ross, 48, has been doing more than talking, and experienced hands like Mr. Bruckheimer have not always been happy about that. Quickly, Mr. Ross fired a string of top lieutenants, started experimenting with unconventional advertising campaigns and went against industry norms for a DVD release (“Alice in Wonderland” discs arrived in stores about a month earlier than was typical). In a first for Disney, Mr. Ross asked Pixar Animation to weigh in on live-action filmmaking. “I want to see greater aspirations,” Mr. Ross said, adding that the mandate extended to Disney’s Broadway business, which also falls within his empire. Brimming with confidence, Mr. Ross also made a string of unorthodox hires. He brought in a young producer, Sean Bailey, to run production. Mr. Ross’s new marketing executive, M T Carney, has plenty of pizazz — note the period-free first name — but no movie experience. The overhaul reflects the Walt Disney Company’s belief that the blueprint for running a movie studio needs to be redrawn to reflect a landscape where DVD sales are sputtering, social media is changing film marketing and consumers are demanding to watch films when and where they want. “We’re not saying that everything is going to change, like we’re no longer going to do TV ads or something,” Ms. Carney said. “But we are also not afraid to try new things, to try daring things.” Even the kinds of movies Disney makes has changed. Mr. Ross is no longer interested in developing projects, big or small, that cannot be squarely branded under one of three banners — Disney (family), Pixar (animation) or Marvel (superheroes) — the better to cut through the marketplace clutter. To that end, Disney sold its Miramax specialty unit and will no longer make Touchstone films; that banner will become a distribution mechanism for DreamWorks Studios. New films in the works are guided by A-list directors, the kind who rarely worked with Disney in the past. David Fincher, for example, is working on an adaptation of “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.” Sam Raimi of “Spider-Man” fame is re-imagining “The Wizard of Oz.” These are the sorts of moves that Mr. Bailey calls “innovative, not entirely predictable, but still Disney.” The overhaul has upset some directors and producers. Mr. Bruckheimer attributed disappointing results for his “Sorcerer’s Apprentice” in part to a leadership vacuum in Disney’s marketing department. Mr. Ross fired the studio’s marketing chief in November and did not bring on Ms. Carney until late April. “I got hurt on it on a number of pictures,” Mr. Bruckheimer said, while making certain to note that he also admires Mr. Ross’s enthusiasm, among other traits. Ms. Carney jumped in with both feet — adding the tagline “It’s the Coolest Job Ever” to “Sorcerer” marketing materials — but was learning on the fly and the campaign never jelled. The $150 million picture tanked, with $62.6 million in domestic sales, and Disney took a write-down. (A studio spokesman said that “Sorcerer” has taken in about $145 million overseas.) Jon Turteltaub, a Disney-based producer and director whose credits include the “National Treasure” franchise, struck a jury-is-still-out tone. On the one hand, he said, stability has finally returned. But he said it remained tricky to know where Mr. Ross stood on certain projects. “What would have been an obvious sequel to make a year ago is not as certain now,” Mr. Turteltaub said of a third “National Treasure” movie. “You ask yourself things like, ‘Do these new people have the same desire to make it?’ ” The feedback on Mr. Ross from inside Disney is enormously positive.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/business/26steal.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">A Fight Brews Over Hollywood’s Video ‘Window’<date>Published: September 25, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELESSOMETIME in the next few months, there is likely to be an explosion in the movie business. The question is which studio will detonate the bomb. Tension between studios and theater owners has been simmeringa long time, but it intensified in May, when the Federal Communications Commission issued what appeared on the surface to be an arcane ruling. After two years of prodding from Hollywood, the F.C.C. agreed to let movie studios activate technology to prevent films sold through video-on-demand systems from being copied. Ho-hum? Hardly. The ruling gave studios the ability to pursue a new business — so-called premium V.O.D. — that may be the industry’s best hope of restoring itself to health, now that the bottom has fallen out of the DVD market. Right now, theaters get an exclusive period — 120 days, on average — to serve up new movies. Then the releases appear on television video-on-demand services at a price of about $4.99. Armed with the new copy-blocking technology, studios want to offer new movies on video-on-demand services about 45 days after they arrive in theaters, for a premium price of $24.99. The business opportunity is multifold. With as much as 80 percent of that early V.O.D. revenue going to the studio, movie executives see a new engine to compensate for the sputtering DVD. And for the studios, the need is urgent: DVD sales for the year are expected to total about $9.9 billion, down 30 percent from their peak in 2004, according to Adams Media Research. Studios also want to cut marketing costs by interweaving advertising for theatrical, DVD and video-on-demand releases; reducing the exclusive “window” given to theaters would make it easier to combine those campaigns. Premium V.O.D. would also bring greater consumer awareness to regular video on demand, which has not caught on as much as other rental options like Netflix, according to a research report by Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Barclays Capital. Last but not least, studios are aware that consumers are growing impatient about being unable to access all movies whenever and wherever they want. Layering in an early video-on-demand option might prevent some of those frustrated customers from turning to pirated copies. “There are people who we believe would like to see movies sooner than later and would pay a premium price to do that,” Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, told analysts on a conference call last month. “We are going to become aggressive.” Cable and satellite television providers like Time Warner Cable (which is no longer connected to Warner Brothers) and DirecTV are ready to push the button on premium V.O.D. as soon as they reach a deal with studios. After all, the service would represent another revenue stream for these providers and another way to differentiate themselves with customers. The promise of the new business is one reason that Comcast is so eager for government regulators to clear its deal to take control of NBC Universal, analysts say. SO what’s the problem? DVD retailers, for a start. The likes of Best Buy and Wal-Mart “have told studios they will retaliate against anyone who tries early-release V.O.D. because of the threat it poses to DVD sales,” Richard Greenfield, an analyst at the financial services company BTIG, wrote in a research note last Monday. But the real wrath will come from theater owners, who have made it clear that releasing a movie early on video-on-demand services — thus cutting into their window — would be the equivalent of declaring war. Over the summer, the National Association of Theater Owners took out full-page ads in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter making its opposition clear. The worry for theaters, of course, is that people will be more reluctant to buy movie tickets, at an average cost of almost $8, if they know they can catch the same film just a few weeks later in their living rooms, and for less money than it costs to haul the whole family to the multiplex. Considering that the average moviegoer spends more than $3 on popcorn and soda and the like, the cost of Friday night at the movies for a family of four can easily reach $45 — or much more in cities like New York — even before premium-priced 3-D screenings or possible parking fees are factored in. “While exhibitors understand the new pressures that a weakened DVD market creates for their studio partners,” the ads read in part, “four decades of box-office growth and three straight years of record-breaking box office argue for caution in tampering with a business model that clearly works.” The Big Three theater chains — Regal Entertainment, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark — declined to comment, but smaller theater companies have been more vocal. “Be careful before you cook us all, yourselves included,” wrote Gregory S. Marcus, the chief executive of the Marcus Corporation — the parent of Marcus Theatres, a Midwest exhibitor — in a July opinion article in The Hollywood Reporter.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/relativity-to-exceed-2-billion-in-revenue-chief-says/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Relativity to Exceed $2 Billion in Revenue, Chief Says<date>September 22, 2010, 5:15 am</date><text>Relativity Media, the privately held film financing company, will bring in more than $2 billion in revenue for the first time this year, its chief executive, Ryan Kavanaugh, said Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. The projection would make the company bigger by revenue than Lions Gate Entertainment, the publicly traded studio that posted $1.58 billion in revenue in the year to March, and that is often referred to as a “mini-major” studio. Major Hollywood studios are much larger, with The Walt Disney Company studio posting over $6 billion in revenue last fiscal year, while Time Warner‘s Warner Bros. unit reported more than $11 billion. Mr. Kavanaugh told a conference hosted by the media and entertainment news Web site TheWrap that the company’s adjusted earnings would be four to five times greater than in 2009, adding that the company was ”just above break even” last year. It has co-financed prominent films like Universal Picture’s ”Robin Hood,” which has grossed more than $311 million worldwide. In July, Relativity, backed by the hedge fund Elliott Management, bought the distribution and marketing arm of Overture Films from Liberty Media , taking on about 45 people. With the ability to distribute its own films, Relativity is on track to be involved in the release of around 30 movies next year. Relativity’s Overture deal came shortly after an accord to provide films to Netflix, the mail-order and online film rental service. Under the agreement, Relativity bypassed traditional pay TV networks in favor of a new online revenue source. In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Kavanaugh also reiterated that the company was considering an initial public offering, saying that Relativity’s books had been audited carefully in preparation for an I.P.O. ”We’re not in any rush,” he told The A.P. ”We really want to show that we can distribute and market a film like a major studio.” Go to Article from The Associated Press via The New York Times » Go to Article from TheWrap » Go to Related Article from DealBook »</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/business/22insider.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Former Disney Employee Pleads Guilty to Conspiracy<date>Published: September 21, 2010</date><text>A former assistant to a top executive at Walt Disney on Tuesday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud charges. She admitted her role in a plan to sell secrets about the company’s finances to others before the information was made public.The defendant, Bonnie Hoxie, 33, formerly the secretary to Disney’s head of corporate communications, entered the plea in United States District Court in Manhattan in a plea deal with the government. The plea agreement said federal sentencing guidelines call for a sentence of four to 10 months in prison. Sentencing was set for Dec. 21. Ms. Hoxie was charged along with her boyfriend, Yonni Sebbag. Mr. Sebbag, 30, a citizen of Morocco, already pleaded guilty to the same charges in a deal that recommends he serve to two and three years in prison. Prosecutors said Ms. Hoxie fed information like Disney’s quarterly earnings to Mr. Sebbag before they were publicly released. Mr. Sebbag then tried to sell the inside tips to 33 investment firms, including hedge funds. The government said the two, residents of Los Angeles, arranged for anonymous letters offering to sell secrets to be sent to the investment companies, many of which were located in Manhattan. Most of the hedge funds and companies that received the offers notified the F.B.I. Federal agents posed as hedge fund traders and offered to buy the information from the pair, prosecutors said. Authorities said the arrests came after Mr. Sebbag met two undercover F.B.I. agents in New York and accepted $15,000 in cash for providing inside information. Prosecutors said he agreed to provide similar confidential information in the future in return for a 30 percent share of any profits from early trades.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/technology/21cookie.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Code Known as Flash Cookies Raises Privacy Concerns<date>Published: September 20, 2010</date><text>Sandra Person Burns used to love browsing and shopping online. Until she realized she was being tracked by software on her computer that she thought she had erased.Ms. Person Burns, 67, a retired health care executive who lives in Jackson, Miss., said she is wary of online shopping: “Instead of going to Amazon, I’m going to the local bookstore.” Ms. Person Burns is one of a growing number of consumers who are taking legal action against companies that track computer users’ activity on the Internet. At issue is a little-known piece of computer code placed on hard drives by the Flash program from Adobe when users watch videos on popular Web sites like YouTube and Hulu. The technology, so-called Flash cookies, is bringing an increasing number of federal lawsuits against media and technology companies and growing criticism from some privacy advocates who say the software may also allow the companies to create detailed profiles of consumers without their knowledge. Unlike other so-called HTML cookies, which store Web site preferences and can be managed by changing privacy settings in a Web browser, Flash cookies are stored in a separate directory that many users are unaware of and may not know how to control. Ms. Person Burns, a claimant who is to be represented by KamberLaw, said she knew cookies existed but did not know about Flash cookies. “I thought that in all the instructions that I followed to purge my system of cookies, I thought I had done that, and I discovered I had not,” she said. “My information is now being bartered like a product without my knowledge or understanding.” Since July, at least five class-action lawsuits filed in California have accused media companies like the Fox Entertainment Group and NBC Universal, and technology companies like Specific Media and Quantcast of surreptitiously using Flash cookies. More filings are expected as early as this week. The suits contend that the companies collected information on the Web sites that users visited and from the videos they watched, even though the users had set their Web browser privacy settings to reject cookies that could track them. “What these cases are about is the right of a computer user to dictate the terms by which their personal information is harvested and shared. This is all about user control,” said Scott A. Kamber, 44, a privacy and technology lawyer with KamberLaw who is involved with some of the cases. The suits have been filed by firms including Parisi &amp; Havens and the law office of Joseph H. Malley. One lawsuit contends that Clearspring Technologies and media companies including the Walt Disney Internet Group “knowingly authorized” the use of online tracking devices that would “allow access to and disclosure of Internet users’ online activities as well as personal information.” Others say that the information was gathered to sell to online advertisers. In August, Clearspring and Quantcast issued statements on their company blogs addressing the suits. Clearspring clarified its use of Flash cookies and said the legal filings were “factually inaccurate.” The company said it used Flash cookies, also known as Flash local storage, “to deliver standard Web analytics to publishers.” The post also stated that data was collected at the aggregate level including unique users and interaction time, but did not include personally identifiable information. Quantcast’s blog post said that the company “uses Flash cookies for measurement purposes only and not for any form of targeted content delivery.” Specific Media did not respond to requests for comment. Counsel for the media companies in the cases declined to comment; representatives of companies that had not yet been served with the suits also declined to comment. Some privacy advocates said that despite the companies’ claims, if enough data is collected over time, advertisers can create detailed profiles of users including personally identifiable data like race and age in addition to data about what Web sites a user visits. They also take issue with the fact that Flash cookies can be used to restore HTML cookies that have been deleted from a user’s computer, circumventing a user’s privacy settings. “The core function of the cookie is to link what you do on Web site A to what you do on Web site B,” said Peter Eckersley, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “The Flash cookie makes it harder for people to stop that from happening.” According to Adobe, more than 75 percent of online videos are delivered using Flash technology, with media companies also using it to serve games and animation to users. The company says that Flash cookies are intended to be used for basic Web functions like saving a user’s volume and language preferences or remembering where a user left off on a video game. In a public letter to the Federal Trade Commission in January, Adobe condemned the practice of restoring cookies after they had been deleted by a user. The company provides an online tool on its Web site to erase Flash cookies and manage Flash player settings. At least one suit, however, claims that the controls are not easy to reach and are not obvious to most Web users.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/eisner-downplays-reports-he-may-run-tribune/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Eisner Downplays Reports He May Run Tribune<date>September 15, 2010, 4:35 am</date><text>Michael Eisner, the former Walt Disney chief who now runs his own investment firm, on Tuesday downplayed reports that he is being considered to head up the Tribune Company when the media firm exits bankruptcy protection. Using a somewhat unclear mathematical analogy, Mr. Eisner, 68, nonetheless indicated in a interview with a St. Louis radio station that journalists had read more into his association with Tribune than was real, The Associated Press reported. ”I guess somebody in the media put one and one and added it up to two,” Mr. Eisner told ”The McGraw Millhaven Show” on KTRS. ”It really adds up to minus one and a half.” Mr. Eisner said he had invested in Tribune debt and acknowledged ”I know all the people involved” in its restructuring. Negotiations continue on a reorganization plan. Mr. Eisner is a very close friend of John Angelo, co-founder of Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co. The private equity firm owns much of Tribune debt and may own part of the company after it emerges from Chapter 11.

Time Warner reached the long-term deal with the Walt Disney Company.In the deal announced on Thursday, 12.7 million Time Warner video subscribers and 2.4 million Bright House Networks video subscribers will get access to ESPN3.com without an extra charge. ESPN3.com offers full game videos, and recently it carried live World Cup matches that built huge audiences via computer screens in the workplace. About 7.4 million people tuned in to ESPN3.com at one point during the tournament, on average watching two hours each. Disney also won a cash payment for granting Time Warner Cable the right to retransmit signals from four ABC stations and secured carriage of a new 24-hour channel called Disney Junior, a rebranding of its SOAPnet channel, when it starts up in 2012. Fees to carry other channels, including the Disney Channel, ABC Family, Disney XD and ESPN 3D, were included in the wide-ranging agreement. Time Warner will pay Disney around 50 cents a subscriber for ABC, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because terms were not made public. It is the first large deal to come up for renegotiation since the Disney Channel and ABC Family became juggernauts, a move that was a crucial part of an agreement by Time Warner to give Disney large flexibility when it comes to distributing its programming on other platforms. The deal came together after the companies indicated on Sunday that there would not be a damaging signal interruption of the kind that cut several minutes off of ABC’s Oscar telecast to millions of Cablevision subscribers in a fee dispute in March. Time Warner Cable and Bright House had long been holdouts on ESPN3.com, which has been around in different forms since 2001. They said Disney’s pattern of tying fees to the number of Internet subscribers was inappropriate, since not all its Internet customers wanted to pay extra for a single Web site. In conceding the deal terms on ESPN3.com, Disney cut its most extensive deal ever with the companies. They had not renegotiated since 2000, only agreeing to a three-year extension in 2007. Among the expanded offerings, Time Warner is starting a new college football channel called ESPN Goal Line that gives fans a live peek at games around the nation on Saturdays, a similar offering to the NFL Network’s NFL RedZone. The first program starts Saturday for sports-tier subscribers. A similar service called ESPN Buzzer Beater will be offered for the college basketball season in January.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EEDB173DF933A0575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">MEDIA DECODER; Time Warner Cable and Disney Are Near a Deal on Fees<date>Published: August 30, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES - It looks as though Time Warner Cable customers won't lose ESPN after all.The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable, which have been engaged in heated negotiations over a new distribution contract for Disney-owned television channels, were close enough to a deal on Sunday to remove attack ads aimed at each other.Even so, a final resolution remains days away, emphasized people briefed on the discussions who asked for anonymity because the talks are private. Time Warner Cable's contract with Disney expires Thursday.''The Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable have made significant progress in our negotiations for continued distribution of ABC, Disney and ESPN networks and services,'' a joint statement released late Saturday read. ''We are now focusing all our attention on a successful conclusion of these efforts.'' Pressure has been mounting on both companies for months, with each aggressively asking viewers to pick a side - theirs - in television, newspaper and Web ads. Disney is seeking to pry undisclosed fee increases out of a reluctant Time Warner Cable.In a full-page ad that ran in The New York Times on Sunday, for instance, Time Warner Cable warned, ''While we've been working hard to reach an agreement, Disney has been threatening a blackout - and telling Time Warner Cable customers to switch TV service providers.'' (The detente came too late for Time Warner Cable to withdraw the ad.) Disney had been warning viewers that they could lose access to Oprah Winfrey's farewell season and college football games.Indications emerged last week that tensions between the companies were easing. On a Time Warner Cable blog last Wednesday, a spokesman, Jeff Simmermon, wrote of the Disney negotiators, ''I run into those guys in the hallway, in the bathroom, at the coffee machine - and they don't look like they're having any more fun than our people.''A smaller fee fight is also under way at AT&amp;T, which is negotiating a new contract with Crown Media Holdings, parent company of the Hallmark Channel. Last week, the companies warned that Hallmark would be dropped at the end of the month from AT&amp;T's U-verse service, which has about 2.3 million subscribers.Hallmark's president, Bill Abbott, said Thursday that AT&amp;T was ''insisting on unreasonable rates that would seriously jeopardize our longevity.'' AT&amp;T said it was ''making every effort to reach a fair agreement.''

Disney has complained that the guild allows anyone to buy a membership (in contrast to most awards-bestowing organizations) and that Disney’s rival DreamWorks Animation has too much power because it gives its employees free guild membership. Variety, which reported the split, noted that Disney’s Pixar entries had won 6 of the last 10 top Annie prizes. But Disney started to agitate more aggressively for changes in 2009 after DreamWorks Animation’s “Kung Fu Panda” won a raft of Annies, and Pixar’s “Wall-E” won nothing. “Wall-E” went on to win the Oscar for animation that year. “We believe there is an issue with the way the Annies are judged, and have been seeking a mutually agreeable solution with the board,” Ed Catmull, president of Disney Animation and Pixar Animation, said in a statement. “Although some initial steps have been taken, the board informed us that no further changes would be made to address our concerns.” Antran Manoogian, the guild’s president, told Variety, “The Annies are about honoring the best in animation, and we will continue to do so.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/buffett-and-diller-to-speak-at-big-sky-summit/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Buffett and Diller to Speak at Big Sky Summit<date>August 25, 2010, 5:15 am</date><text>Senator Max Baucus, senior Democrat of Montana, said investor and philanthropist Warren Buffett is scheduled to participate in the Montana Economic Development Summit in Butte next month live via video, The Associated Press reported.

The News Corporation, parent of the Fox network, and the Walt Disney Company, parent of ABC, are close to deals for iTunes rentals at 99 cents each, according to network executives with knowledge of the discussions who spoke Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. But the executives emphasized that there were still sticking points in the negotiations. The executives said NBC Universal, parent of the NBC network; the CBS Corporation, parent of CBS; and Time Warner, parent of the TNT and TBS cable channels, all had reservations about the proposal. But the companies apparently have not ruled out a rental deal at some point. The companies uniformly declined to comment on Tuesday. The executives spoke on the condition of anonymity because their employers had not authorized them to discuss the negotiations. Apple declined to comment on Tuesday about any coming events or products. Apple has been frustrated in its efforts to penetrate the living room, but many analysts expect the company to continue trying. The talks with the studios seem to indicate that the company is making a renewed push in that area. The iTunes store currently sells TV episodes for $1.99 and $2.99 apiece, but its rental activities are limited to movies. The company is said to believe that inexpensive rentals of TV episodes would enhance its Apple TV and iPad products. Allowing some rentals at 99 cents would be a shift in attitude for the networks, which were said to be skeptical of the proposal when Apple made it last winter. At the time, they fretted about the possible damage that low rental prices would do to sales of DVDs and electronic episodes on iTunes and Amazon.com. Apple, however, has apparently kept up the pressure. Bloomberg News first reported on the renewed talks about the rentals on Tuesday. The talks appear to be pegged to an Apple product introduction. Analysts anticipate that the company will hold an event in September to announce new products, including an updated iPod Touch and a revamped version of Apple TV, a product that Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, has referred to as a hobby. Apple TV helps to bring Web content to television sets, but it has been perceived as a dud. In June, Mr. Jobs laid out his frustration with the TV industry’s business model and seemed to suggest that any Apple efforts in that area would be modest. “The problem with innovation in the television industry is the go-to-market strategy,” Mr. Jobs said at a technology conference, singling out the subsidized set-top boxes provided by cable and satellite companies. “That pretty much squashes any opportunity for innovation because no one is willing to buy a set-top box,” he said. Mr. Jobs suggested that until those industry dynamics changed, Apple was likely to continue tiptoeing. “I am sure smarter people than us will figure this out,” he said. “But that’s why, when we say that Apple TV is a hobby, that’s why we use that phrase.” The revamped Apple TV is expected to have a new user interface and employ the same iOS software used on the iPhone and iPad.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/business/media/24insider.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Man Pleads Guilty to Trying to Sell Disney Secrets<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>A man charged with selling inside information about finances at the Walt Disney Company pleaded guilty in federal court on Monday to wire fraud charges and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.The plea was entered by Yonni Sebbag, a citizen of Morocco, in the United States District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Sebbag and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, who once worked at Disney, were arrested in California in May. “I agreed with others to commit securities and wire fraud,” Mr. Sebbag said in court, reading from a statement. “As part of this, I disclosed material and nonpublic information about the Walt Disney company to outside investors.” The government said the two arranged for anonymous letters to be sent in early March to dozens of hedge funds and other investment companies, many of which were in Manhattan, offering to sell secrets. Most of the hedge funds and companies notified the F.B.I. Federal agents then posed as hedge fund traders and offered to buy the information, prosecutors said. Before Disney’s May 11 earnings report, the couple sent F.B.I. agents a copy of a 107-page document titled, “The Walt Disney Company Q2 Fiscal 2010 Key Topics Speaking Points,” prosecutors said. The couple notified agents two hours before the public earnings announcement that Disney’s results would exceed stock analysts’ expectations. Mr. Sebbag said Monday that he had been paid $15,000 for the information when he met two undercover F.B.I. agents in New York, and was ordered to return the money. Prosecutors said he had agreed to provide similar confidential information in the future in return for a 30 percent share of any profits from early trades. Mr. Sebbag, 30, has been held without bail in Manhattan because he was deemed a flight risk. Sentencing was set for Nov. 16. Though the charges carry a potential penalty of up to 25 years, a plea agreement recommends that the judge impose a sentence of two years and three months to two years and nine months. Prosecutors said Ms. Hoxie, who had been employed at Disney since Dec. 18, 2007, had obtained information, like Disney’s quarterly earnings, before the results were publicly released and fed the information to Mr. Sebbag, who tried to sell the tips. Ms. Hoxie’s case was pending. She remained free on bail.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/business/22price.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Harrison Price, 89, a Planner of Disney Parks, Dies<date>Published: August 21, 2010</date><text>Harrison Price, an internationally known research economist who told the developers of the world’s most famous theme parks where to situate them — in the process putting Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., and Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. — died on Aug. 15 in Pomona, Calif. He was 89.Mr. Price, a Pomona resident, died of chronic anemia, his son David said. Trained in economics and engineering, Mr. Price was a founder and very likely the best-known practitioner of the enterprise sometimes called leisure-time economic analysis. The field, which straddles entertainment, economics, sociology, real estate, time-and-motion studies, architecture and planning, was born at midcentury, when developers of outdoor amusements began seeking the most profitable means of pulling people away from the television and out of the house. For five decades, Mr. Price was a sought-after independent consultant to the makers of theme parks, amusement parks, zoos, museums and other large-scale spectacles. It is widely agreed that his work helped shape significantly the landscape of postwar American amusement. In 1999, the entertainment trade publication Variety called Mr. Price “the dean of recreation economics.” Besides the Walt Disney Company his clients included SeaWorld, Knott’s Berry Farm, the Six Flags amusement park chain and many World’s Fairs. Mr. Price was a professional measurer. In thousands of studies, he calibrated factors like geography, demographics, weather and traffic patterns to help clients answer two vital questions: If we build it, will they come? and If they come, how many of them will there be? To analyze his data, Mr. Price devised a set of algorithms he called “roller-coaster math.” Among the things he would quantify, for instance, was the length of time patrons might stand in line to board an amusement park ride. “If people are waiting around too long, you’re not going to be profitable,” he told The Desert Sun of Palm Springs, Calif., in 2004. “But if they’re going through the park too fast, that’s also not good.” Mr. Price was best known for his work for Disney, for which he produced more than 150 feasibility, marketing and site-selection studies. His association with the company began in 1953, after Walt Disney and his brother Roy O. Disney consulted him about the best place to erect a family-oriented theme park, to be known as Disneyland. At the time, Mr. Price was on the staff of the Stanford Research Institute, a business consultancy. Weighing several Southern California locations, he determined that Anaheim, then a largely rural place of citrus groves, would be the most temperate, accessible and, above all, profitable. The Disney company acquired 160 acres there, and Disneyland opened in 1955. “Walt was a dreamer, but he had a very workmanlike curiosity about how things functioned, and whether what he was talking about would actually work,” Mr. Price said in the Desert Sun interview. At Walt Disney’s urging, Mr. Price founded his own consultancy, Economics Research Associates, in 1958. He sold the business in 1969; in 1978 he founded the Harrison Price Company, which he closed on his retirement in 2005. Harrison Alan Price, familiarly known as Buzz, was born on May 17, 1921, in Oregon City, Ore., and reared in Southern California. As a child, he later said, he was a “numbers geek,” the kind of boy who kept a careful tally of the number of times he played each phonograph record in his collection. Mr. Price received a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1942. After Army service in World War II, he earned an M.B.A. from Stanford in 1951. Besides his son David, Mr. Price is survived by his wife, Anne Shaw Price, whom he married in 1944; another son, Bret; two daughters, Dana Price and Holly Shaw Ristuccia; a sister, Patricia Scott Mannarino; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. He was the author of a business memoir, “Walt’s Revolution! By the Numbers” (Ripley Entertainment, 2004). Other projects on which Mr. Price consulted include the 1964 World’s Fair in New York and the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition in New Orleans. For Disney, he helped choose the location of Tokyo Disneyland, which opened in 1983 in Chiba, Japan. He also oversaw the creation of the California Institute of the Arts, a project of Walt Disney’s that Mr. Price helped shepherd into being after Mr. Disney’s death in 1966. In his long career, Mr. Price made one strategic decision that, it is safe to assume, has earned him the deep retrospective gratitude of Gotham. In the 1960s, wishing to build a theme park on the East Coast, Disney commissioned Mr. Price to find a suitable location. Among the sites he considered for the new park, to be called Walt Disney World, were Orlando, Fla., and New York City. Mr. Price ran his numbers and chose Orlando.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/16/arts/television/16playdom.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Entering a Sorority’s Forbidden Precincts<date>Published: August 15, 2010</date><text>Be honest: is there a straight man in America who hasn’t wondered, perhaps even fantasized, about what really goes on in college sororities? Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Playdom Sorority Life by Playdom, a company being acquired by Disney. Blog ArtsBeat The latest on the arts, coverage of live events, critical reviews, multimedia extravaganzas and much more. Join the discussion. More Arts News As a thirtysomething bachelor, I have no problem admitting that I certainly have. So when I heard a few weeks ago that the Walt Disney Company had agreed to acquire Playdom, maker of the popular Facebook game Sorority Life, in a deal worth up to $763.2 million, I had to check it out. As the online teaser says: “Sorority Life has the hottest fashions and coolest cliques. Play the game all the girls are talking about!” So there I was a few days later, trying to decide which boyfriend to buy. There was Serge the Foreign Exchange Student, black leather jacket and all, available for $600 with a Charm score of 1 and a Popularity score of 2. There was Fletcher the Frat Boy, in his cute pink polo shirt (collar turned up, naturally), also for $600, with a Charm score of 2 and a Popularity score of 1. Then there was the real hunk, Cy the Guy Across the Hall, with a whopping Charm 5 and Popularity 5. Who cares that Cy costs $30,000? If I’m going to live Sorority Life, I definitely need to rock the highest scoring boyfriend. Of course I have to keep him happy. “Ready to date your dream guy?” the game asks. “Select a Sweetheart, pamper him every day, make sure he doesn’t get stolen and protect him from your jealous housemates.” That’s right. In Sorority Life you can steal other players’ boyfriends, driving the score and value of the digital Cys and Serges higher in the process. Rawr! Sorority Life was mildly diverting, but after many hours on several accounts, other horizons beckoned. “Try our other cool games!” read the Playdom banner at the top of the page. (In Mobsters 2: Vendetta, another popular Playdom game, the banner says, “Try our other games wise guy!”) And there, beside Social City, Tiki Farm and Fashion World, I found My Vineyard and Bar Society, games that represent the production and consumption ends of the alcohol industry. (To find any of these games on Facebook, search by title.) My Vineyard is similar to more popular titles like Zynga’s FarmVille or any number of other plantation-style social games where you plant and harvest crops, but in My Vineyard the focus is obviously on growing grapes and making wine. Bar Society is almost identical in its play structure to a raft of other restaurant-style games, like Zynga’s Cafe World, except that instead of pies and entrees, you sling cocktails. (Playdom apparently does not actually own Bar Society, which is credited to Red Atoms Inc., but Playdom markets it as one of “our other games.”) You begin in Bar Society by making 20 gin and tonics, which you sell for a profit. You can then progress to more lucrative offerings like the Black Russian, Long Island Iced Tea, Jager Bomb and Sex on the Beach. Disney’s sojourn into the seedier, tawdrier precincts of social network gaming confused me. That’s because the last big thing I had heard from Disney’s video game unit was at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in Los Angeles in June, when the company promoted Disney Epic Mickey, its presumably family-friendly Mickey Mouse game coming for the Nintendo Wii. And then I thought about Disney’s 2007 acquisition of Club Penguin, the online community for children who like to play games in the guise of virtual penguins. Club Penguin subsequently missed financial targets, but the deal made sense in terms of the image I thought Disney was trying to present. But perhaps I did not understand. And on Friday when I asked Steve Wadsworth, president of Disney’s interactive media division, whether Sorority Life represented Disney values, it did not surprise me when he responded by saying that I just didn’t understand his company. Disney, he explained, owns a portfolio of businesses that operate under a range of brands. I told him that in many hours with Playdom games, I didn’t see anything in the nuts-and-bolts gameplay that differentiated them from, say, the offerings of Zynga, the leviathan of social gaming. What did surprise me was that when I asked Mr. Wadsworth what made Playdom stand out from its competition, he didn’t say anything about the actual play experience. I was waiting for him to point out some amazingly cool game feature that I had somehow missed. Instead, he spoke of Playdom’s “underlying publishing mechanism,” which I took to mean the “secret sauce” of how Playdom games persuade you to pay for digital outfits for your sorority girls or weapons for your mobsters. He would not discuss details. When I talk to executives at companies that make great games, they usually say they want to focus on what they know they are good at: creating high-quality, premium entertainment experiences. When I talked to Mr. Wadsworth at Disney, he said, “Being in every possible category of games is critical for the long-term growth of the company.” There is a difference in perspective. I suspect players can tell.

Yet there is something genuinely disorienting about it. In the past few weeks, the Walt Disney Company has purchased Playdom, one of the biggest makers of social games, and sold Miramax Films, the kind of entertainment company — a movie studio — we used to think of as “real.” The economic logic is simple. Consider the number 61,411,787. That, as of Wednesday, was the number of Facebook users worldwide playing FarmVille, the most popular social game. By some estimates, FarmVille’s maker, Zynga, would be worth $5 billion if it went public. If you haven’t played FarmVille — or don’t use Facebook — it’s hard to imagine where a number like that comes from. The game involves starting a farm. You get your friends to help you water and fertilize crops and harvest them, earning play money to spend on new items. But what is being farmed isn’t only the virtual crops. It’s also the users’ social connections, their attention, and, ultimately, their credit cards. The basic gaming is free, but sooner or later many players spend real cash to buy game cash. And you can’t really play FarmVille without roping in your Facebook friends. The biggest shift in the social-gaming world — which includes titles like Mafia Wars and Restaurant City — is likely to be a battle over payment. Facebook wants to introduce a single currency for all gaming called Facebook Credits. Facebook hopes to harvest 30 percent of every credit. The goal now, for many developers, is not simply to prosper within Facebook. It is to break out into new social-gaming spaces. This, perhaps, explains Google’s recent investment in Zynga. It is a touch dismaying that social gaming is a world where players are festooned with gratuitous awards, sold trinkets for hard cash, and reap rewards for dragging in their friends. It’s lovely to pretend that the game reveals an inner agrarian instinct in all of us, but we would like to invite all 60-some-million FarmVille players to consider growing some actual plants.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/media/11disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">3 Hit Movies Help Drive Disney Profit 40% Higher<date>Published: August 10, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Profit soared nearly 40 percent at the Walt Disney Company in its most recent quarter, propelled by three blockbuster movies, strong merchandise sales and growth at ESPN.But results for Disney’s theme parks — closely watched as a barometer of the broader economy — were mixed as consumers reacted to price increases, adding to worries about a turnaround in consumer spending. The overall results, which beat analyst forecasts by a wide margin, show the degree to which hit movies can bolster Disney, the world’s largest media company. “Toy Story 3,” “Alice in Wonderland” and “Iron Man 2” — the top three movies of the year with a combined $2.5 billion in global ticket sales — are all owned by Disney and had parts of their runs in theaters during the quarter. Disney’s movie unit swung to an operating profit of $123 million, in contrast to a loss of $12 million a year earlier, when duds like “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and smaller films like “Hannah Montana: The Movie” dragged down results. Movies also powered other divisions. “Toy Story 3” in particular contributed substantial sales of related toys and apparel, driving operating income at Disney’s consumer products division up 22 percent, to $117 million. Still, it is too early to declare a recovery at Walt Disney Pictures, which has undergone a broad restructuring over the last year. While the division had enormous success in the third quarter, fourth-quarter releases like “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” and “Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time” have underperformed. (Disney took an unspecified write-down tied to “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” in the third quarter.) Similarly in flux is Disney’s theme park division. Operating income dipped 8 percent, to $477 million, during the quarter, a result of lower attendance and hotel occupancy as Disney cut back on the steep discounts it put in place during the peak of the downturn. Hotel room occupancy at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., for instance, dropped eight percentage points. On the positive side, per capita guest spending was up by a small percentage and future bookings have not fallen off sharply. Over all, Disney said net income for the period ended July 3 rose to $1.3 billion, or 67 cents a share. That compares with income of $954 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue climbed 16 percent, to $10 billion. Analysts had expected income of 58 cents a share. Like other media conglomerates, Disney’s television advertising rebounded during the quarter. ESPN, riding high ratings for World Cup matches and the N.B.A. finals, reported a 30 percent jump in advertising revenue. Ad sales at local stations and the ABC broadcast network were also stronger than a year ago. But James A. Rasulo, Disney’s chief financial officer, was cautious about painting an overly robust picture of the advertising landscape, telling analysts during a conference call that “visibility remains somewhat limited.” Media Networks, the Disney unit that includes ESPN and ABC, reported operating income of $1.9 billion. Aside from higher ad revenue, that result — a 43 percent increase over the year-earlier period — was driven by $255 million in affiliate fees that ESPN realized a quarter earlier than anticipated.</text></article></page><page index="7"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/business/media/31miramax.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Investors Buy Disney’s Miramax for $660 Million<date>Published: July 30, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company agreed late Thursday to sell Miramax Films to an investor group for about $660 million, but the art film unit will not be out of Disney’s hair for another year.In selling Miramax to a group that includes the construction executive Ronald N. Tutor, Disney agreed to distribute films from the studio and its library for as long as a year, said people who had been briefed on the deal and spoke on condition of anonymity to keep from disrupting it. The distribution agreement promises to shore up the Tutor group as it completes financing arrangements — which include equity and bank debt — for a purchase that is priced considerably higher than other bidders were willing to pay. Potential buyers as highly motivated as Bob and Harvey Weinstein — the brothers who founded Miramax three decades ago and sold it to Disney in 1993 — for months had argued that Miramax and its 700-film library, which includes “Chicago” and “No Country for Old Men,” was worth less than $600 million in the face of steadily falling home video revenue. Neither Mr. Tutor nor Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the chief executive of Colony Capital, which joined Mr. Tutor in the purchase, responded to queries on Friday. But one person who was briefed on the transaction said the group was relying on $50 million in cash that would come with Miramax and receivables valued at slightly less than half the purchase price. The price is about four times the company’s annual cash flow. Disney said the transaction, which must comply with federal antitrust regulations, was expected to close between Sept. 10 and Dec. 31. “Our current strategy for Walt Disney Studios is to focus on the development of great motion pictures under the Disney, Pixar and Marvel brands,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said in a statement. Mr. Tutor, who is the chief executive of the Tutor Perini Corporation, Mr. Barrack and their backers bought Miramax through a company called Filmyard Holdings. A spokeswoman for Colony declined on Friday to say whether the buyers intended to restart Miramax as an operating studio — a daunting, expensive task when small film companies like Overture Films, Apparition and Senator Entertainment have struggled or folded. Ron Burkle, an investor and supermarket executive, had been allied with the Weinsteins in their bid, which once led in a process that has gone on for months. Many potential buyers have kicked the tires, then walked away. The Burkle-Weinstein group had offered about $565 million. As much as $150 million of the Miramax unit’s value, according to one person who was briefed on the transaction but asked for anonymity because the talks were private, remains tied to film franchises, including the “Spy Kids,” in which the Weinstein brothers have rights. It was unclear how Mr. Tutor’s group planned to deal with the Weinstein presence, given the brothers’ chagrin at not having prevailed in the bidding. A spokeswoman for the Weinsteins did not respond to queries as to whether they planned to act to protect their stake in Miramax as the Tutor deal closes. Miramax virtually created the art house boom in the 1990s by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. In recent years, as the economics of independent films shifted Miramax declined until Disney virtually shuttered it last fall.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/google-in-talks-to-build-rival-to-facebook/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Google in Talks to Build Rival to Facebook<date>July 28, 2010, 7:30 am</date><text>Does Google have Facebook envy? The search giant has been holding talks with gaming companies as it looks to develop a new service to compete with the social networking site, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Google has been talking with developers like Playdom, Electronic Arts‘s Playfish and Zynga Game Network about offering their games for the new service it is planning, The Journal said. The reported plan for a broader social networking initiative comes as the young but fast-growing market for Internet games on Facebook and other Web sites has exploded, increasing the links between social gaming developers and social networking. Google already owns a stake in Zynga, the maker of Facebook games like FarmVille and Mafia Wars. Walt Disney, meanwhile, said Tuesday that it had signed a deal to buy Playdom for $563.2 million. However, it seems that Google, which already operates the social networking site Orkut and introduced the networking tool Buzz in February, isn’t looking to churn out a carbon copy of Facebook, The Journal said: In an interview this week, Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt declined to confirm the development of a social-networking service that would incorporate social games. When asked if Google’s service might resemble Facebook’s, Mr. Schmidt said “the world doesn’t need a copy of the same thing.” Go to Article from The Wall Street Journal » Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/technology/28disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Buys Playdom in $763 Million Deal<date>Published: July 27, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became Hollywood’s leader in the booming social game business by acquiring Playdom in a deal worth as much as $763.2 million.Playdom is one of a cluster of tech start-ups that make simple online games and sell virtual goods — like a $2.50 outfit for a character in Playdom’s Sorority Life, in which players shop, party and go to a spa. Such companies have grown by taking advantage of rapidly expanding social networks like Facebook. Disney will initially pay $563.2 million for Playdom, which is the No. 3 social game company on Facebook with about 42 million monthly players. The deal includes $200 million in additional payments if Playdom achieves growth thresholds that were not made public. John Pleasants, Playdom’s chief executive, will join Disney as an executive vice president and will report to Steve Wadsworth, president of the Disney Interactive Media Group. Mr. Pleasants, who impressed the Disney board with a presentation on social games at a recent company retreat, is expected to work to develop titles based on Disney characters and franchises. As social games becomes a more crowded and difficult field — several hundred new games are introduced on Facebook weekly and most go nowhere — brands that can be used as the basis for titles are becoming more important. “When deciding how to place a bet we thought we should do it at a significant level and not just take a little shot,” Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said in an interview. “Too often traditional media companies only put a toe or two in, and they deprive themselves at the opportunity for real growth.” He said Playdom furthered his goal of providing entertainment to “a new generation of fans on the platforms they prefer.” The purchase continues Disney’s effort to strengthen and diversify its digital media portfolio by betting on casual Internet games, in contrast to more complex games for platforms like Xbox and PlayStation. Casual games are blossoming in part because players of all ages embrace them. In June, Disney made a small investment in a $33 million financing round for Playdom. On July 1, Disney announced its acquisition of Tapulous, which makes music-based iPhone games. Sales of virtual goods in social games are expected to reach $835 million this year, according to Inside Network, which researches the industry. The leading company in the arena, Zynga, has raised $520 million in venture capital and is widely expected to go public. Zynga’s games, which include FarmVille, have 211 million players every month, according to AppData.com.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/miramax-deadline-could-reopen-door-for-weinsteins/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Miramax Deadline Could Reopen Door for Weinsteins<date>July 26, 2010, 5:51 pm</date><text>From Michael Cieply and Brooks Barnes at Media Decoder: An investment group that includes the construction executive Ronald N.

Tutor must make a nonrefundable $40 million payment toward the purchase of Miramax Films from the Walt Disney Company by Wednesday to move forward with a deal, according to people briefed on the sale.Should the deadline pass with no action, Disney could take Miramax off the market or throw open the bidding again to other suitors. Word of the deadline is the latest wrinkle in a months-long effort to reach a deal for Miramax, an independent film company that made movies like “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love” but has been virtually shuttered by Disney. Potential buyers, including the co-founders of Miramax, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, have either made no offer after checking out a deal or have proposed terms that were far less than Disney wanted. Reached on Monday, Mr. Tutor, who is the chief executive of the Tutor Perini Corporation, said he was blocked from discussing the proposed purchase by a confidentiality agreement that expires on Thursday. Asked about the deposit, Mr. Tutor said: “You’ll know by Wednesday.” Several people who were briefed on the sale — and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidentiality requirements — said the deposit was to be accompanied by a plan to finance the purchase for about $650 million plus as much as $25 million in closing costs, though signed commitments from lenders are not required by the Wednesday deadline. The bid remains complicated by questions about the distribution of film franchises like the “Spy Kids” and “Scary Movie” series, in which the Weinsteins, who ran Miramax before leaving in 2005, continue to hold rights. Mr. Tutor’s group includes the private equity firm Colony Capital, which has been guided in the transaction by Richard D. Nanula, a former chief financial officer of Disney who joined Colony two years ago. The group was granted an exclusive bargaining window for Miramax after talks with a group led by the Weinsteins and their principal backer, the investor Ron Burkle, collapsed amid dickering over a bid that was lowered to $565 million from about $600 million during a similar exclusive bargaining period. On Monday, the Burkle-Weinstein group appeared poised to re-enter the bidding if the Tutor effort failed, according to people who were briefed on that bid, although Disney may chose not to restart talks with the group. A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Weinsteins. Colony, an equity firm founded by Thomas J. Barrack Jr., has already dipped its toe into the entertainment business through unusual distressed investments, including Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch. Disney has been publicly trying to sell Miramax since March. The proceedings have involved a torrent of media miscues, the collision of big personalities — Harvey Weinstein lashed out at Robert A. Iger at the recent Allen &amp; Company gathering in Sun Valley — and endless delays as lawyers for the parties scrutinize every step. Although some in Hollywood have started to see Disney’s inability to close a deal as an embarrassment, the asset is a small one that wouldn’t have a material impact on Disney’s bottom line one way (a sale) or another (Disney yanks it off the market). Miramax, which once had 500 employees, was pared down last fall to essentially no staff, a move by Disney to make it more attractive to a buyer. As talks with various potential buyers have dragged on, Disney has continued with plans to release the handful of Miramax movies still on the shelf. These films include Julie Taymor’s “Tempest,” now set for a December release, and “The Switch,” a Jennifer Aniston comedy that arrives in theaters on Aug. 20. As of late last week, according to people who were briefed on the sale, the Tutor group was still scrambling to lock up financing. Mr. Tutor suggested that any move to pay a deposit would settle such questions. “Nobody’s going to put up that kind of money if there’s any doubt,” he said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/business/media/26tron.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Marketing for ‘Tron: Legacy’: The Hardest Sell Yet<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>SAN DIEGO — The futuristic movie “Tron: Legacy” is not just pushing the boundaries of special effects. It is redefining the Hollywood hard sell.By the time the movie arrives in theaters on Dec. 17, Walt Disney Studios will have spent three and a half years priming the audience pump. The most recent push came last week at Comic-Con International, the annual pop culture convention here. For the third year in a row, Disney teased fans with exclusive “Tron: Legacy” footage. No other movie has guest-starred here so often. “We’re going to show you five minutes of the movie every year for 20 years,” the comedian Patton Oswalt said as he introduced a third trailer for the film to about 6,500 people on Thursday. The selling and selling (and selling) of “Tron: Legacy” is the Hollywood marketing machine in its highest gear yet. Marketing campaigns for what the industry calls “tent-pole” movies — big budget, big risk, big potential payoff — have traditionally started about a year before their release in theaters. Increasingly, that is scarcely enough time. With DVRs undermining the No. 1 tool for promoting movies — television commercials — studios are trying to create Internet brush fires on behalf of their coming releases. One variant is a controlled burn: carefully doling out bits of information over months and years. Lead time also makes a big difference when it comes to breaking through the advertising clutter and competing entertainment options. In a post-“Avatar” world, the goal at the multiplex is to make movies feel like must-attend events; longer campaigns can help achieve that. At the same time, the risk for motion picture studios is bigger than ever. Special effects movies like “Tron: Legacy” can easily cost more than $350 million to develop, produce and market. A studio does not want to release a behemoth like that without a megawatt campaign. It is not just the movie business that is experimenting with a longer selling cycle. Television, too, is seeing a new model emerge. That the comedic musical “Glee” was the No. 1 show of the 2009-10 season was no accident. Yes, the execution of the show mattered. But so did the marketing muscle that Fox put behind it. Most new shows get eight weeks of promotion. Fox gave “Glee” more than a year’s worth. The network started to push the show in February for the May premiere of a single episode, then spent the summer fanning the sparks — screening the pilot at summer camps, streaming it on Fox.com and blanketing beaches and concerts with fliers. “We worked those kids like crazy over that summer,” said Joe Earley, Fox’s president for marketing, in reference to the “Glee” cast. “As reach is becoming more challenging, you need more frequency.” “Glee” returned for a short run in September. But Mr. Earley kept up the promotional pressure until a second batch of episodes arrived in January. Comic-Con, which ended Sunday, is important for entertainment companies because it is a prime spot to start one of those Internet fires, said Sean Bailey, Disney’s president for production. “People look to Comic-Con to guide their moviegoing decisions for the rest of the year,” said Mr. Bailey. “It’s a barometer of what’s cool.” The original “Tron,” released in 1982 and loaded with computer-generated effects, was a hit with the young male crowd, who quickly turned a related arcade game into a success. But the movie failed to attract a wide audience. The story — a man is pulled inside a video game and is forced to play space-age gladiator games — turned off mainstream moviegoers. “It went beyond suburbia’s ability to deal with it at the time,” said Steven Lisberger, who directed and wrote “Tron.” Disney cannot afford to have “Tron: Legacy” play out in similar fashion, which is one reason it is spending so much time trying to position the film in the marketplace. “We really want to open it up — the message is that this is a film that everyone will find cool and contemporary and relevant,” Mr. Bailey said. The studio first decided to “activate” core fans, Mr. Bailey said. Disney unveiled a “Tron: Legacy” teaser trailer at Comic-Con in July 2008. Over the next year, Disney released more video, introduced an ambitious online game and fed bloggers a steady drip of news. In July 2009 at Comic-Con, Disney introduced a walk-through experience (lots of vintage arcade games) and a Twitter-enabled scavenger hunt through the streets of downtown San Diego. A second “Tron: Legacy” trailer appeared with “Alice in Wonderland” in March. Last week, the studio built an even more elaborate walk-through experience that recreated sets from the movie and attracted over 7,000 visitors over three days. Disney also released a third trailer. On the convention floor, Disney gave people a peek at the coming merchandising storm: talking action figures with digitally projected faces, iPod accessories, Adidas sneakers inspired by “Tron: Legacy,” and clothing. With the core audience on board — the online game now has about 4.5 million active users — Disney is turning its attention to the people who make the difference between a hit and a blockbuster: mothers, children and nontechnophiles. The monorail at Walt Disney World got a “Tron: Legacy” makeover. The Disney XD cable channel will present an animated mini-series in the fall (followed by a regular series, to be announced). Most important, Mr. Bailey and his studio colleagues are working to hammer home the message that “Tron: Legacy” is more than a chase through a virtual world. “It’s very focused on a father-son story,” Mr. Bailey said. Jeff Bridges reprises his role from “Tron” as a talented video game programmer; Garrett Hedlund plays his son. “Tron: Legacy,” filmed using advanced 3-D cameras, will inevitably be compared with “Avatar,” which opened on a similar date last year and sold more than $2.7 billion in tickets at the global box office. That is perhaps an unfair bar to set. But six months before release, there are signs that Disney is succeeding at turning its movie into a cultural event. Without Disney’s prodding, Donatella Versace echoed the movie’s aesthetic — sleek black uniforms, white and blue glowing light — in a recent menswear show in Milan. Rihanna, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga have all sported “Tron”-esque fashions. Audi has designed a concept car openly inspired by the look of the vehicles in the movie. The music group the Black Eyed Peas featured a flying “lightcycle” — “Tron”-speak for a motorcycle — on its recent concert tour. “If this thing isn’t a hit,” said John Juarez, a Comic-Con attendee, “somebody at Disney is going to have a lot of explaining to do.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/technology/26macguff.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Hollywood Animation With a Decidedly French Flavor<date>Published: July 25, 2010</date><text>PARIS — The natural habitat of the Lorax, the fantastical protagonist of Dr. Seuss’ environmental fable, is a forest. For the moment, however, the Lorax lives atop a parking garage in central Paris. There, at a French animation and visual effects studio in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower, a French-American team is developing the graphics for a movie version of “The Lorax,” set for release in 2012 by Universal Studios. For the French company, called Mac Guff Ligne, “The Lorax” is a chance to build on the success of “Despicable Me,” a three-dimensional animated film that has been the surprise hit of the summer at the U.S. box office, generating more than $130 million in sales in little more than two weeks. Mac Guff did the animation work for “Despicable Me,” which was produced by a Universal affiliate, Illumination Entertainment. “This is an American movie, of course, but an American movie that is universal,” said Jacques Bled, co-founder and chief executive of Mac Guff, whose name is derived from “MacGuffin,” the term that Alfred Hitchcock coined for the quirky plot devices that popped up in many of his films. “It’s an American movie, made in France.” Universal’s decision to extend the partnership with Mac Guff is a big boost for the French audiovisual industry. With domestic film and television production in the doldrums, Paris-based animation and visual effects studios like Mac Guff are looking to Hollywood for new business. As Mac Guff gets to work on “The Lorax” and a third, undisclosed feature film with Illumination, another French studio, Buf Compagnie, is developing visual effects for “Thor,” a live-action film based on a comic-book superhero, with Walt Disney’s Marvel Studios. Other French rivals, like Mikros Image, which have largely focused on domestic production in the past, are trying to drum up business in Hollywood, too. “We have a lot to win mutually, because the French market is small for these talents, and the American studios can benefit from our skills,” said Olivier-René Veillon, director of the Île-de-France Film Commission, which promotes the greater Paris area as a filmmaking site. In making live-action blockbusters, Hollywood has long been looking to international talent. Films like the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, with a diverse international cast and crew, are difficult to stamp with any nationality. But French effects and animation shops have watched with frustration in recent years as their counterparts in Britain, including companies like Double Negative and Framestore, carved out a lucrative niche in doing contract work for Hollywood studios. Opportunities for French companies were more limited. Buf and Mac Guff, both of which were founded in the mid-1980s, have not gone entirely empty-handed. Buf, for example, worked on scenes in films like “Fight Club,” “The Dark Knight,” “The Matrix” and “Avatar.” Until recently, however, French studios’ efforts to secure more business from Hollywood were held back by the high cost of doing business in France. Two things have changed that. First, the euro started to fall against the dollar, making France more competitive. Then, last year, French lawmakers approved a tax rebate aimed at luring foreign filmmakers to France. It provides subsidies of up to €4 million, or $5.1 million, per film for expenses they incur in France, including work on animation and visual effects, matching a similar incentive system already in place in Britain and some other European countries. Mr. Bled said there was another cost advantage to working with French studios. They are used to working on domestic French productions, whose budgets are typically a fraction of the size of a typical Hollywood film. “We have practice at it,” he said. “When we have one person doing something here, maybe there are two or three people doing the same thing in America.” A tight control over costs helped Illumination make “Despicable Me” on a budget of about $70 million — less than half the size of the outlays on other recent animated hits like “Toy Story 3” or “Shrek 4.” While French films are not known for their reliance on computer-generated graphics, France has a strong tradition in visual effects and animation, going back to Georges Méliès, whose 1902 film “A Trip to the Moon” featured a spaceship crashing into the right eye of the man in the moon. Walt Disney ran an animation studio in a Paris suburb, Montreuil, from 1989 to 2002, where it worked on films like “The Hunchback of Notre Dame” and “Tarzan.” But it was shut when Walt Disney restructured its animation operations, centering them in the United States. Several French art schools, like the Gobelins academy, specialize in film graphics, regularly exporting their talent to U.S. animation studios like Pixar and DreamWorks. “We want to keep these people here by bringing big effects movies to France,” said Julien Meesters, who heads the animation and effects operations of Mikros Image. The partnership with Universal has significantly expanded the opportunities at Mac Guff. While the company has a full-time staff of fewer than three dozen people, Mr. Bled said, employment, including freelancers, sometimes swelled to nearly 300 over the past two years as the studio worked on “Despicable Me.” The company, which is privately owned, was profitable last year on revenue of about €25 million, he said, bouncing back after losing money in 2007 and 2008. He did not disclose details of the deal with Universal, which declined to comment. Over all, French employment in visual effects and animation rose by about 30 percent last year, to around 2,000, according to the Île-de-France Film Commission. Mr. Bled said he saw no reason why French studios could not play a bigger role in the world of animation, now that Mac Guff had shown that a largely French-made film like “Despicable Me” could appeal to U.S. audiences. The French are certainly eager for the work. Pierre Buffin, the founder of Buf, is cultivating his ties to Hollywood, which date to the mid-1990s, when the studio worked on “Batman &amp; Robin.” Mr. Buffin decried the cultural protectionism that pervades the French filmmaking establishment, where financial support was largely reserved for productions with a demonstrably French orientation until the new tax break was created. He said France could learn from Britain, where the work done for Hollywood studios has reinvigorated the British moviemaking scene by building the talent available to local filmmakers, too. There is another incentive to working with Hollywood, he said, tongue in cheek: “When you work with the Americans, they place an order, you do the effects and they pay you. When you work with the French, they place an order, you do the effects and they don’t pay you.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E0DD1F3BF936A25754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">GADGETWISE; In the World of Cars, Lessons About Money<date>Published: July 15, 2010</date><text>The same people who designed Club Penguin have created a new site, World of Cars, which went live earlier this month. It is based on the Disney/Pixar movie ''Cars.'' Everyone under 12 knows about Club Penguin, one of the first and most successful virtual worlds for children. On Club Penguin, created in 1995 by three Canadians, children as young as 5 years old can adopt their own pet penguin, decorate their own igloo and type to other penguins (children) on the site. Disney bought the site in 2007. The new site, intended for ages 6 to 12, works on a similar concept; instead of penguins, you create your own car, drive around and chat with other cars (users). First, you design your own car avatar; mine was assigned the name Chilly Gearbolts. I then spent several hours visiting with hundreds of other avatars, trying some races, earning some dollars and typing some short messages. I had fun. But before you send your child to the site, it's helpful to understand how it makes money. Your child is entering an expertly woven spider Web that uses a ''freemium'' technique, or the ''velvet rope,'' in children's gaming trade show jargon. This means that the creator of the game lures your child with something free and fun -- in this case, some free races and a chance to design his or her own car, but soon tries to charge for cool-looking extras. Older children perhaps can resist the temptation, but first-graders probably cannot, especially after they see that other cars, and not theirs, have accessories. If you've ever shown up at a formal party with less than formal shoes, you get the feeling. For example, in search of a better paint job for my avatar, I steered my free, rather dull-looking car into Romone's House of Body Art. As I tried various looks, Romone told me: ''The other cars are going to be jealous. You look sweet.'' But sadly, my favorite color, Turbo Turquoise, turned out to be just a preview. When I tried to leave this part of the site with my car painted that color, I was told: ''Oops. To buy this, you need to upgrade to a sponsored race car.'' What that means, is that I needed a ''sponsor,'' who would pay a $5.95-a-month charge. In other words, a sponsor is a subscriber, or you, as the parent. It's a ''show and sell'' technique that can turn a happy child into a pouting one if you are unwilling to pay the money. Most children are convinced that they will be able to play the game free. But then a Yellen Yellow sports car, with whitewall tires and other cool stuff, noses ahead in a race. And there you have a lesson in temptation in the information age. So while the World of Cars has no stated educational mission, perhaps it has something to teach, after all. Subscription prices are $5.95 for one month, $29.95 for six months and$57.95 for one year. Subscriptions renew automatically and are nonrefundable. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In a move that underscored the shifting nature of these Big TV brawls, Verizon ads warned consumers that Time Warner’s contract with Disney — supplier of ESPN, ABC and Disney Channel — expires on Sept. 2. Referring to ABC’s dispute with Cablevision in March, when millions of viewers were deprived of part of the Oscars, the ads asked people to pre-emptively switch to Verizon’s FiOS service. “Count on ABC7 for the best programming. Count on FiOS for ABC7,” read an full-page ad in The Los Angeles Times on Saturday. A similar ad on Friday in The St. Petersburg Times of Florida tilted off ESPN: “You don’t have to wait to find out if you will keep your favorite shows. Switch to FiOS.” Verizon declined requests for an interview. Analysts said Verizon’s aggression — it is highly unusual for a so-called switch campaign to pop up almost two months ahead of a deadline — is fresh evidence that cable giants like Time Warner are under increasing pressure. On one side are insurgents in the pay-TV delivery wars (Verizon, DirecTV, AT&amp;T, Dish Network) that are trying to build market share by offering consumers more for less. And they are succeeding. Six years ago, cable companies had 72 percent of the pie, satellite operators had 28 percent and telecom competitors had essentially none, according to SNL Kagan data. By last year, however, satellite had 33 percent and telecom 5 percent, whittling down cable’s share to 62 percent. “We’re starting to see even more churn,” said Vince Vittore, a principal analyst at the Yankee Group. At the same time, all types of TV distributors have lost substantial ground in their reluctance to pay broadcasters like ABC and Fox the same kind of fees they pay cable-only channels like ESPN and TNT. Cable providers have long paid substantial fees to carry cable-only channels, but until recently paid nothing to carry traditional broadcast channels — a situation that the cash-starved broadcast networks have fought mightily to change. When push comes to shove, and it almost always does in these skirmishes, the broadcasters have won: ABC over Cablevision, Fox over Time Warner. All of which puts considerable wind into Disney’s sails, analysts say, as it moves forward with contract talks with Time Warner, the country’s second-largest cable provider. Disney is seeking unspecified increases in the fees Time Warner pays to carry Disney’s roster of cable channels and the signal of certain ABC stations. A report by RBC Capital Markets last week observed that Disney is entering the negotiations with added leverage from programming: ABC and ESPN will carry college football games starting in September. Still, Time Warner has a reputation for playing hardball. Its strategy in previous bouts with suppliers has been to paint them as greedy media giants who are happy to trample on consumers. For instance, ahead of negotiations with Fox, Time Warner called on customers to “get tough” against programmers, and deployed TV commercials that played like political attack ads. “Everybody likes to trash the cable operators, but in fact if you look at their financial statements, they’ve been seeing erosion in their margins on video for many, many years,” said Derek Baine, an analyst for SNL Kagan. “Meanwhile, the cable networks have been seeing margin expansion.” Although Verizon is taking advantage of Time Warner’s position this summer, no distributor is immune from the demands for higher payments. AT&amp;T, an upstart like Verizon in the TV space, is currently resisting increases sought by Rainbow Media for channels like AMC, home to “Mad Men.” Rainbow warned on Friday that AMC would go dark for AT&amp;T television customers on Wednesday unless a new deal was reached. Cable providers dispute the notion that they hemorrhage customers to rivals when suppliers yank channels in a demand for bigger payments. In the first quarter, Scripps Networks pulled the Food Network from Cablevision and Disney pulled ABC. But Cablevision gained about 900 basic cable customers during the period. In other words, even though some subscribers dropped the service, more than enough new ones signed up to make up the difference. Time Warner is trying a new strategy when it comes to those fees broadcasters have been demanding for the right to retransmit their signals. Time Warner was among the companies that signed a petition in March calling for reforms to retransmission laws; cable companies argue that the current rules unfairly favor broadcasters like ABC. After Time Warner submitted an analysis to the Federal Communications Commission backing up its position, Disney submitted a point-by-point rebuttal — an indication that calm heads may ultimately not prevail in negotiations between the two companies. “We think it’s a quiet before the storm,” wrote RBC in its report. Mr. Baine of SNL Kagan said, “As time goes by, we’re seeing that these things are getting really, really vicious.” Disney declined to comment. A Time Warner spokesman, Justin Venech, said, “We are currently engaged in negotiations with Disney, those negotiations continue in good faith, and we are hopeful that we will reach an agreement.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/12/business/media/12movies.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Costumes and Sing-Alongs Make Moviegoing a Social Event<date>Published: July 11, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — They came dressed as Pink Ladies and Beauty School Dropouts. They cheered Danny Zuko at Thunder Road. The rama-lama ding-donging? Deafening.No, this wasn’t a karaoke club. It was the premiere here for “Grease: Sing-A-Long,” a rerelease of the 1978 musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. By adding lyric subtitles, Paramount Pictures hopes to inspire audiences in places like Texas and Michigan — clad in costume, preferably — to trek to multiplexes and sing about summer lovin’. “The goal is to create a true event,” said Adam Goodman, president of the Paramount Film Group. “How do you get groups of young people going to the movies and having a great time?” The key term is “young.” Older moviegoers may still prefer to sit in silence, but younger audiences — the ones studios work hardest to motivate off the sofa — are increasingly programmed to interact and multitask. Sitting quietly in a theater starts to feel like a bore when you can watch the DVD at home while texting a friend, playing a video game and posting witty comments on Facebook. Despite 3-D blockbusters like “Avatar” and “Alice in Wonderland,” moviegoing in North America is in trouble. For the summer period, which typically accounts for 40 percent of annual box office receipts, attendance is down by about 3 percent, to 309 million tickets, compared with a year earlier. Years of sharp ticket price increases have papered over the problem — revenue for the summer is up about 4 percent — but movie studios and exhibitors are now starting to fear a consumer pushback. Since at least “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” moviegoers have created their own events around films — wearing costumes, bringing props, singing along and generally treating the theater as though it’s their own den. Now it is the multiplex chains and film studios that are trying to manufacture audience participation as a way of coaxing a certain crowd into theaters. Just bring your friends, they say, and buy a lot of candy. The strategy depends on creating an excitement that was once organic, and it could easily backfire, said Matt Britton, the managing partner of Mr Youth, a New York social marketing agency. “You don’t want to force a cultural habit on people, especially young people who are very savvy about being manipulated by marketers,” he said. “But it’s definitely savvy to try and make the moviegoing experience less linear and more interactive.” There are signs, at least in the short term, that audiences are responding. “Grease: Sing-A-Long,” which features some minor lyrical changes to make the songs less crude, opened on Thursday in limited national release and has been selling out in cities in California, New York, Texas and Florida. Arriving at a Los Angeles screening, Inthia Seabrooks paid homage to the movie’s “Beauty School Dropout” number by dressing in a silver smock and wearing a headdress made out of an empty KFC bucket. “If you’re going to get all dolled up and go out to the movies, they had better offer you something special,” said Ms. Seabrooks, 28. “This is special.” In addition to signing on for “Grease: Sing-A-Long,” which at the very least is a way for Paramount to keep milking a 32-year-old cash cow, AMC Entertainment has been busy hosting participatory “Twilight Saga” marathons. AMC, one of the largest theater chains in North America, handed out collectible lanyards at the triple feature and encouraged customers to root for their favorite lead character by wearing T-shirts emblazoned with “Team Edward” or “Team Jacob.” “Everyone together laughing or crying or cheering — that’s why you go to the movies, and we want to really reinvigorate that experience,” said Sun Dee Larson, AMC’s vice president for film and product marketing. For Walt Disney Studios, all of this multiplex festivity leads back to one thing: Chihuahuas. To promote “Beverly Hills Chihuahua,” released in fall 2008, Disney invited Chihuahua owners to bring their dogs to a series of screenings. The goal was to attract a few dozen people, but hundreds turned out — many with their dogs dressed in outfits, like tiny little tuxedos. Pictures from the event became a hit on the Web, helping to turn the movie into a success. The lesson for movie marketers was that in the Twitter age, you can easily convince people that moviegoing is a party with a simple promotional event. So Disney, aiming to create a group-fun vibe around “Alice in Wonderland” last spring, staged a similar shindig at a Los Angeles mall. The studio invited MySpace to stream video of the event and told guests to “dress in your best Alice costume.” A crop of Mad Hatters and Red Queens showed up and — presto — moviegoers started popping up in similar garb at theaters across the country. Next up: Elvis. On July 29, National CineMedia will present a compilation of concert footage called “Elvis on Tour: 75th Anniversary Celebration” in more than 450 theaters. “I’m sure Elvis fans will arrive in full costume,” said Michelle Portillo, a National CineMedia spokeswoman. “We receive several calls from Elvis impersonators about it a day.” National CineMedia also organizes multiplex sing-alongs (“Forever Plaid”) and simulcasts sporting events (patrons dress in team colors and cheer as if they were in a stadium). Feeling bashful about behaving this way in a theater? To encourage reluctant singers, Paramount layered a recorded audience’s voice — like a sitcom laugh track — into the musical numbers in its new “Grease.” But beer helps, too. Dale Hurst, marketing director for Carmike Cinemas, said his chain hired caterers with mobile liquor licenses to service theaters for these kinds of events. “Some people really let loose,” he said. Betty Henderson, 67, acknowledges that it took her awhile to warm up to the idea of singing during a movie. “I just thought it sounded a little strange,” she said. But before long, Ms. Henderson was belting out “Summer Nights” with the best of them. “The energy of the crowd was so great that it just made you feel good,” she said afterward. “I’ve never experienced anything like that.”</text></article></page><page index="8"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/business/media/08disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Ordered to Pay $270 Million in ‘Millionaire’ Suit<date>Published: July 7, 2010</date><text>The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday was ordered to pay almost $270 million in damages to Celador, the British production company that created the hit game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” more than a decade ago.Celador alleged that Disney cheated it out of revenue owed from “Millionaire,” which became a television sensation in the United States in 1999. The jurors agreed that Disney was guilty of breaching a contract. Disney said in a statement, “We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will aggressively seek to have it reversed.” The trial, which began in Riverside, Calif., in the spring, six years after Celador first filed a lawsuit, offered a rare window into so-called Hollywood accounting — the allocation of expenses and revenue on a film or television project and a frequent area of dispute between studios and their partners. Roman Silberfeld, the lawyer for Celador, further argued that the “Millionaire” case was a consequence of vertical integration within media giants like Disney, because its subsidiaries were responsible for both producing and distributing the game show. In an telephone interview after the verdict was read, Mr. Silberfeld said that the subsidiaries, ABC and Buena Vista, “had colluded in artificially depressing the network license for ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ so that there would be no profits to share with Celador.” Mr. Silberfeld estimated that ABC earned more than a billion dollars in advertising revenue. But “there was no profit ever shown on their books, and as a result they never shared any with Celador,” he said. Celador did receive $21 million in executive producer fees. During the trial Disney argued that there was nothing unusual about the way the “Millionaire” revenue was allocated, and pointed a finger at the agents at William Morris who negotiated the original contract for Celador. What kind of ripple effect the verdict has in Hollywood remains to be seen. The size of the damages, $270 million, was startling — even for a company of Disney’s size — and the entertainment capital was immediately awash in chatter about a swing in deal-making power from integrated media companies to outside producers. But some in Hollywood said the case probably came with too many unusual circumstances to have a broad industry impact. Even if a change in business conduct did materialize as a result, it would not happen until the resolution of Disney’s appeal. “Hollywood accounting is always an issue, but everyone — both sides in a deal — knows how to play the game,” said Harold L. Vogel, a media analyst and the author of “Entertainment Industry Economics.” In an unrelated case, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury ruled in favor of the actor Don Johnson in a copyright case involving the 1996 television series “Nash Bridges.” Mr. Johnson, most famous for his role in “Miami Vice” and represented by Kirkland &amp; Ellis, argued that he was a co-owner of “Nash Bridges.” The court ordered Rysher Entertainment to pay Mr. Johnson’s production company $23.2 million in damages and pay him 50 percent of future profits earned from reruns in foreign countries.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/business/media/08miramax.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Is Said to Be Nearing a Deal for Miramax Films<date>Published: July 7, 2010</date><text>The Walt Disney Company is nearing a sale of its Miramax Films unit to an investor group led by a construction executive, Ronald N. Tutor, and the private equity firm Colony Capital for $600 million to $700 million, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.A deal for Miramax could be reached within a week, these people said, cautioning that the talks were ongoing and might still collapse. The individuals spoke on condition they not be identified because the negotiations were confidential. If an agreement is reached, it would end the sales process for Miramax, the maker of films including “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love.” It would also signal a triumph of Mr. Tutor’s group over Harvey and Bob Weinstein, the brothers who founded Miramax 31 years ago and sold it to Disney in 1993 for $80 million. The Weinsteins had allied themselves with investors like the billionaire Ron Burkle to try to regain control of Miramax, but failed to reach a deal with Disney last month. Representatives for Disney and Colony declined to comment. A representative for Tutor could not be immediately reached for comment. Talks between Disney and the Tutor-Colony group were first reported by Deadline.com. Mr. Tutor’s efforts to acquire Miramax gained momentum last week when he brought in Colony as a partner. Colony was founded by Thomas J. Barrack, a long-time friend of Mr. Tutor’s. The equity firm has already dipped its toe into the entertainment business through unusual distressed investments, including Michael Jackson’s Neverland Ranch and in an agreement to help the photographer Annie Leibovitz restructure millions of dollars in debt. Among the chief negotiators for the Tutor-Colony group is Richard Nanula, a former chief financial officer for Disney who joined Colony two years ago. The investor group believes that Miramax has significant unrealized value, including a formidable library of more than 600 films and as much as $300 million in receivables, according to one of the people briefed on the matter. The Tutor-Colony group assumes that more can be done with the library to bolster Miramax’s value, including making more of the company’s catalog available on Blu-ray disc, this person added. Mr. Tutor’s acquisition efforts hit some turbulence last month, when several important Hollywood guilds expressed concern over the involvement of David Bergstein, a financier who had helped organize the Tutor consortium. The dispute arose over claims held by the guilds in the bankruptcy cases of several film companies associated with Mr. Bergstein.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/08/sun-valley-the-year-of-the-no-deal/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Live From Sun Valley, Day Three<date>July 8, 2010, 1:10 pm</date><text>1:57 p.m. | Updated SUN VALLEY, Idaho — For years, the Allen &amp; Company annual retreat here has been the birthplace of mega-deals that have reshaped the media landscape. Exhibit A: the sale of ABC to the Walt Disney Company. Exhibit B: the sale of a majority stake in NBC Universal to Comcast. This year, however, the talk among the moguls has been less about the next big merger than about, at best, smaller deals. And in a couple of cases, strenuous denials that sales are in the offing. On Wednesday, Robert Iger of Disney and Jonathan Miller of the News Corporation both denied that they were shopping around ABC and MySpace, respectively. As DealBook and others reported on Wednesday, Disney is close to selling its Miramax Films unit to an investor group led by Ron Tutor and Colony Capital. But that sales process was in the works weeks before the Allen &amp; Company retreat. Harvey Weinstein, who with his brother Bob co-founded Miramax, is here and has sought to reclaim the company, but is disinclined to discuss the matter. Instead, the tenor of the discussions here — at the catered lunch around the resort’s duck pond, at the closely guarded dinner on the Sun Valley Lodge patio — has been that if there are deals to be struck, they’ll be smaller. They may even be partnerships, Gregory Maffei of Liberty Media said on Wednesday. (Then again, there are two days left for the conference.) Several executives, including investor Gordon Crawford of Capital Research and Management, expressed concern to reporters about the fragile state of the economic recovery. Many of their companies have rebounded from the lows of two years ago, and they’re feeling a bit more confident again. But it’s unclear whether now is the time to consider staking that hard-won trip back to health on a potentially risky acquisition. Many of the panel discussions and the side chats have instead focused on where things go from here. And, perhaps, a tee time or hiking trail. – Michael J. de la Merced Follow the latest developments on Michael’s Twitter feed.

She was 81. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image CBS Ilene Woods. Enlarge This Image The Walt Disney Company Cinderella’s singing and speaking voice in the 1950 Disney film both belonged to Ilene Woods. She died of causes related to Alzheimer’s disease, her husband, the drummer Ed Shaughnessy, told The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Woods was an 18-year-old radio singer in 1948 when two songwriter friends asked her to make a demonstration recording of some songs they had written for a planned Disney feature. Two days later, Walt Disney himself interviewed her and offered her the job. She was both the speaking and singing voice of Cinderella in the film, which was released in 1950 and went on to become a big success for the Disney studio. The singing voice of Prince Charming was provided by the future talk-show host Mike Douglas. Ilene Woods was born Jacquelyn Ruth Woods on May 5, 1929, in Portsmouth, N.H. She had her own local radio show at 11 and her own network show at 14. Ms. Woods sang on the Perry Como, Arthur Godfrey and Garry Moore television shows in the 1950s. She retired from show business in the early 1970s. She was given a Disney Legends award in 2003. In addition to her husband, a former member of the “Tonight Show” band, whom she married in 1963, she is survived by their son, Daniel Shaughnessy; a daughter from her first marriage, Stephanie Pagoto; and three grandchildren.

Tapulous, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is one of the more successful companies creating games for Apple's touch-screen mobile devices. With the number of downloads through Apple's App Store topping five billion, many companies see mobile applications as a promising business. Big companies like IAC/InterActiveCorp, Amazon.com and now Disney have bought start-ups that have track records in the market. ''We have been very successful on the iPhone,'' said Bart Decrem, chief executive and co-founder of Tapulous. ''We have been thinking, 'How do we position ourselves to succeed?' And after several conversations with Disney, we could see that we have a shared vision of the future and the iPhone as a mobile platform.'' Disney said Mr. Decrem and Andrew Lacy, the co-founder and chief operating officer of Tapulous, would lead its mobile business. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. ''Tapulous is going to be at the center of Disney's mobile strategy,'' Mr. Decrem said. The company's flagship game, Tap Tap Revenge, which is patterned after popular music rhythm games like Rock Band, challenges players to keep up with colored orbs as they zoom past to the beat of the music. The game was released free in 2008 and quickly climbed the charts of Apple's application store. That prompted the company to begin releasing games with packages of tunes by popular musicians. For example, players can buy a set of songs by the teenage star Justin Bieber or Lady Gaga for $3.99. The success of those series helped push Tapulous into profitability and amass more than 30 million users, according to the company. Steve Wadsworth, president of Disney Interactive Media Group, said that for the time being Tapulous would continue to focus on music rhythm games, ''although we will certainly want to look for opportunities to leverage the assets that Disney has.'' News of the deal was first reported by the blog TechCrunch. The sale to Disney is another indication of the staying power of the iPhone and iPod Touch as powerful gaming devices, said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''The iPhone and iPod Touch are now critical gaming platforms,'' Mr. Golvin said. ''Disney is strengthening the bench for its mobile gaming strategy.'' The acquisition also signals a deeper dive by Disney into the mobile and social game industry. In June, Disney invested in Playdom, an online game company that makes popular games for the iPhone and Facebook, including the game Mobsters. Disney has already had some success with phone apps, including a game with an ''Alice in Wonderland'' theme and a puzzle game called Jelly Car 2.

Ever since a suggestive 2008 Vanity Fair photo shoot thrust her out of the Disney cocoon into the mainstream consciousness, she’s been the subject of speculation, concern and fear. Ms. Cyrus, the chatterers argued, was in trouble but could still be saved.And yet innocence has never been the core of Ms. Cyrus’s appeal. As the star of the Disney Channel’s “Hannah Montana” series, she plays a knowing character — regular kid by day, pop star by night — who understands the duality of celebrity. Being famous is work, and not always of the glamorous kind. A similar duality is now beginning to undo Ms. Cyrus in real life, where she’s still tied inextricably to her Disney identity but looking for a safe landing spot. As surely as the teen idol is a part of pop culture, so is the molting of her shiny veneer. Last week Ms. Cyrus released “Can’t Be Tamed” (Hollywood), the first album that’s shown the frayed seams of her identity. But Ms. Cyrus’s metamorphosis isn’t nearly as radical as “Can’t Be Tamed” — the title track, the video, the title — would suggest. Rather, she’s evolving into something far less controversial: a pop star, confused like all the rest of them. “Can’t Be Tamed” may be the least consistent of her several albums to date — the ones released under her name and the ones as Hannah Montana — but it’s also the most unexpectedly thrilling. There are phenomenal dance-pop songs but also stilted ballads and high-energy screamers. It continues the anchorlessness that’s been clear in Ms. Cyrus’s music the last year and a half. In that time she’s had two major hits: “The Climb,” a soaring, inspirational pop-country ballad from the soundtrack to “Hannah Montana: The Movie,” and “Party in the U.S.A.,” a saccharine, chirpy confection that’s almost the exact opposite (and, notably, does not appear on this album, or any other). “Can’t Be Tamed” continues the chaos. The title track is Rebellion 101: “I want to be a part of something I don’t know/and if you try to hold me back, I might explode.” In the video she’s trapped in a cage, wearing wings, and teases her female backup dancers with near-kisses. As ever, on this song Ms. Cyrus displays a husky, distinctive voice that undermines any attempts at naïveté, but still, there’s no frisson to this attempt at rebirth. Her lashing out is perfunctory too — “Can’t Be Tamed” is merely the song that gets her past the teen-pop ghetto and on to other choices. “Don’t live a lie/This is your one life,” she sings at the beginning of “Liberty Walk,” the album’s first song. But the lie might be that Ms. Cyrus has some core truth that she’s faithful to — on that song alone, she tries out four different vocal strategies, including rapping. Her greatest crime isn’t that she’s maturing too quickly: it’s that it’s unclear where she wants to go. That’s most likely because Ms. Cyrus was formed in the cauldron of public scrutiny, but not in any particular music scene outside of kid-pop. “I listen to zero pop music, which is really weird for someone who makes pop music,” Ms. Cyrus improbably told Billboard magazine last month. If anything, songs like “The Climb” and “Party in the U.S.A.” were scrubbed far cleaner than her Hannah Montana material, which often had a sassy, aggressive edge to it, a mood that’s barely touched on “Can’t Be Tamed.” Instead, the most exciting songs on this album are club-oriented dance-pop, a genre Ms. Cyrus hasn’t previously shown any affinity for and may never again. Still, it’s a timely and sharp sound. “Who Owns My Heart” — produced, like many of the album’s best tracks, by the pop impresarios Rock Mafia — is full of rubbery synths and swooning choruses in the vein of Cascada. On “Two More Lonely People,” bright acoustic guitars slash hard against bouncy synthesizers, suggesting, of all things, vintage Debbie Gibson. And at the bridge, there’s a faint echo of Starship’s “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.” On “Permanent December,” written with Claude Kelly — who also helped write “Party in the U.S.A.” — Ms. Cyrus tries out a sneering type of sing-rapping, à la Fergie: “Don’t call me a Lolita/’Cause I don’t let ’em through.” On a more coherent album, that idea would be explored further. But the fact that Ms. Cyrus feels little need to assert her sexuality, or lack thereof, is consistent with her rejection of a single new identity in favor of a cluster of experiments. Perhaps she hasn’t had time to think it through, or maybe she’s realized that evading the subject for now is a more flexible strategy than tackling it head-on. Still, she may not have those options much longer. “Hannah Montana” will end this spring after its fourth season, bringing the dual identity portion of Ms. Cyrus’s career to a close. At that point, untethered to any old modes, she may in fact look back with some envy on the time in her life when her choices were as simple as either/or.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/22/business/media/22ferb.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Seeks to Make ‘Phineas and Ferb’ the Next ‘SpongeBob’<date>Published: June 21, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Picture the early days of “SpongeBob SquarePants” — before the theme park tie-ins, the movies and the merchandising blitz. Back when it was just a goofy animated show that somehow developed a loyal audience.By that measure, “Phineas and Ferb” is the new “SpongeBob.” A witty Disney Channel series about two stepbrothers and their pet platypus, “Phineas and Ferb” has blossomed into a ratings hit among children. Can the Walt Disney Company now whip the show into a “SpongeBob”-size franchise? It is certainly trying. Disney has shifted gears from a soft to a hard sell for “Phineas and Ferb.” Costumed characters have been introduced at Disneyland, where posters advertising the show also adorn ticket kiosks. By mid-July, the program’s first major merchandising line will be introduced by mass retailers — Wal-Mart, Kmart, Kohl’s, J. C. Penney, Target — and a monthly magazine will arrive soon. In addition, Kraft has licensed Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher to adorn its Macaroni and Cheese line (arriving in grocery aisles in 2011). “We have the ability to identify properties and emerging trends that are capturing the attention of kids — what’s the hottest license, what’s coming up — and ‘Phineas and Ferb’ is definitely one,” said Lisa Harnisch, a Toys “R” Us vice president. Disney, particularly keen on expanding the show’s male audience, has also successfully pushed sports leagues and teams (the Los Angeles Dodgers, for example) to integrate the characters into in-stadium videos and marketing efforts. The N.B.A. used a song from the program, “Squirrels in My Pants,” intercut with game video to promote its recent playoffs. And, of course, there is a surge of new “Phineas and Ferb” content on the way, including a TV movie. A potential spinoff is centered on the Fireside Girls, a gaggle of Girl Scout-types that often aid the stepbrothers in their adventures. Disney is also working on related live-action talk show where the two characters (as cartoons) interview celebrities. “Phineas and Ferb,” created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff Marsh, both veterans of shows like “The Simpsons” and “Family Guy,” took 16 years to make it onto television. The pair were repeatedly told that their idea — two 11-minute shorts that each have three story lines that intersect at the conclusion — was too confusing for children to follow. Each episode also features an original song. “To be fair, it is an intimidating show compared to what else is out there,” said Mr. Marsh, who goes by the nickname Swampy. “Disney in particular had never done a show like this before,” he added, referring to the intention to create episodes by first using drawings, or storyboards, rather than a script. “We fought very hard early on not to dumb anything down,” said Mr. Povenmire. “We don’t really care if there is a joke that goes over a kid’s head — there will be another joke coming at them in five seconds. All we care about is that the kid doesn’t want to turn the channel.” The animation style of the characters is also unusual. Phineas’s head is a triangle and Ferb’s is a rectangle. Each episode revolves around the stepbrothers’ coming up with over-the-top projects to stave off summer boredom. They used a snow cone machine to make a ski slope in their backyard in one episode. In another they sent a miniaturized submarine into their sister’s digestive system. Disney has struggled in recent years to gain traction in television animation. It has found some success in the preschool market with shows like “Handy Manny” and “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.” But blockbusters like “SpongeBob” — shows that hit a cultural nerve and attract children and adults alike — have been all but nonexistent. “SpongeBob,” long the dominant television cartoon and the property of its rival Nickelodeon, is clearly in Disney’s sights. At a recent brand licensing trade show in Las Vegas, Gary Marsh, president of entertainment and chief creative officer for Disney Channel Worldwide, listed various ratings coups for “Phineas and Ferb,” ending with a triumphant, “Yep, beating out ‘SpongeBob.’ ” The accuracy of that statement depends on how the Nielsen figures are sliced and diced, but for 2009, “Phineas and Ferb” was the No. 1 television animated series among children 6 to 11. “SpongeBob” is still a firm No. 1 when judged by the broader children’s demographic of 2 to 11, Nickelodeon said. “Their math is fuzzy,” said David Bittler, a Nickelodeon spokesman. “ ‘SpongeBob’ and four of our other programs all rank higher than that show this year.” Disney executives say they have tried to take a slow-and-steady approach when it comes to turning the series, which began in 2007, into a franchise. “Phineas and Ferb” is shown on both Disney Channel and Disney XD. “It was like a felt-tip pen on a napkin; you plant it there and it at first makes a very small dot and then spreads,” said Gary Marsh, who is not related to Jeff Marsh. “You don’t want to hawk it to the nth degree to launch it,” he continued. “If people discover it on their own first, they will feel a sense of ownership.” The songs have proved to be one of the most important elements of the series. Getting a song into a child’s head is often the key to immortality — think about the theme music for “The Flintstones.” For an coming episode, Jeff Marsh and Mr. Povenmire got Chaka Khan and Clay Aiken to record a duet. The music is also a way for content to spread virally on the Web, particularly among college students. “I honestly was starting to lose hope about cartoons because all of the new ones seem to be mean-spirited or raunchy,” said Kirstie Barlow, a 19-year-old college student whose YouTube channel about the series has nearly 11,000 subscribers. “This show is funny because it’s witty. I don’t feel like my brain cells are dying when I’m watching it.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/06/19/business/19potter.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Universal Hopes Tourists Flock to Harry Potter Attraction<date>Published: June 18, 2010</date><text>ORLANDO, Fla. — First Harry Potter helped rejuvenate book publishing. Then he powered a boom in family mega-movies. Can the boy wizard now use his global popularity to give a lift to central Florida’s $31 billion tourism business?For Universal Orlando, the ailing resort here that opened an elaborate Harry Potter-themed expansion on Friday, and the broader market — including the rival Walt Disney World — the expectations are tremendous. And judging from the turnout on opening day, warranted. By the usual 9 a.m. opening time, there was a six-hour wait just to enter the gates of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, as the 20-acre expansion is called. Hogsmeade, the all-wizard village from J. K. Rowling’s books, was gridlocked as Muggles, sweating in 90-degree heat, waited an hour to taste butterbeer. Thirty-five minutes outside Ollivander’s Wand Shop — built tiny on purpose to be authentic to Ms. Rowling’s stories — got you five minutes inside. Still, those who braved opening day came prepared to wait. Blythe and Paige Passantino, sisters from Charlotte, N.C., were among the throng of people who assembled before dawn hoping to be among the first to pass under the sign reading “Please Respect the Spell Limits” and soak in the experience. It was “so much better than I could have imagined it,” said Paige Passantino, 18. Blythe Passantino, 21, followed with a tearful admission of her own: “I really wanted to live here; it was so much better than our real lives.” The recession has hammered theme parks nationwide, but Universal Orlando — comprising Islands of Adventure, Universal Studios Florida, three hotels and a shopping district — has suffered more than most. Years of little investment left it increasingly unable to compete with Disney, which dominates the market with four major parks. Even SeaWorld has pulled ahead. Attendance in 2009 dropped 10 percent at Universal Studios Florida, to 5.5 million, compared with a year earlier, according to analysts. The newer Islands of Adventure fared even worse, with attendance down 11 percent, to 4.6 million. Combined food, beverage and merchandise sales plummeted nearly 20 percent from 2007 to 2009, according to analysts. NBC Universal, which co-owns Universal Orlando with the Blackstone Group, hopes the Wizarding World, built at an estimated cost of $265 million, will raise annual attendance by over 10 percent. (Universal licensed the Harry Potter park rights from Warner Brothers; Wizarding World is based on the visual landscapes of the films that Warner Brothers produced.) The potential for souvenir profits is enormous. For the first time, Universal has its must-buy equivalent of Disney’s plastic mouse ears: exclusive Potter merchandise. Items include holly-and-phoenix-feather wands — purchased at Ollivander’s, where, just like in the books and films, flowers wilt on command. (More interested in travel than tricks? A Nimbus broomstick sells for $250.) No wonder Universal executives can barely contain their excitement. Alice Norsworthy, Universal Orlando’s executive vice president for marketing, declared that Wizarding World — even before opening — had “established itself as the most spectacular themed environment in the world.” The broader Orlando market is betting that Wizarding World’s popularity will lift all boats. The number of visitors to the region declined about 5 percent in 2009, according to Gary C. Sain, chief executive of the Orlando Convention and Visitors Bureau. But forecasts call for Harry Potter mania to help drive an increase of 2 percent in 2010 and an additional 3 percent in 2011, he said. The region particularly covets international visitors, and Mr. Sain said he expected the global popularity of the Harry Potter franchise — over 400 million copies in print and about $6 billion in worldwide movie ticket sales — to prompt tourists from abroad to consider visiting central Florida for the first time. The arrival of Wizarding World comes as Disney tries to reduce discounting that it adopted as a result of the recession. Discounts on hotel rooms and food has kept attendance high — all four of Disney’s Orlando parks recorded slight attendance increases last year — but profit has suffered. Income for Disney’s resorts unit sank 25 percent, to $1.4 billion, for the company’s 2009 fiscal year. Aware that few visits to Orlando are complete without a day at one of its parks, Disney executives say the company will benefit from Universal’s blockbuster promotional campaign for Wizarding World. Advertising for the attraction has included a Super Bowl commercial and a 30-minute infomercial on NBC. For its part, Warner is counting on Wizarding World to help keep the Harry Potter franchise vibrant as it winds down at the multiplex. “It’s very possible that there will be a generation of kids who will experience Harry Potter for the first time in this park,” said Diane Nelson, president of DC Entertainment and the Warner executive who manages the Potter brand. Universal had been pursuing the Potter theme-park rights since 2002, when creative executives from Universal presented ideas to Warner on a Hollywood soundstage. Warner and Ms. Rowling went with Universal after a flirtation with Disney, in part because they wanted to maintain more control. Everything from the snow on Hogsmeade’s roofs to the packaging on merchandise needed Warner’s approval — some 10,000 submissions, according to Brad Globe, president of Warner Brothers Consumer Products. “Sometimes you can just build a great ride and the rest is O.K. — not with these fans,” Mr. Globe said. Ms. Rowling and art directors from the films have been deeply involved with Wizarding World’s creation. Universal had to redo parts of the rock base for Hogwarts, the castle where Harry Potter and friends attend school, because the Warner team thought it was unrealistic. For its part, Universal insisted that there could be no (fake) rats in the Three Broomsticks pub. Ms. Rowling tasted potential butterbeer recipes. (One person who was not involved: Steven Spielberg, who has a spectacularly rich consulting contract with Universal. Mr. Spielberg, who helped to design the Jurassic Park ride and others, gets about 2 percent of gross receipts from Universal’s Florida and Japan parks in perpetuity.) Universal has had trouble with some of its big openings. The 1990 introduction of Universal Studios Florida was marked by malfunctioning attractions and fuming customers; Islands of Adventure opened to smoother results but had flaws nonetheless. None of that was on display on Friday. One in 10 visitors dressed in some manner of Hogwarts attire. Aaron Gust, 20, was in full Hufflepuff regalia — right down to the school tie — and had donned an invisibility cloak. Paige Passantino was dressed as Luna Lovegood, whom she described as “the eccentric Ravenclaw.” Deborah Kolleya, 48, had come from Birmingham, Ala., with her family to see Wizarding World and, she noted, nothing else in the area. Rather than just watching and reading, “we wanted to actually experience the magic,” she said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/business/media/15espn.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Xbox 360 in Deal to Stream ESPN3<date>Published: June 14, 2010</date><text>In another content deal for a video game console, ESPN said Monday that it would stream thousands of sporting events to owners of Microsoft Xbox 360 consoles this year.Access to ESPN’s broadband sports network, known as ESPN3, will be free for premium subscribers to Xbox’s membership service, which is called Xbox Live. The deal is exclusive to Xbox, meaning that Microsoft’s gaming competitors, Sony and Nintendo, will not be able to carry ESPN3. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The deal stems from conversations that started two years ago between Microsoft and ESPN, which is controlled by the Walt Disney Company. Microsoft’s decision to pay a license fee for ESPN3 reflects an eagerness on the part of console manufacturers to be a pathway for content. This spring Sony cut a deal to add Major League Baseball’s live streaming service to the PlayStation 3 console. Both Microsoft and Sony have made initial forays into video production, as well. Through the Xbox, “we can reach a group that we don’t normally reach,” John Kosner, the senior vice president and general manager of ESPN Digital Media, said in an interview. He said the service would create a “live event experience” for the console. At a Microsoft press conference at the Electronics Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles on Monday, ESPN demonstrated that viewers would be able to chat with friends and answer trivia questions during games, in part through voice recognition. The arrangement, which will go into effect in November, does not appear to threaten the sports media empire’s lucrative deals with cable, satellite and Internet distributors. ESPN3 shows more than 3,500 live sporting events a year, according to the company, but not some of the marquee events that drive television ratings. In order to watch ESPN3, a user’s Internet service provider must have a licensing agreement with ESPN.</text></article></page><page index="9"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/movies/13scott.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Blockbuster 4: The Same, but Worse<date>Published: June 9, 2010</date><text>THE imminent arrival of actual, calendar-based summer a little more than a week from now means that movie summer has been going on for almost two months. And that means it is a perfect time to start complaining about how bad the summer movies are  even the ones that haven’t been released yet. In particular those darn sequels, a perennial easy target for those of us who persist in entertaining high hopes for summer entertainment. Skip to next paragraph Related Trailers for Sequels The Twilight Saga: Eclipse Shrek Forever After Sex and the City 2 Iron Man 2 Toy Story 3 Enlarge This Image DreamWorks Animation and Paramount Pictures A scene from “Shrek Forever After.” Enlarge This Image Francois Duhamel/Paramount Pictures and Marvel Entertainment Samuel L. Jackson, left, and Robert Downey Jr. in “Iron Man 2.” Enlarge This Image Jaap Buitendijk/Warner Brothers Pictures Daniel Radcliffe in “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I.” Every year it’s the same, and every year it’s worse than ever. This year is surely the worst of all time, or at least since, I don’t know, 2007. Just look at the list of recent and coming movies, with all those darn numerals trailing after them: “Iron Man 2,” “Shrek 4” (whatever title DreamWorks Animation finally decided on), “Sex and the City 2,” “Toy Story 3.” Later on there will be a sequel to the audience-polarizing interspecies smackdown “Cats and Dogs” and a third installment (in 3-D, no less) in the “Step Up” dance franchise. And don’t forget “Twilight.” And “Nanny McPhee Returns.” And of course the next “Harry Potter” movie, which is coming in the fall. Have the movie studios completely given up? Is originality extinct? It isn’t only the sequels that fuel such questions of course. (And the answer isn’t always no.) But the steady production of repeatable, renewable movie franchises provides both the clearest evidence of Hollywood’s fundamental cynicism, and also the best excuse to wax cynical about Hollywood. Or does it? Of course it is absurd to deny that rampant sequelism is driven, above all, by commercial calculations. “Why did they make another Shrek movie?” one of my children asked me as we bought tickets to see it, and I suspect it was at least partly a rhetorical question. The first three made so much money that a fourth was pretty much automatic. Every few years since 2001 a new cohort of youngsters has arrived needing green ogre plush toys and other licensed Shrek merchandise to join their Buzz and Woody dolls and Spider-Man action figures. The landscape is also littered with countless abandoned would-be franchises: “Narnia” appears to be getting a second chance, but it seems unlikely that “The Golden Compass” or “Cirque du Freak” or “Master and Commander” or the brand-new and struggling “Prince of Persia” will be so lucky. All of these came from popular sources, which shows that success does not come automatically when best-selling novels or video games are adapted for the screen. Nevertheless it sometimes seems that every commercially ambitious movie these days, with the possible exception of certain romantic comedies, comes with built-in sequel potential. The mercenary impulses of the culture industry always have a plausible populist basis: DreamWorks Animation and Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer and Marvel Studios and all the other serial peddlers are giving us what we want  what they know we like. And this is hardly new. The current era of big-budget, mass-market movie sequelization dates back to the 1970s, when the personal cinema of the New Hollywood spawned, almost as a byproduct, a handful of nostalgic baby-boomer adventures, horror movies and action spectaculars that eventually took over the business. Those of us who grew up in that era remember the unfolding of the “Rocky,” “Star Wars,” “Superman” and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” series, but it is easy to forget that movies like “Jaws,” “Carrie” and “The Exorcist” also spawned further episodes. And when you survey the much-maligned American cinema of the 1980s, it can be hard to find a popular movie that didn’t. There were “Lethal Weapon” and “Die Hard,” “Halloween” and “Friday the 13th,” “Batman” and “Rambo.” Remember all those “Police Academy” movies? Do you wish I hadn’t reminded you? Sorry. Their persistence back there in the shadowy realms of collective memory testifies not only to the vexing ontological riddle that is Steve Guttenberg, but also  at least as profoundly  to a notable aspect of our deep human craving for narrative. Anyone who has told a child a bedtime story knows that its conclusion is met with the demand for “another one”  for the same one again, but a little bit different. Movies are far from the only medium to cater to this desire. The current practice of presenting feature films as installments in a single story cycle recalls the old one- and two-reel serials that used to precede the main attraction in the pretelevision era of moviegoing. And it is hardly an accident that so many of the current franchises are spun from superhero comic books, which fed the youthful appetite of every generation since the Great Depression for open-ended storytelling. Before that, there were crime novels and cowboy pulps. Back in the Victorian era there was Sherlock Holmes, a forerunner of both the 20th-century private eye and his superhero cousins. The great novels of Charles Dickens were first read in periodical cliffhanger installments. How far back should we go? Shakespeare’s continuing adventures of Prince (later King) Henry, that medieval muggle proto-Potter? It seems unlikely that Homer, whoever he was, recited the whole of the Odyssey in one sitting. Anyway, it was already a sequel to the Illiad, unless that poem was the prequel. And surely every little Greek kid wanted an Achilles action figure  Trojan horse sold separately. To return to the modern world, there is television, a cosmos of narrative seriality in all its many shapes. There are, classically, the long and short arcs of the sitcom or the drama, the hour or half-hour that seems to occur in a vacuum, complete unto itself until the next week. There is the long, curlicued line of the soap opera, which has in the past few decades migrated from network daytime into prime time and then into the exalted realm of premium and basic cable. There are mini-series and spinoffs and, most recently and perhaps most radically, entire multiseason shows conceived as single, cyclical works. One notable contrast, this year, between television and the movies is that a handful of TV shows actually and explicitly came to an end. “Lost” at last explained itself  or didn’t, depending on how you interpreted its conclusions; “24” ran out the clock”; and “Law &amp; Order” just stopped. These different forms of closure and the popular reactions to them reveal various ways of dealing with loss. The ending of every story is an intimation and an allegory of death, which is one reason the cold finish of “The Sopranos” a few years ago felt so jarring and, upon reflection, so right. The slight disappointment with the last “Lost” was inevitable, since even a spiritual summation could not compensate for the rich, mysterious pleasures of the previous years. And the grief attending the demise of “Law &amp; Order” was akin to that attending a death from old age. Yes, it was much too soon  it always is  but what a long, full life it had been. Some of the most popular movie franchises of the past decade  the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy, the Harry Potter pictures and the “Twilight” saga  benefit from and are limited by built-in closure. All of them follow book series in which each volume is at once a satisfying, rounded-off story and the segment in a bigger, grander chronicle. Ideally, each of the films in these cycles should be able both to stand alone as a cinematic experience and flow into the whole. And in practice, at least for many legions of fans, they do. But this is not so easy to accomplish with other types of story and other kinds of source material. The exhaustion of the superhero movie  I mean both the tiredness of individual films like “Spider-Man 3” and “X-Men: The Last Stand” and the general malaise afflicting this still-bankable genre  arises precisely from the difficulty of balancing the demands of seriality with the basic requirement of pleasing this audience at this movie right now. The teasers inserted into the first “Iron Man” to suggest delights to come in subsequent chapters felt ingenious and exciting. In “Iron Man 2” such forestalling and foreshadowing was annoying, as if we were being conned into future ticket purchases rather than given our money’s worth. That is sometimes the fate of middle movies, though more often with superheroes it is Part 2 that stands out above the others. The dutiful expository business of explaining origins has been taken care of, and the hero can suffer, fight and explore the dilemmas of his dual nature. (This has been notably true of “The Dark Knight,” and the second “Spider-Man” and “X-Men” movies,) After that, things get too busy and baroque, and after the third or fourth installment the franchise fades away until the next reboot or casting change. And then there are sequels that seem more like epilogues or redundancies  a category that includes “Shrek Forever After” and “Sex and the City 2.” The characters in those movies have already, in previous episodes, come to rest not in death but in its comic analogy, marriage. Of course, in real life, there is more to life than happily ever after, but it’s harder to complicate or undo that state in stories. Carrie and Big will no more be torn asunder than Shrek and Fiona, so the filmmakers have confected elaborately flimsy tales playing on the unconvincing possibility that they might. Shrek develops amnesia, Carrie a mild case of the two-year-itch, but the emotional investment is gone, and the stories have gone on too long. Of the making of sequels, though, there will be no end. We all need something to look forward to. And something to complain about. I don’t know about you, but I can hardly wait until next summer.

He doesn’t know the student couple he’s riding with; he merely answered the ad they posted on the campus ride board. They turn out to be his worst nightmare. “Know any show tunes?” the girl asks. “That’s a great idea!” chirps the boy (who is played, incidentally, by Tim Robbins), whereupon they launch into a hokey cabaret-duo version of the song “Aquarius” from “Hair,” followed by an even more excruciating rendition of the old cutesie-poo standard “Button Up Your Overcoat.” The look of despair on John Cusack’s face says it all: musical-theater types are losers. This scene springs to mind because it’s so startlingly distant from the prevailing youth mind-set today. Something weird and profound has happened in the four years since the original “High School Musical” movie was first shown on the Disney Channel and surprised everyone, including Disney, with its smash success: the musical-theater idiom has regained its currency, and is enjoying what may be its greatest popularity among young people since the pre-rock era. We’re raising a generation of Broadway babies. The foremost example of this is “Glee,” Fox’s instant-hit TV show, which just wound up its first full season. The show’s specious premise is that the members of William McKinley High’s glee club are social outcasts, but clearly, they’re anything but. Most teenagers in America would forfeit a year’s worth of Facebook privileges to inhabit the world of Rachel Berry and Finn Hudson, the powerfully piped high-schoolers played by Lea Michele and Cory Monteith. And Broadway has acquired a vital youth audience. Walk past the stage door of the St. James Theater after a performance of “American Idiot,” the new musical based on the Green Day album of the same name, and you’ll see teenagers crowding the barricades like bobby-soxers in the early heyday of Frank Sinatra. It’s the same deal with the current revival of “Hair” at the Al Hirschfeld Theater, which will close in two weeks after a surprisingly robust run of more than 500 performances. “We knew people of my generation would go for it — I’m in my 50s,” said Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater, under whose auspices the revival originated in 2008 at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. “But I was shocked at how it immediately became this thing with young people. There are dedicated youngsters who come back multiple times. They’re always the first ones who come up on stage at the end. They actually call themselves ‘Hairballs.’ ” Last winter, Mr. Eustis and his fellow producers shrewdly took advantage of the big snowstorm of Feb. 10, which closed schools citywide, by offering steeply discounted Snow Day tickets to anyone with a student ID. The Broadway babies are not the passive, bused-in tourist young people of yore who went to see “The Phantom of the Opera” or “A Chorus Line” simply because it was what one did when visiting New York. They’re true believers for whom love of musicals brings happiness, transcendence, and, strangely enough, social acceptance. Ask Fred Hechinger, a fourth grader at the Manhattan School for Children, which shows he has seen in the last year or so, and his response sounds like the A-B-C listings in The New York Times’s arts section: “ ‘Gypsy,’ ‘South Pacific,’ ‘Finian’s Rainbow,’ ‘A Little Night Music,’ ‘Hair’ three times. A lot of Off-Broadway stuff, too.” Fred’s theatergoing habit has the support of his parents, Paul and Sarah, and, more notably, his classmates. “When I was 5, 6, 7, there weren’t as many kids seeing shows, but now most of them do,” he said. “There are maybe, like, three kids in my school who don’t like theater.” My daughter, 14, is also a member of the genus Showpeople. She has seen “Hair” four times. She spends summers at a theater-arts sleepaway camp in the Catskills called Stagedoor Manor. She not only watches “Glee” raptly, but also is sufficiently fluent in musical theater to have remarked, when the actor Jonathan Groff materialized in an April episode as a new romantic interest for Rachel, “It’s a ‘Spring Awakening’ reunion!” (Mr. Groff and Ms. Michele starred in that Tony-winning Broadway show, which seems in retrospect as significant a cultural portent as “High School Musical.”) Cindy Samuelson, the owner of Stagedoor Manor, said that the application numbers at the camp are the highest they have ever been, no doubt bolstered by the fact that Ms. Michele is the latest graduate to hit it big, joining a roster that includes Natalie Portman, Robert Downey Jr., Zach Braff and Mandy Moore. But to Ms. Samuelson, the truly significant changes are in the demographics, with campers now coming from 44 of the 50 United States and “from every continent but Antarctica.” What is more, boys are applying in ever-greater numbers to the point that two years ago, the camp was compelled to expand the boys’ sleeping areas by 20 beds.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/arts/television/12games.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Awaiting Holidays’ Electronics (and Sales)<date>Published: June 11, 2010</date><text>There is no more important annual event in interactive entertainment than E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo.

Join the discussion. More Arts News As game makers, if you are not Blizzard Entertainment (World of Warcraft) or Rockstar Games (Grand Theft Auto)  the two quasi-independent publishers that define the industry’s most exalted tier of power and popularity  you pretty much have to be there. The mood at this year’s E3 looks to be one of cautious confidence, judging from conversations I recently had with top executives at some of the big American game publishers. Even though software retail sales have been lackluster so far this year amid the overall recession, gaming online and on mobile devices like the iPhone is booming. And the arrival of Wii competitors and the first batch of 3-D games promises more innovation. Here are the key concepts I will be keeping in mind at this year’s E3: DOES THE HOLIDAY SEASON EVEN MATTER ANYMORE? (OR, IS MARCH THE NEW OCTOBER?) There has never been a first half of any calendar year that has matched the bounty of the first half of 2010. The best, most interesting games of 2010 so far have been Red Dead Redemption from Rockstar and Heavy Rain from Sony, but players have also been treated to other major titles, including God of War III, Bayonetta, Final Fantasy XIII, Nier, Mass Effect 2, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Alan Wake, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, BioShock 2 and Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell: Conviction, not to mention a new Pokémon. So can this coming holiday season, promising games like new versions of Halo and Call of Duty, possibly compete? The 2010 roster has already been so compelling that at least some executives seem to fear that the industry may be leading consumers into unrealistic expectations. “No, I’ve never seen this before,” said Christoph Hartmann, president of 2K Games, which released BioShock 2 in February. “I don’t even know if it’s good for consumers. It’s like an overflow of chocolate and then a drought of chocolate, and as a chocolate addict, I don’t want that. At one level it’s good, but at another level it’s dangerous, because the consumers’ expectation of quality is driven too high. In general it’s a trend we have to watch: that we’re not digging our own grave in that the expectations of people are so high that we’re just not able to fulfill it.” My job is constantly to drive expectations of quality in video games higher and higher, so I say, bring it on. A great game will earn its due no matter when it is released. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen a lineup like this in the first six months of the year,” said Pete Hines, vice president for marketing at Bethesda Softworks, which recently revived the classic Fallout series and whose parent company, ZeniMax Media, acquired iD Software, originators of the Doom and Quake franchises. “I don’t know if there are major implications for the holiday,” he said, but added, “It just means people have had a lot more to spend their money on now rather than having it to spend later in the year.” LOOK MA, NO CONTROLLER! (BUT CAN ANYONE MAKE MONEY LIKE THAT?) The most important development in gaming over the last several years was Nintendo’s introduction and ingenious marketing of the Wii. At a moment when video games were in danger of being relegated to the fringe of mass entertainment and culture, à la comic books, Nintendo delivered brilliantly on the belief that people who would never pick up a traditional button-covered controller could still be attracted to gaming. It gave those people a new sort of intuitive interface: a wand that you can just wave around. Microsoft and Sony are now playing catch up. Microsoft’s biggest push at E3 will be around Natal, an add-on for the Xbox 360 expected later this year that uses a camera to allow you to control on-screen action without holding any physical device. Theoretically, Natal lets you physically kick your leg to strike a soccer ball or wave your hand to control a virtual paintbrush. Meanwhile, Sony will be hyping Move, a new system for the Playstation 3 that involves Wii-like devices shaped a bit like ice cream cones instead of customary controllers. But here’s the thing: almost no one besides Nintendo itself has made much money on the Wii (Disney, with its emphasis on kids’ games, is one of the few). And that raises the question of whether Natal and Move will provide much opportunity for outside developers interested in making high-end games. “Natal games at 60 bucks are probably a stretch,” said Frank Gibeau, president of EA Games, referring to the price of most big-name titles. But he added that the strength and popularity of the Xbox Live service from Microsoft made the prospect of cheaper downloadable games using Natal potentially more attractive. Graham Hopper, executive vice president and general manager for Disney Interactive Studios, which has not achieved huge success on the Xbox and PlayStation in the past, would not comment on any specific deals with Microsoft and Sony. But, he said, “When I look at Move and Natal and their motion-sensing interfaces, it gives me a lot of encouragement about the future of the Disney brand on those platforms.” THE ‘AVATAR’ EFFECT (OR, GET READY TO DUCK!) I am initially skeptical about the viability of 3-D gaming technology in the near term. But I’m willing to be convinced, and I have come to expect a lot of convincing at this year’s E3. Nintendo has already announced that it is developing a 3-D version of its popular DS handheld, but I expect the real surprises to come from Sony. There is a lot going on here. First, Sony makes fabulous televisions, while Microsoft doesn’t make TVs at all. That gives Sony a unique impetus and opportunity to develop and market home 3-D technology. Second, in actually delivering 3-D content, the PlayStation 3, with its Blu-ray storage and superior silicon horsepower, would logically appear to have an advantage over the Xbox 360, with its mere DVD storage. As with the motion-sensing technologies, I’ll be keeping an eye on which outside publishers Sony has been able to get on board with 3-D gaming. The other big question is whether Microsoft will have any 3-D initiative of its own or whether those folks from Redmond, Wash., have put all their eggs for now in the Natal basket.

The guild leaders are alarmed that Disney is in exclusive talks with Mr. Bergstein, his co-investor Ron Tutor and others, according to a person briefed on the expressions of concern, which have stopped short of a formal threat to oppose the acquisition. A sale would turn over responsibility for millions of dollars in residual payments connected with more than 600 films and television episodes in the Miramax library. That person spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflicts with Disney, guild leaders and the Bergstein group. A Disney spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said top Disney executives said they were unaware of the guilds’ expression of concerns. For the last week, Disney has been talking exclusively with the group led by Mr. Bergstein. Those talks began after a group that included the investor Ron Burkle and Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the brothers who co-founded Miramax and later sold it to Disney, failed to reach a deal for the unit. A failure by Mr. Bergstein’s group could swing the Weinsteins and Mr. Burkle back into center position. The Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America, West — as well as their related pension and health plans — have been listed as creditors in a complex of bankruptcy cases that involves the Capco Group and other companies associated with Mr. Bergstein. One case, which was filed in March in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, includes claims related to the films “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” and the “Love Ranch,” an as-yet-unreleased film directed by Taylor Hackford, who is the president of the directors guild. Representatives for the three guilds declined to comment. Asked on Thursday about the guild concerns, Mr. Bergstein said the specific claims against various companies in the bankruptcy court were misdirected, because he did not actually produce movies and was not a party to agreements the guilds cited. “My organization basically is a lender,” Mr. Bergstein said, adding that he had specialized in buying the debt of distressed companies and acquiring assets through foreclosure. Mr. Bergstein described any attempt by the guilds to question the possible Miramax sale as belonging to a pattern of illegal interference with his business. “To call a potential seller is completely illegal behavior,” Mr. Bergstein said. “We’ll be doing something about it. I can’t tell you what,” he said, referring to what he described as continuing challenges to his business dealings by the guilds. Any legal challenge to a transfer of Disney’s guild obligations to a Bergstein-led group would most likely come only after a deal was concluded, partly because the guilds have been careful to avoid impairing their already tense relationship with Mr. Bergstein by taking a public position against the merger.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/business/10disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Hopes to Revive Park With a Fountain Display<date>Published: June 10, 2010</date><text>ANAHEIM, Calif. — Can an expensive fountain extravaganza finally turn the Walt Disney Company’s California Adventure theme park here into a hit?On Thursday, Disney will unveil World of Color, an elaborate water show that is estimated to have cost about $75 million. It is part of a $1 billion overhaul at the struggling park that Disney built nearly a decade ago in what used to be Disneyland’s main parking lot. Constructed in a three-acre lagoon, the 26-minute show combines music, lighting, fire, lasers and 1,200 programmable jets of water to bring classic Disney characters to life. Animation from movies like “Aladdin” and “Wall-E” is incorporated using 28 digital projectors and a 380-foot screen made entirely of water. The individual fountains, which rise as high as 200 feet in the air, are built on an underwater platform the size of a football field, according to Disney, and feature 18,000 points of control for color intensity, water angle and height. In a nutshell, think of a more animated version of the dancing fountains outside of the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. “Painting with water” is how Steven Davison, Disney’s vice president for parades and spectaculars, refers to the aquatic display, which was five years in the making and inspired by “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color,” the 1960s era television series. “We wanted to take fountain technology — varied planes of water, different textures of water — and use it to tell stories in a new way,” Mr. Davison said. Opened on the cheap in 2001, California Adventure has been a laggard in Disney’s $11 billion resorts and parks portfolio. The company has been pouring money into the park to turn it around, notably two years ago adding Toy Story Mania, an $80 million attraction that essentially puts riders inside a video game. But California Adventure attracted only about six million visitors last year, a trickle compared with the 16 million who swarmed the adjacent Disneyland, according to theme park analysts. Disney hopes that over-the-top attractions like World of Color will take some stress off Disneyland, which is often so crowded that guests are unpleasantly packed elbow to elbow, while increasing its hold in the lucrative but hotly competitive Southern California market. A successful California Adventure would also increase revenue from Disney’s resort offerings in Anaheim, which include three hotels and a shopping district. “World of Color puts more Disney DNA into that park,” said Thomas O. Staggs, the company’s theme park chairman. “It’s the kind of attraction that speaks to how we want to direct our capital — something that is quintessentially Disney, that can easily evolve over time, that broadens our potential guest base.” In addition to World of Color, which will be presented two or three times each night, California Adventure additions include a ride based on “The Little Mermaid” and a 12-acre expansion devoted to “Cars,” the animated film by Pixar. There is also an array of broader overhauls — a new entrance, brick streets instead of asphalt — that aim to make the park more intimate and emotion-tugging, said Robert W. Weis, executive vice president of Walt Disney Imagineering. Renovations are also under way at the Disneyland Hotel (new rooms, substantial upgrades to the pool) and at the company’s flagship park, where a new version of “Star Tours” is planned. Determined to make World of Color a success, Disney has activated its vaunted marketing system around the attraction. Television commercials promoting the fountains have been running regionally and at a preview for 6,000 people on Tuesday night, an announcer introduced the “thrilling nighttime spectacular” as “a life changer.” Rebecca Kai, who traveled from Sacramento with her family to see the advanced viewing, said she wouldn’t go that far. But she did give World of Color a resounding thumbs-up. “It took me back to my childhood and gave me chills,” she said. “I just kept staring and thinking, ‘How do they do that?’ ”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/10/business/10zone.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney to Close 5 ESPN Zone Restaurants<date>Published: June 10, 2010</date><text>The Walt Disney Company is closing five ESPN Zone restaurants, saying the economics of the business became too challenging.Locations in Baltimore, Chicago, Las Vegas, New York and Washington will close June 16, ESPN said Wednesday. The cable sports network is controlled by Disney. ESPN Zone is a sports-themed restaurant chain started 12 years ago by Disney. It will stay open in Los Angeles and Anaheim, Calif., where the restaurants are run by Anschutz Entertainment Group and Zone Enterprises, ESPN said. “This was a very difficult decision to make” Rick Alessandri, senior vice president at the cable sports network, said in an interview. “But it was the right decision to make.” Each restaurant was split into three sections, according to Disney regulatory filings: a “studio grill” for dining, a “screening room” for watching ESPN sports coverage and a “sports arena” for playing interactive games. The restaurants averaged about 30,000 square feet, large by industry standards, Mr. Alessandri said. The 50,000-square-foot location in Times Square was the biggest, and the restaurant in Baltimore was the chain’s first, he said. Disney is opening a retail store in Times Square. ESPN would not release revenue or other financial information about the chain. Shares of Disney, based in Burbank, Calif., fell 21 cents, to $32.94.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/business/media/02disney.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Puts Tickets on a Facebook Site<date>Published: June 1, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — The Walt Disney Company has created what it believes is a first-of-its-kind application allowing Facebook users to buy tickets to “Toy Story 3” without leaving the social networking site and while, at the same time, prodding their friends to come along.The application, called Disney Tickets Together, could transform how Hollywood sells movie tickets by combining purchases with the powerful forces of social networking. When you buy a ticket through Disney’s application, for instance, it alerts your Facebook friends and prompts you to invite them to buy tickets of their own. Disney quietly introduced the service on May 26 with a simple post on the site’s official “Toy Story 3” page, which has over 732,000 followers. While many theaters will not make tickets available for the film, which was made by Disney’s Pixar unit, for another week — its release date is June 18 — early results indicate that people are using the application to buy tickets in groups as large as 80, according to Disney. “The whole idea is that no friend gets left behind,” said Oliver Luckett, senior vice president and general manager of DigiSynd, a Disney subsidiary that manages the entertainment giant’s social networking presence. Disney Tickets Together, which has been in development for months, works with ticket-buying sites like Fandango.com and covers the majority of the movie theaters in North America, Mr. Luckett said. Facebook receives no percentage of the ticket sales but does, in theory, get more visitors on its site. For now, only “Toy Story 3” tickets are available. But Mr. Luckett said other Disney movies would follow if the application is deemed a success. Facebook, which is approaching 500 million users around the world, has become a crucial marketing tool for entertainment companies. Disney alone operates hundreds of promotional pages on the site for its various products — motion pictures, theme park attractions, consumer articles, television shows — that cumulatively reach tens of millions of people. But Disney Tickets Together represents a deepening relationship between businesses and Facebook users, according to Dan Rose, the site’s vice president for partnerships and platform marketing. “What Disney is doing moves beyond just creating awareness to using the platform to acquire customers directly,” Mr. Rose said. “This is the first time that a movie studio has tried this, which we think makes a lot of sense because moviegoing is one of those activities that is inherently social.” Buying movie tickets in advance via the Web is becoming more common, especially in cities where screenings routinely sell out. But most tickets are sold the old-fashioned way: people show up at the box office at an appointed time. At most, online ticketing sites account for about 20 percent of the box office for a wide-release movie. Anything that increases ticket sales is likely to be warmly embraced by studio executives and theater owners, who are struggling with declining attendance. Although higher ticket prices have propped up the bottom line, moviegoing is on the decline. About 23.4 million people went to the movies over the Memorial Day weekend, a 22 percent decline from last year and the lowest total since 1993, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box office statistics. Disney is distinctly positioned to bring new marketing ideas to the Web. Steven P. Jobs, the Apple chief executive, joined the Disney board with the 2006 acquisition of Pixar, which he had controlled, and became Disney’s largest shareholder. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, joined Disney’s board six months ago. The entertainment conglomerate has had difficulties figuring out its approach to its own Web site, Disney.com, largely because of management stumbles within the Disney unit that oversees that businesses, analysts say. But the company — notably its television group, which includes ABC and ESPN — has been aggressive about online video and Apple’s iTunes store and iPad. Disney Tickets Together works in the same manner as other Facebook applications. Users click on the “go to application” button and give the service access to personal information in their profiles. A page then loads ticket times at nearby theaters based on their profile location settings. A Disney Tickets Together search in the Los Angeles ZIP code of 90004 on Tuesday served up 88 screenings at 12 theaters. The application provides an option for inviting friends who are not members of the site. The slogan: “ ‘Toy Story 3’ arrives in theaters on June 18! Who are you bringing with you?”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/wall-street-debates-fate-of-disneys-abc/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Wall Street Debates Fate of ABC<date>May 28, 2010, 5:45 am</date><text>Wall Street has long seen sense in Walt Disney selling or spinning off ABC, the low-rated TV network and the one piece that does not seem to fit well with the entertainment empire — but the problem is finding a buyer, Reuters reported. On Wednesday, the long-debated issue resurfaced after prosecutors charged a secretary to a senior Disney executive and her boyfriend with trying to entice would-be insider traders by claiming they knew the company was in advanced discussions with private equity to sell ABC. Wall Street took notice. Disney’s shares, typically steady, shot up nearly 5 percent before Disney said the claim was false. The stock then backtracked to close up 2.3 percent, Reuters said. Some believe the timing is right amid an advertising rebound and prospective new revenue for broadcasters from transmission deals with cable operators, which should bolster ABC’s value.

The British blog, Here Is the City. is disgusted with the amateur performance of the boyfriend and girlfriend team accused of trying to sell confidential information about Walt Disney to several investment firms, including hedge funds. In a post titled “Hedge Fund Letters Probably The Most Stupid Sent,” the publication details excerpts of missives allegedly sent by Bonnie Hoxie, an executive assistant at Disney, and Yonni Sebbag to 33 hedge funds. According to Here Is the City, the introductory letter allegedly sent to the investment firms began: ‘Hi, I have access to Disney (DIS) quarterly earnings report before its release on 5/03/10. I am willing to share this information for a fee that we can determine later….My email is XXX. I count on your discretion as you count on mine’. The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York has charged Ms. Hoxie and Mr. Sebbag, 29, both of Los Angeles, with conspiracy and wire fraud. The two were arrested by F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning. If convicted on all charges, each would face up to 25 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Here Is the City continues: But our dynamic duo’s problems began when several of the hedge funds reported the matter to United States regulator The Securities and Exchange Commission, who called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.). And the FBI set up a sting operation. Posing as ‘investment managers’, the F.B.I. entered into e-mail correspondence with Sebbag. Here are some of the e-mails he sent to the Feds once they had engaged with him (includes original spelling and punctuation): ‘First of all, i am not a fed, I have no way to prove it at this point but i am not asking you to disclose your identity not i will disclose mine. It is up to you to determine if this is worth the risk as i did. I work for Disney, that is all i can tell you’ …. ‘I dont think we will get caught if we stay discrete and careful. You can count on my discretion as i am counting on yours..’. But what really seemed to get the blog’s goat was that they only asked for $15,000 when the met with the F.B.I. agents posing as posing as hedge fund traders.

Disney’s current preschool operation — a block of programming on Disney Channel and about two dozen Playhouse Disney international channels — will be rebranded Disney Junior starting next year. “This represents the next step in a global preschool strategy that started 10 years ago with the introduction of dedicated channels overseas,” Ms. Sweeney said. Disney Junior will not feature advertising. It will be geared to a slightly wider demographic, ages 2 to 7, than other preschool offerings like Sprout and “Sesame Street,” which typically are aimed at ages 2 to 5. Programming on Disney Junior will include about 200 new episodes annually of current Disney Channel shows, including “Handy Manny” and “Special Agent Oso,” and new series like “Jake and the Never Land Pirates,” an animated program about children who pretend to be pirates and encounter Captain Hook. In the works are other shows that play off classic Disney characters. Other offerings will include classic Disney movies like “101 Dalmatians,” “Aladdin” and “The Little Mermaid.” With Disney Junior, the company has chosen a name that echoes the preschool brand operated by rival Nickelodeon, a unit of Viacom. Nick Jr. is a commercial-free channel that features programming like “Dora the Explorer” and “Team Umizoomi” and is available in 73.3 million homes. (Since Nick Jr. became a full-service cable channel in 2008, replacing Noggin, ratings have nearly doubled, indicating a demand for programming for preschoolers in the evenings.) Carolina Lightcap, president of Disney Channels Worldwide, said the name Disney Junior was selected because it clearly suggested shows aimed at younger children. “We’re very comfortable with it — parents know the difference between Disney and Nick,” she said. “The name represents our new brand to a T.” Nickelodeon said in a statement, “The ‘Jr.’ has been part of our preschool identity for over 30 years, and we have a leading educational curriculum that has forged a strong and sincere bond with both preschoolers and their parents.” Ms. Sweeney called the decision to unplug SoapNet “a tough one,” but one that made business sense because the original purpose of the channel, shifting soap operas from day to night, had grown obsolete with the rise of digital video recorders. Disney, which is trying to secure long-term advertising commitments for SoapNet, emphasized that the channel would not go dark for 18 months or so. The company is in the final stages of obtaining approval for the new format from cable affiliates that carry SoapNet. Although ABC remains committed to its soap operas, including “General Hospital” and “All My Children,” other broadcasters have been moving away from the genre, limiting the amount of content available for SoapNet. The enormous preschool market, on the other hand, represents an area of growth for Disney, which has made inroads with programs like “Mickey Mouse Clubhouse” but has not found a cultural phenomenon like “Dora the Explorer.” That hit Nickelodeon series, now a decade old, generates more than $1 billion annually in sales of related products. Disney also wants its TV portfolio to retain children as they grow. The hope is that they will start with Disney Junior, migrate to Disney Channel, which is aimed at ages 6 to 14, and then move to boy-centric Disney XD or ABC Family. One question about Disney Junior is whether the expansion of the target age group will come with a shift away from programs based on education, the hallmark of preschool entertainment. Ms. Lightcap said Disney had no plans to water down the educational components of its preschool lineup, adding that the channel would work to build “more of an emotional connection” to its young viewers but would continue to emphasize language skills, early math and healthful eating.</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/media/27insider.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">2 Charged With Selling Insider Data From Disney<date>Published: May 26, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — An administrative assistant at the Walt Disney Company and a male friend were arrested and charged with selling early access to the entertainment giant’s confidential earnings reports.The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York charged Bonnie Hoxie, 33, and her friend, Yonni Sebbag, 29, both of Los Angeles, with conspiracy and wire fraud. The charges were filed in New York because that is where the money changed hands. The two were arrested by F.B.I. agents in Los Angeles on Wednesday morning. If convicted on all charges, each would face up to 25 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A federal judge released Ms. Hoxie on a $50,000 bond. Mr. Sebbag was ordered held as a potential flight risk. Ms. Hoxie, a worker in Disney’s corporate media relations office who had access to nonpublic draft materials related to quarterly earnings, corresponded via company e-mail with Mr. Sebbag about their scheme, according to the complaint. It gave the following account of their correspondence. “Is it coming or what?” Mr. Sebbag wrote to Ms. Hoxie on May 11, referring to the nonpublic information. She responded: “What would you suggest I do? If I could wave my magic wand and give you what you want — I would.” She later did, serving up a confidential document titled “The Walt Disney Company Q2 Fiscal 2010 Key Topics Speaking Points,” the complaint said. Mr. Sebbag appears to have attracted the attention of the F.B.I. by sending an anonymous form letter to more than 30 hedge funds in the United States and Europe that offered to provide confidential earnings information “for a fee that we can determine later,” the complaint said. It said that undercover agents posing as hedge fund traders communicated with Mr. Sebbag, who provided earnings-related information, including earnings per share, in return for a $15,000 cash payment. Mr. Sebbag further agreed to provide similar information in the future in return for a 30 percent share of any profits from the insider-trading scheme, it said. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a separate civil insider-trading lawsuit against the two with its complaint, detailing how she had asked him for compensation that included a $700 handbag from Neiman Marcus and a pair of expensive Stella McCartney shoes. According to the criminal complaint, Ms. Hoxie and Mr. Sebbag tried to convince the undercover agents that they had the access they had promised by telling them that Disney “is in serious and advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell them the ABC network.” On Wednesday, Disney issued a statement denying any such talks. “The reference in the complaint to conversations regarding the ABC Network were and are false,” the statement read. It added that the company was “fully cooperating” with the investigation. Ms. Hoxie and Mr. Sebbag made the claim about ABC in the wake of rumors that Disney was looking to sell the network after a comment by Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, at the company’s annual meeting.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/24/after-nbc-will-abc-and-cbs-be-next-on-the-block/?ref=disneywaltcompany">After NBC, Will ABC and CBS Be Next on the Block?<date>May 24, 2010, 7:36 am</date><text>After General Electric‘s deal to sell NBC Universal to Comcast, will rival networks ABC and CBS be next to go on the block? That’s the suggestion of The New York Post, which reports that some Wall Street dealmakers are predicting that Sumner Redstone, who controls CBS, and Walt Disney, which owns ABC, may begin mulling whether to put their networks up for sale. The Post reports: Among bankers, CBS appears to be garnering the most attention amid signs Redstone these days isn’t dismissing out of hand the notion of selling CBS. “This is a good time to sell a network,” said one Wall Street exec. “Retransmission makes it look more interesting. [CBS] has assets in radio but no long-term strategy in cable.” Retransmission refers to fees for “retransmission consent,” in which cable and satellite operators pay a network a monthly per-subscriber fee to carry the channel on their systems…. Meanwhile, ABC’s future in the Mouse House is also not guaranteed, with Disney chief Bob Iger said to be taking a hard look at the network. “There are no guarantees,” Mr. Iger told The Post recently, referring to ABC’s future at Disney. The paper reported a source said that the issue was what would be done with the network’s accompanying stations.

The brothers founded Miramax 31 years ago, naming it after their parents, Miriam and Max, but were forced to leave it behind in 2005. The relationship between seller and buyer, however, suddenly grew stormy late Friday. Two people with direct knowledge of the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, insisted that the proposed deal had collapsed entirely. But Harvey Weinstein and their primary backer in the deal, the investor Ronald W. Burkle, claimed the exact opposite. “The Weinstein brothers, the Weinstein Company and Ron Burkle are all working towards a deal to purchase and operate Mirmax,” a joint statement from Harvey Weinstein and Mr. Burkle read. “The parties continue to work diligently towards an agreement.” A Disney spokeswoman declined to comment. Negotiations, which have been going on for over a month and until recent days were considered close to resolution, did not bog down over price, according to the people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Weinsteins had been offering about $625 million, backed by the Yucaipa Companies, which is controlled by Mr. Burkle. Colbeck Capital Management and the Fortress Investment Group were to provide additional backing. Instead, the snag involved complications regarding how Miramax would fit with the brothers’ new venture, the Weinstein Company, which has struggled to find its way in a shrinking market for independent film. The brothers appeared to want to align the two companies — but not merge them — while managing the Miramax library and using its cachet to bolster their own position as film producers and distributors. Disney is now expected to try to restart talks with other bidders. Before Disney awarded the Weinsteins an exclusive negotiating window last month, an all-cash offer for about $550 million was pending from the brothers Tom, Alec and Sam Gores, who are independent investors and control the Paradigm Talent Agency. A spokesman for the Gores declined to comment. One reason the Gores brothers initially lost out to the Weinstein group involved sequel rights. Industry insiders have privately estimated that any buyer of Miramax will ultimately need as much as $300 million above the sale price to revive the studio. Miramax delivers several hundred million in annual revenue from its 700-title library, but no longer has any employees after the integration with Walt Disney Studios last fall. The difficulty Disney has encountered in selling Miramax comes as investors all over Hollywood chew over a difficult question: just how much are movie libraries worth? Hotly pursued during the DVD boom, libraries are now significantly less valuable as the economic downturn and shifting consumer tastes have sent disc sales plummeting.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/business/media/13penguin.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Club Penguin Misses Goals, Giving Disney a Half-Price Deal<date>Published: May 12, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELES — Club Penguin, the subscription-based online community acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2007, has failed to meet profit targets that were tied to $350 million in payouts to the Web site’s creators.Disney’s purchase of Club Penguin was valued at $700 million, with half of the total paid up front and half coming in two payments based on unspecified growth thresholds. Disney disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last May that Club Penguin had missed the first target. On Wednesday, the company confirmed that the Web site did not meet the second one. The upshot is that a smartly structured deal prevented Disney from overpaying for a high-flying Web business that became tangled in the economic downturn. The question now is whether the site can regain its momentum as consumer spending loosens up, and by how much the targets were missed. Club Penguin, where members pay $5.95 a month to dress penguin characters and play games, is stumbling — at least on the surface. The site attracted about six million unique visitors in April, a 10 percent decline from the same month a year earlier, according to the marketing research firm comScore. In March, it suffered a 7 percent drop, to about 6.7 million. But Disney says those numbers are incorrect, citing internal estimates that show a 20 percent year-on-year increase in unique visitors. Moreover, Disney argues that traffic does not matter because it sells no advertising on the site. What does count are paying subscribers, the number of which has continued to grow quickly, according to Lane Merrifield, a co-founder of Club Penguin who is now partly responsible for strategy and operations at Disney’s online division. Mr. Merrifield would not release subscriber numbers to back up that assertion. Disney said in its second fiscal quarter earnings report on Tuesday, however, that “higher Club Penguin subscription revenues” helped its Interactive Media unit to narrow its loss to $55 million, from $61 million in the year-earlier quarter. At the time of purchase, Club Penguin had about 700,000 subscribers. As for the profit thresholds, Mr. Merrifield also declined to disclose specifics. “We set some big goals and had we met them it would have been great,” he said. “The good news is that we’re not far off.” The important thing, he said, is that Club Penguin has continued to stay focused on quality. “We knew from the beginning that we may never see that back half,” he said. Part of the reason Club Penguin did not meet its profit targets, Mr. Merrifield said, involves faster-than-anticipated expansion overseas. The site now counts customers in 190 countries and is available in four languages with two more on the way. “We wanted to reinvest faster than we thought” in new markets, Mr. Merrifield said. The economic downturn figured prominently in the Web site’s inability to meet its aggressive growth projections. But the fickle nature of children’s entertainment, an oversaturation of virtual worlds aimed at youths and competition from new smartphone games have also contributed, analysts say. Some Disney executives have grumbled about the aggressive manner in which Club Penguin’s founders have controlled the brand when it comes to television and consumer products tie-ins. The urgency to exploit Club Penguin across business units has also faded a bit inside Disney as managers have turned their focus to the new brand in the company cupboard: Marvel. Mr. Merrifield noted that a Club Penguin video game had been a big seller for Nintendo and another was on the way, along with more toys. Club Penguin is still by far the leading online world for children, and other sites have experienced much deeper declines in unique visitors. Webkinz.com, where children care for stuffed animals that come to life, registered about 3.8 million unique visitors in April, a 50 percent drop from a year ago. Neopets.com, owned by Viacom, suffered a 39 percent decline, to about 1.5 million. Disney operates a flotilla of online worlds along with Club Penguin. Some, like PixieHollow.com, have found an audience with young girls, but others — particularly one dedicated to “Pirates of the Caribbean” — have suffered from technology bugs. The company is currently testing a long-delayed new offering, World of Cars, which is planned for a summer introduction.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9407E5DA143AF930A25756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney Sells A Franchise That Mothers Didn't Like<date>Published: May 13, 2010</date><text>The media investor Haim Saban said on Wednesday that he had bought back the rights to his biggest franchise, ''Power Rangers,'' from the Walt Disney Company and had licensed the show to Nickelodeon, the children's cable channel owned by Viacom. Executives at Saban and Viacom said in interviews that they intended to reinvigorate the nearly 20-year-old franchise, a one-time sensation among children that features costumed teenagers saving the world. ''Power Rangers'' is the first acquisition by Mr. Saban's new brands and licensing division. Mr. Saban, who made most of his fortune in children's entertainment and now owns a big stake in Univision, announced last week that his Saban Capital Group would invest $500 million in Saban Brands, a new company dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands and exploiting them through retail, television and film channels. ''The list is very, very long for things we're going to do'' with the franchise, Mr. Saban said. ''Power Rangers'' was most prominent in the mid-1990s, when it was shown on Fox, but it has remained in production ever since, and an 18th season is in development now. That season will have its debut on Nickelodeon in the first quarter of 2011, the channel said. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the multiyear deal. The franchise came to Disney in 2001 as part of the purchase from Saban and Fox of what is now the ABC Family cable channel. At first, Disney had high hopes for the characters, exploring additional licensing and even a feature film. But focus group research soured Disney on them. Mothers, the research showed, disliked the violence -- particularly the hand-to-hand combat -- that is part of the franchise's DNA. Ultimately, Disney decided not to brand the Power Rangers characters as Disney products, which made the franchise something of a black sheep at the company. Mr. Saban said he felt that Disney ''did not develop the property and exploit it in the way that it deserves.'' Disney had been quietly shopping the franchise for more than a year, with efforts heating up after the acquisition of Marvel in August. Now flush with boy-centric characters, Disney's interest in the Power Rangers faded even further. Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's president, said the violence was a ''nonissue,'' calling the show ''more martial artsy and campy than anything else.'' Elie Dekel, who is leading the Saban Brands effort, said he would seek to restore ''Power Rangers'' to pop culture ubiquity. The company, which would not divulge any potential acquisitions, will have to move fast as other companies aggressively mine the branding and licensing turf. The Iconix Brand Group, for instance, is a force in this arena, recently snapping up the Peanuts franchise from E. W. Scripps for about $175 million in cash. Noting that one of Nickelodeon's digital channels, Nicktoons, would be broadcasting reruns of ''Power Rangers'' -- there are 700 episodes in the program's library -- Mr. Dekel said that ''for much of the audience, they will be brand new.''</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/disney-plans-joint-venture-channels-in-south-korea/?ref=disneywaltcompany">Disney, in a Joint Venture, Plans TV Channels for South Korea<date>May 12, 2010, 3:26 am</date><text>The Walt Disney Company says it plans to introduce two Korean-language Disney channels in South Korea in a joint venture with SK Telecom, The Associated Press reported.

The release of “Alice in Wonderland” on March 5 was the primary reason for the rebound. In contrast, Disney’s normally high-flying TV operation had flat income of $1.3 billion on a 6 percent increase in revenue. The company’s cable channels, including ESPN, surged as usual with higher advertising revenue and subscriber fees offsetting increased costs. But ABC, where income decreased by 24 percent primarily because of drooping prime-time ratings, weighed sharply on results. Growth at Disney’s television operation is normally robust, with income in the first quarter increasing by 11 percent over the previous year and the fourth quarter recording a 26 percent uptick. ABC will unveil new programs to advertisers on Tuesday in New York, and Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive, told analysts in a conference call that he remained hopeful that a turnaround was on the horizon. “I’m confident in the team’s long-term track record,” he said, referring to ABC management. Mr. Iger added that he expected upfront ad sales for the fall season to be “very good.” He also said the network had recently completed a series of cost cuts in its news division. For the three months ended April 3, Disney had net income of $953 million, or 48 cents a share, a 55 percent rise from $613 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $8.6 billion. The results beat analyst forecasts. Disney’s consumer products division, where income soared 37 percent to $133 million, contributed to the strong overall results. The company said sales of “Toy Story” merchandise has been strong and Marvel, which Disney acquired in August for $4.3 billion, chipped in healthy publishing sales. But the movie studio was the primary driver. “Alice in Wonderland” had $960 million in global ticket sales. During the quarter Disney also released “The Last Song,” an inexpensive Miley Cyrus vehicle that sold about $72 million in tickets worldwide. Aggressive cost cutting also buoyed the studio’s results. Because movie operations work far in advance, Disney is now reaping rewards from pictures that were put into production by a management team that was jettisoned in the fall, after a fallow stretch at the box office. Disney’s new movie managers, however, deserve credit for the effective marketing and completion of these films. But it will not be clear for at least six months whether a true turnaround is at hand at the studio. The financial health of Disney’s theme park division, closely watched as a barometer of consumer confidence, worsened slightly. The unit reported a 12 percent decline in income to $150 million. Revenue inched up 2 percent. The drop was partly because of higher fuel costs and promotions at Disney Cruise Line. Also contributing were increased labor costs and a 6 percent decrease in attendance at Walt Disney World in Florida. James A. Rasulo, Disney’s chief financial officer, said the attendance decline was caused partly by a decision to ease off deep discounting — something that had kept the parks full of visitors during the economic downturn but had also hurt margins. “Consumers are still out there waiting for bargains,” Mr. Rasulo said in the conference call. But he added that “we are determined and confident we can take our pricing back to normalized levels.”</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/10/business/media/10miley.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Sharp Turn for Miley Cyrus and Disney<date>Published: May 10, 2010</date><text>When Miley Cyrus, 17, released her new music video last week, chatter about her attire (fetish gear), suggestive dance moves (writhing on her back) and setting (inside a black bird cage) spread like wildfire.Some fans were you-go-girl positive. But the majority of people seemed shocked to see Ms. Cyrus — who will appear as the wholesome title character in “Hannah Montana” on the Disney Channel for another year — taking a naughty page from Lady Gaga. “I don’t want to explain to my kids why Hannah Montana has no pants on in her latest video,” said a post on the blog MomLogic.com. Whether a 17-year-old should be using sex to sell CDs can be debated, and it is too early to tell whether the brand has sustained any lasting damage. (Previous scandals involving Ms. Cyrus have not dented ratings.) The real surprise might be that the Walt Disney Company helped it happen. Hollywood Records, Ms. Cyrus’s label, is owned by Disney. Although she personally paid most of the video’s cost, the label at the least oversaw its creation and distributed it. It’s not uncommon for divisions of media conglomerates to work against one another — except at Disney, which aggressively extols its companywide synergy to investors. So, given Disney’s strict franchise management, how could one division participate in the creation and distribution of a product that could imperil one of the company’s most valuable properties? Disney declined to comment beyond a statement: “Miley, at 17, is now making creative choices as a solo recording artist that reflects her own personal style and vision. Miley was 12 years old when she began portraying the fictional character of Hannah Montana who continues to be beloved by millions of Disney Channel fans.” BROOKS BARNES</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/09/realestate/09roth.html?ref=disneywaltcompany">Fit for a Queen of Hearts<date>Published: May 4, 2010</date><text>DOWN the rabbit hole with you, Alice!In your new world you’ll find grinning cats, a nasty queen ... and $20 million apartments? That last thing is available in Manhattan. The longtime moviemaker Joe Roth, a producer on Tim Burton’s “Alice in Wonderland,” has found a buyer for his penthouse apartment at 151 East 58th Street. The condominium has just gone into contract with an unidentified buyer after three and a half months on the market. The contract price was not available, but the asking price was $21.7 million. The apartment at One Beacon Court has floor-to-ceiling windows and views to the north, south and east. It also has four bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, 13-foot ceilings and 3,779 square feet of space. Mr. Roth bought the apartment in late 2005 for $13 million. He has worn many hats in the film industry, including producer and director. He ran two major studios, 20th Century Fox and Walt Disney Studios, and founded a production company called Revolution Studios. Over the years, his projects have ranged from “Young Guns” to “Black Hawk Down,” to dabbling in professional soccer — as an owner. The apartment is listed with Deborah Grubman, who represented Mr. Roth in his purchase five years ago, and her colleague at the Corcoran Group, Carol Cohen.
