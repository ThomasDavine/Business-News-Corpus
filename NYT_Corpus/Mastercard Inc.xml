THEY come for his money. They come for his advice. They come — duh — for his connections. But mostly they come, with all the élan of Dorothy on her way to Oz, for a chance at some face time with Reid G. Hoffman, the start-up whisperer of Silicon Valley. Mr. Hoffman made his name and fortune as the co-founder of LinkedIn, the social network that went public five months ago. But he has also emerged as something else — — as the man whom Internet entrepreneurs call when they dream of becoming the next, well, Reid Hoffman. Want to brainstorm about new technology? Build a business? Raise a cool million — or billion? Mr. Hoffman is a man to see. If he can’t help, he probably knows someone who can. He is, as you might expect, a seriously linked-in guy. On this particular day in July, a rising entrepreneur named Brian Chesky has come calling. Mr. Chesky, the co-founder of Airbnb, an online service that matches people looking for vacation rentals with those with rooms to rent, wants some pointers about expanding into China. Mr. Hoffman, 44, leans back in his chair. Then he lets fly: Airbnb will need a team in China, a robust Chinese-language platform, Web filters to keep Beijing happy, he says. It might also need a joint venture partner. He rattles off a few names. It’s noon, and this is the third of nine meetings that Mr. Hoffman has scheduled today. He is trying not to sneak a peek at his smartphone — or, rather, his four smartphones. He fields upward of 400 e-mails a day, not counting all the stuff that streams in via Facebook, Twitter and, naturally, LinkedIn, where he had 2,536 connections at last count. These days, Mr. Hoffman finds himself, a bit to his own surprise, at the center of the social media universe. He has a second full-time job as a partner at Greylock, the venture capital firm. He serves on the boards of eight companies, including Zynga, the hottest game company on the Web, and Mozilla, of Firefox fame. He is also involved in three nonprofits. Oh, and there’s that little company called LinkedIn, which, as of Friday, was worth about $7.9 billion in the stock market. Amid all the meetings and messages and tweets, Mr. Hoffman, the executive chairman, must persuade Wall Street that LinkedIn will prosper and that its lofty valuation is not just another sign of Internet mania. For the moment, Mr. Hoffman seems to give off a golden aura, at least to many in Silicon Valley. Everyone wants a piece of him. “He’s the first stop for every hot deal,” says David Siminoff, a technology investor. Gina Bianchini, the founder of the Internet start-ups Ning and Mightybell, says: “He’s like an early warning system for something great in Silicon Valley.” Cyriac Roeding, the founder of Shopkick, a mobile shopping app that has been bankrolled by Greylock, adds: “I’ve never made a significant move, decision, without consulting him.” Hearing Mr. Hoffman wax philosophical about technology, it’s easy to understand why so many here seem to view him as something of a yoda. When he talks about “scale” — Internet-speak for having enough people use a network to make the network actually useful — he often invokes Archimedes, the great mathematician and inventor in ancient Greece. According to lore, Archimedes created a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade to pump water against gravity: the Archimedes screw. Mr. Hoffman urges his followers to find their own levers and devices to encourage people to adopt their technologies. Entrepreneurs, he says, often spend too much time creating products and too little figuring out how to get people to use them. Archimedes is reputed to have said that, given a lever big enough and a place to stand, he could move the world. “It’s not really quite true, once you understand Newtonian physics, but it is an accurate metaphor,” Mr. Hoffman says.  “Build a compact piece of work with the right leverage, and you can solve a very big problem.” LONG before LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman was just another kid in California obsessed with playing games. He grew up in Berkeley, bright and precocious, despite B’s and C’s in middle school. His father, William Hoffman, a real estate lawyer, recalls that his son always showed remarkable focus. When Reid was 5, for instance, his father read to him from “The Lord of the Rings” before bed. “Apparently, I wasn’t reading fast enough,” William Hoffman recalls. “Whenever I picked up the book, the bookmark moved further and further ahead.” 1 2 3 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: November 6, 2011 An earlier version of this article misstated the country where Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, went on vacation in August. He visited Austria, not Australia.</text></article>

In the United States, use of MasterCard-branded debit cards rose 23 percent, compared with just 7 percent for credit cards. By comparison, Visa, which has a bigger share of the domestic debit card market, said last week that debit purchase volume rose about 8 percent. The debit card side of the card industry is experiencing a shake-up. New federal regulations limit the fees that banks and payment processors like MasterCard and Visa can charge retailers for handling debit card purchases, setting a cap of about 24 cents a transaction, versus the previously unregulated average of about 44 cents. And merchants will be allowed to choose which network processes their transactions. That choice was previously made by the merchant’s bank. The rules started on Oct. 1. MasterCard reported net income of $717 million, or $5.63 a share, up from $518 million, or $3.94 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 27 percent, to $1.82 billion from 1.43 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast profit for MasterCard of $4.81 a share on revenue of $1.7 billion, according to data provided by FactSet. The results outpaced the performance of Visa, which had a rare miss on revenue forecasts last week. MasterCard shares rose $23.36, or 7.3 percent, to $357.66 on heavy volume. The company said third-quarter purchase volume, the amount spent on debit and credit cards, rose 17 percent worldwide to $628 billion. In the United States spending was up 13 percent to $227 billion. That included a 7 percent gain in credit card spending to $130 billion, and a 23 percent spike in debit spending to $97 billion. The number of open credit card accounts rose 2 percent to 147 million, while the number of debit accounts rose 11 percent to 126 million.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/world/europe/wikileaks-founder-faces-extradition-hearing-in-london.html?ref=mastercardinc">Assange, WikiLeaks Founder, May Be Extradited, Judges Rule<date>Published: November 2, 2011</date><text>LONDON — A British court ruled Wednesday that Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, can be extradited to Sweden for questioning over allegations of sexual abuse made against him by two women there last year. He will seek a final appeal at Britain’s highest court, according to a person close to him.Two of Britain’s most senior judges dismissed all four arguments raised by Mr. Assange’s defense team. The decision makes it increasingly likely that Mr. Assange will face his accusers in Sweden. He has at least 14 days to ask for permission to bring his case before Britain’s highest court, the Supreme Court, for a final appeal. The court hears only cases of constitutional or general public importance. The 43-page ruling was the latest twist in an 11-month legal battle that has included multiple court appearances and brought out throngs of supporters, and it comes as WikiLeaks has been temporarily shuttered because of continuing financing troubles. Mr. Assange was briefly jailed last December, as Swedish authorities filed an arrest warrant demanding he return to face accusations made by two WikiLeaks volunteers in Stockholm in August 2010. He is accused of two counts of sexual molestation, one count of unlawful coercion and one count of rape based on their allegations that consensual sex became nonconsensual. He vehemently denies the allegations and has engaged a series of high-profile lawyers to fight the extradition warrant, arguing, among other things, that he could not get a fair trial. Mr. Assange has given interviews condemning Sweden’s strict sexual crimes laws, calling the country “the Saudi Arabia of feminism.” Wednesday’s ruling marks the second time a British court has rejected his appeals. After the ruling Mr. Assange and a coterie of advisers and friends huddled in the courthouse to discuss their options, flanked by security guards. “We will consider our next steps in the coming days,” he said in a brief statement to the throng of reporters gathered outside. But a person close to Mr. Assange said he would appear in court again to seek permission to appeal. If the court does not allow him to move his case forward, Mr. Assange will be extradited to Sweden within 10 days of the court’s decision. Mr. Assange appeared for an initial interview with the police in Sweden in 2010, but flew to London before further questioning could be completed, a court here was subsequently told. He has told friends that he has refused to return to Stockholm to face questioning because he fears that the country is run by a cabal of interconnected people who are aligned against him. Mr. Assange’s lawyers have also argued that if he were extradited from Sweden to the United States, he could face the death penalty over the leaking of classified American documents, citing comments by conservative politicians, including the former governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, who said he should be hunted down as an anti-American operative. In addition, Mr. Assange has hinted that he believes world powers might be behind the sexual abuse charges, seeing them as a way of silencing him and halting embarrassing leaks. The WikiLeaks release of hundreds of thousands of United States military documents on the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and State Department diplomatic cables dominated the front pages of newspapers across the world last year. Mr. Assange has hoped that releases of such documents would reshape the very nature of government. WikiLeaks cables in which American diplomats reported on the corruption of Tunisia’s rulers did, in fact, help fuel the uprising that overthrew Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, jumpstarting the Arab Spring. WikiLeaks has foundered since Mr. Assange was briefly jailed last December, before being placed under virtual house arrest at the country mansion of a wealthy friend in eastern England. Mr. Assange told a press conference in London last month that WikiLeaks would cease its publishing activities because it lacked money following a blockade on donations by credit card companies like Visa and MasterCard, and the payments services Western Union and PayPal. The organization has also been severely weakened by a spate of defections from its core of computer-programmer volunteers, insiders have said. Many, tired of what they described as Mr. Assange’s imperiousness, have formed their own document-leaking sites.</text></article>

They told MF Global it needed to raise more capital, and they asked about risky transactions involving European debt. Yet its chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, resisted, lobbying to persuade regulators that the firm did not need to raise capital, according to people briefed on the discussions. MF Global did improve its capital position, but it was not enough to save the firm. The details that have emerged about MF Global’s final 72 hours, drawn from dozens of interviews with people who participated in the weekend discussions or were directly briefed by people who did, illustrate that three years after the financial crisis, Wall Street executives are still fighting regulators’ demands.

That was approximately 11.6 percent of the minimum collateral requirement for MF Global.

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/world/europe/blocks-on-wikileaks-donations-may-force-its-end-julian-assange-warns.html?ref=mastercardinc">Julian Assange Says WikiLeaks May Be Forced to Close<date>Published: October 24, 2011</date><text>LONDON — Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, said on Monday that his Web site could be forced to shut down by the end of the year because a 10-month-old “financial blockade” had sharply reduced the donations on which it depends.Calling the blockade a “dangerous, oppressive and undemocratic” attack led by the United States, Mr. Assange said at a news conference here that it had deprived his organization of “tens of millions of dollars,” and warned, “If WikiLeaks does not find a way to remove this blockade, we will not be able to continue by the turn of the new year.” Since the end of 2010, financial intermediaries, including Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union, have refused to allow donations to WikiLeaks to flow through their systems, he said, blocking “95 percent” of the Web site’s revenue and leaving it to operate on its cash reserves for the past 10 months. An aide said that WikiLeaks was now receiving less than $10,000 a month in donations. Mr. Assange said WikiLeaks had been forced to halt work on the processing of tens of thousands of secret documents that it had received, and to turn its attention instead to lawsuits it had filed in the United States, Australia, Scandinavian countries and elsewhere, as well as to a formal petition to the European Commission to try to restore donors’ ability to send it money through normal channels. WikiLeaks receives and publishes confidential documents from whistle-blowers and leakers, who are eager to see the site continue with the publishing sensations that drew worldwide attention last year. WikiLeaks released and passed to news organizations huge quantities of secret United States military and diplomatic cables on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and other subjects. Among the organizations the group worked with were The New York Times; Der Spiegel, a German newsmagazine; and The Guardian, a British newspaper. Mr. Assange held the news conference while on a brief break from his effective house arrest on a country estate 100 miles outside London. Limits on his movements are part of the bail conditions imposed on him last year while British courts decide whether to extradite him to Sweden. The authorities there want him to answer questions related to accusations that he sexually abused two women during a visit to Stockholm in the summer of 2010. A British appeals court ruling on the extradition, pending for months, is expected at any time. At the news conference on Monday, Mr. Assange said he and WikiLeaks were victims of a “conspiracy to smear and destroy” them, led by the United States Treasury, American intelligence agencies and “right-wing” forces in the United States, including powerful corporations led by Bank of America and Visa. He said the attack had also included “high-level calls” to assassinate him and other WikiLeaks associates, but offered no specifics to support the allegation. The finances of WikiLeaks, and of Mr. Assange personally, have been part of the controversy that has swirled around the organization for the past year. Internal disputes have prompted several of Mr. Assange’s closest associates to quit the organization, and one of the issues they have raised concerns the tight, even secretive, control he maintained over its money. This year, the Wau Holland Foundation, an organization that has operated as a channel for WikiLeaks donations and as a keeper of the organization’s books, issued a report saying that WikiLeaks raised $1.8 million in 2010, and spent slightly more than $550,000, leaving an apparent surplus of about $1.3 million at the start of 2011. A representative of Wau Holland who appeared with Mr. Assange on Monday at the Frontline Club in London said that its work for WikiLeaks had also been halted by the American financial measures. Asked in an e-mail after the news conference for details of WikiLeaks’ current financial status, Wau Holland said it would respond by the end of the week. A signal that WikiLeaks was in increasing financial distress came last month when a collection of memorabilia associated with Mr. Assange was put up for sale to raise money for WikiLeaks. The items included a sachet of prison coffee he said he had smuggled out of the Wandsworth jail, where he was briefly held last year before bail was set in the extradition case, and an “exclusive” photograph of Mr. Assange at Ellingham Hall in eastern England, where he has lived since then. One standout item in the sale was a laptop computer said to have been used in the preparation of the secret American government cables that WikiLeaks released; it was posted at a “buy it now” price of more than $550,000, with the highest early bid coming in at $6,000, according to a BBC report at the time. In a Twitter posting, WikiLeaks vaunted the attractions of the laptop, telling potential buyers, “In this exclusive auction item, you will get the full set of WikiLeaks cables, the WikiLeaks computer and its passwords.” Mr. Assange responded brusquely on Monday when a reporter asked whether donations to WikiLeaks had been used to finance his extradition battle, with legal bills running into hundreds of thousands of dollars. A posting on the WikiLeaks Web site invites donations to the WikiLeaks and Julian Assange Defense Fund, but Mr. Assange said that no money intended for WikiLeaks had been used for his legal defense. Last month, Canongate Books, based in Edinburgh, published a 340-page biography of Mr. Assange based on 50 hours of interviews he gave to a writer, Andrew O’Hagan, that were initially intended to yield a memoir. Mr. Assange later repudiated his book contract and, according to newspaper reports, refused to return a $650,000 advance; sales of the book have been sluggish.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/opinion/sunday/lets-admit-it-globalization-has-losers.html?ref=mastercardinc">Let’s Admit It: Globalization Has Losers<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>Steven Rattner is a contributing writer to Op-Ed and a former counselor to the secretary of the Treasury and lead auto adviser. He has spent nearly 30 years on Wall Street. FOR the typical American, the past decade has been economically brutal: the first time since the 1930s, according to some calculations, that inflation-adjusted incomes declined. By 2010, real median household income had fallen to $49,445, compared with $53,164 in 2000. While there are many culprits, from declining unionization to the changing mix of needed skills, globalization has had the greatest impact. Yes, globalization. The phenomenon that free traders like me adore has created a nation of winners (think of those low-priced imported goods) but also many losers. Nowhere have these pressures been more intense than in the manufacturing sector, which I saw firsthand as head of President Obama’s Auto Task Force. A typical General Motors worker costs the company about $56 per hour, which includes benefits. In Mexico, a worker costs the company $7 per hour; in China, $4.50 an hour, and in India, $1 per hour. While G.M. doesn’t (yet) achieve United States-level productivity in China and India, its Mexican plants are today at least as efficient as those in the United States. G.M. has responded with inarguable logic. While reducing its United States hourly work force to 50,000 from 89,000 over the past five years, its Mexican hourly head count has risen, to 9,235 from 9,073. Pressed by high unemployment and eager to keep jobs in this country, the United Auto Workers agreed that companies could cut their costs by hiring some workers at $14 an hour, with lower benefits. Most recently, Volkswagen arrived in Chattanooga, Tenn., with 2,000 much-welcomed jobs — but all with starting pay of $14.50 per hour. At this pay rate, although some workers will quickly exceed it at that plant, yearly income would be $30,000 per year, hardly the American dream of great middle-class jobs. In these troubled times, any jobs are surely welcome. But we need to reverse the decline in incomes, and this requires a more thoughtful approach than the pervasive, politically attractive happy talk nostalgically centered on restoring lost manufacturing jobs. So let’s start by acknowledging that just as occurred decades ago with agriculture, the declining role in our economy of manufacturing, which over the last half-century is down from 32 percent of the work force to 9 percent, will continue. Let’s also recognize that retreating into protectionism would turn a win-lose into a lose-lose. And even if organized labor could force wage rates back up, that would hardly help domestic manufacturing compete against lower-cost imports. Instead, we should follow the example of successful high-wage exporters in concentrating on products where we have an advantage, as Germany has done with products like sophisticated machine tools. While America still leads in sectors like defense and aviation, our greatest strength, and a source of high-paying jobs, lies in service industries with high intellectual content, like education, entertainment, digital media, and yes, even financial services. Facebook, Google and Microsoft are all American creations, as are the global credit card companies American Express, Visa and MasterCard. Achieving higher wages also requires a greater commitment to education; wages for those with college degrees rose 1.4 percent between 2000 and 2010, after inflation. Following the German model of greater emphasis on engineering and technical training would also be advantageous. Finally comes the tricky question of what role government should play. The prospect of Washington lurching into the private sector is terrifying, as illustrated by the debacle of Solyndra, the solar energy company that failed with $535 million of taxpayer loans. While countries like China have put large resources behind industries they want to nurture, we should resist the temptation to plunge deeply into industrial policy. Particularly in its current dysfunctional condition, Washington is ill-equipped to pick winners and should concentrate its capital on infrastructure and other public investments that the private sector won’t make. To assist the private sector, particularly young companies, which are the biggest source of new hiring, tax incentives could be used to foster the creation of well-paying jobs. In addition, the Kauffman Foundation, which focuses on entrepreneurship, has identified other possible solutions, including providing visas to entrepreneurs, easing access to public financing markets and reform of the patent and regulatory apparatus. Sadly, Congress shows little sign of addressing all of this. With global competition and its pressure on American wages intensifying, American workers deserve a more focused approach from Washington.</text></article>

Card Fees<date>October 13, 2011, 4:40 pm</date><text>Getty Images The latest skirmish over card fees is about the fees charged at independently operated A.T.M.’s — those cash machines not affiliated with banks that you see in convenience stores, hotel lobbies and airports. The National ATM Council Inc., an industry group, and about a dozen individual firms filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against Visa and MasterCard, accusing the payment networks of fixing prices by forcing the independent operators to charge consumers set fees. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, seeks class-action status and sheds light on the often-arcane payment arrangements underlying the country’s A.T.M. networks. The suit contends that Visa and MasterCard prevent nonbank A.T.M. operators from charging users discounted access fees, even when consumers use cards that can use alternative, cheaper payment networks. Visa and MasterCard both declined to comment on the suit. While MasterCard and Visa are the biggest networks, there are also less well-known networks, like Star and Shazam, that process debit transactions. A.T.M. operators, the suit says, may charge cardholders an access fee — but only if the same fee is charged, whether the machine performs a Visa or MasterCard transaction or uses another debit network. So even though the Visa and MasterCard networks can be more costly for operators to use, the rules bar an operator from offering consumers a lower fee for A.T.M. transactions not completed over Visa or MasterCard’s networks, said Jonathan Rubin, the lawyer for the operators. “By restricting their ability to attract customers to lower-cost A.T.M. services through lower prices, the A.T.M. restraints put a competitive straitjacket on A.T.M. operators,” the suit says. The practice, the suit says, artificially raises the price that consumers pay for A.T.M. services and limits the revenue that A.T.M. operators can earn. If operators could put a sign on their cash machines, for instance, saying the fee is $2 for Visa or MasterCard, but $1 for cards using other networks, the machines could charge lower fees, Mr. Rubin said. The operators, he added, would make more money because more people would use their machines. “We’re looking for more machines and more competition,” Mr. Rubin said. There are about 400,000 A.T.M.’s in the United States, and about half are run by nonbank operators, he said. Do you think consumers would benefit from more competition among payment networks?</text></article>

Yet since the start of 2008, large-capitalization stocks have lagged riskier small-company shares, belying their reputation as ports in an economic storm.That changed a bit in the third quarter — relatively speaking. While mutual funds that invest in blue-chip stocks suffered major losses in the late summer, they fell considerably less than small-cap portfolios. The average fund that invests in large-cap growth stocks fell 15.6 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, versus the average 22.1 percent loss suffered by small-cap growth funds. The bigger the stocks, the less painful the performance during the last quarter. Traditionally, stocks of companies with a market value of around $10 billion are considered large caps. But large-cap funds with average holdings of at least $25 billion held up slightly better — losing 14.7 percent in the quarter, according to the fund tracker Morningstar. “In the latter half of last year and the first half of this year, ‘the riskier the better’ was the mantra,” said Bradley P. Hinton, co-manager of the Weitz Partners Value fund. “But in the last quarter, you’ve seen smaller companies sell off stronger, which is more what you’d expect in periods of uncertainty.” What changed? Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at Standard &amp; Poor’s Capital IQ, said the relative outperformance of large caps could reflect the nature of this sell-off, which appears to be focused on the weakening global economy, he said. Blue-chip stocks tend to hold up better than the rest of the market in such conditions. By contrast, he said: “The last two mega-meltdowns have not really been economically driven. The 2000-2 bear was the popping of the tech bubble, which directly affected large-cap tech stocks. And 2008 was triggered by the meltdown in large-cap financials.” Timothy Mulrenan, co-manager of the Pioneer Fundamental Growth fund, which finished in the top 5 percent of all large-cap growth funds in the third quarter, cited a couple of other factors. For starters, the economic recovery that began in June 2009 has matured to the point where corporate profit growth has peaked and is now slowing. “Once you move past peak growth rates, then sentiment does shift,” Mr. Mulrenan said. Investors are showing a preference for larger companies with a proven record of thriving in tough economic times or that stand to benefit from faster-growing markets outside the United States, he said. “This economic environment,” he said, “certainly hasn’t hurt the earnings of a company like Apple at all,” referring to one of the stocks in the fund. Nor has it damaged the long-term prospects of a company like MasterCard, another fund holding, he said. It assumes no credit risk on transactions and is therefore somewhat insulated from a weak economy, he said. And while the economy could slow MasterCard’s growth, the company generates around 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. MR. MULRENAN added that another reason for the relative attractiveness of large stocks is their relatively favorable valuations. Donald A. Yacktman, manager of of the Yacktman Fund, makes a similar argument. Mr. Yacktman, whose portfolio finished among the top 4 percent of all large-cap value funds in the third quarter, favors dominant companies with predictable cash flows and strong balance sheets — companies like the News Corporation., PepsiCo, Microsoft and Procter &amp; Gamble, he said. “On a relative basis, I don’t think I can think of another period of time where so many of these companies were selling at such cheap prices relative to other companies or to U.S. Treasuries,” he said. Many large caps are also paying dividends that now exceed the yields of long-term Treasury bonds, offering investors more of a cushion in a volatile market, said William C. Nygren, manager of the Oakmark Fund, which fared better than more than 80 percent of its large-cap peers for the first nine months of the year. “There’s an amazing list of large-cap names where you can get over a 3 percent dividend yield and price-earnings ratios in the single digits,” Mr. Nygren said. Examples in his portfolio, he said, include companies like Microsoft, which yields more than 3 percent and trades at nine times next year’s estimated earnings per share, and Merck, which yields nearly 5 percent and trades at eight times next year’s estimated earnings. Still, this doesn’t mean that all large-cap stocks will offer investors protection if the economy worsens. That’s why Thomas H. Forester, chief investment officer for the Forester Value fund, has been raising cash in his portfolio and making subtle shifts. “We try to over- and under-weight companies within a sector based on the environment we’re in,” he said. For example, the prospects for falling oil prices because of the slowing global economy and problems in Europe could hurt oil drillers. Instead of fleeing energy altogether, Mr. Forester said, he recently sold his position in Marathon Oil and has shifted a good deal of that money into Exxon Mobil, a more diversified energy company with strong cost controls. It’s important even for large-cap investors to take precautions. “It’s like when you’re driving,” he said. “When you go around a curve, you slow down, and when you straighten out you speed up. Well, it sure feels like we’re in the curves when it comes to this economy.” Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com.</text></article>

His response? He ranted and raved and suggested that consumers “get the heck out of that bank.” But even as Bank of America and other institutions are adding fees and other restrictions, a company called PerkStreet, which you may have read about in this column before, is hoping that those Bank of America customers will run to its Web site. PerkStreet gives checking account customers as much as 2 percent back on their purchases when they use its debit cards. Meanwhile, a company called BancVue works with community banks and credit unions to offer checking accounts that can yield more than 3 percent in interest on deposits for people who use their debit cards a lot. Soon, the company asserts, the total number of branches among all of the institutions that offer its rewards checking accounts will equal that of the 10th-largest bank in America. So the big banks make you pay, and the most aggressive of the little institutions want to pay you. What on earth is going on here, and can this possibly continue? First, let’s be clear about what we talk about when we talk about free checking. As Ron Shevlin, an analyst at Aite Group, explains it, you can just as easily make a case that free checking will always exist as you can that it never existed in the first place. “If I bring enough money and accounts, they are not going to charge me,” he said. “They would be crazy to.” Indeed, that is still the case with Bank of America. If you have a mortgage with the bank or $20,000 on deposit, the $5 fee will not apply. Even when nearly everyone had free checking several years ago, however, there were all sorts of questionable activities going on behind the scenes to pay for it. Overdraft fees were a big one. A.T.M. fees for using the wrong machine were also lucrative. And then there are the merchants who have generally paid far more to the banks for the privilege of accepting their debit cards than the service actually costs. Those fees helped pay for free checking, but they probably contributed to slightly higher prices in the store. The outrage over those merchant fees is what led Senator Durbin and his colleagues to limit what financial institutions with over $10 billion in assets can collect from merchants when customers use debit cards. Any checking account provider smaller than that, including PerkStreet and BancVue’s partners, can continue collecting higher fees. Because they get more fees, it helps them offer better checking account terms. Indeed, both companies are built in no small part on the backs of those merchants and the fees that they pay. PerkStreet offers a free checking account and 2 percent back on all debit card purchases (with no monthly or annual limits) to people who keep an average of $5,000 in a checking account. On days when you fall below that figure, you get 1 percent back, which is still a good deal for a debit card program. Dan O’Malley, PerkStreet’s co-founder, would not say what percentage of customers regularly earned 2 percent, though he said that the number was “meaningful.” I’d guess it’s less than half. He achieves further savings by handing out the refunds only via gift cards, most of which he obtains at a discount to face value. The catch for PerkStreet customers is that they have to sign for their purchases to get the rewards. (Recurring charges on the debit card from monthly billers earn rewards, too.) If customers punch in a PIN instead, PerkStreet usually gets less in fees from the merchants, so it generally doesn’t give customers rewards when they do that. Mr. O’Malley also would not say how many accounts the company had at the moment. As big banks have made changes in recent months, however, PerkStreet has tripled its account acquisition rate, he said. Last Friday, the day after Bank of America announced the $5 fee, the acquisition rate doubled again. On Saturday, it doubled yet again. BancVue’s checking accounts, which it encourages bank and credit union customers to call “Kasasa,” can offer high interest or rewards, depending on which platforms the partner institution wants to adopt. The banks and credit unions decide how much interest to pay, and it can top 3 percent these days. The catch is that they generally limit how much money you can deposit to earn that rate, and you have to use your debit card at least 10 or 15 times a month. Most don’t require customers to sign for purchases, though. The theory here is that once you make people use the debit card 10 or 15 times a month, they’ll put it at the top of their wallet and use it 20 or 30 times a month. So whether they sign or use a PIN, enough money rolls in from the merchants to pay for the high interest. (Some people may overdraw their accounts more often with heavy use, which also helps on the profitability front.) In reality, according to Carolyn Jordan, a senior vice president at Neighborhood Credit Union, which has branches in and around Dallas, only half of people who sign up for its Kasasa accounts will make the required number of debit transactions in any given month. If they don’t, they earn less, so that helps sustain the program. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/opinion/debit-card-fees-are-robbery.html?ref=mastercardinc">Debit Card Fees Are Robbery<date>Published: October 6, 2011</date><text>WHEN Bank of America told its customers recently that it would start charging them $5 a month to use debit cards, it argued that it was forced to make that change because of regulations that altered the economics of the cards. Other banks agreed. The chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, put the effects of the regulations this way: “If you’re a restaurant and you can’t charge for the soda, you’re going to charge more for the burger.” Both banks were responding to the Federal Reserve’s actions to limit the interchange fees banks charge stores each time a debit card is used for a purchase.But the banks’ simplistic statements are merely an attempt to rationalize and obfuscate one of the largest illegal transfers of wealth from consumers to banks in American history. Debit cards were developed by banks as a replacement for paper checks. When a consumer pays with a debit card instead of a check, the bank saves money. In the 1980s, Visa calculated the savings at 55 cents to $1.60 per check. The savings is much higher today. For decades, Bank of America, the founding owner and member of Visa (originally called BankAmericard) and all of the Visa and MasterCard banks, including Chase, hid the identity of their debit cards from stores by designing them to look and function like their signature authorized credit cards and by charging stores the same price for debit and credit transactions. Banks did this despite the fact that purchases made with a debit card didn’t involve a loan from the bank, posed very little fraud risk and were extravagantly profitable to banks because they eliminated the costs of processing and clearing checks. The practice of deceiving stores and forcing them to accept overpriced debit transactions was challenged in a 1996 antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard, in which I was the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. In 2003, that resulted in a $3.4 billion settlement to stores, a court order to redesign the debit cards and a reduction in the price banks charge stores for common debit transactions — to an average of 42 cents per transaction from an average of 63 cents. However, that lower price was still much too high, as the Federal Reserve well knew. The Fed had been established in 1913 in large measure to end the then widespread practice of banks’ charging a similar “interchange” fee for the use of paper checks. Those check interchange fees were slowing the growth of interstate commerce, and the Fed quickly prohibited them. The interchange fees that banks now charge stores for debit transactions are economically and functionally identical to the check interchange fees prohibited by the Fed almost a century ago. When A.T.M. cards were first used at stores as point-of-sale debit cards, no interchange fees were charged. In many instances debit card networks like Shazam and Tyme actually paid stores to accept debit transactions. They did this so banks, which owned the networks, could reap the huge profits of eliminating checks. But Bank of America, Chase and their Visa/MasterCard partners wanted to have their burgers and eat them, too. They instituted the illegal practices challenged and eliminated in the Visa Check antitrust litigation. Later, the Dodd-Frank Act directed the Fed to continue the process of addressing high and anticompetitive debit interchange fees by examining whether the banks could justify those fees on the basis of the costs banks incurred in processing debit card transactions. After initially deciding that debit interchange fees should be lowered from 44 cents to 7 to 12 cents, the Fed, in yet another huge handout to big banks, revised the fee range to 21 to 24 cents. That is the change in economics which Bank of America cites as it attempts to begin charging a large new fee to its debit cardholders. It’s a free country, but also one where competition is supposed to prevail and prevent companies, including banks, from simply raising the price of their burgers without suffering the competitive consequences. Recently, Netflix learned that a company can’t adopt a big price increase without suffering the consequences. When it tried to, it lost hundreds of thousands of its customers. Retail customers of Bank of America and of any other bank that follows its lead should swiftly move their business. I am certain that other banks will welcome the competitive opportunity that Bank of America has given them with its arrogant and disingenuous action and justification.

    <article index="11" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E0D71330F936A35753C1A9679D8B63&amp;ref=mastercardinc">As Economies Slow, Price Of Gas Falls<date>Published: October 5, 2011</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED HOUSTON -- The sharp slump in oil prices over the last few months is finally beginning to bring relief at the gasoline pump, with the price of a gallon of regular gasoline dropping nearly a penny a day over the last four weeks. Gasoline cost an average of $3.41 nationwide on Tuesday, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report, down from more than $4 a gallon in some states in May. And with the global economy weakening further, prices for both oil and gasoline are likely to fall further in coming days, analysts say. On Tuesday, the price of Brent crude oil, a crucial global benchmark that is linked to the gasoline prices paid by most Americans, fell $1.92 a barrel in London trading, ending the day at $99.79. It was the first time Brent had closed below $100 since early February, when political turmoil began spreading across the Middle East and North Africa. Oil experts say the dropping prices of oil and gasoline reflect increasing supply and declining demand worldwide, a surge in the value of the dollar in recent weeks and a gradual easing of fears that the Arab Spring revolutions would produce an oil supply shock. ''Oil wants desperately to grind down,'' said Jan Stuart, head of energy commodities research at Credit Suisse. ''Oil is moving down as part of a broader trade of equities, debt markets and commodities driven by a panicky feeling that the macroeconomic situation is deteriorating fast.'' The slowing global economy has led to declining demand for oil in Europe and the United States and has curbed consumption growth in China and other developing countries. Gasoline consumption in the United States was down 2.5 percent in September compared to the same period a year ago, according to a MasterCard Spending Pulse survey. The survey has shown declines of 2 to 3 percent in the four-week moving averages of gasoline consumption every week since the week ending Aug. 5, reflecting a decline in economic activity. Oil prices have also fallen in part because Europe's financial crisis has weakened the region's currency, the euro. Oil is denominated in dollars, so it becomes cheaper to buy in dollars when the greenback is stronger. Oil supplies around the world remain tight, but they have eased, too, in recent months. With the Libyan civil war winding down, exports of oil have started up again in recent days, and several European oil companies have returned to work in onshore and offshore fields. As much as a half-million barrels a day of high-quality crude could return to the market by the end of the year. Iraqi production is also slowly recovering. As a rule of thumb, economists say a $10 decline in the price of a barrel of oil increases economic growth 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points, helping many businesses dependent on oil, like airlines and makers of plastics and fertilizers. Every dime shaved off the price of a gallon of gas can translate into an annual savings of $120 for the typical household that consumes 1,200 gallons a year. But until the last couple of weeks, gasoline prices have not slumped as sharply as oil. Part of that is because of a quirk of the American market. The main benchmark oil quoted in the United States, West Texas Intermediate, has fallen much more sharply than Brent crude, closing Tuesday at $75.67 a barrel, down $1.94. Normally, W.T.I. and Brent have diverged in price by only a couple of dollars. But this year the gulf between the two has surged to $20 or more as a glut of W.T.I. built up at the Cushing, Okla., storage terminal, where W.T.I. contracts are settled. Most Americans pay for gasoline that is pegged to Brent prices, not W.T.I. prices, and Brent prices have remained resiliently high. ''W.T.I. continues to capture headlines but has little to do with what Americans pay for fuel,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. ''Brent is the relevant number for drivers.'' Tuesday's average retail price per gallon of gasoline of $3.41 is still roughly 70 cents above a year ago and only about 15 percent below the year's high of $3.98 on May 5. Mr. Kloza predicted that gasoline prices would continue to fall to around $3 in the coming months. ''That will be the launching pad for 2012, and we will overreact in the spring and prices will flirt with $4 again,'' he added, since oil and gasoline prices normally rise as the summer driving season approaches.</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/banks-adding-debit-card-fees/?ref=mastercardinc">Banks Adding Debit Card Fees<date>September 29, 2011, 3:35 pm</date><text>Michael Stravato for The New York TimesA customer pays by swiping a debit card. Starting Saturday, big banks must comply with a new regulation that caps the fees they can charge merchants for processing debit card purchases. But some consumers are already seeing the impact of the change, in the form of higher fees charged on their checking accounts, as banks seek to recoup lost revenue. Bank of America is the latest bank to say it will begin charging a monthly fee for checking accounts that use debit cards. Starting early next year, the bank will charge $5 a month, in any month that the customer uses a debit card to make a purchase. (If customers have a debit card, but don’t use it, they won’t incur the fee.) The fee won’t apply to A.T.M. transactions, and it won’t be charged to customers with certain premium accounts, a bank spokeswoman, Betty Riess, said. “The economics of offering a debit card have changed with recent regulations,” she said. Bank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found. The added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared. (The Federal Reserve originally considered a cap of 12 cents, or half of what it finally set.) While consumers are seeing the impact of the change in their bank accounts, any potential savings benefit at stores is likely to be muted. “I don’t expect there to be any visible effects at the cash register,” said Aaron McPherson, practice director for payments at IDC Financial Insights. When similar caps were put in place in Australia, he said, merchants there didn’t pass along savings, so it’s unlikely that will happen here either. That’s because, retail groups say, stores aren’t going to benefit as much as they had originally hoped under the new cap, and some merchants may actually pay higher fees. The Fed earlier this year lowered the average maximum “swipe,” or interchange, fee to roughly half of what it had been previously. (Shoppers don’t pay the fees directly; banks collect them from merchants on behalf of payment networks like MasterCard and Visa, which set the rates. The rates vary depending on the type of merchant.) Retail groups say the new cap is a “critical step” in reining in fees that contribute to higher prices for shoppers. But Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said the Fed, under pressure from banks, set a “deeply flawed” formula for the cap that will actually result in some retailers paying higher fees for small-dollar transactions — say, drinks sold at coffee shops. The formula sets the cap at 21 cents, plus .05 percent of the transaction amount, plus another penny in certain cases, for fraud-control measures. That means the maximum fee on the average debit transaction of $38 will be about 24 cents, compared with 44 cents previously. But the payment networks have indicated they will treat the cap as more of a floor in some cases, Mr. Dodge said. In short, he said, to help make up for lost revenue on big-ticket items, the networks will increase fees on smaller transactions, to bring them up to the new limit. Retailers do retain some flexibility, he said, to steer customers away from more expensive forms of payment, like rewards credit cards, and toward less expensive methods. So consumers may eventually see some merchants, like gas stations, offer discounts for using a debit card, as some do now for payments in cash. One impact is clear, said Paul Bragan of Wakefield Research, which has studied consumer opinion about the swipe fee debate: Consumers are much more aware of the process by which banks charge stores for the use of plastic cards, and are in favor of more disclosure of such fees. “They’re looking for greater transparency in the process, so they can understand how it will affect them,” he said. If you see any signs of changed retail prices or bank fees, after Oct. 1, please let us know in the comments section.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/personaltech/googles-virtual-credit-card-can-replace-plastic.html?ref=mastercardinc">Visions of a Future Where Phones Replace Wallets<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Plenty of companies would love to get their hands on our wallets. But Google wants to go one step further: it wants to be our wallets.Its new phone software, called Google Wallet, is intended to replace the credit cards in our actual wallets. It does sound pretty spectacular, doesn’t it? No fishing plastic cards out of wallets, no paper slips, no signatures. Everything is handled securely, instantly, conveniently, with one tap of your phone at the register. Europeans and Asians already routinely pay for things that way. Why can’t we have that in America? Now you can. But there are enough footnotes to fill a podiatry journal. At the moment, the free Google Wallet app runs on only a single cellphone model: Sprint’s Google Nexus S, which runs Google’s Android software. That’s because Google Wallet requires a special N.F.C. chip (near-field communications), and the Nexus S is one of the few phones so equipped. Someday, Google says, many more phones will have N.F.C. chips. The company says that it’s in talks with every major Android phone maker. The next question: Where can you use Wallet to pay for things? Google had the inspired idea of teaming up with MasterCard, which has already installed N.F.C. readers at 150,000 merchants in the United States and 230,000 overseas. You can see the black MasterCard PayPass terminals all over the place. That’s 150,000 companies; the total number of physical stores is far higher. At the moment, they include CVS, Duane Reade, RadioShack, Sunoco, Sports Authority, Foot Locker and New York City taxis. In coming weeks, Google says, more stores will come along, including Subway, Macy’s, Walgreens and Bloomingdale’s. Someday, Google says, the readers will be installed at cash registers all across this great land. Think of Wallet as a copy of your actual credit card. Wherever you might swipe a credit card, you can tap your phone instead. At the moment, though, the only credit card Wallet can impersonate is a Citibank MasterCard. Someday, Google says, all kinds of credit cards from all kinds of banks will work with Wallet. If you don’t have a Citibank MasterCard, you can still use Wallet. On the screen where you select which credit card you want to use, you’ll find an imaginary one called Google Prepaid Card. It comes with $10 of credit — Google’s gift to you, O Early Adopter — but right there on the phone, you can preload it with more money from another credit card. All right. So you’re in CVS or 7-Eleven, and the cashier announces the total, “$31.24.” At the exact moment when you would ordinarily swipe your credit card, you simply turn on the phone. (You don’t have to fire up the Wallet app first.) You hold it against the PayPass terminal and enter your four-digit password. The screen says “Sent,” and the terminal’s screen says “Authorizing ... Approved ... Balance $0. Thank you!” Security, Google says, is baked into the system from the beginning. The phone’s N.F.C. chip is completely deactivated when the screen is off. That’s to prevent sneaky evildoers from “skimming” (reading) your credit card information. A shame, really; Google says that the N.F.C. chip could work even when the phone was off, meaning you could keep using it to buy things. But Google chose to emphasize security over convenience; as a result, the phone is useless as a wallet once its battery is dead. The pass code requirement is intended to prevent people from buying stuff with your phone if it’s lost or stolen, since they won’t know the code. (And if they guess wrong five times in a row, the whole Wallet becomes unusable. You have to contact Google and explain yourself.) Of course, the four-digit pass code requirement also sucks most of the fun and convenience out of the whole phone-as-wallet concept. Tapping out the pass code on small keys on a not-always-responsive touch screen is a hassle, and not demonstrably faster than signing a regular credit card slip. Why can’t we disable that requirement according to our own paranoia levels? You can’t even pick an easy-to-type pass code to save yourself effort; Wallet won’t accept codes like 1234 or 1111. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/e-m-v-chip-cards-unlikely-to-change-consumer-liability/?ref=mastercardinc">Consumer Liability Unlikely to Change With New Credit Cards<date>September 19, 2011, 1:00 pm</date><text>Recently, Bucks noted Visa’s plans to speed up adoption in the United States of credit and debit cards that use E.M.V. chip technology, which is considered more secure than the old-fashioned magnetic strip cards prevalent here. The new cards are widespread in Europe, and some globetrotting Americans have complained that their cards don’t always work  overseas. In response, a reader wondered, in a posted comment, if the impetus for the change was to shift more liability for card fraud away from banks and onto cardholders; he suggested that had happened in Europe, after the migration to E.M.V. cards several years ago. (E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.) But it’s unlikely that the new chip cards will result in any changes to consumer liability in the United States, says Julie McNelley, an analyst specializing in retail banking with Aite Group.  Federal law already limits consumer liability in cases of card fraud to a maximum of $50 in most situations, and banks usually waive even that amount.  “The shift of the form factor isn’t going to affect consumer liability,” Ms. McNelley said. Rosetta Jones, a spokeswoman for Visa, noted in an e-mail that Visa has a “zero liability” policy for fraudulent use of its credit and debit cards that goes beyond the protection of federal law in the United States: “Visa doesn’t expect the zero liability protections consumers enjoy in the U.S. to change with the adoption of E.M.V. chip.” There was some controversy about cardholder liability in Britain, when some banks balked at reimbursing customers for unauthorized transactions conducted using a PIN, according to consumer advocates in Britain. But that problem was addressed by regulations that took effect in late 2009. A spokeswoman for the UK Card Association, an industry group, said via e-mail that cardholder liability is limited by legislation to £50 (about $80) and in practice, most card companies refund their customers in full. There is a possible exception if the cardholder acts “fraudulently” or with “gross negligence,” but the burden of proof lies with the bank. What will change in the United States, eventually, is that merchants — instead of banks — will bear more responsibility for fraudulent transactions. Card-issuing banks now generally cover most fraud costs, but merchants will bear more liability if they don’t adopt payment systems that can handle the new E.M.V. technology by October 2015, according to Visa’s plan.</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/google-wallet-makes-its-debut/?ref=mastercardinc">Google Wallet Makes its Debut<date>September 19, 2011, 6:59 pm</date><text>Updated 8:30 p.m.: Added an interview with Google. Google introduced to the public its long-awaited solution for eventually replacing credit cards with mobile phones. The product, called Google Wallet, stores people’s credit card information, coupons and discount cards on Google Android smartphones and allows people to pay for products with a swipe of the phone. Merchants need the technology of near-field communication, or N.F.C., which enables short-range wireless communications between a phone and an N.F.C reader. But don’t throw away your credit cards and wallet just yet. Google Wallet comes with several caveats. To use the new feature you will need a Sprint Nexus S 4G phone with built-in N.F.C. technology, a Citibank account and a MasterCard credit card. Google said it hoped to eventually add Visa, Discover and American Express to its wallet software, but it is not clear when. Google introduced Google Wallet in May, but until now, only employees of Google and other companies involved with the app have been able to use it. Google will focus at first on signing up merchants and users in New York and San Francisco, but Sprint Nexus S 4G users will be able to use it in other cities at 150,000 merchants that accept MasterCard’s PayPass, Google said. Google is just one of dozens of companies competing to replace plastic credit cards with a digital alternative. Technology companies including Square, Venmo and PayPal are trying to offer similar products, and larger banks are working with phone manufactures to avoid being   pushed out of the mobile banking race. One of the hold-ups to making cellphone payments mainstream has been that people can just as easily reach into their pockets for a credit card as they can for a phone. Google will try to overcome that obstacle by offering deals like Google Offers as part of Google Wallet, said Osama Bedier, Google’s vice president of payments. Another hold-up has been the sheer number of players involved in offering mobile payments — mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies — especially since each wants a percentage of the transactions. But Google has moved relatively quickly because it does not earn money from Google Wallet transactions. It only makes money if merchants choose to advertise to Google Wallet customers through AdWords or Google Offers. For Google, the wallet is a way to jump from the Web to the offline world and provide a way for consumers and advertisers to use Google even when they aren’t online. “We see the lines are blurring between online and offline, and our business can no longer be just about online activity,” Mr. Bedier said. “Consumers don’t see their world as online or offline, they see it as a continuum, and we think there’s a huge opportunity here to address their offline advertising needs.”</text></article>

Gasoline cost an average of $3.41 nationwide on Tuesday, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report, down from more than $4 a gallon in some states in May. And with the global economy weakening further, prices for both oil and gasoline are likely to fall further in coming days, analysts say. On Tuesday, the price of Brent crude oil, a crucial global benchmark that is linked to the gasoline prices paid by most Americans, fell $1.92 a barrel in London trading, ending the day at $99.79. It was the first time Brent had closed below $100 since early February, when political turmoil began spreading across the Middle East and North Africa. Oil experts say the dropping prices of oil and gasoline reflect increasing supply and declining demand worldwide, a surge in the value of the dollar in recent weeks and a gradual easing of fears that the Arab Spring revolutions would produce an oil supply shock. ''Oil wants desperately to grind down,'' said Jan Stuart, head of energy commodities research at Credit Suisse. ''Oil is moving down as part of a broader trade of equities, debt markets and commodities driven by a panicky feeling that the macroeconomic situation is deteriorating fast.'' The slowing global economy has led to declining demand for oil in Europe and the United States and has curbed consumption growth in China and other developing countries. Gasoline consumption in the United States was down 2.5 percent in September compared to the same period a year ago, according to a MasterCard Spending Pulse survey. The survey has shown declines of 2 to 3 percent in the four-week moving averages of gasoline consumption every week since the week ending Aug. 5, reflecting a decline in economic activity. Oil prices have also fallen in part because Europe's financial crisis has weakened the region's currency, the euro. Oil is denominated in dollars, so it becomes cheaper to buy in dollars when the greenback is stronger. Oil supplies around the world remain tight, but they have eased, too, in recent months. With the Libyan civil war winding down, exports of oil have started up again in recent days, and several European oil companies have returned to work in onshore and offshore fields. As much as a half-million barrels a day of high-quality crude could return to the market by the end of the year. Iraqi production is also slowly recovering. As a rule of thumb, economists say a $10 decline in the price of a barrel of oil increases economic growth 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points, helping many businesses dependent on oil, like airlines and makers of plastics and fertilizers. Every dime shaved off the price of a gallon of gas can translate into an annual savings of $120 for the typical household that consumes 1,200 gallons a year. But until the last couple of weeks, gasoline prices have not slumped as sharply as oil. Part of that is because of a quirk of the American market. The main benchmark oil quoted in the United States, West Texas Intermediate, has fallen much more sharply than Brent crude, closing Tuesday at $75.67 a barrel, down $1.94. Normally, W.T.I. and Brent have diverged in price by only a couple of dollars. But this year the gulf between the two has surged to $20 or more as a glut of W.T.I. built up at the Cushing, Okla., storage terminal, where W.T.I. contracts are settled. Most Americans pay for gasoline that is pegged to Brent prices, not W.T.I. prices, and Brent prices have remained resiliently high. ''W.T.I. continues to capture headlines but has little to do with what Americans pay for fuel,'' said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service. ''Brent is the relevant number for drivers.'' Tuesday's average retail price per gallon of gasoline of $3.41 is still roughly 70 cents above a year ago and only about 15 percent below the year's high of $3.98 on May 5. Mr. Kloza predicted that gasoline prices would continue to fall to around $3 in the coming months. ''That will be the launching pad for 2012, and we will overreact in the spring and prices will flirt with $4 again,'' he added, since oil and gasoline prices normally rise as the summer driving season approaches.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/banks-adding-debit-card-fees/?ref=mastercardinc">Banks Adding Debit Card Fees<date>September 29, 2011, 3:35 pm</date><text>Michael Stravato for The New York TimesA customer pays by swiping a debit card. Starting Saturday, big banks must comply with a new regulation that caps the fees they can charge merchants for processing debit card purchases. But some consumers are already seeing the impact of the change, in the form of higher fees charged on their checking accounts, as banks seek to recoup lost revenue. Bank of America is the latest bank to say it will begin charging a monthly fee for checking accounts that use debit cards. Starting early next year, the bank will charge $5 a month, in any month that the customer uses a debit card to make a purchase. (If customers have a debit card, but don’t use it, they won’t incur the fee.) The fee won’t apply to A.T.M. transactions, and it won’t be charged to customers with certain premium accounts, a bank spokeswoman, Betty Riess, said. “The economics of offering a debit card have changed with recent regulations,” she said. Bank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found. The added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared. (The Federal Reserve originally considered a cap of 12 cents, or half of what it finally set.) While consumers are seeing the impact of the change in their bank accounts, any potential savings benefit at stores is likely to be muted. “I don’t expect there to be any visible effects at the cash register,” said Aaron McPherson, practice director for payments at IDC Financial Insights. When similar caps were put in place in Australia, he said, merchants there didn’t pass along savings, so it’s unlikely that will happen here either. That’s because, retail groups say, stores aren’t going to benefit as much as they had originally hoped under the new cap, and some merchants may actually pay higher fees. The Fed earlier this year lowered the average maximum “swipe,” or interchange, fee to roughly half of what it had been previously. (Shoppers don’t pay the fees directly; banks collect them from merchants on behalf of payment networks like MasterCard and Visa, which set the rates. The rates vary depending on the type of merchant.) Retail groups say the new cap is a “critical step” in reining in fees that contribute to higher prices for shoppers. But Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said the Fed, under pressure from banks, set a “deeply flawed” formula for the cap that will actually result in some retailers paying higher fees for small-dollar transactions — say, drinks sold at coffee shops. The formula sets the cap at 21 cents, plus .05 percent of the transaction amount, plus another penny in certain cases, for fraud-control measures. That means the maximum fee on the average debit transaction of $38 will be about 24 cents, compared with 44 cents previously. But the payment networks have indicated they will treat the cap as more of a floor in some cases, Mr. Dodge said. In short, he said, to help make up for lost revenue on big-ticket items, the networks will increase fees on smaller transactions, to bring them up to the new limit. Retailers do retain some flexibility, he said, to steer customers away from more expensive forms of payment, like rewards credit cards, and toward less expensive methods. So consumers may eventually see some merchants, like gas stations, offer discounts for using a debit card, as some do now for payments in cash. One impact is clear, said Paul Bragan of Wakefield Research, which has studied consumer opinion about the swipe fee debate: Consumers are much more aware of the process by which banks charge stores for the use of plastic cards, and are in favor of more disclosure of such fees. “They’re looking for greater transparency in the process, so they can understand how it will affect them,” he said. If you see any signs of changed retail prices or bank fees, after Oct. 1, please let us know in the comments section.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/personaltech/googles-virtual-credit-card-can-replace-plastic.html?ref=mastercardinc">Visions of a Future Where Phones Replace Wallets<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Plenty of companies would love to get their hands on our wallets. But Google wants to go one step further: it wants to be our wallets.Its new phone software, called Google Wallet, is intended to replace the credit cards in our actual wallets. It does sound pretty spectacular, doesn’t it? No fishing plastic cards out of wallets, no paper slips, no signatures. Everything is handled securely, instantly, conveniently, with one tap of your phone at the register. Europeans and Asians already routinely pay for things that way. Why can’t we have that in America? Now you can. But there are enough footnotes to fill a podiatry journal. At the moment, the free Google Wallet app runs on only a single cellphone model: Sprint’s Google Nexus S, which runs Google’s Android software. That’s because Google Wallet requires a special N.F.C. chip (near-field communications), and the Nexus S is one of the few phones so equipped. Someday, Google says, many more phones will have N.F.C. chips. The company says that it’s in talks with every major Android phone maker. The next question: Where can you use Wallet to pay for things? Google had the inspired idea of teaming up with MasterCard, which has already installed N.F.C. readers at 150,000 merchants in the United States and 230,000 overseas. You can see the black MasterCard PayPass terminals all over the place. That’s 150,000 companies; the total number of physical stores is far higher. At the moment, they include CVS, Duane Reade, RadioShack, Sunoco, Sports Authority, Foot Locker and New York City taxis. In coming weeks, Google says, more stores will come along, including Subway, Macy’s, Walgreens and Bloomingdale’s. Someday, Google says, the readers will be installed at cash registers all across this great land. Think of Wallet as a copy of your actual credit card. Wherever you might swipe a credit card, you can tap your phone instead. At the moment, though, the only credit card Wallet can impersonate is a Citibank MasterCard. Someday, Google says, all kinds of credit cards from all kinds of banks will work with Wallet. If you don’t have a Citibank MasterCard, you can still use Wallet. On the screen where you select which credit card you want to use, you’ll find an imaginary one called Google Prepaid Card. It comes with $10 of credit — Google’s gift to you, O Early Adopter — but right there on the phone, you can preload it with more money from another credit card. All right. So you’re in CVS or 7-Eleven, and the cashier announces the total, “$31.24.” At the exact moment when you would ordinarily swipe your credit card, you simply turn on the phone. (You don’t have to fire up the Wallet app first.) You hold it against the PayPass terminal and enter your four-digit password. The screen says “Sent,” and the terminal’s screen says “Authorizing ... Approved ... Balance $0. Thank you!” Security, Google says, is baked into the system from the beginning. The phone’s N.F.C. chip is completely deactivated when the screen is off. That’s to prevent sneaky evildoers from “skimming” (reading) your credit card information. A shame, really; Google says that the N.F.C. chip could work even when the phone was off, meaning you could keep using it to buy things. But Google chose to emphasize security over convenience; as a result, the phone is useless as a wallet once its battery is dead. The pass code requirement is intended to prevent people from buying stuff with your phone if it’s lost or stolen, since they won’t know the code. (And if they guess wrong five times in a row, the whole Wallet becomes unusable. You have to contact Google and explain yourself.) Of course, the four-digit pass code requirement also sucks most of the fun and convenience out of the whole phone-as-wallet concept. Tapping out the pass code on small keys on a not-always-responsive touch screen is a hassle, and not demonstrably faster than signing a regular credit card slip. Why can’t we disable that requirement according to our own paranoia levels? You can’t even pick an easy-to-type pass code to save yourself effort; Wallet won’t accept codes like 1234 or 1111. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.com</text></article>

The new cards are widespread in Europe, and some globetrotting Americans have complained that their cards don’t always work  overseas. In response, a reader wondered, in a posted comment, if the impetus for the change was to shift more liability for card fraud away from banks and onto cardholders; he suggested that had happened in Europe, after the migration to E.M.V. cards several years ago. (E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.) But it’s unlikely that the new chip cards will result in any changes to consumer liability in the United States, says Julie McNelley, an analyst specializing in retail banking with Aite Group.  Federal law already limits consumer liability in cases of card fraud to a maximum of $50 in most situations, and banks usually waive even that amount.  “The shift of the form factor isn’t going to affect consumer liability,” Ms. McNelley said.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/sports/soccer/07iht-soccer07.html?ref=mastercardinc">One of FIFA's Own Speaks Out<date>Published: September 6, 2011</date><text>LONDON — In almost four decades, first under the rule of the Brazilian João Havelange and then his successor, Sepp Blatter, the world governing body of soccer, FIFA, has grown rich, powerful and corrupt.Journalists have said it. A few administrators, like the former FIFA general secretary, Michel Zen-Ruffinen, were dismissed for saying it. But not until now has a member of the 24-man FIFA executive committee dared to say it. In “FIFA, More Political than Football,” a 3,000-word passage in a memoir published by Chung Mong-joon, the former FIFA vice president breaks that inner code of silence. Chung, a billionaire shipbuilding magnate, part of the Hyundai family and a senior member of the South Korean National Assembly, makes it very clear that he would sooner run for president in his homeland than for any FIFA office. His book, released Tuesday in South Korea, refers to Blatter as “an articulate and intelligent man, but more like an impetuous child than a gentleman.” More than that, Chung writes: “The executive committee is meant to provide checks and balances when its president goes beyond his authority and mandate. Blatter is trying to take away the power of the executive committee and thereby neutralize any efforts to check his power.” He adds: “A lot of dictators on this planet have used similar methods.” Around this time last year, Chung, at that time one of FIFA’s senior vice presidents, was bidding to take the World Cup to South Korea for the second time in his 17-year involvement with the sport. He was asked in London if he might challenge Blatter for the presidency. He said he was considering it. Shortly after that, South Korea lost the 2022 World Cup bid to Qatar. And in the new year, Chung lost his seat as one of Asia’s representatives on the FIFA hierarchy. Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar became the only contender for Blatter’s crown. That vote never took place. On the eve of the election, Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, longtime personal friends of Blatter’s who had helped his rise to power, were accused of offering $40,000 bribes to members of Warner’s Caribbean constituency to vote for bin Hammam. Warner resigned, complaining that the FIFA ethics panel set to consider the evidence was a court of hypocrites because, he said, gifts were part and parcel of the FIFA culture. Bin Hammam was found guilty by the FIFA ethics panel and banned from any soccer activity for life. The Qatari called the panel a kangaroo court doing Blatter’s bidding and said he would go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, to prove his innocence. On Tuesday, he claimed FIFA never would have convicted and banned him if he were European. But Hammam, Warner and Chung are out. Blatter remains, in his 13th year as FIFA president. Blatter says that in October, he will present his reforms for a cleaner, transparent FIFA after the corruption that the news media exposed during the World Cup bidding process last December. He invited, without consulting his executive committee, the U.S. diplomat Henry A. Kissinger, the Spanish singer Plácido Domingo and the retired soccer player Johan Cruyff to help him find solutions to clean up FIFA’s image. Kissinger appeared to be flattered to be asked. But long ago, while leading an American bid to stage the 1986 World Cup, Kissinger, the secretary of state under Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, was reported to have said: “The politics of FIFA, they make me nostalgic for the Middle East.” What Kissinger found then was that FIFA, under Havelange as president and with Blatter as general secretary, was anything but transparent in its dealings with billion-dollar bids for its global tournament. The U.S. bid was undermined by a deal for television rights that Havelange had already promised to Mexico, which was awarded the 1986 tournament. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/world/middleeast/26syria.html?ref=mastercardinc">Political Cartoonist, Ali Farzat, Is Attacked in Syria<date>Published: August 25, 2011</date><text>BEIRUT, Lebanon — Masked gunmen severely beat Syria’s best-known political cartoonist on Thursday, breaking his hand and leaving him to bleed on the side of a road in Damascus, activists said.The attack came days after the artist, Ali Farzat, published a cartoon showing President Bashar al-Assad hitching a ride out of town with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, who was toppled from power this week. Also Thursday, Syrian security forces carried out military operations against antigovernment activists in several areas across the country, killing nine people, activists and residents said. Since the start of the Syrian uprising in March, Mr. Farzat, whose cartoons are renowned through the Arab world, has aimed his pen at Mr. Assad and his crackdown on protesters. Activists said that Mr. Farzat was seized at 4:30 a.m. in Umayyad Square in Old Damascus, as he was heading home from his studio. They said he was beaten severely and thrown out of a car along the airport road, where passers-by found him. A friend of Mr. Farzat’s said that two fingers of his left hand were broken, his right arm fractured and his left eye bruised. Another friend, Ayad Sharbaji, visited him in the hospital and relayed his description of what happened. “They told him as they were burning his beard, ‘We’ll see what you will draw from now on,’ ” Mr. Sharbaji said. “ ‘How dare you disobey your masters?’ ” The attackers also stole drawings and other personal belongings, activists and friends said. The American Embassy in Damascus called it “a government-sponsored, targeted, brutal attack.” “What happened to Ali Farzat today scared us,” said an activist from Homs, who wished to be identified only by her first name, Sally. “But it’s only a proof of how desperate the regime is. It shows how frightened they are and proves that they are losing control.” In eastern Syria, tanks and armored vehicles entered the town of Shuhail, southeast of the provincial capital, Deir al-Zour, activists and residents said. Daily protests against the government have taken place in Shuhail, they said, since the start of Ramadan. Security forces also attacked four towns in the province of Dara’a in southern Syria, and Rastan and Talbiseh, two villages near Homs, Syria’s third largest city, where there have been large demonstrations. Residents in both areas reported hearing heavy gunfire and loud explosions throughout the day. The Local Coordination Committees, a group of Syrian activists involved in organizing and documenting the protests, said that four soldiers were also shot dead in Rastan after they refused to fire on protesters and residents. Activists said that a Turkish driver was killed as he was driving through the same village, though the reason was not clear. The committees said that among those dead was a 9-year-old boy from Baniyas, a city along the Mediterranean Coast that was the scene of a brutal crackdown in May. The Syrian news agency, Sana, which focuses its reports on the deaths of soldiers it attributes to terrorists, said that armed groups had fired on a military bus in the town of Talbiseh, killing an officer and two soldiers, and that “a terrorist group” had killed five soldiers in Rastan. The Syrian government has not given a total number of security forces killed in the crackdown on protests, but activists and human rights groups say that about 400 have died. The United Nations says that more than 2,200 people have been killed over the past five months. New American sanctions imposed over the crackdown have rendered Visa and MasterCard credit cards no longer valid in Syria, officials said Thursday. The Treasury Department added the state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria and its Lebanon-based subsidiary to its sanctions list this month, citing links to human rights abuses and to illegal weapons trade with North Korea.

    <article index="8" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/23/capital-ones-new-1-5-percent-cash-back-credit-card/?ref=mastercardinc">Capital One's New 1.5 Percent Cash-Back Credit Card<date>August 23, 2011, 1:00 pm</date><text>Today, Capital One is introducing a new cash-back credit card that ultimately yields 1.5 percent in refunds on each purchase, as long as you’re patient. The Capital One Cash MasterCard works like so: You get 1 percent of your purchases back in the form of a cash refund. Then, on the anniversary of the date that you first activated your card, you get a 50 percent bonus on whatever you’ve already earned during the past year. For example, if you activate a new card on Oct. 1, 2011, and use it for $30,000 in purchases between then and Oct. 1, 2012, you’ll earn $300 during that year. Then, on Oct. 1, 2012, you’ll get another $150 added to your refund. You continue receiving the annual bonus on each anniversary. So where’s the fine print here? To be honest, I’m having trouble finding any other than the wait for that extra anniversary money. You can request the cash back whenever you like, even if you’ve earned only $1. You can get it in the form of a credit on your monthly bill or as a check. And you can ask the company to issue the refunds automatically, which eliminates the possibility that you will forget to request the money. There is no limit on how much you can earn. The rewards never expire. And there is no annual fee. Per usual, it’s a bad idea to run up debt on this or any credit card, since the value of the rewards is a tiny fraction of what you’ll pay in interest. Using reward cards drives up costs for merchants, who pass them along in the form of higher prices. Then again, if you sit out of the rewards game on principle, you’ll still pay those higher prices but not get any rewards. As always when a good deal like this comes around, you have to wonder whether the company will be able to sustain it. Charles Schwab introduced a 2 percent cash-back card a few years back, insisted that it knew what it was doing and then got out of the card business when it became clear that its projections were way off. Time will tell whether Capital One has it right. My primary credit card is still the Starwood Preferred Guest American Express, since I’m able to redeem the Starwood points I earn (one point per dollar spent) for Starwood hotel stays that yield a value per point of about 3 cents. That’s twice as much as the 1.5 pennies that Capital One customers will get for every dollar they spend on this new card. Still, I do carry a Capital One No Hassle Rewards cash-back Visa card for two reasons. First, I need a backup card for merchants that do not accept American Express. Plus, Capital One cards do not hit users with the outrageous fees that most other card companies do when a transaction originates outside of the United States. My No Hassle card yields just 1.25 percent cash back, so I plan to try to upgrade my current card to the new one. According to a Capital One spokeswoman, Sukhi Sahni, people like me can call the phone number on the back of our cards to make the request. How do you think this new card stacks up to the Visa and MasterCard cash-back competition?</text></article>

What’s affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week. The Economy: Credit Where Credit Is Due Kevin Drum says he feels like he’s “watching Armageddon from an armchair.” President Obama says that a strong recovery begins with small business and plans a speech on the economy for September. Support for the president’s economic policies hits a new low. A.I.G.’s chief sees a ‘core of strength’ in the economy. Rural businesses are doubtful of the latest government plan. Fitch, another credit bureau, disagrees with Standard &amp; Poor’s and reaffirms America’s AAA credit rating. Starbucks’ chief tells politicians to stop fighting and start creating jobs. Amid skepticism, the newly formed debt panel is pressed for a deal and is told by a business group to revamp taxes and cut Medicare. Politicians and investors often rely on incomplete economic data. Meanwhile, Robert Reich offers an alternative (and funny!) explanation for the credit downgrade. The Data: Leading Indicators Are Up? The market ends down 4 percent.Dell cuts its forecast. Wal-Mart reports higher profits and weaker sales. Jobless claims go up. Bank of America plans to lay off 3,500. TLC lays off Kate Gosselin. Gallup reports a rise in unemployment. The A.I.A. architecture billings index drops yet again. Housing starts fall 1.5 percent. Existing home sales are down in July but up sharply from a year ago. Builder confidence holds steady and the home remodeling index hits a record high. United States industrial production resumes its growth but Fed surveys in both the Empire State and Philadelphia show significant contraction. Core inflation rises the most in six months and construction material prices have risen 8.9 percent this past year, but Paul Krugman says inflation fears are receding. Leading indicators are up, and oil falls to $81 a barrel. Taxes: Warren Buffett Wants to Pay More Warren Buffett wants to raise taxes on the rich, and President Obama agrees. Harvard’s Jeffrey Miron disagrees: “The way to promote a hard-working, entrepreneurial and innovative society is to celebrate great wealth so long as it has been earned by legitimate means. When this is not the case, policy should target the wrongdoing directly, not demonize everyone who hits it big.” A tax expert says Mr. Buffett misses the facts: “Mr. Buffett chose to leave most of his fortune to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and, thus, avoided an estate tax that could potentially give 55 percent of his wealth to Uncle Sam.” Starting Up: Winter May Be Coming for Tech Start-Ups According to the Angry Bear, new data implies that net job creation comes largely from the creation of new establishments and that few of them manage to survive over the long run. A start-up offers employment to locked out N.B.A. players. Seattle’s “green” job programs is a bust. If your green start-up is also suffering, here are 10 ways to wind it down. The Kaufmann Foundation’s Jonathan Ortmans has an update on Startup America. One entrepreneur believes that anybody can build a consumer start-up, but selling to enterprises “separates the men from the boys.” And tech start-ups be warned: some think winter is coming. Red Tape Update: Hide Your Accounting Software Republicans focus their anti-regulatory attacks on the Environmental Protection Agency. Many of us should pay attention to upcoming patent reforms. Lobbying is a booming business in Florida. Independent contractor rules continue to be narrowed. An accountant warns that the I.R.S. may be after our accounting software. Cyndia Zwahlen says that “small-business owners who work at home might not have to worry about a commute, but figuring out their taxes could make the 405 Freeway at rush hour seem like a piece of cake.” Fran Tarkenton talks up small business (he’s not a fan of the president). Marketing: Too Important to Be Left to The Marketing Department? Major Web sites such as MSN.com and Hulu.com have been tracking people’s online activities using “super cookies.” Facebook is showing sharp declines in usage for certain activities, and an analyst thinks both Facebook and Groupon are in trouble. Time lists its 50 best Web sites of 2011. A former “Nightline” producer shares his 10 commandments of media outreach. Isabelle Mercier Turcotte lists 13 ways to respond to the complaint, “it costs too much.” A blogger  shares 20 marketing quotes that inspire him, including one from David Packard: “Marketing is too important to be left to the marketing department.” A marketing engineer explains how some manufacturers are using social media effectively. Here are seven ways you can strengthen your customer relationships. Or better yet, just try to be more like Morton’s Steakhouse. Management: It Pays to be Mean Abercrombie &amp; Fitch offers to pay the Situation NOT to wear its clothes. Almost one in two small-business owners have experienced late client payments in the past 12 months, according to a new report, with a quarter facing serious cash flow shortages as a result. Amy Levin Epstein shares tips on how small-business owners can get paid on time, every time. James Gardner shares 10 epic idea management fails. A survey finds that 72 percent of small-business owners who go away on holiday are unable to leave work behind. Hilton welcomes the Chinese. The Chinese are not very welcoming to the Georgetown Hoyas. But they do seem interested in our technology. Nick Morgan’s podcast explains how to be a passionate communicator. Michael Hess offers foolproof diet and exercise tips — for businesses. A study finds that mean people earn more. Contests: America’s Favorite Small Business Check maker Deluxe Corporation begins a yearlong marketing lab that gives small-business owners tools and resources. Dell, MasterCard and Microsoft are offering $75,000 to America’s favorite small business. Opportunities: It’s All Science Cars are expected to surpass laptops as the largest lithium battery market. A company reports that tomorrow’s pacemakers could be powered by light. Beth Goodbaum writes about a handful of recent developments in materials science that have significant business potential. A new preservative could extend shelf life for five years. Are these the most honest people in the world? Finance: Opening Up the Spigots (a Little) A soon-to-expire government initiative aimed at spurring small-business lending has barely gotten off the ground. Here’s where you should never, ever use a business credit card. Capital One issues a new cash-back card for small business. An angel investor network debuts in Minnesota. An analysis says that many of the nation’s biggest banks are making significantly fewer small-business loans than they did before the recession, but The Wall Street Journal says that banks are opening up the spigots … a little. Technology: Google Plunges In, H.P. Gives Up The online meeting provider Webex introduces a half-price product geared toward small business. Google buys Motorola’s phone business. H.P. kills off its phones and TouchPads, and Best Buy is sitting on a bunch of unsold inventory. A tech writer reports that hackers are focusing more on smartphones. We’re now told that every hour of TV shortens life by 22 minutes. Kathryn Boehret says this about BlackBerry’s new phone: “If you’re wedded to the BlackBerry and you’re eager to upgrade, the BlackBerry Torch 9850 is a slick device that’s fast to respond in various tasks. But the scant number of apps available for it will be a real drawback and won’t satisfy BlackBerry fans looking for an iPhone equivalent.” The Week Ahead: Bernanke Speaking The Richmond Fed reports on manufacturing activity, and new home sales are released Tuesday. Most economists will be paying close attention to Durable Goods, weekly unemployment and preliminary Gross Domestic Product numbers. On Friday, Ben S. Bernanke is expected to deliver a speech. This Week’s Bests Reason to be tough Jeff Haden tells business people to Toughen Up, Sissy Boy: “Sound harsh? It’s not. T.U.S.B. is actually empowering. When you put the focus on yourself, you stop wasting time thinking about what you can’t control. You can’t control your boss. You can’t control your coworkers. You can’t control customers or vendors or markets. You can’t completely control what anyone does, even if they work for you — but you can completely control what you do.” Reason to be optimistic about our energy future Foreign Policy magazine says it will be the Americas, not the Middle East, that will soon rule the energy market: “By the 2020s, the capital of energy will likely have shifted back to the Western Hemisphere. The U.S. endowment of unconventional oil is more than 2 trillion barrels, with another 2.4 trillion in Canada and 2 trillion-plus in South America — compared with conventional Middle Eastern and North African oil resources of 1.2 trillion. The problem was always how to unlock them economically.” Way to live a fulfilling life Consultant Peter Bregman lists three questions that help him live a fulfilling life, including: “What is this day about? How will it bring me one day closer to what I want to achieve for the year? What is most important for me to accomplish today? I set my watch to beep every hour, interrupting myself for one minute to reconnect with my purpose for the day. In that minute, I ask myself two questions: Am I doing what I most need to be doing right now? Am I being who I most want to be right now?” This Week’s Question What do you most need to be doing right now?

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/business/low-interest-rates-do-little-to-sway-nervous-consumers.html?ref=mastercardinc">Low Interest Rates Do Little to Sway Nervous Consumers<date>Published: August 14, 2011</date><text>The Federal Reserve’s announcement last week that it intended to keep credit cheap for at least two more years was a clear invitation to Americans: Go out and borrow.But many economists say it will take more than low interest rates to persuade consumers, a crucial driver of the nation’s economy, to take on more debt. There are already signs that the recent stock market upheaval, turbulence in Europe and gridlock in Washington over the federal deficit have spooked consumers. On Friday, preliminary data showed that the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index had fallen this month to lower than it was in November 2008, when the country was deep in recession. Under normal circumstances, the Fed’s announcement might have attracted new home and car buyers and prompted credit card holders to rack up fresh charges. But with unemployment high and those with jobs worried about keeping them, consumers are more concerned about paying off the loans they already have than adding more debt. And by showing its hand for the next two years, the Fed may have inadvertently invited prospective borrowers to put off large purchases. Lenders, meanwhile, are still dealing with the effects of the boom-gone-bust and are forcing prospective borrowers to go to extraordinary lengths to prove their creditworthiness. “I don’t think lenders are going to be interested in extending a lot of debt in this environment,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, a macroeconomic consulting firm. “Nor do I think households are going to be interested in taking on a lot of debt.” In housing, consumers have already shown a lackluster response to low rates. Applications for new mortgages have slowed this year to a 10-year low, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Sales of furniture and furnishings remain 22 percent below their prerecession peak, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, a research service. Credit card rates have actually gone up slightly in the last year. The one bright spot in lending is the number of auto loans, which is up from last year. But some economists say that confidence among car buyers is hitting new lows. For Xavier Walter, a former mortgage banker who with his wife, Danielle, accumulated $70,000 on a home equity line and $20,000 in credit card debt, low rates will not change his spending habits. As the housing market topped out five years ago, he lost his six-figure income. He and his wife were able to modify the mortgage on their four-bedroom colonial in Medford, N.J., as well as negotiate lower credit card payments. Two years ago, Mr. Walter, a 34-year-old father of three, started an energy business. He has sworn off credit. “I’m not going to go back in debt ever again,” he said. “If I can’t pay for it in cash, I don’t want it.” Until now, one of the biggest restraints on consumer spending has been a debt hangover. Since August 2008, when household debt peaked at $12.41 trillion, it has declined by about $1.2 trillion, according to an analysis by Moody’s Analytics of data from the Federal Reserve and Equifax, the credit agency. A large portion of that, though, was simply written off by lenders as borrowers defaulted on loans. By other measures, households have improved their position. The proportion of after-tax income that households spend to remain current on loan payments has fallen, from close to 14 percent in early 2007 to 11.5 percent now, according to Moody’s Analytics. Still, household debt remains high. That presents a conundrum: many economists argue that the economy cannot achieve true health until debt levels decline. But credit, made attractive by low rates, is a time-tested way to bolster consumer spending. With new risks of another downturn, economists worry that it will take years for debt to return to manageable levels. If the economy contracts again, said George Magnus, senior adviser at UBS, then “you could find a lot of households in a debt trap which they probably can never get out of.” The market most directly affected by the reluctance to borrow is housing. With many owners still owing more than the current value of their homes, they cannot sell and move up to new homes. New mortgage and refinancing loan volumes fell nearly 19 percent, to $265 billion, at the end of the second quarter, down from $325 billion in the first quarter, the lowest since 2008, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter. 1 2 Next Page » Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.</text></article>

This time, it's one with a particularly unwieldy name, even by travel rewards credit card standards: the Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard, a joint offering from Citibank and American Airlines. The card carries a host of travel perks as well as a hefty $450 annual fee, and an E.M.V. version is expected to be available sometime later this year, Citibank and American said in a press release. A Citibank spokeswoman declined to provide details on precisely when the chip cards would be made available, or to discuss whether the chips would be offered on less-pricey versions of the Citi AAdvantage card. In the press release, the companies noted that cards with E.M.V. chips - the initials stand for Europay, MasterCard and Visa - were ''increasingly important when making credit card purchases abroad.'' That's for sure. United States card issuers and retailers still rely on older, less secure magnetic strip technology. But the New York Times travel writer Michelle Higgins has reported on the difficulty Americans have encountered when using ''mag stripe'' cards abroad, especially at unattended kiosks selling train tickets or collecting highway tolls. Her most recent column elicited an avalanche of reader responses. Because of those types of frustrating mishaps, more United States banks are offering cards with E.M.V. chips to their customers who travel overseas. US Bank, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and some smaller credit unions are among those already offering or testing the cards. Have you been able to get a card with E.M.V. chip technology?

    <article index="12" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/cards-that-help-save-on-airline-baggage-fees/?ref=mastercardinc">Cards That Help Save on Airline Baggage Fees<date>August 10, 2011, 12:26 pm</date><text>If you’ve flown anywhere recently, you know that travelers are increasingly trying to cram more luggage into the overhead bins to avoid those pesky checked-baggage fees that generally start at $25 a bag. Some credit cards, though, can help reduce the fee burden — and maybe even reduce time wasted as attendants pry excess bags from the hands of desperate passengers and wheel them away to be checked. NerdWallet, a card comparison site, has compiled a chart of cards that waive the fees on the first bag you check, if you use the card to buy your ticket: www.nerdwallet.com Via: NerdWallet As the chart shows, some airlines, like Southwest and Jet Blue, don’t charge for the first bag. So even though the airlines have branded cards, you don’t necessarily need them for this particular situation. Delta and Continental each charge $25 for the first bag, but you can have the fee waived if you pay for your ticket with their branded cards, like Delta’s Skymiles Gold from American Express, and Chase’s Continental OnePass Plus. The cards carry hefty annual fees after the first year, though, so you’ll want to consider how much you travel before choosing one. Delta’s card allows up to nine people on the same itinerary to check a bag free, whereas the Continental card’s perk is restricted to the primary cardholder and a traveling companion. Because of the Continental merger with United Airlines, the Continental OnePass Plus card also allows a free checked bag on United flights, too. The United Mileage Plus card didn’t originally offer free checked bags, but that is now changing as a result of the  merger. As Bucks reported earlier, a new card, called the United MileagePlus Explorer, will replace it, and offer as a perk the right to check a bag for yourself and a traveling companion free. Eventually, the card will replace the Continental OnePass Plus card, too. Also, American Airlines and Citibank recently announced a new card — the Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard — that allows travelers to waive the fee for the first domestic bag checked, as well as the fee for up to eight companions flying on the same itinerary. The new card, with a $450 annual fee, isn’t reflected in the chart. (I could have used some help on a recent American flight, which ended up costing my family an extra $200 in baggage fees, round trip). The other way to get free checked-bag perks is to attain “elite” status as a frequent flier. Some cards can help you rack up mileage faster, says Nerdwallet — and it lists some of them here. How important is it to you get avoid checked-bag fees? Is it worth getting a new credit card with an annual fee? This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 10, 2011 Corrected to reflect that the Continental OnePass Plus card now has the same benefits as the new United MileagePlus Explorer card, so it allows the first bag free for the cardholder as well as a traveling companion.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/visa-wants-u-s-cards-to-catch-up-with-the-world/?ref=mastercardinc">Visa Wants U.S. Cards to Catch Up With the World<date>August 9, 2011, 3:26 pm</date><text>Updated to add American Express comment / Aug. 10, 11:04 a.m. Visa said on Tuesday that it would take steps to speed up adoption in the United States of credit and debit cards that use secure E.M.V. chips. The reaction from those of us here at Bucks? “It’s about time!” Bucks writers and our colleagues at The Times have written often about the problems increasingly faced by Americans using credit cards when traveling abroad. These problems occur because United States credit card companies and merchants continue to use older, less-secure magnetic stripe technology. In Europe and elsewhere overseas, cards with embedded E.M.V. chips, which are microprocessors that provide heightened security, are becoming the norm, and “mag stripe” cards sometimes don’t work, particularly at unattended kiosks that, for instance, sell train tickets. (E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.) While the rest of the world has moved to the chips, the United States has lingered in a chicken-and-egg limbo, with retailers loathe to spend money on new payment systems until card companies adopted the new technology, and card companies reluctant to use the chip cards until merchants agreed to accept them. Now, Visa says that accelerating a switch to E.M.V. technology in the United States will not only enhance security when credit and debit cards are used, but also will help prepare for increased use of mobile systems that let shoppers pay by waving their cellphones at a payment terminal. (Systems that let shoppers pay with their phones use E.M.V. chips, too). Visa’s plan offers financial incentives for retailers to upgrade their payment systems voluntarily while card issuers make the transition to the chip cards. The new systems will be able to process payments from multiple methods during the transition period, including cards with magnetic stripes and E.M.V. chips, as well as mobile systems using smartphones. The overall changeover is likely to take five to six years. Visa’s announcement comes as some banks are starting to offer E.M.V.-enabled credit cards, mainly for affluent customers who travel internationally. A few credit unions have been offering the cards too. Further, some large merchants are backing the new technology: the McDonald’s Corporation has deployed chip-capable terminals in the United States, and Nordstrom has voiced support as well. Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the SmartCard Alliance, said in an e-mail that Visa’s move was the “ignition point” that was needed to spark a migration to the technology in the United States, because merchants have been waiting for a road map from card companies as to what technologies to invest in. “Now that Visa has signaled that the future will include contact chips and mobile contactless payments,” he wrote, “they know what the next generation of payments will look like.” In an e-mail, the MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said that “To date, consumer demand and market economics have not justified a migration in the U.S. We are helping our customers understand what the implications of E.M.V. and other technologies in the U.S. would be.  Any migration must take into account all customer and consumer interests if a collective effort is to be successful. Obviously, Visa’s decision will impact market direction and we will continue to consider our actions accordingly.” Elizabeth Crosta, a spokeswoman for American Express, said in an email that the company does offer chip cards in some markets, like the United Kingdom, but “We have not had a large number of our Cardmembers in the US  requesting cards with chips. While we cannot comment on any future plans, I can assure you that we’re always looking to best serve our Cardmembers and anticipate their needs.”</text></article>

    <article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/business/mastercard-profits-from-customers-abroad.html?ref=mastercardinc">MasterCard Profits From Customers Abroad<date>Published: August 3, 2011</date><text>MasterCard said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards. Its shares rose 13.39 percent, or $39.98, to close at $338.47 on the news. MasterCard said signing up two big banks — SunTrust Banks and Banco Santander’s American affiliate Sovereign Bank — to offer MasterCard debit cards had helped increase revenue in the second quarter. The two banks previously offered Visa debit cards. MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company had benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments. United States economic weakness is now translating to slower inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company’s expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown. “They’re getting strength from other areas,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones. MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 a share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $4.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Visa also beat analysts’ expectations when it reported quarterly results last week. MasterCard executives said they would alter their debit interchange fee structure before new industry fee caps were imposed on those charges later this year. The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers’ debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees and takes effect later this year. Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all United States transactions. MasterCard’s revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew. Over all, MasterCard’s cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent. The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil. Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was because of higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.</text></article>

This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 10, 2011 Corrected to reflect that the Continental OnePass Plus card now has the same benefits as the new United MileagePlus Explorer card, so it allows the first bag free for the cardholder as well as a traveling companion.</text></article>

The reaction from those of us here at Bucks? “It’s about time!” Bucks writers and our colleagues at The Times have written often about the problems increasingly faced by Americans using credit cards when traveling abroad. These problems occur because United States credit card companies and merchants continue to use older, less-secure magnetic stripe technology. In Europe and elsewhere overseas, cards with embedded E.M.V. chips, which are microprocessors that provide heightened security, are becoming the norm, and “mag stripe” cards sometimes don’t work, particularly at unattended kiosks that, for instance, sell train tickets. (E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.) While the rest of the world has moved to the chips, the United States has lingered in a chicken-and-egg limbo, with retailers loathe to spend money on new payment systems until card companies adopted the new technology, and card companies reluctant to use the chip cards until merchants agreed to accept them. Now, Visa says that accelerating a switch to E.M.V. technology in the United States will not only enhance security when credit and debit cards are used, but also will help prepare for increased use of mobile systems that let shoppers pay by waving their cellphones at a payment terminal. (Systems that let shoppers pay with their phones use E.M.V. chips, too). Visa’s plan offers financial incentives for retailers to upgrade their payment systems voluntarily while card issuers make the transition to the chip cards. The new systems will be able to process payments from multiple methods during the transition period, including cards with magnetic stripes and E.M.V. chips, as well as mobile systems using smartphones. The overall changeover is likely to take five to six years. Visa’s announcement comes as some banks are starting to offer E.M.V.-enabled credit cards, mainly for affluent customers who travel internationally. A few credit unions have been offering the cards too. Further, some large merchants are backing the new technology: the McDonald’s Corporation has deployed chip-capable terminals in the United States, and Nordstrom has voiced support as well. Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the SmartCard Alliance, said in an e-mail that Visa’s move was the “ignition point” that was needed to spark a migration to the technology in the United States, because merchants have been waiting for a road map from card companies as to what technologies to invest in. “Now that Visa has signaled that the future will include contact chips and mobile contactless payments,” he wrote, “they know what the next generation of payments will look like.” In an e-mail, the MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said that “To date, consumer demand and market economics have not justified a migration in the U.S. We are helping our customers understand what the implications of E.M.V. and other technologies in the U.S. would be.  Any migration must take into account all customer and consumer interests if a collective effort is to be successful. Obviously, Visa’s decision will impact market direction and we will continue to consider our actions accordingly.” Elizabeth Crosta, a spokeswoman for American Express, said in an email that the company does offer chip cards in some markets, like the United Kingdom, but “We have not had a large number of our Cardmembers in the US  requesting cards with chips. While we cannot comment on any future plans, I can assure you that we’re always looking to best serve our Cardmembers and anticipate their needs.”</text></article>

Card<date>August 8, 2011, 3:20 pm</date><text>Add another credit card to the list of those offering affluent customers the more-secure E.M.V. chip technology that’s becoming dominant in Europe. This time, it’s one with a particularly unwieldy name, even by travel rewards credit card standards: the Citi Executive AAdvantage World Elite MasterCard, a joint offering from Citibank and American Airlines. The card carries a host of travel perks as well as a hefty $450 annual fee, and an E.M.V. version is expected to be available sometime later this year, Citibank and American said in a press release. A Citibank spokeswoman declined to provide details on precisely when the chip cards would be made available, or to discuss whether the chips would be offered on less-pricey versions of the Citi AAdvantage card. In the press release, the companies noted that cards with E.M.V. chips — the initials stand for Europay, MasterCard and Visa — were “increasingly important when making credit card purchases abroad.” That’s for sure. United States card issuers and retailers still rely on older, less secure magnetic strip technology. But the New York Times travel writer Michelle Higgins has reported on the difficulty Americans have encountered when using “mag stripe” cards abroad, especially at unattended kiosks selling train tickets or collecting highway tolls. Her most recent column elicited an avalanche of reader responses. Because of those types of frustrating mishaps, more United States banks are offering cards with E.M.V. chips to their customers who travel overseas. US Bank, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and some smaller credit unions are among those already offering or testing the cards. Have you been able to get a card with E.M.V. chip technology?</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/04/business/mastercard-profits-from-customers-abroad.html?ref=mastercardinc">MasterCard Profits From Customers Abroad<date>Published: August 3, 2011</date><text>MasterCard said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards. Its shares rose 13.39 percent, or $39.98, to close at $338.47 on the news. MasterCard said signing up two big banks — SunTrust Banks and Banco Santander’s American affiliate Sovereign Bank — to offer MasterCard debit cards had helped increase revenue in the second quarter. The two banks previously offered Visa debit cards. MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company had benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments. United States economic weakness is now translating to slower inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company’s expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown. “They’re getting strength from other areas,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones. MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 a share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $4.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Visa also beat analysts’ expectations when it reported quarterly results last week. MasterCard executives said they would alter their debit interchange fee structure before new industry fee caps were imposed on those charges later this year. The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers’ debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees and takes effect later this year. Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all United States transactions. MasterCard’s revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew. Over all, MasterCard’s cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent. The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil. Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was because of higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/take-my-money-please/?ref=mastercardinc">Take My Money, Please<date>August 2, 2011, 4:52 pm</date><text>6:01 p.m. | Updated to clarify that the mileage bonus is for elite-qualifying miles, not just regular frequent-flier miles. This is a story about how a company can manage to turn away someone who wants to give it his money. Actually, two companies. Here’s what happened. A week or so ago, I received some mail from Chase promoting its Continental Presidential Plus MasterCard. Normally, I throw this sort of thing away without even opening it. But I live near Newark Liberty International Airport, a Continental hub, so I try to fly the carrier whenever I travel. I was curious. The Presidential Plus card is the fancier of the two Continental cards Chase offers. (The other is the OnePass card, which is nice, but doesn’t have the same number of perks as the Presidential Card.) It includes access to Continental’s and United’s airport lounges, priority security lines and elite status with hotel and rental car companies. And that’s not to mention early boarding, free checked bags and 1,000 elite-qualifying miles for every $5,000 I charge on the card. All in all, it’s a nice collection of amenities. I never fly enough in a year to attain any elite status, but with a card like this, I would get some of that treatment. Normally, the Presidential Plus card charges an annual fee of $395, making it a competitor to American Express’s Platinum Card (which charges $450 per year). That’s a bit steep, but I was being presented with a special offer in this mailing: If my application were accepted, the first year’s membership fee would be waived. That got my attention. I figured this was one of those times where I had little to lose. I mean, why not get the card, if only for a year? For me, that’s three or four flights (maybe more) where I can relax about security lines, hang out in an airport lounge, board early and get a room upgrade when I check into my hotel. Fabulous. And when the year is almost up, I can cancel the card and feel clever for having gotten something for nothing. Or, after a year of privileges and perks, I can decide I can’t live without it and pay the membership fee for a year two (which, clearly, is what Chase and Continental are hoping for). I set the offer aside as I sorted through the rest of my mail. This weekend, I thought, I’ll apply. The weekend came and I pulled out the sheet I had saved from Chase. There was a Web address to apply, continentalpresplus.com. I typed it in. “Thanks for your interest in the offer we have sent to you. Please provide the required information below so that we can locate your offer,” the site said. Then there was a blank entry field next to “12-digit invitation number.” What 12-digit invitation number? I looked at the piece of paper I had saved. It didn’t have any codes — just the Web address for the site. I then — if not physically, then mentally — slapped my forehead: I had thrown away the rest of the mailing. The number must’ve been in there. There had been a dozen pages or so and, distracted by other things, I thought it all looked like marketing malarkey so I just kept the cover letter. So that was stupid. But no big deal, I thought. I’ll just call up Chase and get my code. I called Chase Credit Cards and explained my situation. The person at the other end had no idea what I was talking about. She suggested I go visit my Chase branch. I asked her if she actually knew if they could help me, or was this what she says when she doesn’t know the answer to something. She was refreshingly candid. “That is exactly what I recommend, sir.” It was a Saturday and I didn’t have a lot going on, so I went over to my local branch. I sat down with a Chase representative and told him my story. He asked me to type in my Social Security number to pull up my profile. By the way, my profile at Chase is not thin: I have two checking accounts there, a savings account, a Chase Visa credit card and a mortgage with them. I’m all over its databases. While I’m at it, I also have a Continental OnePass account. But my man at the Chase branch pulled up nothing on my profile related to the Presidential Plus offer. He made a face. “Let me call my friend in the credit card division,” he said. A few murmured sentences and he hung up. “Sorry. She can’t do anything for you either,” he said. “Unfortunately, it’s impossible for us to track the offers back to customers.” That’s too bad, I said. After all, here I am, asking to apply for this credit card, and I can’t because I lost the piece of paper that had some numbers and letters on it. “Yeah,” the Chase rep said. “It is frustrating. What’s even more frustrating is that even if your friend got the same offer, you couldn’t use his code, as each code is unique and linked to a specific individual.” This was amazing. “So if each code is linked to a specific identity,” I said, “why can’t you find mine? Surely there’s a database somewhere that says, ‘Sam Grobart equals ABCXYZ1234’ or something, right?” “I know,” he replied. “But I can’t. But there is an online promotion right now for the Presidential Plus card. Would you be interested in that? You get a $95 statement credit when you get the card.” Unfortunately, $95 is not $395. The Chase rep agreed that this was true. I didn’t want the card that much, I explained, particularly because I was now aware of a much better offer — an offer that had been sent to me, even. “You could try calling Continental,” he said. I thanked the Chase rep for his time, went home and called Continental, not really expecting much. Sure enough, a representative from Continental told me the airline had no way of tracking the offer back to me. “You know, we may send out another mailing next quarter,” she told me. “If you’re included in that one, you may see this offer again.” “And for our departing contestants we have some lovely going-home prizes. Johnny, tell them what they’re getting.” So with this story in hand, I contacted a Chase spokesman, Paul Hartwick. I explained my situation, informed him that I was going to write about this and asked him if it was really possible that, in 2011, a promotional offer from two multibillion-dollar companies could actually hinge on a single piece of paper, as if it were a Golden Ticket from Willy Wonka. Mr. Hartwick agreed. “Our advisers have the ability to look at offers that have been received by a customer,” he wrote in an e-mail. “In your case, we simply failed to do so and for that, we are sorry.” He informed me that someone would be contacting me to solve this problem. I thanked Mr. Hartwick for his attention to this matter and his candor, but I also asked him a question: What if other people had this problem and they aren’t writing about it for The New York Times? What should they do? Mr. Hartwick suggested that the matter be taken to a supervisor and escalated beyond that if necessary. Later that day, I received a call from Chase Credit Cards’ executive office (a higher level of customer service that you can learn more about in this post from The Consumerist) informing me that they were looking into my problem and would get back to me within a day or two. I am awaiting further action, amazed that The Case of the Missing Promo Code is proving so hard to crack. Have you had a similar experience? Tell us in the comments section below.</text></article>

Federal authorities arrested 16 people on Tuesday, 14 of whom are suspected members of the activist hacker group Anonymous, officials said. The other two individuals were arrested on cyber-related charges. Earlier Tuesday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed three search warrants in connection with the hacker group, law-enforcement officials said. Two of the raids were executed at homes on Long Island, while the other raid took place in an apartment building in Brooklyn. The authorities said they seized computers in the raid. The United States Department of Justice said in a statement that Tuesday’s arrests took place across the United States in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio. The charges, which were brought by federal prosecutors in the Northern District of California in San Jose, allege that Anonymous members performed a distributed denial of service attack against PayPal, the payment Web site, taking the company’s Web site offline for four days. The attacks, which took place during December of last year, were in retaliation for PayPal’s refusal to process WikiLeaks credit card payments. All of the defendants charged in the case are between the ages of 20 and 33 years old. The defendants are all being charged with several counts of conspiracy and intentional damage to a protected computer. Authorities said they will be arraigned Tuesday in the areas they were arrested. Anonymous has been at the center of the news lately with members of the loosely organized group ramping up attacks on corporate and government Web sites. In recent months the group has started to call its efforts AntiSec, or Anti Security, and says it hopes to expose security flaws online. Anonymous has claimed responsibility in the past for attacking MasterCard and Visa in an effort to assist the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange. The group has also attacked sites related to the Church of Scientology. William K. Rashbaum contributed reporting.</text></article>

Varney, the government's top antitrust lawyer, is leaving the Justice Department to join Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore as a partner, representatives of the law firm confirmed on Wednesday. Ms. Varney, 55, who was appointed by President Obama in January 2009, was expected to bring a more aggressive antitrust approach to Washington after what many legal experts saw as a period of lax enforcement during the Bush administration. ''She was faced with an agency that had been decimated and had to turn that ship around, which takes time,'' said Bert Foer, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonprofit agency that generally argues for more competition. ''She got it moving in the right direction.'' In a statement, Ms. Varney said, ''I am grateful for my two and a half years of service as assistant attorney general of the antitrust division.'' Her decision to return to private practice came as a surprise to many. Under Ms. Varney, the antitrust division had just begun to bring big cases. Last October, the Justice Department brought a case against the major credit card companies, accusing them of anticompetitive behavior in prohibiting merchants from steering customers toward certain payments to avoid transaction fees. Visa and MasterCard settled the civil allegations; American Express is fighting the claim. That same month, the department sued Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, contending that the health insurer forced hospitals to charge higher prices to Blue Cross's rivals. On the merger front, the Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange abandoned a joint bid to acquire NYSE Euronext after the antitrust division informed the companies that it would file a lawsuit to block the deal. It also forced VeriFone Systems to drop its takeover of Hypercom, a deal that the agency said would have lessened competition in the electronic payments business. Yet a number of controversial mergers won approval under Ms. Varney, including the merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster; Google's purchase of ITA, the airline search software company; and Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal. Each of these deals was subject to various concessions by the companies. The agency is now examining one of the biggest acquisitions in recent years: AT&amp;T's proposed $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA. Ms. Varney bumped up against Cravath several times at the Justice Department. The antitrust division cleared a number of deals on which Cravath worked, including the airline merger between United and Continental. And defending American Express in the government's antitrust action is Evan R. Chesler, the presiding partner at Cravath who helped recruit Ms. Varney. There is another Cravath connection: Late last year, Ms. Varney hired Katherine B. Forrest, a Cravath partner who led the review of the Continental-United combination, to serve as one of her top deputies. Ms. Forrest was recently nominated for a federal judgeship in Manhattan. Under government ethics rules, Ms. Varney is banned for two years from appearing in any matter before the Justice Department. And she cannot work on any case or matter that was initiated by her division during her tenure. The hiring of Ms. Varney is a coup for Cravath, which is renowned for its antitrust work. It is also unusual in that Cravath rarely hires partners from outside the firm. She will work in New York, where nearly all the firm's lawyers are based. (It also has a small office in London.) She plans to leave the Justice Department early next month and start at Cravath on Sept. 6. She will advise the law firm's clients on antitrust issues related to mergers. The firm is currently advising the Williams Companies in a bid to acquire the pipeline company Southern Union. Recent assignments include advising Johnson &amp; Johnson in its $21.3 billion acquisition of Synthes and representing a special committee of J. Crew's board in the $3 billion buyout by two private equity firms. A graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center, Ms. Varney has jumped between government service and private practice throughout her career. Before joining the Obama administration, Ms. Varney was a partner at Hogan &amp; Hartson, where she focused on antitrust work and Internet policy. In the 1990s she served as a commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission after working in the White House during the early years of the Clinton administration. Among the oldest firms in the United States, Cravath has had a number of its lawyers serve in prominent government posts. John W. White, a longtime partner, served during the George W. Bush administration as the head of corporate finance at the Securities and Exchange Commission and then rejoined the firm in 2009. William H. Seward, who served as President Lincoln's secretary of state and governor of New York, was a founding partner of the firm. Cravath's hiring of Ms. Varney comes at a time when large corporate law firms are aggressively hiring away top lawyers from other firms and offering record pay packages. Ms. Varney is not receiving such largess: Cravath hews to a lockstep compensation model in which partners are paid according to seniority. Still, she will get a significant raise from her government salary: the average Cravath partner earned $3.2 million last year, according to American Lawyer magazine. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

    <article index="10" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/assange-claims-credit-for-egypts-revolution/?ref=mastercardinc">Assange Claims Credit for Egypt's Revolution<date>July 6, 2011, 5:53 pm</date><text>An online ad for WikiLeaks. Updated | Thursday | 9:04 a.m. As Dan Murphy reports on The Christian Science Monitor’s Backchannels blog, a new online ad for WikiLeaks seems to imply that the work of its founder, Julian Assange, helped spark the Egyptian revolution in January. The ad, structured as a parody of a MasterCard commercial, first lays out some of the costs incurred by Mr. Assange to run WikiLeaks and pay his legal bills: “Twenty secure phones to assist in staying anonymous: $5,000. Fighting legal cases across five countries: $1 million. Upkeep of servers in over 40 countries: $200,000. Donations lost due to banking blockade: $15 million. Added cost due to house arrest: $500,000.” The commercial then cuts to images of Mr. Assange watching video of Egyptian protesters facing down riot police officers during the battle for the Kasr al-Nil Bridge in Cairo on Jan. 28. A narrator intones: “Watching the world change as a result of your work? Priceless. There are some people that don’t like change. For everyone else, there’s WikiLeaks.” The ad is particularly puckish since, two days after this MasterCard parody was posted online, WikiLeaks also announced plans to sue the credit card company for refusing to process donations to the organization. Late last year, WikiLeaks published hundreds of leaked American diplomatic cables — in collaboration with The Times and other news organizations. Some of the cables included frank assessments by American diplomats of allegations of widespread corruption among Tunisia’s ruling elite and growing discontent inside Egypt’s military with senior officers, including President Hosni Mubarak’s defense minister. Mr. Assange has said before that he is convinced that the release of the cables played some role in sparking the wave of popular protests in the Arab world that began in Tunisia. For Mr. Murphy, a former Egypt correspondent for The Monitor, the logic behind the new WikiLeaks ad is not at all convincing. The problem with the ad’s premise, Mr. Murphy wrote, “is that it isn’t true.” At least two Egyptian bloggers and activists who took part in the revolution were also not swayed by the ad’s suggestion that WikiLeaks helped spark the uprisings that have swept the Arab world since mid-January, when Tunisians toppled the autocratic government of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Alaa Abd El Fattah, an Egyptian who writes as @alaa on Twitter, told The Lede on Tuesday: “For Tunisia, I don’t know. Information flow there was much more controlled and the leaks did include major gems. But for Egypt, not at all. What was common knowledge already exceeded WikiLeaks, had absolutely no impact.” After the ad was first promoted on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed last week, another Egyptian activist and blogger, who writes as Zeinobia, devoted a post to the video headlined, “Dear Julian, It Was Not the WikiLeaks.” Zeinobia began by stating: “The Egyptian revolution did not happen because of the WikiLeaks cables about Egypt and Mubarak. For the record, only very few cables were allowed to be published in Egypt.” She then noted that while some cables were published in Arabic late last year by the independent newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm, one translator later explained that she had been warned not to translate any of the leaked cables relating to Omar Suleiman, the former Egyptian spy chief. (A leaked cable that was published in English two weeks after the protests in Egypt began later revealed that Mr. Suleiman was Israel’s preferred successor to Mr. Mubarak.) She added that before the first protest on Jan. 25, the only “explosive” cable released by WikiLeaks about Egypt concerned the country’s army, but the revolution in Tunisia “overshadowed” that news and not one Egyptian Web site or newspaper “dared to translate it.” Zeinobia concluded: The Egyptians had many reasons to revolt against Mubarak and bring him down along his rotten, corrupted regime, they were not waiting for WikiLeaks, and the battle of Kasr al-Nil Bridge is not a material for commercials, even political parody commercials! So, what gave Mr. Assange the idea that, as he watched the revolution unfold in Egypt on his laptop, he was viewing the result of his own work? The claim that WikiLeaks acted as a catalyst seems to have begun with reports from Tunisia in January — including one by my colleague David Kirkpatrick — that cited statements by activists who said the release of the cables had added fuel to the fire once the protests got going. And, though it had its own internal dynamics, the revolution in Egypt was at least partly inspired by the success of the revolution in Tunisia. During a recent talk in London, Mr. Assange explained in some detail his theory of just how his group’s release of American diplomatic cables helped trigger the Arab revolutions. At one stage in that talk on Saturday, Mr. Assange suggested that the release of the cables was important not because they provided Tunisians or Egyptians with new information about how corrupt their rulers were, but because they revealed that the United States and European governments were aware of that corruption. The release of the leaked cables also created a political crisis, Mr. Assange said, for rulers in the region and abroad, which made it impossible for the French or American governments to come to the aid of the presidents of Tunisia or Egypt as they might otherwise have done. Here is video of Mr. Assange’s complete conversation with Amy Goodman and Slavoj Zizek — his discussion of the Arab uprisings begins at the 1:50:40 minute mark. (A transcript of this part of the discussion was posted on Ms. Goodman’s Democracy Now Web site.) As The Lede reported in the immediate aftermath of the revolution in Tunisia, several Arab bloggers and journalists initially heaped scorn on the idea that WikiLeaks had played an important role in driving Tunisians into the streets. Abeer Allam, a Saudi-based Financial Times correspondent, wrote on her Twitter feed: “Wikileaks didn’t teach Tunisians secrets about their country. Tunis activists like Zohair Yahyaoui knew and exposed it years ago.” A fellow Arab blogger, a Moroccan lawyer who writes as Ibn Kafka, replied to Ms. Allam: “You’re so right, it seems some Western people cannot fathom that a 3rd world people can get by without their help.” Mr. Assange’s detractors might also point to the fact that one of the first observers to suggest a central role for WikiLeaks in the Arab uprisings was Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. In January, as Libyans prepared to launch a protest movement of their own, Colonel Qaddafi appeared on state television and blamed the unrest in neighboring Tunisia squarely on WikiLeaks, which he denounced as part of a foreign plot to destabilize Arab regimes through disinformation. “WikiLeaks,” the Libyan leader said, “publishes information written by lying ambassadors in order to create chaos.” But Mr. Assange does have at least one strong supporter in Tunis. Slim Amamou, a Tunisian Internet activist, told The Lede on Wednesday that it was “true” that WikiLeaks had played a role in sparking the protests there. Mr. Amamou, who had been jailed in the last days of the Ben Ali regime — and was appointed to the country’s new transitional government just days after his release in January — declined to elaborate on how important the cables were in Tunisia, but he did post a link to the ad on Twitter, with the message “Support WikiLeaks.” Well before the release of the diplomatic cables or Tunisia’s revolution, Mr. Amamou was a strong supporter of WikiLeaks. In July 2010, he wrote a post on his blog about the organization that ended with a call for readers to support WikiLeaks. On Dec. 17, the same day that Mohamed Bouazizi, a Tunisian fruit seller, began the protest movement by setting himself on fire, Mr. Amamou was quoted in an article speaking in support of Internet attacks by the online group Anonymous on the Web sites of companies that had stopped doing business with WikiLeaks. (After this post was originally published, a reader made us aware of a new interview, also published on Wednesday, in which another Tunisian blogger, Sofiane Ben Haj M’Hamed, told the Institute for War and Peace Reporting that he also considered WikiLeaks important. Mr. M’Hamed said that after the uprising began, he used Google Translate to make rough, French-language translations of the cables and posted them on Facebook for Tunisians to read. According to the blogger, the cables were important because, “through WikiLeaks, international diplomats confirmed what ordinary Tunisians had suspected for a long time.”) While it is true that Tunisia’s government blocked a Lebanese Web site that published leaked cables last December, and activists like Mr. Amamou were aware of WikiLeaks, it is not at all clear that people like Mr. Bouazizi knew about the documents or the organization. In his talk last week in London, Mr. Assange referred to Mr. Bouazizi, incorrectly, as “a computer technician.” As my colleague Kareem Fahim reported from Sidi Bouzid, Mr. Bouazizi’s hometown, in January: He was not a college graduate, as earlier reports had said. He had been a vendor since he was a teenager, and had worked odd jobs since he was 10, his relatives said. … Mr. Bouazizi made it to high school, but it was unclear whether he graduated: a cousin said he devoured literature and especially poetry, but his mother said he preferred math.</text></article>

    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/business/media/04link.html?ref=mastercardinc">Speed Bumps on the Road to Virtual Cash<date>Published: July 3, 2011</date><text>MONEY is accumulated, traded and transferred online every day, but can there be a form of currency that exists only online and yet has real-world value? That is the premise of Bitcoin, an open-source virtual currency system that since 2009 has grown to a market worth more than $100 million. But the past few weeks have shown that a virtual currency can be just as vulnerable as the paper kind. Bitcoin accounts have been subject to hacking and theft; the currency itself experienced a bubble and a crash. And at least one group that was collecting donations in Bitcoins has decided against using them because of possible legal entanglements. Gavin Andresen, who is the lead developer of the open-source software that operates the currency, said in an interview from his home in Amherst, Mass.: “I expected it to have lots of speed bumps along the way — but I didn’t expect there to be so many speed bumps in a row.” There are several appeals to the idea of an online currency. The standard way to ensure the validity of online transactions, according to Jerry Brito, a technology expert at George Mason University, is “to have an intermediary to keep the ledger,” that is, a service like PayPal or a credit card company that takes a percentage of the transaction. A virtual currency would not need an intermediary. It would also make it harder for authorities to track transactions (particularly appealing for gambling sites or other quasi-legal activities). Bitcoin began as a kind of thought experiment. In 2009, an anonymous programmer published a paper proposing a virtual currency that would elegantly solve many of the problems surrounding currency that exists only on the Internet, including the main one, that the money would simply be copied like, say, music files, and plummet in value. Another part of the challenge was to create a currency without having to resort to a central bank to issue the currency and track the transactions. In other words, the transactions would be genuinely “peer-to-peer” rather than pass though a virtual bank. The solution of the Bitcoin programmer, who wrote under the name Satoshi Nakamoto, was to ensure that each “coin” was its own certificate of authenticity — that the coin, in essence, would be nothing more than that certificate. In the Bitcoin system, a new coin is produced whenever a computer can calculate an answer to a difficult problem, and then attaches that answer to a digital record of every transaction of every Bitcoin ever traded — a breathtakingly large amount of information to carry around in order to buy a pack of gum, but in a time when information can zip around the Internet, not too much to ask. Anyone would be free to create a new coin, within proscribed supply limits, by having a computer do the work needed to prove that it was in fact a valid Bitcoin. “The incentives are right, they are a check that everyone is following the rules,” said Mr. Andresen. “Early adopters want it to succeed, because they already own the currency. And if you generate Bitcoins no one thinks is valid, you have wasted a lot of computer time.” In fact, Bitcoin is a rarity for a currency in that it is neither a so-called fiat currency — one like dollars, which are valuable because the government says they are — nor is it a specie currency, one that gets its value because it can be converted into a precious metal like silver or gold. But why would a Bitcoin have value if it is only a stream of numbers, unsupported by government fiat or by some underlying asset? “Why does any tool have value?” Mr. Andresen asked. “It is valuable because it is useful.” Starting almost as soon as the coins were introduced, they have been traded for dollars at online exchanges, serving as a crude measure of the currency’s popularity and health (and also giving a market where owners can trade in Bitcoins for real dollars). After two years, there are seven million of these “coins” in circulation and the rate of increase — currently 50 coins are added every 10 minutes — will slow each year until the number tops out at 21 million coins around 2025. The coins, which trade for about $17 each at online exchanges, have a cumulative value of about $100 million. “I do think of it as the market cap of Bitcoin,” said Mr. Andresen. Today, a list of businesses that accept Bitcoin currency is a motley collection of companies on the fringe of the computer world, groups that conduct gambling or the like, and, notably, the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks, which accepts contributions in Bitcoins. You certainly can’t stock the pantry or furnish your home with Bitcoins. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/business/04gas.html?ref=mastercardinc">Gas Discounts Help Retailers Keep Parking Lots Full<date>Published: July 3, 2011</date><text>With gas prices locked at well above $3 a gallon, some retailers and manufacturers are trying to get more shoppers back on the road by picking up some costs at the pump.Publix, the grocery chain in the Southeast, is offering $50 gas cards for $40, with a minimum purchase of $25 in other products. Kellogg’s asks that shoppers send in 10 bar codes from cereals like Raisin Bran or Corn Flakes for a $10 gas card. At CVS, customers receive a $10 gas card when they spend $30 on certain items. Even shoppers at Wal-Mart, the country’s largest discount retailer, are gassing up at a savings. The company announced last week that in 18 states, shoppers could save 10 cents a gallon at Wal-Mart and Murphy gas stations if they paid with a Wal-Mart credit, gift or prepaid card. Though prices for food and clothing are also increasing, gas prices are having the most direct effect on shoppers’ behavior, retail analysts say. On weekdays, gas sales are down slightly from a year ago. But on weekends, when most people are not commuting and can choose how much to drive — and when retailers want their parking lots full — the declines are much larger, according to MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which issues a weekly gas index. “When you start to see weekend pumping taking a hit,” said Michael McNamara, the group’s vice president for research and analysis, “retailers want to do something to combat that.” The gas discounts resonate with many consumers, in part because gasoline is not an optional purchase for most people, who can often recite from memory — and with some agony — what their neighborhood gas station charges per gallon. “They view it as having an immediate positive effect on their wallet,” Mr. McNamara said of a gas discount. “That’s why so many retailers are turning to it.” The gas promotions recall the summer of 2008, when gas prices were above $4 a gallon. At that time, auto-dependent industries like tourism and car manufacturing started running gas-price deals. Chrysler offered guaranteed $2.99-a-gallon gas for three years to get people to buy cars, and Suzuki gave three months’ free gas, while hotel companies like Marriott also offered gas cards. With gas at about $3.62 on average in late June, according to SpendingPulse, those kinds of deals are also returning. Some Marriotts are bringing back the free-gas promotions, and tourist destinations and even casinos are giving discounts on gas, too. Last time, however, retailers generally did not get in on the discounts. The spike in prices came before the recession, and spending continued to be strong — even when gas prices peaked in July 2008, retailers’ sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. But now, with consumers feeling short on cash after the recession, high gas prices are keeping some of them from shopping as frequently. “The increase to gas prices,” Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, Charles M. Holley, said in a call with reporters in May, “certainly does hurt our core customer going to the store, and they’ll consolidate trips.” Even when the gas deals do not save shoppers that much money — the Wal-Mart promotion saves consumers about $1.60 per fillup for a 16-gallon tank — they can give them a psychological lift. Cheryl Moore, 35, a mother of three in Spokane, Wash., said that when gas increased to $3.88 a gallon at nearby stations, she cut back on shopping trips. While she used to shop every day for food and other staples, she now goes twice a week. “Now it’s like, well, wait a minute, let’s carpool; or, maybe we can wait another day and do everything in one day, because it’s just so stinking expensive,” she said. Ms. Moore uses lots of coupons. But she said that somehow saving $10 on gas, as the Kellogg’s promotion offers, for example, seemed much more appealing than saving the equivalent amount on groceries through coupons. “It’s right there in front of you, and I don’t have to do any of the other math,” said Ms. Moore, who has written about some of the gas-saving deals at The Frugal Life of a Mom. But though retailers are framing the gas discounts as an I-feel-your-pain response to shoppers’ concerns, some are either complicated to qualify for, or not that deep. At CVS, the qualifying items vary week to week and depend on the location; this week, Pampers and Pantene are among the included items in several cities. At the register, shoppers must use a loyalty card to get credit for the purchases. Wal-Mart’s deal is restricted to shoppers who have a Wal-Mart credit card, a Wal-Mart Money Card (a prepaid Visa or MasterCard) or a gift card. Those cards are not free — the money card costs $3 to issue, $3 to reload and $3 a month, while the Wal-Mart credit card has a 22.9 percent annual percentage rate, which is quite high. “These are fun, topical and varying degrees of clever,” Brad Wilson, founder of the deal-hunting site BradsDeals.com, said in an e-mail. “But not great deals.” Other stores offer deeper discounts. Stop &amp; Shop recently expanded its gas program, which lets shoppers accumulate points toward gas discounts with each dollar spent at the grocer, up to a $2.20 discount per gallon. Kroger, which also has a points-toward-gas program, in May adjusted the rules to reflect rising gas prices. Previously, it capped gas discounts at 10 cents a gallon in many markets; now, it lets shoppers accumulate points that give up to a dollar off per gallon at Kroger-owned gas stations in several states. “The increase in gas prices is taking a bigger chunk out of family’s wallets,” said Keith Dailey, a Kroger spokesman. “It’s a popular, and increasingly more popular, program.”</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/business/27views.html?ref=mastercardinc">Cheap Big Tech Stocks May Stay That Way - Breakingviews<date>Published: June 26, 2011</date><text> Microsoft, Apple and Google — worth more than $650 billion combined — seem to have plenty of growth left in the tank, but it is not evident in their stock valuations. The shares of all three tech giants, after accounting for their cash hoards, trade at a discount to the market. This phenomenon is not new. Investors shunned the sector for long stretches twice over the last 40 years, worrying that obsolescence might pre-empt expansion. Intel, for one, can vouch for the experience. In the mid-1970s, shares of the rapidly growing chip maker could have been bought for just six times earnings. Few tech investors seized the opportunity, however, because of a recent scarring. A few years earlier, upstart mainframe companies like Control Data had been all the rage. And I.B.M. and Xerox once boasted spots in the list of “nifty fifty” large caps, whose growth was supposed to continue steadily unabated. Those bubbles popped when computer orders slowed and economic hard times hit blue-chip corporations. By the early 1980s, investors had regained their zeal for growth stocks. Hewlett-Packard, with its hot-selling desktops, was bid up to 28 times expected earnings. Intel regained favor, too, and was valued at a heady 60 times. Meanwhile, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index was trading at a mere multiple of 12. Recession brought a fresh malaise at the end of that decade. Valuations on many smaller tech companies sank below even the cash on their books, according to Fred Hickey’s High Tech Strategist newsletter. More significant, growth companies suffered along with industry gorillas. Compaq, a leader in the sizzling PC market, was expanding its bottom line by more than 60 percent a year but traded at just nine times earnings, or about half the multiple of the broader market. It took another five years for tech stocks to rebound. So, while Microsoft, Apple and Google look cheap today, history suggests the discount could linger. Microsoft is at 7.5 times its cash-adjusted earnings expectations for 2011, Apple trades at 9.8 times and Google at 11.5 times — compared with 13 for the market. A willingness by investors to bid up unprofitable companies like LinkedIn and Pandora means they are not yet repulsed by the entire sector. As in earlier cycles, big tech stocks may need to wait until the day comes that they meaningfully climb again. Hulu Held Back Hulu, the online TV service, should be set free. The media titans NBC Universal, the Walt Disney Company and the News Corporation have given Hulu a good running start. But their ownership in the company creates conflicts that will retard its growth. An analogy can be found in banking, where Visa and MasterCard have flourished since being granted independence. An unsolicited approach for Hulu creates a perfect opportunity to find it a better home. Hulu has defied skeptics who doubted that old-school media companies could collaborate to create a successful service for a new generation of TV watchers. Hulu said last year it was profitable, and it expects to generate $500 million in revenue this year, mostly from advertising but also from its one million paying subscribers. But joint ventures have a knack for degenerating. Hulu already has shown signs of strain. Its two executive champions at the News Corporation and NBC are gone. Hulu’s chief executive, Jason Kilar, even went so far as to criticize the ways of his corporate overlords in a blog post in February. When Comcast, America’s biggest cable operator, bought NBC Universal, trustbusters stripped it of any say on how Hulu is run. Comcast is also aggressively pushing its own popular on-demand services and making it easier for subscribers to watch programs on mobile devices. What’s more, as networks seek higher fees from cable and satellite companies, Hulu’s presence is increasingly a sticky point in negotiations. Letting Hulu fly now could enable it to scale new heights. That was certainly the case for the two major credit card networks once they were cut loose by their financial institution masters. Since its initial public offering five years ago, shares of MasterCard have soared by 500 percent. And Visa’s annual operating income has nearly quadrupled since it went public in 2008. Under new ownership, Hulu will still be in thrall to the major media companies. Like Netflix and other sites, it must first pay for the programming. In the right hands, though, Hulu stands a better chance of becoming a fixture of the inevitable online video oligopoly.

    <article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/business/24discover.html?ref=mastercardinc">Discover Financial’s Profit Doubles<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>Discover Financial Services said on Thursday that quarterly profit more than doubled, beating expectations, as customers spent more on their credit cards and the company started to reap the benefits of its expansion beyond credit card lending.The company reduced its provision for loan losses in the quarter, while revenue grew 5 percent, to $1.74 billion. That better-than-expected growth contrasted with the lagging revenue reported earlier this year at the biggest United States lenders, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, which are to report second-quarter results next month. “It’s something that’s really outstanding in the financial space, to see that core performance improve. You can’t find a lot of financials that are seeing a lot of loan growth,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Lenders have struggled with weak consumer loan demand after the financial crisis, and Discover is trying to build up other businesses, including transaction processing and noncredit card lending. It bought a student lending platform from Citigroup in 2010, and last month it agreed to buy an online mortgage origination business from Tree.com. David W. Nelms, the chief executive, said that the company also planned to offer checking accounts eventually. Discover’s overall balance of loans increased 5 percent from a year earlier in the latest quarter, despite a 1 percent decline in credit card loans. Like American Express, Discover lends directly to consumers and also competes with the larger card networks Visa and MasterCard to process card transactions for banks. It reported profit of $600 million, or $1.09 a share, for the fiscal second quarter that ended May 31, compared with a year-earlier profit of $258 million, or 33 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The company’s shares rose 1.4 percent to $23.93.</text></article>

But why would a Bitcoin have value if it is only a stream of numbers, unsupported by government fiat or by some underlying asset? “Why does any tool have value?” Mr. Andresen asked. “It is valuable because it is useful.” Starting almost as soon as the coins were introduced, they have been traded for dollars at online exchanges, serving as a crude measure of the currency’s popularity and health (and also giving a market where owners can trade in Bitcoins for real dollars). After two years, there are seven million of these “coins” in circulation and the rate of increase — currently 50 coins are added every 10 minutes — will slow each year until the number tops out at 21 million coins around 2025. The coins, which trade for about $17 each at online exchanges, have a cumulative value of about $100 million. “I do think of it as the market cap of Bitcoin,” said Mr. Andresen. Today, a list of businesses that accept Bitcoin currency is a motley collection of companies on the fringe of the computer world, groups that conduct gambling or the like, and, notably, the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks, which accepts contributions in Bitcoins. You certainly can’t stock the pantry or furnish your home with Bitcoins. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/business/04gas.html?ref=mastercardinc">Gas Discounts Help Retailers Keep Parking Lots Full<date>Published: July 3, 2011</date><text>With gas prices locked at well above $3 a gallon, some retailers and manufacturers are trying to get more shoppers back on the road by picking up some costs at the pump.Publix, the grocery chain in the Southeast, is offering $50 gas cards for $40, with a minimum purchase of $25 in other products. Kellogg’s asks that shoppers send in 10 bar codes from cereals like Raisin Bran or Corn Flakes for a $10 gas card. At CVS, customers receive a $10 gas card when they spend $30 on certain items. Even shoppers at Wal-Mart, the country’s largest discount retailer, are gassing up at a savings. The company announced last week that in 18 states, shoppers could save 10 cents a gallon at Wal-Mart and Murphy gas stations if they paid with a Wal-Mart credit, gift or prepaid card. Though prices for food and clothing are also increasing, gas prices are having the most direct effect on shoppers’ behavior, retail analysts say. On weekdays, gas sales are down slightly from a year ago. But on weekends, when most people are not commuting and can choose how much to drive — and when retailers want their parking lots full — the declines are much larger, according to MasterCard Advisors Spending Pulse, which issues a weekly gas index. “When you start to see weekend pumping taking a hit,” said Michael McNamara, the group’s vice president for research and analysis, “retailers want to do something to combat that.” The gas discounts resonate with many consumers, in part because gasoline is not an optional purchase for most people, who can often recite from memory — and with some agony — what their neighborhood gas station charges per gallon. “They view it as having an immediate positive effect on their wallet,” Mr. McNamara said of a gas discount. “That’s why so many retailers are turning to it.” The gas promotions recall the summer of 2008, when gas prices were above $4 a gallon. At that time, auto-dependent industries like tourism and car manufacturing started running gas-price deals. Chrysler offered guaranteed $2.99-a-gallon gas for three years to get people to buy cars, and Suzuki gave three months’ free gas, while hotel companies like Marriott also offered gas cards. With gas at about $3.62 on average in late June, according to SpendingPulse, those kinds of deals are also returning. Some Marriotts are bringing back the free-gas promotions, and tourist destinations and even casinos are giving discounts on gas, too. Last time, however, retailers generally did not get in on the discounts. The spike in prices came before the recession, and spending continued to be strong — even when gas prices peaked in July 2008, retailers’ sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. But now, with consumers feeling short on cash after the recession, high gas prices are keeping some of them from shopping as frequently. “The increase to gas prices,” Wal-Mart’s chief financial officer, Charles M. Holley, said in a call with reporters in May, “certainly does hurt our core customer going to the store, and they’ll consolidate trips.” Even when the gas deals do not save shoppers that much money — the Wal-Mart promotion saves consumers about $1.60 per fillup for a 16-gallon tank — they can give them a psychological lift. Cheryl Moore, 35, a mother of three in Spokane, Wash., said that when gas increased to $3.88 a gallon at nearby stations, she cut back on shopping trips. While she used to shop every day for food and other staples, she now goes twice a week. “Now it’s like, well, wait a minute, let’s carpool; or, maybe we can wait another day and do everything in one day, because it’s just so stinking expensive,” she said. Ms. Moore uses lots of coupons. But she said that somehow saving $10 on gas, as the Kellogg’s promotion offers, for example, seemed much more appealing than saving the equivalent amount on groceries through coupons. “It’s right there in front of you, and I don’t have to do any of the other math,” said Ms. Moore, who has written about some of the gas-saving deals at The Frugal Life of a Mom. But though retailers are framing the gas discounts as an I-feel-your-pain response to shoppers’ concerns, some are either complicated to qualify for, or not that deep. At CVS, the qualifying items vary week to week and depend on the location; this week, Pampers and Pantene are among the included items in several cities. At the register, shoppers must use a loyalty card to get credit for the purchases. Wal-Mart’s deal is restricted to shoppers who have a Wal-Mart credit card, a Wal-Mart Money Card (a prepaid Visa or MasterCard) or a gift card. Those cards are not free — the money card costs $3 to issue, $3 to reload and $3 a month, while the Wal-Mart credit card has a 22.9 percent annual percentage rate, which is quite high. “These are fun, topical and varying degrees of clever,” Brad Wilson, founder of the deal-hunting site BradsDeals.com, said in an e-mail. “But not great deals.” Other stores offer deeper discounts. Stop &amp; Shop recently expanded its gas program, which lets shoppers accumulate points toward gas discounts with each dollar spent at the grocer, up to a $2.20 discount per gallon. Kroger, which also has a points-toward-gas program, in May adjusted the rules to reflect rising gas prices. Previously, it capped gas discounts at 10 cents a gallon in many markets; now, it lets shoppers accumulate points that give up to a dollar off per gallon at Kroger-owned gas stations in several states. “The increase in gas prices is taking a bigger chunk out of family’s wallets,” said Keith Dailey, a Kroger spokesman. “It’s a popular, and increasingly more popular, program.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/business/27views.html?ref=mastercardinc">Cheap Big Tech Stocks May Stay That Way - Breakingviews<date>Published: June 26, 2011</date><text> Microsoft, Apple and Google — worth more than $650 billion combined — seem to have plenty of growth left in the tank, but it is not evident in their stock valuations. The shares of all three tech giants, after accounting for their cash hoards, trade at a discount to the market. This phenomenon is not new. Investors shunned the sector for long stretches twice over the last 40 years, worrying that obsolescence might pre-empt expansion. Intel, for one, can vouch for the experience. In the mid-1970s, shares of the rapidly growing chip maker could have been bought for just six times earnings. Few tech investors seized the opportunity, however, because of a recent scarring. A few years earlier, upstart mainframe companies like Control Data had been all the rage. And I.B.M. and Xerox once boasted spots in the list of “nifty fifty” large caps, whose growth was supposed to continue steadily unabated. Those bubbles popped when computer orders slowed and economic hard times hit blue-chip corporations. By the early 1980s, investors had regained their zeal for growth stocks. Hewlett-Packard, with its hot-selling desktops, was bid up to 28 times expected earnings. Intel regained favor, too, and was valued at a heady 60 times. Meanwhile, the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index was trading at a mere multiple of 12. Recession brought a fresh malaise at the end of that decade. Valuations on many smaller tech companies sank below even the cash on their books, according to Fred Hickey’s High Tech Strategist newsletter. More significant, growth companies suffered along with industry gorillas. Compaq, a leader in the sizzling PC market, was expanding its bottom line by more than 60 percent a year but traded at just nine times earnings, or about half the multiple of the broader market. It took another five years for tech stocks to rebound. So, while Microsoft, Apple and Google look cheap today, history suggests the discount could linger. Microsoft is at 7.5 times its cash-adjusted earnings expectations for 2011, Apple trades at 9.8 times and Google at 11.5 times — compared with 13 for the market. A willingness by investors to bid up unprofitable companies like LinkedIn and Pandora means they are not yet repulsed by the entire sector. As in earlier cycles, big tech stocks may need to wait until the day comes that they meaningfully climb again. Hulu Held Back Hulu, the online TV service, should be set free. The media titans NBC Universal, the Walt Disney Company and the News Corporation have given Hulu a good running start. But their ownership in the company creates conflicts that will retard its growth. An analogy can be found in banking, where Visa and MasterCard have flourished since being granted independence. An unsolicited approach for Hulu creates a perfect opportunity to find it a better home. Hulu has defied skeptics who doubted that old-school media companies could collaborate to create a successful service for a new generation of TV watchers. Hulu said last year it was profitable, and it expects to generate $500 million in revenue this year, mostly from advertising but also from its one million paying subscribers. But joint ventures have a knack for degenerating. Hulu already has shown signs of strain. Its two executive champions at the News Corporation and NBC are gone. Hulu’s chief executive, Jason Kilar, even went so far as to criticize the ways of his corporate overlords in a blog post in February. When Comcast, America’s biggest cable operator, bought NBC Universal, trustbusters stripped it of any say on how Hulu is run. Comcast is also aggressively pushing its own popular on-demand services and making it easier for subscribers to watch programs on mobile devices. What’s more, as networks seek higher fees from cable and satellite companies, Hulu’s presence is increasingly a sticky point in negotiations. Letting Hulu fly now could enable it to scale new heights. That was certainly the case for the two major credit card networks once they were cut loose by their financial institution masters. Since its initial public offering five years ago, shares of MasterCard have soared by 500 percent. And Visa’s annual operating income has nearly quadrupled since it went public in 2008. Under new ownership, Hulu will still be in thrall to the major media companies. Like Netflix and other sites, it must first pay for the programming. In the right hands, though, Hulu stands a better chance of becoming a fixture of the inevitable online video oligopoly.

    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/business/24discover.html?ref=mastercardinc">Discover Financial’s Profit Doubles<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>Discover Financial Services said on Thursday that quarterly profit more than doubled, beating expectations, as customers spent more on their credit cards and the company started to reap the benefits of its expansion beyond credit card lending.The company reduced its provision for loan losses in the quarter, while revenue grew 5 percent, to $1.74 billion. That better-than-expected growth contrasted with the lagging revenue reported earlier this year at the biggest United States lenders, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, which are to report second-quarter results next month. “It’s something that’s really outstanding in the financial space, to see that core performance improve. You can’t find a lot of financials that are seeing a lot of loan growth,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Lenders have struggled with weak consumer loan demand after the financial crisis, and Discover is trying to build up other businesses, including transaction processing and noncredit card lending. It bought a student lending platform from Citigroup in 2010, and last month it agreed to buy an online mortgage origination business from Tree.com. David W. Nelms, the chief executive, said that the company also planned to offer checking accounts eventually. Discover’s overall balance of loans increased 5 percent from a year earlier in the latest quarter, despite a 1 percent decline in credit card loans. Like American Express, Discover lends directly to consumers and also competes with the larger card networks Visa and MasterCard to process card transactions for banks. It reported profit of $600 million, or $1.09 a share, for the fiscal second quarter that ended May 31, compared with a year-earlier profit of $258 million, or 33 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 75 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters. The company’s shares rose 1.4 percent to $23.93.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/technology/24hack.html?ref=mastercardinc">Arrest Puts Spotlight on Brazen Hacking Group LulzSec<date>Published: June 23, 2011</date><text>LONDON — As suspects go, Ryan Cleary did not look dangerous: a pale 19-year-old who looked five years younger, wearing a white skateboarding T-shirt and track pants, standing nervously in a courtroom here on Thursday.But charges by the British police link Mr. Cleary to a hacking group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which has been on an Internet crime spree in recent weeks, attacking Web sites and computer networks including those of the United States Senate, the Central Intelligence Agency and Sony. The British tabloids have been quick to cast Mr. Cleary as the young criminal mastermind behind LulzSec, calling him “Hack the Lad” in front-page headlines. His mother, Rita, has said her son is highly intelligent but has a history of mental illness, including agoraphobia. His lawyer, Ben Cooper, described Mr. Cleary as “a vulnerable young man.” Though it is not clear how much notoriety he deserves, Mr. Cleary’s arrest has made him a focus of the public fascination with a wave of computer hacking cases, carried out by amorphous online collectives. The police say Mr. Cleary is guilty of illegally using a computer to perform denial of service attacks — bombarding Web sites with so many automated messages that they shut down. They say his targets were organizations including the British Serious Organized Crime Agency. In the hierarchy of computer hacking, the accusations against Mr. Cleary and the actions of LulzSec fall broadly into the category known as hacktivism. Hackers of this type are not motivated by money, but are mainly interested in protesting against or antagonizing their targets, or in showing off technical skills. Hacktivists, according to computer security experts, are a different breed from mainstream cybercriminals, who seek financial gain. Such criminals, for example, manipulated Citigroup’s Web site to steal the personal information of credit card holders. The third category, experts say, are warriors, either working in the “cybercommands” of governments like those of the United States and other countries, or for mercenary or terrorist groups. They defend computer networks, power grids and state secrets of their own country, while devising tactics to attack enemies. Hacktivists tend to portray their activities as digital sit-ins, a form of protest. But security experts say their attacks often cause real damage to computer networks and financial losses. LulzSec has been more aggressive than most, and more brazen in its choice of targets. “This is organized criminal activity that is typically distributed across many different countries,” said Mark Rasch, a former prosecutor in the Justice Department, who is director of security for CSC, a computer services company. “It’s a serious crime.” On Thursday evening LulzSec released what it said were hundreds of internal documents from the Arizona Department of Public Safety, including material related to border patrol and counterterrorism operations. It said it was taking aim at the agency because of Arizona’s anti-immigrant policies. A Department of Public Safety spokesman, Capt. Steve Harrison, said the documents appeared to be authentic but were sensitive, not confidential. Hacking has been a pursuit of mischievous young men — and they are nearly all men — since shortly after computers were invented. But the Internet made it an increasingly international pursuit. The intruders quickly became power users of online bulletin boards and Internet chat software, using those tools to communicate and organize activities. “Hackers were among the first to figure out the benefits of social networking,” said Alan Brill, a senior managing director of Kroll, a security consulting firm. The far-flung hacker networks present a formidable challenge for law enforcement. But in recent years, they and prosecutors have more and more formed their own international networks of communication, sharing information across borders. Mr. Cleary’s arrest, for example, involved cooperation between Scotland Yard and the F.B.I. LulzSec, on a Twitter feed that it uses to communicate with more than 250,000 followers, has said that Mr. Cleary is “at best mildly associated with us.” The group did not respond to a Twitter message seeking comment for this article. LulzSec, experts say, is a splinter group from Anonymous, another online hacking collective. Anonymous is best known for its attacks last year in support of WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange. The group went after the Web sites of companies like MasterCard and PayPal, which had refused to process donations to WikiLeaks after it disclosed confidential diplomatic cables. Earlier this year, said Barrett Brown, a former Anonymous activist, “some of the most prominent leaders and hackers broke off and are now LulzSec.” The two hacker groups certainly strike different poses. LulzSec’s statements and its actions display a spirit of exuberant anarchic glee. Lulz, in essence, means mean-spirited laughter, and LulzSec’s Web site describes the group as “a small team of lulzy individuals who feel the drabness of the cybercommunity is a burden on what matters: fun.” The group is strongly antagonistic to the media. When a TV journalist for Russia Today asked for an interview, she was told it would be granted only if she and her producer wore shoes on their heads and wrestled in mud while singing. They declined. There seems to be far less glee in the Anonymous culture. In a YouTube video describing the group, a voice intones: “There is no control, no leadership, only influence. The influence of thought.” Later, the video adds that Anonymous’s actions have “brought justice to our world.” LulzSec’s exploits have riled others in the hacker world who object to its activities, particularly exposure of personal information of innocent Internet users. Those people are now working to stop LulzSec by investigating its members’ identities and providing information to the F.B.I. The core LulzSec group, according to Mr. Brown, the former Anonymous activist, numbers between five and 10. Mr. Brown said the members he had dealt with — known by online nicknames like Topiary and Sabu — are mostly men in their early 20s. Mr. Brown said he had dealt with Mr. Cleary, and that he believed — contrary to LulzSec’s statement — that he was involved with the group. But a person involved with Anonymous, who declined to be named for fear of prosecution, said Mr. Cleary was peripheral. On Thursday the court agreed to delay Mr. Cleary’s application for bail while police investigated. Hacker networks and their activities are murky by design, said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer of the British company BT Group. LulzSec, Mr. Schneier said, “is a badge, a name you call each other if you’re one of the cool hacker kids now.” Riva Richmond contributed from New York.</text></article>

Chip Cards for Travelers<date>June 20, 2011, 4:18 pm</date><text>U.S. Bank is joining the small-but-growing ranks of American financial institutions offering credit cards with tiny, secure microprocessing chips that are widely used overseas. But U.S. Bank’s card, aiming for maximum flexibility, uses technology that lets the card work with three different payment systems. The bank, the main banking unit of Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp, says its FlexPerks Travel Rewards Visa card offers the embedded E.M.V. (for Europay, Mastercard and Visa) chips, which are becoming prevalent in Europe, as well as the older magnetic stripe technology, which is still dominant in the United States. The U.S. Bank card also can be used in “contactless” payment systems available at some locations in the United States. These systems let the customer wave the card at a payment terminal to make a purchase, rather than sliding it through a reader at checkout. That’s a lot of technology sitting in a little plastic rectangle. The bank says that will allow its customers to have the “best experience possible wherever they go.” “While we believe E.M.V. is important for our international travel cardholders, we are committed to driving contactless mobile payments in the United States,” said Cliff Cook, chief marketing officer for the bank’s retail payments unit, in a press release. Roughly 20,000 FlexPerks Visa cardholders will get the new cards this month. The bank plans to expand the card to other travel reward cardholders in the coming year. E.M.V. technology is considered more secure than magnetic stripes and is widely used in Europe. Some American cardholders have had trouble using their magnetic stripe cards abroad, particularly at unattended kiosks used to sell train tickets and the like, as this Practical Traveler column discussed. The cards have been slow to catch on in the United States, in part because of the expense merchants will incur to install new, compatible card readers at their registers. Recently, some big banks—Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase—as well as some smaller credit unions have introduced cards with E.M.V chips for customers who travel internationally. Chase has said it will expand its E.M.V. offerings in the coming months, and on Monday it introduced a second E.M.V. card, JPMorgan Select Visa Signature® card. Unlike some versions of E.M.V. cards, which require a PIN, Chase’s smart-chip cards use a signature, but you don’t have to sign at unmanned kiosks, according to the bank.</text></article>

But American Express is coming out with a reloadable prepaid card on Tuesday that appears to right many of the industry's wrongs: You can order the reloadable card online at no cost, and there are no hidden fees lurking in the fine print. And even more impressively, you can use the card overseas and you won't be charged any of the pesky foreign exchange transaction fees that most American Express credit and charge cards usually hit you with. ''The prepaid market is synonymous with fees,'' said Dan Schulman, president of the company's enterprise growth group. ''If we were going to enter the market, we wanted to be a consumer champion.'' Of course, Amex isn't forgoing profits for the sake of consumers. The company can afford to be competitive because it owns the payment network that process its transactions. So instead of collecting fees from consumers, it makes money on the fees that it collects from retailers every time you swipe your card. Keep in mind that American Express levies higher swipe fees than Visa and MasterCard, so its cards are not as widely accepted for that reason. Starting today, you can order the card online at no cost and load money onto the card through a checking account (but not through a credit card). You can also reload the card online at no cost, as well as set up recurring transactions so that your funds are replenished every week or month, for example. In coming months, customers will also be able to load the cards with money via direct deposit, Mr. Schulman said. You could automatically add, say, $100 per pay check to the card. But it will cost you $4.95 if you want to load the card with cash. It also takes some doing. Here's how it would work, at least for now: You can order the prepaid card online for free and then buy what's known as a ''Green Dot MoneyPak'' at major retailers like Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid and 7-Eleven. You would pick up the MoneyPak from the prepaid section and take it to the cashier, who would then load the amount you want onto the MoneyPak (you can typically load $25 to $500 at most retailers) and charge you the $4.95 fee. One you have the loaded MoneyPak in hand, you would either go to MoneyPak.com or call 1-800-GreenDot to transfer the money to the Amex prepaid card. American Express doesn't charge any fees to load the card with a MoneyPak, and it will refund the $4.95 fee on the first MoneyPak you purchase. The prepaid card will be likely available in retail stores later this year for those who don't want to buy it online. Typically, those retailers charge a nominal fee, also in the neighborhood of $4.95, to provide the cards; Mr. Schulman said he'd like to keep that charge as low as possible. But it's still too soon to say how much, if anything, it will cost to load the card. ''You have a lot of folks who don't have access to credit or charge cards and they want to have the safety of having the card,'' Mr. Schulman said. ''They want to be able to make online transactions and they want a budgetary tool.'' Some more particulars: The card has no activation or maintenance fees, nor are there any fees to make purchases, balance inquiries, or to replace a card. The funds on the card do not expire, and you can load up to $2,500 on the card. If the car is lost or stolen, the money on the card will be replaced if you report it to the company. The first monthly A.T.M. withdrawal is free, after which you'll be charged $2 (that doesn't include any fees charged by the bank or ATM network). Users also have the option to disable ATM access. Some perks: You can add additional users to the card, like a family member or babysitter, for instance. You can also see your transaction history online or receive e-mail or text alerts for low funds or notification when a transaction has occurred. Like a regular Amex card, your purchases are protected against accidental damage or theft for 90 days from the date of purchase, up to $1,000 per occurrence. And though there's been a recent uptick in credit cards that have stopped chargingtransaction fees on purchases denominated in currencies other than dollars, most cards still charge them. You'll avoid those charges on the Amex prepaid card; dollars are converted at the same rate as if you used a regular American Express credit or charge card, but you won't be charged the 2.7 percent fee that typically accompanies those transactions. Would you use the new prepaid card? If anyone decides to order the card, please let us know what your experience was like in the comment section below.

Travelers staying at any of 13 Marriott properties in Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Utah through Sept. 6 receive a $25 gas card per night and breakfast for two. Participating hotels include Residence Inn in Santa Fe and Courtyard in Boulder. Visit marriott.com for more details. The Holiday Inn Club Vacations Resort in Orlando, Fla., gives guests who stay a minimum of three nights a $100 gas card on check-in, which can be used at BP stations, and a room upgrade. Located next to Disney World, it has 2,478 apartment style rooms with full kitchens. Stays must be completed before Aug. 25 and booked through hiclubvacations.com. Nightly rates start at $184. And, the InterContinental Hotel Group is rewarding guests with a $75 MasterCard, which can be used toward gas or at any retailer that accepts MasterCard: anyone booking a room at ihg.com/get75 for two consecutive weekend nights, for travel up to Aug. 31, gets the card within six to eight weeks of the stay, and travelers can book up to four separate weekends to get a $300 card. The Intercontinental group has 4,500 hotels globally and includes Intercontinental Hotels, Crowne Plaza and the Venetian in Las Vegas.</text></article>

But it’s still too soon to say how much, if anything, it will cost to load the card. “You have a lot of folks who don’t have access to credit or charge cards and they want to have the safety of having the card,” Mr. Schulman said. “They want to be able to make online transactions and they want a budgetary tool.” Some more particulars: The card has no activation or maintenance fees, nor are there any fees to make purchases, balance inquiries, or to replace a card. The funds on the card do not expire, and you can load up to $2,500 on the card. If the car is lost or stolen, the money on the card will be replaced if you report it to the company. The first monthly A.T.M. withdrawal is free, after which you’ll be charged $2 (that doesn’t include any fees charged by the bank or ATM network). Users also have the option to disable ATM access. Some perks: You can add additional users to the card, like a family member or babysitter, for instance. You can also see your transaction history online or receive e-mail or text alerts for low funds or notification when a transaction has occurred. Like a regular Amex card, your purchases are protected against accidental damage or theft for 90 days from the date of purchase, up to $1,000 per occurrence. And though there’s been a recent uptick in credit cards that have stopped charging transaction fees on purchases denominated in currencies other than dollars, most cards still charge them. You’ll avoid those charges on the Amex prepaid card; dollars are converted at the same rate as if you used a regular American Express credit or charge card, but you won’t be charged the 2.7 percent fee that typically accompanies those transactions. Would you use the new prepaid card? If anyone decides to order the card, please let us know what your experience was like in the comment section below.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/business/09debit.html?ref=mastercardinc">Senate Votes Against Delay of Debit Card Fee Limits<date>Published: June 8, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — The Senate refused Wednesday to delay new rules that would sharply cut the fees that banks can charge retailers to process debit card transactions.The debit card rules were a major part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law passed last year. The Senate vote was one of the strongest challenges so far to the new law. Although 54 senators voted in favor of the delay, the measure failed to garner the 60 votes that were required for it to pass under Senate rules. Forty-five senators voted against the measure, which was sponsored by Senator Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who is facing a tough re-election battle next year, and Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. Even with the defeat, the vote showed the results of a remarkable come-from-behind lobbying campaign by banks to recover from the anti-Wall Street drubbing they took during last year’s debate over financial regulation. The debit card measure, sponsored by Senator Richard J. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, passed last year by a two-to-one ratio after little debate and no hearings. The Wednesday vote, which followed a vigorous floor debate, was a victory for retailers, who have complained that banks and the companies that control the largest debit card networks, Visa and MasterCard, have consistently raised the fees on debit card transactions even as the market has grown rapidly and technology costs have declined. Those fees topped $20 billion last year, according to industry reports. The Federal Reserve, as guided by the new law, had proposed rules that would cut the average debit card processing fee to 7 to 12 cents per transaction, from 44 cents currently. Though Congress exempted small banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the new limits, banking regulators warned that such a two-tiered fee system among banks would not be competitive. Opponents of the delay said that all but 100 banks and three credit unions would be exempt from the fee restrictions. The new regulations are scheduled to take effect by July 21, and the Federal Reserve, which received more than 11,000 comments on its proposals, has said that it intends to meet the deadline. The vote also provided a victory for Senator Durbin, who managed to keep his debit-fee measure intact despite a switch by 12 senators from supporting him last year to now voting to delay the debit fee caps. Nine Democrats and three Republicans changed their votes, including both New York senators, whose constituency includes Wall Street and major banks. Mr. Durbin said that a delay of the debit rules would have kept fees at current levels and given banks “a windfall of profit that they do not deserve.” By coming close to victory, banks are likely to be emboldened to fight other regulations being drawn under the Dodd-Frank bill. Those include rules that would subject derivatives to increased margin requirements and force derivative trades through a central exchange. Bankers and business lobbies are also opposed to the structure of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is scheduled to take over regulation of mortgages and other consumer-related areas from other banking regulators. “This shows the banking industry has mounted a very effective fight,” Bill Allison, editorial director for the Sunlight Foundation in Washington, which monitors lobbying activity, said in an interview. Both sides sought to portray the fight as pitting big, well-financed interests against small-town retailers or banks. Bank lobbyists said that the rule would most harm small community banks and credit unions, while benefiting giant retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot that account for most of the nation’s debit card transactions. Similarly, a coalition of retailers framed the debate as pitting the giant banks that issue the most debit cards — JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo — against mom-and-pop retailers that were trying to scrape by on meager profit margins. There were elements of truth to both arguments. Home Depot executives, for example, told financial analysts on a conference call this year that a cap on debit fees could save the company $35 million a year. Banks, in a flurry of ads in subway cars and on television, portrayed the debit fee reduction as a $12 billion gift to retailers. “Bureaucrats want to take away your debit card!” read a print ad that tried to argue that the fee cuts would make debit cards so unprofitable that smaller banks and credit unions would either charge for debit cards or raise fees on checking accounts or other consumer services to make up the loss. Similarly, independent business owners testified before Congress that debit fees had sharply raised their costs.  The Federal Reserve had already missed an April deadline to complete the debit card rules, and lobbyists on both sides of the issue said that Fed officials expressed a desire for Congress to take the issue out of their hands. Though the major card companies said they would work to put a system in place that allowed for two tiers of charges — one for big banks subject to the limits and another for smaller banks that were exempt — the top banking regulators at the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation each expressed doubts that such a system would work, because market forces would guide transactions to the lower-cost option. “It’s going to affect the revenues of the small issuers,” Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Senate committee last month, “and it could result in some smaller banks being less profitable or even failing.” The Sunlight Foundation said in an April report that 24 lobbying firms had been hired last year to influence action on the debit card rules. Eighteen of those firms were registered as representatives of the two major debit card networks, Visa and MasterCard. A large portion of those lobbyists have gone through the revolving door between government and industry:  68 of the 79 people who registered as lobbyists for Visa or MasterCard previously worked in government, according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. Among the most prominent who worked to influence votes on the debit card measure were Richard A. Gephardt, the former House majority leader and a Democrat, who represented Visa. The retailers had Don Nickles, the former Republican senator from Oklahoma, in their corner.</text></article>

While information concerning customers’ names, credit card numbers, addresses and e-mail addresses was exposed, the bank said that data like the “Social Security number, date of birth, card expiration date and card security code were not compromised.” Citi is notifying cardholders who have been affected via mail, as well as via their online accounts. Most customers will also receive a replacement card, the company said. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink “Citi has implemented enhanced procedures to prevent a recurrence of this type of event,” the bank said. “For the security of these customers, we are not disclosing further details.” While no group has claimed responsibility for the breach, it is part of a spate of recent cyberattacks. Sony has reported a series of assaults on its PlayStation network and several Sony Web sites — one hacker site says there have been 18 so far — after the company sued, and then settled with, a programmer who had cracked the PlayStation code. Other attacks have hit PBS, Fox and an F.B.I. affiliate known as Infragard. And most worrying of all, perhaps, they compromised the security system of RSA, maker of the popular SecurID. But none of those breaches appears to pose as direct a threat to consumers as the one reported by Citi. A spokesman for the bank said that only credit card customers had been affected, not debit card holders, and that law enforcement had been alerted. The Financial Times earlier reported the breach. Two people associated with the hacker collective Anonymous said they did not believe the group was involved. “Anonymous kind of moved off the banks,” one said, adding that it was “because they were bored.” Anonymous has become known for prominent denial-of-service attacks that disable and deface the Web sites of companies the hackers dislike; for example, the group disrupted service at Visa and MasterCard after they stopped allowing donations to WikiLeaks. “For-profit attacks are always foreign,” one of the people said. “I’ve never heard of an American group doing that. You can deface a Web site, but once you start stealing money … we understand the FBI. They can kick your door down for downloading torrents.” Citigroup was reported to have been breached by hackers tied to a Russian group in 2009, and before that in 1995. One of the members of Anonymous questioned Citigroup’s security as the bank described it on its Citi Card site, saying the 128-bit encryption the bank boasts of is “really not that big a deal.” “Two-hundred-and-fifty-six bit would take someone a lifetime to decrypt,” the person said. “The security is so weak right now, if you know a couple attacks, you can just go around and see what works.”</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/29/opinion/29sun3.html?ref=mastercardinc">Spammers and Their Bankers<date>Published: May 28, 2011</date><text>In early 2004 Bill Gates claimed that “two years from now, spam will be solved.” Today it amounts to 70 percent of all e-mail. Yet there may be a chance to cut it back. In March, spam volumes tumbled as United States marshals seized computers at Internet hosting facilities that controlled Rustock, a huge spamming network. The seizure followed a lawsuit by Microsoft against Rustock’s operators for violating its trademarks with spam that fraudulently claimed a Microsoft link. Spam volumes had already been declining sharply, as smaller networks were taken down. According to Symantec, an Internet security company, spammers were sending an average of 180 billion messages a day last August. On Wednesday, they were down to 39.4 billion. It is too early to declare victory. Symantec detected a small spam rebound in May. Tracking down and seizing computers is not easy — even if there is a clear legal basis. We still do not know who operated Rustock. Entities from as far away as Azerbaijan leased computers from hosting firms around the United States. These controlled a million “zombie computers,” which unbeknownst to their owners sent thousands of spam messages a day. The good news is there may be other ways to disrupt spammers. The Times’s John Markoff reported that computer scientists at two University of California campuses have found another vulnerability: spammers’ banks. To track the flow of information, the researchers made hundreds of purchases. Buying Viagra from the Pharmacy Express group in Russia involved computers in Brazil, China and Turkey. The Viagra came from India. But 95 percent of the purchases were handled by three banks — in Azerbaijan, Latvia and St. Kitts and Nevis. This suggests that if banks or credit card companies refused to settle payments for some transactions with these banks, they could deliver a blow to the spam economy. After Congress moved to suppress online gambling, Visa and Mastercard blocked payments for American players. Similarly, Congress might require them to block, say, card-not-present pharmaceutical purchases on the grounds that it is illegal for individuals to import drugs. Though spammers might be able to change banks, the process would be cumbersome. The concentration of business in three banks suggests there aren’t that many willing to deal with spammers. It’s certainly worth pursuing.</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/technology/27google.html?ref=mastercardinc">Google Unveils Wireless Payment System<date>Published: May 26, 2011</date><text>Google is among the first out of the gate in the attempt to make leather wallets go the way of the typewriter.On Thursday, the technology giant introduced Google Wallet, a mobile application that will allow consumers to wave their cellphones at a retailer’s terminal to make a payment instead of using a credit card. The app, for the Android operating system, will also enable users to redeem special coupons and earn loyalty points. Starting this summer, the wallet will be available on the Nexus S 4G phone on Sprint and able to hold certain MasterCards issued by Citibank. It will also hold a virtual Google Prepaid MasterCard. The mobile wallet will work at any of the 124,000 merchants that accept MasterCard’s PayPass terminals, which take contactless payments, and more than 300,000 merchants outside the United States. The wallet is powered by a technology called near-field communications, which is incorporated into a chip in mobile phones and sends a message to the merchants’ terminals. “Eventually, you will be able to put everything in your wallet,” Stephanie Tilenius, vice president for commerce at Google, said at a news conference. That grand vision will take a while to come to fruition. Various players have been working on mobile wallets for years, but they have not gained traction because the companies have not been able to agree on how they would be paid or who would control the wallets. Cellular carriers, banks, credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies all have a stake in this battle. With its wallet, Google plans to make money by offering consumers promotions as they shop. For instance, it plans to introduce “Google Offers” — advertising deals from local and online businesses that can be found online or sent through the phone. Like Groupon, Google will collect a fee from participating retailers every time a person redeems a coupon. Citibank will collect the same fees as it would in a traditional credit card transaction. Google Wallet will need some time to become fully functional nationwide. While Google has worked with more than 15 retailers, like American Eagle Outfitters, Bloomingdale’s, the Container Store and Jamba Juice, they all need to upgrade their payment terminals. When they do, consumers will also be able to store and redeem deals with the wallet. Merchants in New York and San Francisco are expected to be ready this summer. Once the retailers’ technology is in place, consumers will be able to wave their phone at the checkout counter and, in one swoop, discounts will be applied, loyalty points will be awarded and payments made. Someday, Google said, when consumers enter the store, their phones may serve up a list of items they recently bought, and offer them related discounts. The wallet app itself will require a PIN, as will each transaction. The payment credentials will be encrypted and stored on a chip inside the phone. Google emphasized that the wallet would be open to all businesses and invited other banks, credit card issuers, payment networks, mobile carriers and merchants to work with it. “I expect that other payment networks and other banks will join this effort, though in some cases it will be a hedge strategy they employ along with their own mobile payment initiatives,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Since these payments utilize the same underlying business model as cards today, there is not significant disruption risk for these players.” Google is also working with First Data, which processes payments and will ensure the security of the transaction. If the phone was stolen, the credit cards inside could be remotely disabled. Consumers would have the same “zero liability” for unauthorized transactions made with their phones as they would with plastic cards. Separately, PayPal filed a suit on Thursday against Google and two of its former executives who are now at Google, including Ms. Tilenius. The suit claims that they misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-payment business. A Google spokesman declined to comment because he said they have not yet received a copy of the complaint. Eventually, Google said, its wallet may be able to hold much more, including car keys and airline boarding passes. But access to such items will still require a fully charged phone. If the phone battery dies, even Ms. Tilenius of Google conceded, “I think you need to use your plastic at that point.”</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/technology/25mobile.html?ref=mastercardinc">Google Is Said to Have a Wireless Payment System<date>Published: May 24, 2011</date><text>Google is expected to introduce on Thursday a mobile payment system that will let shoppers wave their phones to pay instead of pulling out a credit card, according to people briefed on the announcement. Google will offer mobile payments with MasterCard and Citibank, according to one of the people, as well as with cellphone carriers, hardware manufacturers and retailers.  Initially, the mobile wallets will be available only on Google’s Nexus S phone and will use a Citibank-issued MasterCard credit card number and a virtual Google MasterCard prepaid card. Consumers will be able to make payments at any of the 124,000 merchants that have MasterCard’s PayPass terminals, which accept contactless payments, a person briefed on the deal said. The people familiar with the deal were not authorized to speak until the deal was publicly announced. The news of the announcement was first reported by Bloomberg News. The three companies have also teamed up with a few retailers — Macy’s, American Eagle Outfitters and Subway, a person familiar with the deal said. After these retailers upgrade their terminals — at first, only retailers in New York and San Francisco will participate — consumers will also be able to redeem discounts and participate in loyalty programs. While several companies have been working on mobile wallets for years, they have not yet been widely adopted because all of those involved need to agree on how the wallets will take shape and how the various stakeholders will get paid. Mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers payment networks and technology companies have been battling over their roles. “Google is dipping their toe into the water and it will accelerate other efforts from other providers,” said Rick Oglesby, a senior analyst at the Aite Group, a research and advisory firm focused on the financial services industry. Google plans to use a technology called near-field communication, or N.F.C., which is incorporated into a chip in mobile phones to make payments, redeem coupons, earn loyalty points and receive special offers. When a phone is waved in front of a credit card reader, it wirelessly sends an encrypted signal with a person’s credit card information. After that, the transaction is processed like a normal credit card transaction at a store.  Google’s announcement has been expected since it introduced the latest version of its Android mobile phone software, which has the capacity for N.F.C., and its Nexus S phone, which includes an N.F.C. chip.  Representatives for Google, MasterCard, Citigroup and Sprint, a carrier for Google’s Nexus phones, declined to comment. </text></article>

Like Groupon, Google will collect a fee from participating retailers every time a person redeems a coupon. Citibank will collect the same fees as it would in a traditional credit card transaction. Google Wallet will need some time to become fully functional nationwide. While Google has worked with more than 15 retailers, like American Eagle Outfitters, Bloomingdale’s, the Container Store and Jamba Juice, they all need to upgrade their payment terminals. When they do, consumers will also be able to store and redeem deals with the wallet. Merchants in New York and San Francisco are expected to be ready this summer. Once the retailers’ technology is in place, consumers will be able to wave their phone at the checkout counter and, in one swoop, discounts will be applied, loyalty points will be awarded and payments made. Someday, Google said, when consumers enter the store, their phones may serve up a list of items they recently bought, and offer them related discounts. The wallet app itself will require a PIN, as will each transaction. The payment credentials will be encrypted and stored on a chip inside the phone. Google emphasized that the wallet would be open to all businesses and invited other banks, credit card issuers, payment networks, mobile carriers and merchants to work with it. “I expect that other payment networks and other banks will join this effort, though in some cases it will be a hedge strategy they employ along with their own mobile payment initiatives,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. “Since these payments utilize the same underlying business model as cards today, there is not significant disruption risk for these players.” Google is also working with First Data, which processes payments and will ensure the security of the transaction. If the phone was stolen, the credit cards inside could be remotely disabled. Consumers would have the same “zero liability” for unauthorized transactions made with their phones as they would with plastic cards. Separately, PayPal filed a suit on Thursday against Google and two of its former executives who are now at Google, including Ms. Tilenius. The suit claims that they misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-payment business. A Google spokesman declined to comment because he said they have not yet received a copy of the complaint. Eventually, Google said, its wallet may be able to hold much more, including car keys and airline boarding passes. But access to such items will still require a fully charged phone. If the phone battery dies, even Ms. Tilenius of Google conceded, “I think you need to use your plastic at that point.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/25/technology/25mobile.html?ref=mastercardinc">Google Is Said to Have a Wireless Payment System<date>Published: May 24, 2011</date><text>Google is expected to introduce on Thursday a mobile payment system that will let shoppers wave their phones to pay instead of pulling out a credit card, according to people briefed on the announcement. Google will offer mobile payments with MasterCard and Citibank, according to one of the people, as well as with cellphone carriers, hardware manufacturers and retailers.  Initially, the mobile wallets will be available only on Google’s Nexus S phone and will use a Citibank-issued MasterCard credit card number and a virtual Google MasterCard prepaid card. Consumers will be able to make payments at any of the 124,000 merchants that have MasterCard’s PayPass terminals, which accept contactless payments, a person briefed on the deal said. The people familiar with the deal were not authorized to speak until the deal was publicly announced. The news of the announcement was first reported by Bloomberg News. The three companies have also teamed up with a few retailers — Macy’s, American Eagle Outfitters and Subway, a person familiar with the deal said. After these retailers upgrade their terminals — at first, only retailers in New York and San Francisco will participate — consumers will also be able to redeem discounts and participate in loyalty programs. While several companies have been working on mobile wallets for years, they have not yet been widely adopted because all of those involved need to agree on how the wallets will take shape and how the various stakeholders will get paid. Mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers payment networks and technology companies have been battling over their roles. “Google is dipping their toe into the water and it will accelerate other efforts from other providers,” said Rick Oglesby, a senior analyst at the Aite Group, a research and advisory firm focused on the financial services industry. Google plans to use a technology called near-field communication, or N.F.C., which is incorporated into a chip in mobile phones to make payments, redeem coupons, earn loyalty points and receive special offers. When a phone is waved in front of a credit card reader, it wirelessly sends an encrypted signal with a person’s credit card information. After that, the transaction is processed like a normal credit card transaction at a store.  Google’s announcement has been expected since it introduced the latest version of its Android mobile phone software, which has the capacity for N.F.C., and its Nexus S phone, which includes an N.F.C. chip.  Representatives for Google, MasterCard, Citigroup and Sprint, a carrier for Google’s Nexus phones, declined to comment. </text></article>

(With fuel prices rising, that might not be happening as often, but it still occurs.) Airlines typically offer credits or vouchers for the difference in price when that happens, although most of them mute the benefit by imposing a hefty change fee when you try to claim the credit. But a lot of consumers don't realize they may be eligible for a credit, or don't act fast enough to claim it. The flier first has to know the fare has dropped, and then must call the airline in time to request the credit before the price goes up again. For that reason, a lot of travelers don't take advantage of the credit. A recent survey by MasterCard found that 71 percent of people searching for airfares weren't aware of the availability of such credits and that 10 percent knew they existed but didn't know how to take advantage of them. So MasterCard has teamed with the travel site Yapta to offer a service aimed at making it easier for travelers to claim the credit. Called MasterCard PriceAssure, it works like this: You go to the service's Web site and enroll your MasterCard. Then, you use your card to buy your ticket directly from an airline and elect to have PriceAssure track your itinerary. (The service is available on major carriers including Delta, American, United and JetBlue. It's not available for flights booked through a travel agent or a third-party Web site.) If the price drops before your flight departs and you're eligible for a credit, you get an e-mail telling you so. (Yapta offers this level of service free for fliers, regardless of what credit card you pay with, by tracking your confirmation number.) At that point you have two options. You can call the airline's customer service line yourself, and pay no charge. Or, for a fee - $19.95 per itinerary, regardless of the number of people traveling - you can have MasterCard's PriceAssure do the work for you and notify you of the credit. Registering and having your fare tracked is free; you pay the fee only if you're eligible for a credit and you have MasterCard arrange for it. There's a couple of big caveats, though - mostly because of the big airlines' practice of charging a change fee even if you're not switching your itinerary. Such fees are as much as $150 for domestic flights on Delta, United and US Airways. American uses a variable change-fee structure that can go as high as $250 for domestic flights and up to $500 for international flights. So the drop in the fare needs to be significant - at least $169.95 for a domestic ticket, if you add in the PriceAssure fee, for you to actually claim a credit on the pricier airlines. Other airlines' fees are lower ($100 for Virgin America; $75 on AirTran), so the change in fare needn't be as drastic for you to qualify. JetBlue does not charge a change fee if you're only claiming a lower fare, so you may be more likely to actually collect a credit on their flights. Here's an example from the PriceAssure Web site: You paid: $580.80 New Fare: $316.40 Difference: $264.40 Less change fee plus Price Assure fee: $150 plus $19.95 = $169.95 Your credit: $94.45 In a trial run of the service, the average savings for those who qualified for a credit was $140. According to Yapta, the average flight has 21 price changes over a 45-day tracking period. The credit is good for future travel on that same airline - you don't get an actual refund on your MasterCard billing statement (unless you bought a refundable ticket; those fares are generally refunded to the card you used to pay). Practices vary by airline, but most carriers send an e-mail to fliers to document the credit. Generally, credits must be used within a year. The main benefit of the service, a Yapta spokesman said in an e-mail, is it lets you avoid the ''long and cumbersome'' process of calling airline customer service to arrange for the credit. Have you ever claimed a credit for an airfare that rose after you purchased a ticket? Do you think this new service is worth the fee? This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/business/18gasoline.html?ref=mastercardinc">In Consumer Behavior, Signs of Gas Price Pinch<date>Published: May 17, 2011</date><text>High gasoline prices have not derailed the economic recovery, but that’s small comfort to Loraine Greene. A customer relations manager in the Hudson Valley of New York, Ms. Greene spent the weekend packing up to move to a rental house much closer to work.At $4 a gallon, gas is too expensive to justify the 50-mile round-trip commute. “The option was either to sell my truck and get something smaller, or to try to get closer to work,” said Ms. Greene. She chose to move. The new house is just eight miles from the office. Economists say steady job growth over the last three months, as well as this year’s federal payroll tax cut, have offset the downward pull of rising energy costs on the economy as a whole. But like a lot of economic news these days, what looks good on paper does not feel good for Americans still digging their way out of the recent recession. At a True Value hardware store in Wilmington, Del., customers stressed by the cost of filling their tanks are buying more replacement parts for wheelbarrows and lawn mowers instead of buying new equipment. In the San Francisco Bay area, the daily number of cars driving across the Golden Gate Bridge has dropped while passengers on the buses and ferries have risen. “If all your customers are paying $50 for a tank of gas that they used to pay $25 for, somebody is not getting that $25,” said William Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business. According to a recent survey, one in four small businesses cited weak sales as their No. 1 problem. Although gas prices have eased slightly in recent weeks, they are, on average, up about 30 percent over a year earlier. High oil prices have also driven up prices of food, airfares and even taxi rides in some regions, diverting consumers from other purchases. The nation’s largest retailer, Wal-Mart, which reported earnings on Tuesday, said high gas prices had restrained its shoppers, and its business. Sales at stores open at least a year fell by 1.1 percent in the first quarter, as visits to stores in the United States declined. “Our customers are consolidating trips due to higher gas prices,” said Bill Simon, who oversees the United States business. It was the eighth consecutive decline in same-store sales at Wal-Mart. Lowe’s, the home improvement chain, which reported a 5.7 percent slide in quarterly profits on Monday, said its traffic was down 3.4 percent in the quarter as customers made fewer trips. “Rising gas and energy prices are cited by homeowners as the top factor affecting future spending plans, followed by the state of the overall economy and inflation in general,” said Lowe’s chief executive, Robert A. Niblock, explaining earnings that missed analysts’ expectations in a conference call with investors. MasterCard Advisors’ SpendingPulse, which researches consumer spending, reported on Tuesday that the gallons of gas pumped nationwide in the last month fell by 1 percent from the period a year ago. Conserving miles has become a new business priority at Topical BioMedics, where Ms. Greene works in Rhinebeck, N.Y. Her boss, Lou Paradise, recently invested in cloud computing so employees could access documents and programs and work from home more. He hands out gas cards as bonuses and birthday gifts, and holds seminars on how to make a car more energy-efficient. And when employees have to drive somewhere on business, he urges them to use the company cars — a Volkswagen TDI, a clean-diesel car and a Ford Transit Connect van, which is relatively fuel-efficient. Other companies are also trying to help workers cope with high gas prices. Robert Trow, who runs a small distribution company in Mashpee, Mass., recently gave his employees a raise — on top of the one he gave in December — to help them deal with pump prices. At the hair products business Paul Mitchell, which is based in the Los Angeles area, the company gives employees 20 cents a mile when they carpool, and covers bus fare in full. More employees are taking the company up on the offers now. Even the chief financial officer, Rick Battaglini, has begun carpooling to work. Over all, the economy, though still slowly mending, has largely been able to shrug off the effects of high gas prices. Since the beginning of the year, employers have added more than 750,000 jobs, which puts more money into the economy in the form of additional paychecks. And while the rise in gas prices since the beginning of the year roughly translates into a loss of $75 billion to $100 billion in spending power if sustained for the entire year, the payroll tax cuts adds back about $112 billion, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse. “It looks like those two things have fought each other to a standstill,” said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/business/17travel.html?ref=mastercardinc">Picking the Right Credit Card for Travel Perks<date>Published: May 16, 2011</date><text>Credit card issuers have begun aggressively marketing to business travelers because they often have many of the attributes the issuers look for, like good jobs and higher incomes.Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, said credit card issuers had gone “from no activity to a frenzy of activity” in the last year or two. “They’ve turned up the wick in the intensity,” he said, in marketing to business travelers. “The frequent-traveler demographic tends to be someone with a higher household income, and a better job and credit rating,” he added. “That’s why issuers are focusing so aggressively on this segment of the market.” Mr. Winship recommended that travelers determine where they are on the credit continuum before choosing a card. “Are you a frequent buyer or a frequent flier? If you’re a frequent buyer and earn the majority of your miles by using your credit card and not traveling, there’s no compelling reason to sign up for an airline co-branded card. You’re probably better off with a Capital One Venture card, an American Express or Citi ThankYou Premier card — you won’t face restrictions getting reward flights because they buy the tickets.” But frequent fliers who opt for cards issued by their airline loyalty program can also earn miles from hotel stays, car rentals and even mortgage payments. “If you earn a significant number of miles through traveling, you’re better off sticking with an airline-linked card, since miles you get from purchases can be linked with miles you get from traveling,” Mr. Winship said. Another option is the Starwood Preferred Guest American Express card, which lets travelers earn points that can be redeemed for stays at Starwood hotels or converted into mileage for airline tickets; the American Express Membership Rewards program offers similar flexibility. There are also cards that give users a cash rebate on their purchases, which also affords flexibility. According to an analysis by Mr. Winship, certain cards are better for specific perks than others. Here is a sampling: FOR AIRPORT LOUNGE ACCESS He suggested American Express Platinum and Centurion cards, whose annual fees cover entry into lounges of American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and US Airways, and annual membership in Priority Pass Select, a program that provides access to 600 lounges worldwide. Certain Continental and United cards also offer annual memberships to their lounges. All cards have annual fees of $375 or more. TO AVOID FOREIGN FEES Mr. Winship estimated that foreign transaction fees could add as much as 3 percent to the cost of goods and services purchased overseas. He said travelers should consider cards that have eliminated these fees, including American Express Platinum and Centurion cards; certain Visa cards issued by Continental, British Airways, IHG, Marriott and Hyatt; Chase’s Sapphire Preferred; and Citi’s ThankYou Premier and ThankYou Prestige cards. Some cards charge hefty annual fees, but others — like Marriott’s $30 charge and IHG’s $49 — are minimal. TO WAIVE BAG-CHECKING FEES Depending on restrictions, Continental’s various MasterCards as well as Delta’s SkyMiles credit cards will cover one or two bags per traveler per flight. The American Express Platinum and Centurion cards also give users a $200 annual credit toward miscellaneous airline fees, including baggage-checking fees. TO CUT MILEAGE REQUIREMENTS Look into American Airlines’ Citi cards and USAirways’ MasterCards, which offer discounts on the number of miles required to book an award ticket. TO EARN QUALIFYING MILES Consider the top-tier credit cards offered by Continental, Delta, United and US Airways to build up the miles that help travelers qualify for elite status in airline loyalty programs. These cards let holders earn elite miles if they spend a certain amount of money, though they also limit the number of elite miles that can be earned this way. One other significant perk is automatic loyalty program status upgrades, available through Marriott, Hilton and IHG co-branded cards. The American Express Platinum and Centurion cards also reimburse holders for the $100 application fee for Global Entry, a program that expedites customs and immigration clearance at airports in the United States. Many business travelers carry more than one credit card, using each differently. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/business/14card.html?ref=mastercardinc">Credit Card Use Suggests Recovery Is Taking Hold<date>Published: May 13, 2011</date><text>Ever since the United States emerged from the recession, economists have been watching for signs that Americans are spending again.This year, evidence is building that they are — with every swipe of their credit cards. In the most recent quarter, covering January to March, American Express, MasterCard and Visa all reported increases in card spending. Business and consumer spending in the United States helped propel that growth, along with global growth and an increase in merchants that accept cards. “The dust is slowly coming off credit cards,” said Gregory Daco, a senior economist with IHS Global Insight. “It is a general return of consumers to credit card usage, but it is a cautious one. Income is lower and slowly making a comeback right now.” In the last few years, consumers and household budgets have been constrained by the housing crisis, a weak job market and, most recently, high energy prices. Economists now are cautiously forecasting a turnaround in spending. Consumers cut debt after the 2008 financial crisis, this year’s federal payroll tax cut is padding incomes, and consumers are adjusting to a labor market that appears to be stabilizing. At the same time, the rate of deleveraging has been slowing, according to Federal Reserve data. Revolving credit balances, mostly credit cards, have generally been falling as demand declined, consumers used their cards less or paid them off, and banks wrote off nonperforming balances. Such balances reached $796.1 billion in March, compared with a peak of $973.6 billion in August 2008. The most recent data show that revolving credit was up 2.9 percent in March compared with February, only the second monthly increase since late 2008. The other increase was in December 2010. While these figures are moving in the right direction, Mr. Daco and other economists say there are still factors, like gas prices and other uncertainties, that could derail any progress. “The positive news from the credit card issuers and processors is directly related to the increase in consumer spending over the past nine months and a more positive outlook for spending going forward,” said Cristian deRitis, the director of consumer credit analytics at Moody’s Analytics. The card industry is a good gauge of how consumers are spending and what they are buying. It also shows how confident they are in reaching for their credit cards again. Consumers are starting to relieve some of the pent-up demand for autos, appliances and other goods that they had put off buying, analysts said. “It is a psychological pall that is gradually lifting with the realization that the economy has in fact not been in recession for more than a year,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a journal covering the consumer payments industry. “It is incremental,” he added. “It is not blockbuster.” The three biggest card brands, reporting their results for the latest quarter, say the trends point to relative growth of Americans’ consumer credit card use. MasterCard said its first-quarter profit rose 24 percent, to $562 million, as people used cards more in global markets and to a lesser extent, as consumers swiped them more for nonessential items. Still, consumer spending in the United States has been surpassed by business spending. “The recovery, such as it is in the United States, is really a commercially driven, as opposed to a consumer-driven thing,” Timothy H. Murphy, the chief product officer for MasterCard, said at a recent investor conference. MasterCard’s credit card purchase volume was $115 billion in the first quarter of 2011, a 5 percent increase compared with the year earlier. While the company does not break down that spending, it said its consumer credit card spending rose. It was essentially flat in the fourth quarter of 2010 and negative going back to the second quarter of 2008. Analysts said that could mean consumers were returning to discretionary spending. Visa, in its earnings report for the three months ending in March, showed $199 billion in credit purchase volumes in the United States, a 9 percent rise compared with the year-ago quarter. While the company did not break down the figure for consumers, the chief financial officer, Byron Pollitt, said credit was typically used more for discretionary purchases. “As the economy recovers, our belief is that consumers, in combination with more employment, become more willing to spend on the discretionary side,” he said during a conference call. American Express reported that first-quarter consumer spending on its cards in the United States reached $96 billion, up 13 percent compared with last year. “Over all, we are seeing consumers spending again across all categories and including discretionary items like travel and entertainment,” a spokeswoman for the company, Joanna G. Lambert, said. The quarterly results also suggest that more consumers were spending more freely, analysts said. David J. Koning, a senior research analyst at Robert W. Baird &amp; Company, said that while American Express typically had a more affluent cardholder base, for example, growth was accelerating at Visa and MasterCard. That may reflect a broader economic recovery, he said. Mr. Robertson, of The Nilson Report, added, “Those people at the very top are spending more quarter after quarter, as the wealthiest individuals overthrow whatever cloak of recessionary blues they might have had.” He said, “And that is permeating and dropping down further into the American credit card public.”</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/small-banks-and-debit-card-reform/?ref=mastercardinc">Small Banks and Debit-Card Reform<date>May 12, 2011, 5:00 am</date><text>05/13/11 | Updated to take account of the association’s comment on its role in the debit card category. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of “13 Bankers.” It’s not hard to understand why large banks oppose any attempt to overhaul the financial arrangements currently surrounding credit cards and debit cards. In the duopoly run through Visa and MasterCard, big banks earn fees that far exceed their costs. Philip Scott Andrews/The New York TimesSenator Dick Durban, a Democrat from Illinois, has proposed that the Federal Reserve require banks to lower debit-card fees to a level closer to the actual cost of transactions.  The excess profit for debit cards would be substantially reduced by a proposed Federal Reserve regulation now on the table that would implement the Durbin Amendment from the Dodd-Frank 2010 financial reform act. That amendment, sponsored by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, required the Fed to place a cap on the fees that banks may charge on debit-card transactions. Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, has proposed legislation that would delay and effectively derail implementation of the Durbin Amendment, and the big banks are very much in his camp. It’s much harder to understand why Independent Community Bankers of America, the trade group for small banks, is pushing so hard for the Tester bill (and effectively shielding big banks from political pressure), because community banks are explicitly exempted from having to lower their fees, and individual executives from at least some small banks publicly support the Durbin Amendment (see, for example, Senator Durbin’s letter to the I.C.B.A. last year). The I.C.B.A. needs to publish the full details of a “survey” that it uses to claim that most community bankers are against the Durbin Amendment. And it probably should also step back from its involvement in the Durbin-Tester debate. The open secret of the American financial system is that while you and your friends might like to rail against banks over dinner, when the time comes to pay (at the grocery store or in the restaurant), you are likely to offer the merchant some form of plastic card. While this transaction may seem free to you, the merchant is charged a fee by the bank that issued the card — administered through a card network run by Visa or MasterCard (or American Express or Discover). Specifically, the merchant’s bank (known as the “acquirer”) has to pay “interchange fees” to the card-issuing bank. For debit cards, which draw directly from your checking account, these fees averaged 44 cents for each transaction in 2009 (which was 1.14 percent of the relevant average retail transaction, according to the Fed, adding up to $15.7 billion economy-wide). The actual cost of these operations varies, mostly depending on economies of scale in the bank’s processing operation (which is why the Durbin exemption for small banks makes sense). But over our current systems, the cost is very low; on average it is 4 cents for a transaction, according to the Fed. (For the most detailed publicly available study on the effect of lower interchange fees, look at this report on what happened in the Australian debit-card payment system.) The Durbin Amendment charged the Federal Reserve with lowering the debit-card fees to a reasonable level that will cover costs, and the Fed is proposing to set this rate at not more than 12 cents for a transaction. But this rate would apply only to larger banks. By design, the Durbin Amendment does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in total assets, and the Fed has confirmed that this exemption can be implemented (see this statement by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed). Global megabanks are now regarded as “too big to fail” by policy makers, and these companies benefit from huge implicit government guarantees. When you talk with community bankers, they understand and are seriously upset by this arrangement. But the lobbyists for these community bankers have been unwilling or unable to take on the big banks in any part of the political arena. The Durbin Amendment is a determined attempt to give the small banks an advantage. But the I.C.B.A. is not interested. It argues that the “carve out” for small banks will not work — through moves by merchants and the card networks, these banks will be squeezed out of the payments system. This is not the view of the Federal Reserve staff, which has studied this closely. And Senator Durbin is firm on this: My amendment does not allow discrimination by merchants against issuers of debit cards. As is the case today, under my amendment a merchant who accepts Visa debit cards from large banks would be required to accept Visa debit cards from small banks and credit unions as well. They would also be prohibited from offering discounts for large bank cards and not providing the same discount for small bank cards from the same network. The I.C.B.A’s main justification for its position is a “survey” of independent community bankers that shows they are opposed to the Durbin Amendment — that is, lowering the debit fees of banks with which they compete. This result is odd, particularly given that a simple online poll by American Banker showed that 60 percent of its readers thought that small banks would gain from the amendment — and this result came after the I.C.B.A. tweeted that it wanted votes against the Durbin plan. The I.C.B.A.’s Web site does not disclose details of who was surveyed or by whom, or what questions were asked. Its staff members were friendly but confirmed to me that they would not disclose these details.

    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/06/business/06shop.html?ref=mastercardinc">April Retail Sales Post Big Jump, as Expected<date>Published: May 5, 2011</date><text>Retailers expected a good April, and they got it.Sales at stores open at least a year, a measure of retail buoyancy known as same-store sales, increased 8.9 percent on average in April, according to Thomson Reuters’ tracking of 25 retailers. That was one of the biggest increases in the last few years, and it topped analyst expectations of 8.2 percent. Chris Donnelly, a senior executive in the retail practice at Accenture, said the results were good but no one should get carried away. “It was expected to be a big jump — if you look at analyst expectations, and even the companies’ own expectations,” he said, “and frankly, some companies didn’t jump as much as they were expected to do.” Even so, the companies that missed forecasts by the biggest margin — Kohl’s, Saks Fifth Avenue and J. C. Penney — still posted good results. Kohl’s same-store sales increased 10.2 percent, compared with analyst estimates of 15.1 percent. Sales at Saks rose 5.8 percent, compared with estimates of 10.3 percent. And J. C. Penney increased 6.4 percent; analysts had expected 8.5 percent. “Everyone’s pretty happy that April turned out so well, but looking forward, there’s still a lot of concern,” Mr. Donnelly said, noting that gasoline prices and raw material costs are rising sharply. Gasoline prices are up about 30 percent so far this year — close to an average of $4 a gallon — and retailers are trying to figure out the impact if prices stay there or continue to rise. Higher gas prices tend to affect traffic at physical stores. “When the national average price of gasoline exceeds $3.20 a gallon, that’s when we start to see indications of change,” said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at SpendingPulse, which also tracks gas sales. “People pump fewer gallons, and drive less, and that tends to have impact on retail because people cut back on Saturday driving.” Stage Stores, which reported results on Thursday, said its first-quarter sales increase of just 0.2 percent was damped by gas prices. “Rising gas prices made for a more cautious consumer,” Andy Hall, president and chief executive, said in a statement. Last week, Wal-Mart’s chief executive, Michael T. Duke, issued the same warning. “There’s no doubt that rising fuel prices are having an impact on our customers,” Mr. Duke said at an event in New York. “There’s more pressure.” The sharp drop in oil prices over the last four days has not yet begun to affect prices at the gasoline pump, but if sustained, it could provide relief. Three of the midrange department stores reporting sales on Thursday had some of the best results, with Macy’s, Dillard’s and Kohl’s all posting increases of same-store sales between 10.2 and 11 percent. The companies attributed the increase in large part to Easter coming in late April, as opposed to last year when most of the Easter-related shopping occurred in March. Even so, comparing combined March and April results from this year to last year, the stores were improving. Dillard’s, for instance, said its combined March and April same-store sales were up 4 percent over 2010, and Macy’s said the combined months’ results were up 5.3 percent this year over last. Limited Brands had an increase of 20 percent for all its brands, bolstered by a 25 percent increase at its Victoria’s Secret unit. Analysts had expected a 12.2 percent increase for Limited over all, and a 16.3 percent increase at Victoria’s Secret. The Limited said in a recorded message that pretty much everything at Victoria’s Secret was performing well, from yoga shorts to new packaging for its fragrances. It also increased its earnings guidance for the second quarter, to 37 to 39 cents a share, up from its previous guidance of 26 to 31 cents a share. Gap Inc. had one of the most surprising results. Gap’s sales have been faltering so badly that when Thomson Reuters reports same-store sales for the apparel category, it also includes a number that excludes Gap, to more accurately reflect where the majority of stores are. On Thursday, Gap Inc. announced that it had dismissed its head designer for the Gap brand, Patrick Robinson. Three months ago, it dismissed the Gap brand’s top business-side executive. In April, however, Gap posted an 8 percent increase in same-store sales in a month analysts had expected a 0.8 percent decrease. The Old Navy and Banana Republic divisions pushed that increase, rising by 14 and 11 percent respectively. But the Gap unit was also in positive territory for the first time in 2011, with an increase of 2 percent. Spending in the apparel sector over all increased 10.4 percent in April as compared with April a year ago, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which estimates sales from cash, check and credit cards. “Sectors like apparel had a significant Easter bump, and they are really inflating the growth rate,” Mr. McNamara of SpendingPulse said. E-commerce sales were up 19.2 percent, according to SpendingPulse, the largest increase since July 2007. And luxury spending continued to be strong, increasing 9.6 percent. High gas prices can be a boon for e-commerce sales, as customers save gas by having clothing shipped directly to their houses. “Almost in conjunction with the lower pumping numbers, we’ve seen acceleration of the e-commerce growth,” Mr. McNamara said. And while high gas prices affect discount stores’ customer base, they also means the stores might attract more affluent customers. Discount stores as a sector had the highest same-store sales increase in April, rising 12.1 percent, which was 1.3 percent higher than analysts had expected. “It hurts the spending power of your folks, but at the same time a lot of people tend to trade down,” Mr. Donnelly said.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/12/small-banks-and-debit-card-reform/?ref=mastercardinc">Small Banks and Debit-Card Reform<date>May 12, 2011, 5:00 am</date><text>05/13/11 | Updated to take account of the association’s comment on its role in the debit card category. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of “13 Bankers.” It’s not hard to understand why large banks oppose any attempt to overhaul the financial arrangements currently surrounding credit cards and debit cards. In the duopoly run through Visa and MasterCard, big banks earn fees that far exceed their costs. Philip Scott Andrews/The New York TimesSenator Dick Durban, a Democrat from Illinois, has proposed that the Federal Reserve require banks to lower debit-card fees to a level closer to the actual cost of transactions.  The excess profit for debit cards would be substantially reduced by a proposed Federal Reserve regulation now on the table that would implement the Durbin Amendment from the Dodd-Frank 2010 financial reform act. That amendment, sponsored by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, required the Fed to place a cap on the fees that banks may charge on debit-card transactions. Senator Jon Tester, a Democrat from Montana, has proposed legislation that would delay and effectively derail implementation of the Durbin Amendment, and the big banks are very much in his camp. It’s much harder to understand why Independent Community Bankers of America, the trade group for small banks, is pushing so hard for the Tester bill (and effectively shielding big banks from political pressure), because community banks are explicitly exempted from having to lower their fees, and individual executives from at least some small banks publicly support the Durbin Amendment (see, for example, Senator Durbin’s letter to the I.C.B.A. last year). The I.C.B.A. needs to publish the full details of a “survey” that it uses to claim that most community bankers are against the Durbin Amendment. And it probably should also step back from its involvement in the Durbin-Tester debate. The open secret of the American financial system is that while you and your friends might like to rail against banks over dinner, when the time comes to pay (at the grocery store or in the restaurant), you are likely to offer the merchant some form of plastic card. While this transaction may seem free to you, the merchant is charged a fee by the bank that issued the card — administered through a card network run by Visa or MasterCard (or American Express or Discover). Specifically, the merchant’s bank (known as the “acquirer”) has to pay “interchange fees” to the card-issuing bank. For debit cards, which draw directly from your checking account, these fees averaged 44 cents for each transaction in 2009 (which was 1.14 percent of the relevant average retail transaction, according to the Fed, adding up to $15.7 billion economy-wide). The actual cost of these operations varies, mostly depending on economies of scale in the bank’s processing operation (which is why the Durbin exemption for small banks makes sense). But over our current systems, the cost is very low; on average it is 4 cents for a transaction, according to the Fed. (For the most detailed publicly available study on the effect of lower interchange fees, look at this report on what happened in the Australian debit-card payment system.) The Durbin Amendment charged the Federal Reserve with lowering the debit-card fees to a reasonable level that will cover costs, and the Fed is proposing to set this rate at not more than 12 cents for a transaction. But this rate would apply only to larger banks. By design, the Durbin Amendment does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in total assets, and the Fed has confirmed that this exemption can be implemented (see this statement by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Fed). Global megabanks are now regarded as “too big to fail” by policy makers, and these companies benefit from huge implicit government guarantees. When you talk with community bankers, they understand and are seriously upset by this arrangement. But the lobbyists for these community bankers have been unwilling or unable to take on the big banks in any part of the political arena. The Durbin Amendment is a determined attempt to give the small banks an advantage. But the I.C.B.A. is not interested. It argues that the “carve out” for small banks will not work — through moves by merchants and the card networks, these banks will be squeezed out of the payments system. This is not the view of the Federal Reserve staff, which has studied this closely. And Senator Durbin is firm on this: My amendment does not allow discrimination by merchants against issuers of debit cards. As is the case today, under my amendment a merchant who accepts Visa debit cards from large banks would be required to accept Visa debit cards from small banks and credit unions as well. They would also be prohibited from offering discounts for large bank cards and not providing the same discount for small bank cards from the same network. The I.C.B.A’s main justification for its position is a “survey” of independent community bankers that shows they are opposed to the Durbin Amendment — that is, lowering the debit fees of banks with which they compete. This result is odd, particularly given that a simple online poll by American Banker showed that 60 percent of its readers thought that small banks would gain from the amendment — and this result came after the I.C.B.A. tweeted that it wanted votes against the Durbin plan. The I.C.B.A.’s Web site does not disclose details of who was surveyed or by whom, or what questions were asked. Its staff members were friendly but confirmed to me that they would not disclose these details. (My impression is that the survey asked banks how they would respond if their debit interchange fees were greatly reduced — not whether the Durbin Amendment would actually reduce these fees). It’s time for the I.C.B.A. to disclose those details. Is this a real survey or another instance of lobbying posing as research? The I.C.B.A. should share this information both with its membership and with the public.

There will be four weekly episodes of a new series, “Capitales del Futbol,” or “Capitals of Football,” i.e., soccer, to be shown across Latin America on four consecutive Sundays, beginning this Sunday. The series will be shown at the same time in 18 countries that speak Spanish as well as in Portuguese-speaking Brazil. ESPN says that is the first simultaneous premiere of its type. “Capitales del Futbol” is being co-produced by ESPN, part of the Walt Disney Company, and a production company known as 100 Bares, which produced the 2009 movie from Argentina, “The Secret in Their Eyes.” The series is a documentary-style look at four premier soccer cities: Buenos Aires, Madrid, Milan and Rio de Janeiro. Interspersed in each episode is MasterCard, which is a sponsor of major soccer events like Copa America (America Cup) and the UEFA Champions League. There will also be three vignettes appearing in each episode that offer highlights of three of the cities. The vignettes are titled “Al Visitar” (“To Visit”). For Madrid, shopping is featured; for Milan, food; and for Rio, hotels. Each vignette ends with a brief glimpse of a MasterCard Platinum card. The vignettes will be in addition to regular commercials for MasterCard that will appear during each episode. There will also be microsites, or special Web sites, devoted to the series, hosted by ESPN Deportes (Sports) and billed as “presented by MasterCard.” One, in Spanish, is at capitalesdelfutbol.com and the other, in Portuguese, is at espn.com.br/capitaisdofutebol. The effort is “one of a kind,” said Edgardo Tettamanti, senior vice president and group head for Latin America and the Caribbean region at the Miami office of MasterCard Worldwide. MasterCard is increasingly interested in “embedding the brand into the content,” he added. Those kinds of initiatives, known as branded entertainment, are meant to counter the ability of consumers to avoid traditional pitches like television commercials. The goal of focusing on soccer is to present “the ‘priceless’ experience,” Mr. Tettamanti said, using the theme of MasterCard ads, “and connect with the passion of these consumers.” Speaking of MasterCard ads, two MasterCard agencies are also involved in developing and producing “Capitales del Futbol” along with 100 Bares and the ESPN International Marketing Solutions unit of ESPN. The agencies are McCann Erickson Worldwide and Universal McCann, both owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. As to whether the series may feature additional cities beyond the four in the four episodes, Mr. Tettamanti said, “We know there are more ‘priceless’ cities, soccer cities, than that.”</text></article>

Most United States banks issue use cards with magnetic stripe technology, which can’t be used overseas. “The State Employees’ Credit Union of Raleigh, N.C., just started offering debit cards with the so-called E.M.V. chips (for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) to members who bank at its 236 branches throughout North Carolina,” Ms. Carrns writes. And another credit union, the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York, has also been offering credit cards with E.M.V. chips.

    <article index="8" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/small-players-offer-smart-cards-but-not-big-banks/?ref=mastercardinc">Small Players Offer Smart Cards, but Not Big Banks<date>April 12, 2011, 6:15 pm</date><text>You may have read in this newspaper about some Americans having problems using their credit or debit cards overseas because the cards rely on older “magnetic stripe” technology. Many countries are switching to more fraud-resistant cards that use tiny chips to conduct transactions. Some vendors in Europe, like those selling tickets or services at unattended kiosks (gas pumps, for instance), can’t process the magnetic stripe cards, which remain the standard for credit and debit cards issued in the United States. So if, like most Americans, you bank at a financial institution in the United States, your card could potentially cause you some problems overseas — unless, that is, you happen to be a member of a small credit union. The State Employees’ Credit Union of Raleigh, N.C., just started offering debit cards with the so-called E.M.V. chips (for Europay, MasterCard and Visa) to members who bank at its 236 branches throughout North Carolina. “We had begun to hear about problems with acceptance from members traveling internationally,” said Leanne Phelps, senior vice president of card services at the credit union. “It was sporadic.” Just a small percentage of the credit union’s debit transactions are international. But after hearing the complaints and realizing that both Canada and Mexico were moving to the chip cards, Ms. Phelps said she became convinced that her institution should make the switch. “We’re sandwiched between those two countries,” she said. Last month, the credit union began switching over the cards used for its “travel” debit accounts — a sort of forced budgeting mechanism marketed to globetrotting members. The accounts have a dedicated debit card and a balance fixed by the user, to avoid overspending while on a vacation. By the end of this year, however, the credit union aims to equip all of its debit cards with the chip technology. Another credit union, the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York, has been offering credit cards with the chips for about a year. So if small credit unions are offering the latest card technology to members, why don’t big banks? The answer to that question is a bit complicated, said Martin Ferenczi, managing director of card systems in the United States for Oberthur Technologies, a large maker of E.M.V. chips. Oberthur entered the American market in 1994, and is still waiting for widespread adoption. “We’ve been very patient,” Mr. Ferenczi said. “The only country not very advanced in this technology is the United States.” To be fair, he noted, one reason the United States has been slow to adopt E.M.V. technology is that there has been less card-related fraud here than in other countries. So banks haven’t felt enough of a financial hit from crime to justify the switch to chip cards, which are more expensive. But that may no longer be the case, as banks come under pressure from coming changes in the structure of swipe fees that banks charge retailers. The paradox here is that the organization that manages the technology standards for the chip cards, EMVCo, is owned in part by American Express, MasterCard and Visa. So why can’t they do something to advance the chips — especially American Express, which markets itself heavily to travelers? Marina Hoffmann Norville, a spokeswoman for American Express, said the card companies are just one player in the business. The other two are the banks that actually issue the cards to their customers and the retailers, which must adopt readers that can process the new technology. Everyone has to get on board, she said, for the switch to occur. Currently, any cards issued in the United States with E.M.V. chips must also have magnetic stripes, or they aren’t usable in domestic stores. Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance, which promotes the adoption of chip cards, said big banks in the United States had been more focused recently on gaining an edge in mobile payment systems and in so-called contactless cards — another type of card that lets you pay for things by waving the card past a reader. Smaller banks and credit unions, which aren’t likely to get out in front in those areas, may see offering E.M.V.-chip cards as a way to distinguish themselves from the competition, he said. Meantime, Mr. Vanderhoof suggested an alternative for European travelers who don’t want to be inconvenienced. Travelex, which maintains currency exchange outlets at many airports, will issue prepaid, E.M.V.-compliant cards in your choice of euros or pounds. Just load up the card before you board, and you won’t have to worry about having coming up short on your trip. Have you encountered any troubles with your magnetic stripe cards while traveling overseas? Have you asked your bank for a chip-based card?</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/big-banks-have-a-powerful-new-opponent/?ref=mastercardinc">Big Banks Have a Powerful New Opponent<date>April 7, 2011, 5:00 am</date><text>Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of “13 Bankers.” As a lobbying group, the largest American banks have been dominant throughout the latest boom-bust-bailout cycle – capturing the hearts and minds of the Bush and Obama administrations, as well as the support of most elected representatives on Capitol Hill. Elaine Thompson/Associated Press Big banks are lobbying Congress to delay a limit on fees they charge for debit-card transactions, and retailers are countering with an advertising campaign. Their reign, however, is being seriously challenged – finally – by an alliance of retailers, big and small, on whose behalf a variety of ads are now running, including on television (such as this one, by Americans for Job Security), the Web (such as this, by American Family Voices) and a powerful radio spot directly attacking the too-big–to-fail banks. The immediate issue is the so-called Durbin amendment –- a requirement in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation that would lower what are known as the interchange fees that banks collect when anyone buys anything with a debit card. Retailers pay the fees, but these are then reflected in the prices faced by consumers. The United States has very high debit-card fees, colloquially known as swipe fees –- 44 cents on average (that amounts to 1.14 percent of the average purchase price of $39) and up to 98 cents for some kinds of cards. These fees are per transaction and although the formula is complex, the payment is a significant percentage of many purchases and poses a particular problem for smaller merchants. These fees are estimated to amount to $16 billion to $17 billion annually. Other countries, including Australia and members of the European Union, have acted to reduce interchange fees – because the actual cost of such transactions is quite low. Think about it: the interchange fee for checks, which also draw directly on bank deposits, is zero. The United States severely lags behind comparable countries in terms of how consumers are treated by banks in this regard. The intent behind the amendment offered by Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, was quite clear: Fees should be lowered – to a level commensurate with the costs of that particular transaction. The amendment attracted bipartisan support (the vote was 64-33 in the Senate, with 17 Republicans among the supporters). The Federal Reserve was mandated with determining reasonable fees through a regulatory rule-making process, and, after some foot-dragging, the proposal is that interchange fees be capped at 12 cents. Unsurprisingly, the big banks’ lobbying machinery sprang into action, arguing that the fee cap would hurt small banks and credit unions. Senators Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, and Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, are offering legislation –- as is Representative Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia –- that would postpone implementation of the fee reduction for up to two years, pending further study. In Washington, the best way to kill something is to study it further. This is an issue that cuts across party line –- witness the eclectic Dick Morris weighing in for the amendment – but supporters of the big banks sit on both sides of the aisle. Tea Party-inclined Congressional conservatives are arguing that the Fed should not get involved with the market. And the Financial Services Roundtable asserts that the amendment is wrong from top to bottom. But this is a badly broken market, as James C. Miller III, the budget director under President Reagan, has argued. Too-big-to-fail banks are not a market – they are a government subsidy scheme, because they are backed by implicit government bailout support (to be provided at below market cost whenever needed). These subsidies enable megabanks to borrow more cheaply and grab market share relative to smaller banks (those with less than $10 billion of assets.) On top of this, and working closely with the biggest banks, Visa and MasterCard have around 90 percent of the market for debit cards – hardly conducive to reasonable competitive outcomes. At the same time, some on the political left are confused (or captured) by the assertion that lower interchange fees will hurt small banks and credit unions. This is a pure smokescreen – banks with less than $10 billion in total assets are specifically exempt from the provisions of the Durbin amendment. This exemption was a smart political move, and it also makes economic sense, given the disproportionate size and power of our largest banks. Adam Levitin, writing on the Credit Slips blog, makes a strong case that small banks will actually win under the proposed cap, as this can level the playing field with larger banks to some degree: If they end up with higher interchange revenue than big banks as a result of Durbin, that is a step toward undoing the troubling consolidation of financial services around too-big-to-fail institutions. See also Mr. Levitin’s paper on credit unions, showing that they may also benefit – again as most have less than $10 billion in total assets. Of course, the big banks are threatening to punish customers in other ways if debit fees are capped — for example, by ending free checking. But this makes no sense, given that these banks have to compete with smaller institutions for retail business that will not be affected by the caps on debit fees. The dispute between big banks and the nonfinancial sector has started to get interesting.</text></article>

Elizabeth Warren’s charm campaign made a stop in enemy territory on Wednesday. Ms. Warren, the Obama administration official who is overseeing the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, brought her calls for tough regulation to the Chamber of Commerce, a ferocious opponent of regulation – and the bureau itself. But you wouldn’t know from her remarks that she had stepped into the lion’s den. Ms. Warren, in a speech to the chamber’s Capital Markets Summit on Wednesday morning, trod lightly on the bureau’s plans to regulate Wall Street. She instead played to her audience, saying the bureau would ease some burdensome regulations. “The lesson seems clear: Rules should be focused, and those that are not useful should be revised or eliminated,” she said, adding that the bureau would not primarily focus on writing new regulations. Ms. Warren said she even agreed with the chamber’s recent proclamation that the bureau should work to “prevent duplicative and inconsistent regulation of Main Street business.” That is why, she said, the bureau’s top priority is to “consolidate the duplicative and burdensome” mortgage closing documents. Article Tools E-mail Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ms. Warren’s charm offensive comes as the deadline approaches for President Obama to name an official director of the bureau – a spot that many consumer advocates want her to fill. Ms. Warren’s visit to the chamber — one of the financial industry’s top cheerleaders and lobbying shops — is her latest olive branch to fierce critics who stand in the way of her nabbing the job. Ms. Warren’s calendar this year has been jam-packed with meetings on Wall Street. She has met with the chief executive of every major Wall Street bank, including Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup and James P. Gorman of Morgan Stanley. Her industry outreach included talks with dozens of community bankers, too, and meetings with top credit card executives like Ajay Banga, the president and chief executive of MasterCard. “I believe in regulatory engagement with industry, and I understand that industry provides a critical perspective in the regulatory process,” she said in the speech. Ms. Warren also played up her recent hires, which include some familiar faces on Wall Street. The bureau tapped Rajeev Date, a former Deutsche Bank managing director and Capital One Financial senior vice president, to oversee the rule-writing process. Mr. Date, Ms. Warren told the chamber, “has spent almost his entire career working for financial services firms, and he is acutely aware that we need to make sure that any rules we write will enhance the market.” Ms. Warren also hired Elizabeth Vale, a former Morgan Stanley managing director, a lawyer who has represented the financial industry and a former senior employee at the mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. “We’ve built a structure to make sure that any rules we write will be fact-based and grounded in a deep understanding of the market being regulated,” Ms. Warren said. Still, playing nice with Wall Street will not be an easy feat for the bureau. “I’ve been in Washington only a short time, but I have eyes,” Ms. Warren said. “Industry groups have extraordinary resources to push back on oversight and to make their views known, as is their right.” It also remains to be seen whether Ms. Warren’s efforts will win her the job as the bureau’s director. When President Obama tapped Ms. Warren, a Harvard law professor, to set up the bureau in September, he stopped short of nominating her to be its first director. The bureau’s director will face Senate confirmation — not a sure bet for Ms. Warren, an outspoken consumer advocate and leading critic of risky lending practices. The bureau will formally open its doors in July, but it is handcuffed from writing several critical rules until it has a director. Ms. Warren on Wednesday did not comment on her possible nomination, although she did say, “I didn’t come to Washington looking for a job in government.” Ms. Warren’s appearance comes a year after the chamber led a campaign to sabotage the bureau. The lobbying powerhouse ran a series of fatalistic radio ads warning that the bureau would suffocate small businesses and ultimately hurt consumers. Those efforts failed. Lawmakers created the bureau as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory law signed by President Obama in July. The law gave the bureau authority over a wide swath of financial businesses, including payday lenders, mortgage companies and big banks. Ms. Warren’s prepared remarks acknowledged the awkwardness surrounding her speech. “At the outset, I need to tell you that I’ve had more teasing about this meeting than I’ve had in a long time,” she said. “But then, perhaps, so have you.” Ms. Warren’s speech on Wednesday will be followed by remarks from a more friendly face for the chamber: Mr. Dimon, of JPMorgan.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/your-money/24RURAL.html?ref=mastercardinc">A Reverse Mortgage Can Help Those With No Retirement Savings<date>Published: March 23, 2011</date><text>GRASS VALLEY, Calif.I F you’re worried that you haven’t saved enough for retirement, you’re probably right. Most of us haven’t. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found the majority of American workers had put away less than $25,000 for their golden years. But even those people are in better financial shape than Susanna Wilson, 70, who saved nothing. Her only dependable income is a Social Security check of about $900 a month. “I can never retire,” she said, her voice trembling as she stared at the floor of her living room in Grass Valley, Calif. “Probably about every two weeks when the bills are due, that’s when I get really worried. I think ‘How am I going to pay this one?’ ” It should never have come to this. Ms. Wilson attended the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1950s, though she left before graduating to move to New York and marry her college sweetheart, the Minimalist sculptor and sometime rock musician Walter De Maria. Ms. Wilson spent her prime earning years engaged in various creative endeavors in New York, mostly as a designer. Her clothing line, O’Susanna, found a home in the late 1970s at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s. Glamour and Seventeen magazines featured Perfumes by Susanna, including a popular fragrance called Strawberry Love. In her 40s, Ms. Wilson moved to California and became a publicist. At her peak, she made around $65,000 a year, she said, and not a penny of that made its way into a retirement fund. “One thing kind of led to another,” Ms. Wilson said. “I’ve always put all my money into my businesses. And I always thought the business I was in was going to be a great success.” She also raised a daughter, Corie, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with her two children and is not in a position to help her mother financially. Now twice divorced and living alone with her Shetland Sheepdog, Rooney, Ms. Wilson subsists on those government checks, plus a one-day-a-week job at a local jewelry store that pays $12.50 an hour. She received no alimony from either divorce. Ms. Wilson also makes little girls’ dresses under her O’Susanna label, at a vintage Singer Featherweight sewing machine in her dining room. But she sells only about six a month for around $200. Grass Valley, an old gold mining town of 12,300 residents in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, isn’t an expensive place to live. But Ms. Wilson isn’t the only one struggling. Her friend Molly Fisk, 55, a poet and teacher, was visiting the house and joked that her retirement planning was “all tied up in MasterCard futures. Sad but true.” Ms. Wilson would probably manage on her current income, though not without sacrifice, were it not for the debt she had accumulated. All told, she averages about $1,400 in monthly income, including Social Security (adjusted for one of her former husbands’ earnings). A third of that goes toward fixed expenses like utilities. She pays $300 toward a mortgage balance of $5,477. She inherited the house, fully paid off, from her parents, but took out the mortgage a few years ago to pay for repairs. The balance of her income goes toward the monthly minimum payments on $9,000 in credit card debt, racked up for daily living expenses. “I think I might just have to declare bankruptcy,” she said. “I just can’t live with that.” Before she takes that drastic step, Ms. Wilson should consider some other options, said Elizabeth Rutter Baer, a certified financial planner in Lansing, Mich. She worries that Ms. Wilson is “extremely close” to the edge and isn’t getting anywhere with her debt payments because she keeps putting more expenses, like food, on her credit cards. Yes, she could try to find other income, Ms. Baer said. But that’s a short-term solution. At some point, despite her excellent health, Ms. Wilson may not be able to work. “Bankruptcy is possible, but my advice is, let’s liquidate assets and get those debts paid off,” Ms. Baer said. To that end, Ms. Baer recommended something she said she had never before suggested: a reverse mortgage. Such mortgages allow homeowners to tap existing home equity to receive a lump sum or monthly checks. Unlike a home equity loan, however, borrowers don’t have to make any repayments until they no longer live in the home. The strategy can be risky, with high fees and sometimes poor counseling for borrowers. Reverse mortgages are available only to homeowners 62 or older. “Susanna is the ideal candidate,” Ms. Baer said. “This is one instance where it could work.” The house is valued from $150,000 to $200,000. Ms. Baer said Ms. Wilson should work with a bank to see if she could wrap the current mortgage into a reverse and then take cash out. Ms. Wilson is already making phone calls to explore the idea. Ms. Baer also noted that Ms. Wilson was part owner, with her two brothers, of several tracts of timberland in northern California. The land’s value has dropped because of the economy, but Ms. Baer said that shouldn’t stop them from selling it. “Whatever the purpose of this land was before, today’s the rainy day,” she said. “It may not be that much, but at this point $25,000 would change her life, totally.” Ms. Wilson said she was discussing this with her brothers and a real estate agent. Ms. Baer, who is 67 and single, said there were particular financial difficulties facing single people as they aged. Even people in a relationship should make financial plans that can work even if they were to be single during retirement, she said, adding, “Nobody knows who’s going to be there at the end.” Ms. Wilson agreed with that assessment. “I have friends, and they’re two people together, and it’s a lot easier.” At that point she again spoke through tears. “My Mom would say, ‘Why don’t you just go and get married?’ and that’s just not me,” she said. “I believe you have to love somebody.” Ms. Baer’s advice provided a push for her to explore some options she had already thought about, but hadn’t followed through on, Ms. Wilson said, because she had been paralyzed by the fear of what might happen if she could no longer generate extra income. Overcoming that fear will be key to recovering her financial health. And she’s confident that will happen. “I don’t want to be a Pollyanna,” Ms. Wilson said. “But tomorrow is another day.”</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/technology/24wallet.html?ref=mastercardinc">As Phones Become Mobile Wallets, Businesses Want a Share<date>Published: March 23, 2011</date><text>The cellphone has been more than a cellphone for years, but soon it could take on an entirely new role — standing in for all of the credit and debit cards crammed into wallets.Instead of swiping a plastic card at the checkout counter, consumers would merely wave their phones. There’s just one hitch: While the technology is already being installed in millions of phones — and is used overseas — wide adoption of the so-called mobile wallets is being slowed by a major behind-the-scenes battle among corporate giants. Mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies are all vying to control these wallets. But first, they need to sort out what role each will play and how each will get paid. The stakes are enormous because small, hidden fees that are generated every time consumers swipe their cards add up to tens of billions of dollars annually in the United States alone. “It all comes down to who gets paid and who makes money,” said Drew Sievers, chief executive of mFoundry, which makes mobile payment software for merchants and banks. “You have banks competing with carriers competing with Apple and Google, and it’s pretty much a goat rodeo until someone sorts it out.” In one camp are the long-established players. Payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, along with banks that actually issue credit cards to customers, want to stay at the center of any payment system and continue to collect their fees from merchants. They are facing competition from companies they see as interlopers. These include PayPal and Google, which want to play a part in a new payment system, as well as Apple and the mobile carriers, which want to collect fees through their control of the phones themselves. In the middle — and perhaps playing a deciding role — are the retailers. They have to install terminals that accept mobile payments. Consumer advocates, meanwhile, said they were concerned that a mobile system would bring higher fees and questioned whether consumers even want a new system. “Is it possible to make a system that’s too easy to use, where you reduce so much friction from the transaction process that people aren’t necessarily aware of what they’re spending on something?” asked Jan Chipchase, executive creative director at the design firm Frog Design, who studies mobile payments. Credit card and technology companies have talked about mobile wallets for well over a decade. But now, finally, the pieces are starting to fall into place. “Now that we have this commitment by the handset manufacturers and telcos, I think things are looking far more promising than ever,” said Gwenn Bézard, research director at the Aite Group, a research and advisory firm focused on the financial services industry. “The question is, Are telcos and card networks and banks going to agree on anything?” Visa and MasterCard now dominate the major tracks that shuttle credit card and debit payments between banks and retailers. Retailers must pay the banks issuing the cards a percentage of each transaction, and payment networks like Visa take a small cut. So for every $1 spent by a consumer, the retailer keeps about 97 cents, the card-issuing bank takes nearly 2 cents and the remaining penny goes to the merchant’s bank handling the transaction and the payment network. With mobile payments, it is still unclear how all the players will get paid or if any of the costs will trickle through to consumers, perhaps through new fees. Mobile carriers may demand that the card issuers pay them something akin to rent, or reach some other agreement, to store important payment credentials on a secure piece of the chip inside the phone. There are several technologies that allow phones to communicate wirelessly with other technologies, though the front-runner for payments is one called near-field communication, or N.F.C. “I think watching the industry evolve will determine where we need to go,” said Peter Ho, product manager for Wells Fargo’s card services and consumer lending, adding that the banking industry’s past conversations with mobile carriers had not been fruitful because they could not agree on financial terms. The mobile carriers’ frustration with the banks, some analysts said, was the impetus behind a joint venture by Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Discover to create their own mobile wallet. The venture, known as Isis, is expected to introduce its system next year. Barclaycard, already a major player in Britain, will be the first issuer of the group’s in-phone credit card and sees it as an opportunity to expand in the United States. Referring to the carriers’ 200 million customers, Amer Sajed, chief executive for Barclaycard US, said, “It’s phenomenal for us to be able to leverage such a large customer base, right as the customer is getting or updating their mobile device.” The banks and credit card issuers, meanwhile, have found a way to temporarily avoid working with the cellphone carriers. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan Chase, working with Visa, are all in various stages of testing wallets that would provide access to some of their own credit or debit cards. Because their model is powered by a chip that consumers insert into a slot in certain phones, it does not require the cooperation of the mobile operators. Visa said some of its bank partners might introduce mobile payments in the second half of this year. But that variation may become outmoded as more phones with embedded chips become available. Visa said it was also working with other providers to ensure that its network would work in all wallets. (As to the issue of security, several banks and payment networks said that mobile wallets would require a pass code and could be disabled remotely if a phone was stolen. Consumers would not be responsible for transactions they did not make.) Apple and Google already have payment systems — Apple’s iTunes has 200 million accounts tied to credit cards, while Google Checkout has been less popular. Both could be turned into mobile wallets, allowing users to pay for offline purchases with their Apple or Google accounts. But they would need access to the cellphone chips and the merchants’ terminals. Apple could make its own cellphone chips to make this all happen, but Google could not because it makes only Android cellphone software, not the phones themselves. Getting retailers on board is important to the widespread adoption of the mobile payments because many merchants will have to replace their card terminals. While one analyst estimated, conservatively, that only 5.9 percent of merchants will accept mobile payments by 2015, Mr. Bézard of Aite Group said that many of the large retailers — including McDonald’s and CVS — already had the terminals and thus could take part whenever the payment network was figured out. And, he said, 80 percent of consumer transactions occur at the top 200 merchants. Mobile payments have taken off more readily in other countries, using a variety of technologies. In Africa, where many people do not have credit cards, mobile phones have often replaced cash. And in Japan, people have been swiping phones at convenience stores and bus stations for several years. “Other global markets may have a single dominant mobile carrier, or a small number of banks, or a strong central bank,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin Strategy and Research. “And this has made it easier for them to reconcile a model.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 26, 2011 An article on Thursday about making payments by swiping smartphones rather than credit or debit cards omitted the name of the design firm that employs Jan Chipchase, who commented on possible downsides of the technology. It is Frog Design.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/chase-to-end-debit-card-rewards/?ref=mastercardinc">Chase to End Debit Card Rewards<date>March 21, 2011, 5:07 pm</date><text>Is it time to hunt around for a new debit card that offers rewards? JPMorgan Chase is mailing letters to customers saying that it will stop offering debit card rewards to most customers as of July 19 in response to proposed federal limits on interchange fees. Those are the fees that merchants pay to banks to process transactions over payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. The change was reported today by Bloomberg News. A Chase spokesman, Tom Kelly, declined comment, but provided a sample of a letter that was sent to customers. “Congress recently enacted a new law known as the Durbin Amendment that significantly impacts debit cards,” it read. “As a result of this law, we will be changing our debit rewards program.” Customers who have already accumulated rewards will still be able to use them after July 19, and the bank won’t charge an annual fee any more. JPMorgan Chase isn’t the first bank to back off debit reward programs: PNC Bank and U.S. Bancorp also have rolled back some perks. But Chase is the largest bank so far to do so, raising the question of whether other large institutions will do so, too. A Bank of America spokeswoman said the bank had not made any changes to its rewards program. A Citigroup spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment. Of course, it’s more difficult to switch a debit card with rewards than it is to hunt for a new credit card, because the debit card is linked to your checking or savings account. Getting a better deal would mean finding a new bank. If you’re a Chase debit cardholder, what do you think of the bank’s move? Is the loss of rewards on your debit card enough to prompt you to shop for a new bank?</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/business/economy/02debt.html?ref=mastercardinc">Credit Card Data Tells Mixed Story<date>Published: March 1, 2011</date><text>American shoppers did not shed their reliance on credit cards over the year-end holidays.While the average debt on credit cards in December decreased by 4 percent compared with the same month a year before, Americans still carried an average of $4,284 on credit card statements in December 2010, according to data released this week by the credit monitoring company Experian. The data offers conflicting versions of the economy’s already mixed picture. While some consumers spent more during the holidays because the economy was rebounding, others were still unable to cover expenses without leaning on their credit cards. And while holiday spending also appeared to have been more robust than in the last several years, even more recent data has shown a bit of a slowdown in consumption this year. “You’ve got people who already had good credit and were pretty much managing their credit, and because of the risk, paid down their debt even more,” said Maxine Sweet, vice president for public education at Experian. Then there were “very dramatic increases in debt by people who, mainly, lost jobs, but also had medical emergencies, and turned to credit cards to carry them through the hard times.” The most recent consumer credit report from the Federal Reserve showed that revolving credit, which is mostly credit card debt, increased by 3.5 percent in December at an annual rate, the first such increase in 27 months. (That data included “charge-offs,” or debt that the credit card companies considered essentially uncollectible, while the Experian data, since it was pulled from active credit files, did not.) Card spending (including credit, debit and electronic benefit-transfer cars) was up 6.5 percent in December compared with spending at the same stores a year earlier, according to First Data, which processes merchant transactions. Retailers tend to benefit from credit card spending, as it often means people are spending beyond their budgets. Holiday spending rose 5.5 percent in the 50 days before Christmas in 2010 compared with 2009, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. Much of that was driven by increases in apparel, jewelry and luxury goods. While many shoppers had vowed to spend only with cash this holiday season, that was a budgeting trick that not everyone could use. The cash shoppers, Ms. Sweet suggested, “were the ones that were pretty much in control — they can say, ‘I’m going to be more conservative.’ ” People under more difficult circumstances had to put certain debts on their credit cards, she said. In February, the retail analyst David Strasser issued a note to clients saying that the increase in credit spending was good news. Spending at Visa and MasterCard in the United States was up a combined 8.3 percent for the fourth quarter, Mr. Strasser noted, “a hopeful sign that big-ticket spending is in recovery mode for 2011.” “Weak credit trends have clearly bottomed out,” he wrote, and the increases in credit card spending “will disproportionately help big-ticket retailers that were hit hard during the downturn, as credit was curtailed and consumers lacked liquidity to purchase big-ticket products.” The Experian data, which is broken down by metropolitan area, also gives a sense of how different cities may be recovering from the recession. The city with the highest card debt in December was San Antonio, with $5,177 due on average, 21 percent above the national average. (The figures include debts on regular credit cards and retail Visas and MasterCards, but not a retailer’s own card — so a Gap-brand credit card would not be included, but a Gap Visa card would.) San Antonio was followed by Jacksonville, Fla., at $5,115, a city with one of the lowest average credit scores, suggesting that pure debt may have been piling up there. Dallas, which came in at fifth with $4,936, also has one of the lowest average credit scores in the country. Atlanta was third, with $4,960, and Honolulu, with $4,939, was fourth. In 2009, the list of cities with the most credit card debt was similar: Dallas, Atlanta, San Antonio, Jacksonville and the Waco, Tex., metropolitan area. Jeanie Wyatt, chief executive of the San-Antonio based advisory firm South Texas Money Management, said the economy in the city had been quite steady. “Our unemployment rate is lower than the national average,” she said, “the health care field has been fast-growing, and of course we still have a big military component, and tourism, and a growing energy component. People are feeling, I think, pretty good about their job security.” She said San Antonians were largely living on working-class paychecks, which could explain some of the credit card debt. “While San Antonio has a lower unemployment rate and a more stable economy, our wage earners are at that mid- to lower end,” she said. “I would presume that lower-income individuals tend to have a higher percentage of credit card debt.” 1 2 Next Page » Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Columbus, Ohio, and Nate Schweber from Paramus, N.J.</text></article>

She also met with a range of consumer advocates, including Damon Silvers, the AFL-CIO‘s director of policy. The Treasury Department disclosed the gatherings in its monthly calendar of meetings about the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/your-money/24RURAL.html?ref=mastercardinc">A Reverse Mortgage Can Help Those With No Retirement Savings<date>Published: March 23, 2011</date><text>GRASS VALLEY, Calif.I F you’re worried that you haven’t saved enough for retirement, you’re probably right. Most of us haven’t. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found the majority of American workers had put away less than $25,000 for their golden years. But even those people are in better financial shape than Susanna Wilson, 70, who saved nothing. Her only dependable income is a Social Security check of about $900 a month. “I can never retire,” she said, her voice trembling as she stared at the floor of her living room in Grass Valley, Calif. “Probably about every two weeks when the bills are due, that’s when I get really worried. I think ‘How am I going to pay this one?’ ” It should never have come to this. Ms. Wilson attended the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1950s, though she left before graduating to move to New York and marry her college sweetheart, the Minimalist sculptor and sometime rock musician Walter De Maria. Ms. Wilson spent her prime earning years engaged in various creative endeavors in New York, mostly as a designer. Her clothing line, O’Susanna, found a home in the late 1970s at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale’s. Glamour and Seventeen magazines featured Perfumes by Susanna, including a popular fragrance called Strawberry Love. In her 40s, Ms. Wilson moved to California and became a publicist. At her peak, she made around $65,000 a year, she said, and not a penny of that made its way into a retirement fund. “One thing kind of led to another,” Ms. Wilson said. “I’ve always put all my money into my businesses. And I always thought the business I was in was going to be a great success.” She also raised a daughter, Corie, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with her two children and is not in a position to help her mother financially. Now twice divorced and living alone with her Shetland Sheepdog, Rooney, Ms. Wilson subsists on those government checks, plus a one-day-a-week job at a local jewelry store that pays $12.50 an hour. She received no alimony from either divorce. Ms. Wilson also makes little girls’ dresses under her O’Susanna label, at a vintage Singer Featherweight sewing machine in her dining room. But she sells only about six a month for around $200. Grass Valley, an old gold mining town of 12,300 residents in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, isn’t an expensive place to live. But Ms. Wilson isn’t the only one struggling. Her friend Molly Fisk, 55, a poet and teacher, was visiting the house and joked that her retirement planning was “all tied up in MasterCard futures. Sad but true.” Ms. Wilson would probably manage on her current income, though not without sacrifice, were it not for the debt she had accumulated. All told, she averages about $1,400 in monthly income, including Social Security (adjusted for one of her former husbands’ earnings). A third of that goes toward fixed expenses like utilities. She pays $300 toward a mortgage balance of $5,477. She inherited the house, fully paid off, from her parents, but took out the mortgage a few years ago to pay for repairs. The balance of her income goes toward the monthly minimum payments on $9,000 in credit card debt, racked up for daily living expenses. “I think I might just have to declare bankruptcy,” she said. “I just can’t live with that.” Before she takes that drastic step, Ms. Wilson should consider some other options, said Elizabeth Rutter Baer, a certified financial planner in Lansing, Mich. She worries that Ms. Wilson is “extremely close” to the edge and isn’t getting anywhere with her debt payments because she keeps putting more expenses, like food, on her credit cards. Yes, she could try to find other income, Ms. Baer said. But that’s a short-term solution. At some point, despite her excellent health, Ms. Wilson may not be able to work. “Bankruptcy is possible, but my advice is, let’s liquidate assets and get those debts paid off,” Ms. Baer said. To that end, Ms. Baer recommended something she said she had never before suggested: a reverse mortgage. Such mortgages allow homeowners to tap existing home equity to receive a lump sum or monthly checks. Unlike a home equity loan, however, borrowers don’t have to make any repayments until they no longer live in the home. The strategy can be risky, with high fees and sometimes poor counseling for borrowers. Reverse mortgages are available only to homeowners 62 or older. “Susanna is the ideal candidate,” Ms. Baer said. “This is one instance where it could work.” The house is valued from $150,000 to $200,000. Ms. Baer said Ms. Wilson should work with a bank to see if she could wrap the current mortgage into a reverse and then take cash out. Ms. Wilson is already making phone calls to explore the idea. Ms. Baer also noted that Ms. Wilson was part owner, with her two brothers, of several tracts of timberland in northern California. The land’s value has dropped because of the economy, but Ms. Baer said that shouldn’t stop them from selling it. “Whatever the purpose of this land was before, today’s the rainy day,” she said. “It may not be that much, but at this point $25,000 would change her life, totally.” Ms. Wilson said she was discussing this with her brothers and a real estate agent. Ms. Baer, who is 67 and single, said there were particular financial difficulties facing single people as they aged. Even people in a relationship should make financial plans that can work even if they were to be single during retirement, she said, adding, “Nobody knows who’s going to be there at the end.” Ms. Wilson agreed with that assessment. “I have friends, and they’re two people together, and it’s a lot easier.” At that point she again spoke through tears. “My Mom would say, ‘Why don’t you just go and get married?’ and that’s just not me,” she said. “I believe you have to love somebody.” Ms. Baer’s advice provided a push for her to explore some options she had already thought about, but hadn’t followed through on, Ms. Wilson said, because she had been paralyzed by the fear of what might happen if she could no longer generate extra income. Overcoming that fear will be key to recovering her financial health. And she’s confident that will happen. “I don’t want to be a Pollyanna,” Ms. Wilson said. “But tomorrow is another day.”</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/technology/24wallet.html?ref=mastercardinc">As Phones Become Mobile Wallets, Businesses Want a Share<date>Published: March 23, 2011</date><text>The cellphone has been more than a cellphone for years, but soon it could take on an entirely new role — standing in for all of the credit and debit cards crammed into wallets.Instead of swiping a plastic card at the checkout counter, consumers would merely wave their phones. There’s just one hitch: While the technology is already being installed in millions of phones — and is used overseas — wide adoption of the so-called mobile wallets is being slowed by a major behind-the-scenes battle among corporate giants. Mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies are all vying to control these wallets. But first, they need to sort out what role each will play and how each will get paid. The stakes are enormous because small, hidden fees that are generated every time consumers swipe their cards add up to tens of billions of dollars annually in the United States alone. “It all comes down to who gets paid and who makes money,” said Drew Sievers, chief executive of mFoundry, which makes mobile payment software for merchants and banks. “You have banks competing with carriers competing with Apple and Google, and it’s pretty much a goat rodeo until someone sorts it out.” In one camp are the long-established players. Payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, along with banks that actually issue credit cards to customers, want to stay at the center of any payment system and continue to collect their fees from merchants. They are facing competition from companies they see as interlopers. These include PayPal and Google, which want to play a part in a new payment system, as well as Apple and the mobile carriers, which want to collect fees through their control of the phones themselves. In the middle — and perhaps playing a deciding role — are the retailers. They have to install terminals that accept mobile payments. Consumer advocates, meanwhile, said they were concerned that a mobile system would bring higher fees and questioned whether consumers even want a new system. “Is it possible to make a system that’s too easy to use, where you reduce so much friction from the transaction process that people aren’t necessarily aware of what they’re spending on something?” asked Jan Chipchase, executive creative director at the design firm Frog Design, who studies mobile payments. Credit card and technology companies have talked about mobile wallets for well over a decade. But now, finally, the pieces are starting to fall into place. “Now that we have this commitment by the handset manufacturers and telcos, I think things are looking far more promising than ever,” said Gwenn Bézard, research director at the Aite Group, a research and advisory firm focused on the financial services industry. “The question is, Are telcos and card networks and banks going to agree on anything?” Visa and MasterCard now dominate the major tracks that shuttle credit card and debit payments between banks and retailers. Retailers must pay the banks issuing the cards a percentage of each transaction, and payment networks like Visa take a small cut. So for every $1 spent by a consumer, the retailer keeps about 97 cents, the card-issuing bank takes nearly 2 cents and the remaining penny goes to the merchant’s bank handling the transaction and the payment network. With mobile payments, it is still unclear how all the players will get paid or if any of the costs will trickle through to consumers, perhaps through new fees. Mobile carriers may demand that the card issuers pay them something akin to rent, or reach some other agreement, to store important payment credentials on a secure piece of the chip inside the phone. There are several technologies that allow phones to communicate wirelessly with other technologies, though the front-runner for payments is one called near-field communication, or N.F.C. “I think watching the industry evolve will determine where we need to go,” said Peter Ho, product manager for Wells Fargo’s card services and consumer lending, adding that the banking industry’s past conversations with mobile carriers had not been fruitful because they could not agree on financial terms. The mobile carriers’ frustration with the banks, some analysts said, was the impetus behind a joint venture by Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Discover to create their own mobile wallet. The venture, known as Isis, is expected to introduce its system next year. Barclaycard, already a major player in Britain, will be the first issuer of the group’s in-phone credit card and sees it as an opportunity to expand in the United States. Referring to the carriers’ 200 million customers, Amer Sajed, chief executive for Barclaycard US, said, “It’s phenomenal for us to be able to leverage such a large customer base, right as the customer is getting or updating their mobile device.” The banks and credit card issuers, meanwhile, have found a way to temporarily avoid working with the cellphone carriers. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp and JPMorgan Chase, working with Visa, are all in various stages of testing wallets that would provide access to some of their own credit or debit cards. Because their model is powered by a chip that consumers insert into a slot in certain phones, it does not require the cooperation of the mobile operators. Visa said some of its bank partners might introduce mobile payments in the second half of this year. But that variation may become outmoded as more phones with embedded chips become available. Visa said it was also working with other providers to ensure that its network would work in all wallets. (As to the issue of security, several banks and payment networks said that mobile wallets would require a pass code and could be disabled remotely if a phone was stolen. Consumers would not be responsible for transactions they did not make.) Apple and Google already have payment systems — Apple’s iTunes has 200 million accounts tied to credit cards, while Google Checkout has been less popular. Both could be turned into mobile wallets, allowing users to pay for offline purchases with their Apple or Google accounts. But they would need access to the cellphone chips and the merchants’ terminals. Apple could make its own cellphone chips to make this all happen, but Google could not because it makes only Android cellphone software, not the phones themselves. Getting retailers on board is important to the widespread adoption of the mobile payments because many merchants will have to replace their card terminals. While one analyst estimated, conservatively, that only 5.9 percent of merchants will accept mobile payments by 2015, Mr. Bézard of Aite Group said that many of the large retailers — including McDonald’s and CVS — already had the terminals and thus could take part whenever the payment network was figured out. And, he said, 80 percent of consumer transactions occur at the top 200 merchants. Mobile payments have taken off more readily in other countries, using a variety of technologies. In Africa, where many people do not have credit cards, mobile phones have often replaced cash. And in Japan, people have been swiping phones at convenience stores and bus stations for several years. “Other global markets may have a single dominant mobile carrier, or a small number of banks, or a strong central bank,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at Javelin Strategy and Research. “And this has made it easier for them to reconcile a model.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: March 26, 2011 An article on Thursday about making payments by swiping smartphones rather than credit or debit cards omitted the name of the design firm that employs Jan Chipchase, who commented on possible downsides of the technology. It is Frog Design.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/21/chase-to-end-debit-card-rewards/?ref=mastercardinc">Chase to End Debit Card Rewards<date>March 21, 2011, 5:07 pm</date><text>Is it time to hunt around for a new debit card that offers rewards? JPMorgan Chase is mailing letters to customers saying that it will stop offering debit card rewards to most customers as of July 19 in response to proposed federal limits on interchange fees. Those are the fees that merchants pay to banks to process transactions over payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. The change was reported today by Bloomberg News. A Chase spokesman, Tom Kelly, declined comment, but provided a sample of a letter that was sent to customers. “Congress recently enacted a new law known as the Durbin Amendment that significantly impacts debit cards,” it read. “As a result of this law, we will be changing our debit rewards program.” Customers who have already accumulated rewards will still be able to use them after July 19, and the bank won’t charge an annual fee any more. JPMorgan Chase isn’t the first bank to back off debit reward programs: PNC Bank and U.S. Bancorp also have rolled back some perks. But Chase is the largest bank so far to do so, raising the question of whether other large institutions will do so, too. A Bank of America spokeswoman said the bank had not made any changes to its rewards program. A Citigroup spokesman wasn’t immediately available to comment. Of course, it’s more difficult to switch a debit card with rewards than it is to hunt for a new credit card, because the debit card is linked to your checking or savings account. Getting a better deal would mean finding a new bank. If you’re a Chase debit cardholder, what do you think of the bank’s move? Is the loss of rewards on your debit card enough to prompt you to shop for a new bank?</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/19/your-money/19money.html?ref=mastercardinc">Rebuilding Your Credit Score - Your Money<date>Published: February 18, 2011</date><text>Millions of consumers have fallen out of favor with the credit scoring gods.Some lost their jobs or were just overwhelmed by mounting debt. Others got caught up in the real estate bubble or had major medical bills. Whatever the reason, the rising number of foreclosures, short sales, late credit card payments and the ultimate credit sin — bankruptcies — have left black marks on credit reports most everywhere. So what can these people do to repair their credit? The simple answer is to focus on the information that is used to generate the all-powerful FICO score — the measure used most frequently by traditional lenders to determine creditworthiness. Its scale runs from 300 points to 850 points; the higher the score, the better your credit standing. “FICO is still the 500-pound gorilla,” said John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com. “In 2011, the best way to get credit from the mainstream lenders is to have a good FICO score.” Consumers can hope that the banks will eventually consider alternatives to the traditional FICO score, which was developed by Fair Isaac Corporation and has been in wide use for about two decades. After all, as banks regain their appetite for lending, they will be looking for ways to differentiate between borrowers with the same scores, some of whom are temporarily struggling and others who chronically have trouble with money. For now, though, the FICO score reigns. The best antidote to a poor score is time. Still, there are a half dozen ways to speed the process, or, at the least, avoid even more credit trouble. What to Do ASSESS YOUR SITUATION Before you even start to think about rehabilitating your credit, make sure that you can pay your bills on time and not do any more harm. If keeping up with your credit card bills is still an issue, then call the issuer, explain your situation and try to negotiate payments you can afford. Ask the issuer how that will be reported to the major three credit bureaus: Not paid as agreed, which can hurt your score? Or will the new terms say that you are now paying as agreed? “You have to get in writing that this is what they agreed to do,” said Mechel Glass, director of education at CredAbility, a nonprofit consumer credit counseling agency. Ditto for other providers, like utility companies. Then, assess all the damage by getting a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus through annualcreditreport.com. Each of the major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian and TransUnion — generate their own FICO scores based on the data they collect. Two versions of your FICO score are also available for $19.95 each, through myFico.com. How far your credit score has fallen will depend on where it started, as well as the frequency and severity of your credit mistakes. If you had almost perfect credit, but because of the loss of a job your credit card bills ended up at a collection agency, you can expect to lose anywhere from 80 to 150 points from your FICO score. A short sale or foreclosure? Both, Mr. Ulzheimer said, “would turn a FICO 790 into a FICO 590 overnight.” CLEAN UP YOUR SCORE Start with the low-hanging fruit. Let’s say you were late paying a bill from a company that no longer exists, or a bank that has since merged with a larger institution. If the credit reporting bureaus cannot verify the accuracy of that black mark, they are required to remove it. “Not only does it have to be correct, but it has to be verifiable,” Mr. Ulzheimer said. Next, focus on paying off the loans — namely, credit cards — that will help give your score the most lift. Paying off a mortgage, a student loan or other installment debts, like car loans, feels good but that won’t necessarily do much for your credit score. You also want to get your so-called debt utilization rate into good shape. FICO considers how the total amount of debt on each of your credit cards compares with your total available credit. The credit score “elite” — that is, people with FICO scores above 760 — typically don’t have debts that exceed 7 percent of their available credit. But if you are at 50 percent and can get the rate down to 30 percent, that will help. LEAVE A NOTE Because prospective employers may pull a copy of your credit report, consider adding the equivalent of a doctor’s note to each of your reports explaining your hardship, like a job loss. All three major credit bureaus allow you to add a brief statement through their Web sites. FICO doesn’t consider these statements when formulating scores, however, so don’t expect it to sway lenders. GET SECURED CARDS It will obviously be hard to get a traditional credit card when you have a poor credit history. Secured cards, if used strategically, can help nurse your credit back to health more quickly. These cards require you to put a set amount of money in a bank account, say $250 or $500, which is used as collateral. And the amount of available credit should be equivalent to the amount on deposit. “What is the most predictive and powerful in your score are the things you’ve done most recently,” Mr. Ulzheimer said. “That cuts both ways. If you add a secured card and you pay it religiously and the balance is low, it will help your score a lot more quickly than if you do nothing.” But read the fine print before signing up. Consumer advocates said some unscrupulous card issuers have charged the security deposit to the card. And be sure the issuer reports your payment information to the big three credit bureaus, since not all do. Curtis Arnold, the founder of CardRatings.com, recommended two cards, both of which report payments to the big three: the Orchard Bank Secured MasterCard, which has an attractive interest rate of 7.9 percent, waives the annual fee in the first year and charges a moderate $35 annually thereafter. He also likes the Citi Secured MasterCard, largely because it offers an interest rate on the security deposit equivalent to an 18-month certificate of deposit, which he says is an industry first. TALK TO A CREDIT UNION These institutions may be more willing to work with members who have checkered histories. Their offerings vary, but they may be more likely to consider alternative credit scores, offer free credit counseling or have products tailored for people with poor credit histories. “Certainly, many credit unions have credit builder or rebuilder loans, often structured as a loan with a built-in savings component so that a person gradually builds up funds that can act as partial collateral,” said Clifford Rosenthal, the president of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, a trade association representing credit unions in low- and moderate-income areas. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/business/economy/09fed.html?ref=mastercardinc">Fed Seeks to Identify Firms That Pose ‘Systemic’ Risk<date>Published: February 8, 2011</date><text>Federal regulators on Tuesday took an expansive view of the types of companies that could be deemed essential enough to the financial system that they should be subjected to greater oversight.The Federal Reserve, in a 22-page proposal required by the Dodd-Frank financial legislation, outlined initial criteria for identifying ”systemically important financial institutions,” whose collapse would pose a serious threat to the economy. The Fed says at least 35 companies, all of them big banks, may pose systemic risks, but that number could grow to include nonbanks like large hedge funds, insurers, asset managers and consumer finance companies. Even payment companies like Visa and MasterCard could face greater oversight under the Fed’s proposed guidelines. “They have made sure that nobody is going to be excluded on a definitional basis,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at MF Global. “What’s left to play out is how regulators employ this authority.” To determine whether a company is systemically important, the proposal suggests regulators first look at a company’s two most recent fiscal years to see if more than 85 percent of its assets or revenues were tied to financial activities. It leaves room for judgments on a “case-by-case basis,” giving regulators wide discretion. For financial companies, the distinction is not trivial. Those deemed systemically important will face higher capital requirements and tougher regulatory scrutiny. They could also be forced to break up if they started teetering. Policy makers hope the expanded definition of “too big to fail” can help avoid a repeat of the abrupt collapse of Lehman Brothers, which helped set off a financial crisis. The Fed guidelines represent only the first stage of a lengthy process and could cause new lobbying by the financial industry. Even before the plan’s release, representatives from the hedge fund industry — including officials from D.E. Shaw and Paulson &amp; Company — met with Fed officials to discuss how firms would be designated. So did BlackRock, the asset manager, and the Financial Services Roundtable, a group representing the nation’s largest banks and insurance companies. Now that the proposed criteria have been made public, more firms may ratchet up their efforts to avoid being deemed systemic — or at least try to press for less onerous oversight. The proposal will remain open for public comment through March 30. By midyear, the Fed plans to submit final rules for approval by the Federal Stability Oversight Council, a board of top financial regulators responsible for executing the policies set forth by the Dodd-Frank Act. The council’s work will result in a new list of systemically important firms. About 35 big banks, each with assets of $50 billion or more, will automatically make the cut. This group includes Wall Street giants like Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs as well as the 16 or so other large banks that were required to undergo comprehensive stress tests during the depths of the financial crisis. But nonbanks could also face harsher oversight if they have $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, or if their businesses were so closely intertwined with large traditional banks that they could put the broader financial system at risk. That may rope in big investment firms, like Citadel, the Fortress Group and Blackstone; large insurers like the American International Group and the Hartford; and big money managers like Fidelity Investments and Vanguard. Consumer and specialty lenders like General Electric Capital and the CIT Group could also be included. The new guidelines also define “data processing, data storage, data transmission services” as financial activities, meaning credit bureaus like Experian as well as payment companies like First Data, Visa and MasterCard could fall under the new rules since their businesses are closely tied to the giant banks. Officials from these companies said they were studying the proposed guidelines, declined to comment or did not return phone calls.</text></article>

The company reported a quarterly profit of $415 million, or $3.16 a share, compared with $294 million, or $2.24 a share, a year earlier. Cross-border volumes, which indicate that people are traveling more and using their cards in foreign countries, grew almost 19 percent. MasterCard, like its larger rival, Visa, is benefiting from a rebound in business travel. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which also reported quarterly earnings on Thursday, is among the hotel companies and airlines that are reporting higher-than-expected profits as companies in the United States spend more money on employee travel. MaterCard’s “earnings showed some really nice fundamental progress,” said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of the money management firm W. P. Stewart. “These are signs both that banks are issuing cards, and cardholders are using their cards again,” he said, “so we’re getting back to normal.” Stock in MasterCard, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., rose $6, to close at $245.39 a share.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Wikileaks-t.html?ref=mastercardinc">The Times's Dealings With Julian Assange<date>Published: January 26, 2011</date><text>This past June, Alan Rusbridger, the editor of The Guardian, phoned me and asked, mysteriously, whether I had any idea how to arrange a secure communication. Not really, I confessed. The Times doesn’t have encrypted phone lines, or a Cone of Silence. Well then, he said, he would try to speak circumspectly. In a roundabout way, he laid out an unusual proposition: an organization called WikiLeaks, a secretive cadre of antisecrecy vigilantes, had come into possession of a substantial amount of classified United States government communications. WikiLeaks’s leader, Julian Assange, an eccentric former computer hacker of Australian birth and no fixed residence, offered The Guardian half a million military dispatches from the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq. There might be more after that, including an immense bundle of confidential diplomatic cables. The Guardian suggested — to increase the impact as well as to share the labor of handling such a trove — that The New York Times be invited to share this exclusive bounty. The source agreed. Was I interested?I was interested. The adventure that ensued over the next six months combined the cloak-and-dagger intrigue of handling a vast secret archive with the more mundane feat of sorting, searching and understanding a mountain of data. As if that were not complicated enough, the project also entailed a source who was elusive, manipulative and volatile (and ultimately openly hostile to The Times and The Guardian); an international cast of journalists; company lawyers committed to keeping us within the bounds of the law; and an array of government officials who sometimes seemed as if they couldn’t decide whether they wanted to engage us or arrest us. By the end of the year, the story of this wholesale security breach had outgrown the story of the actual contents of the secret documents and generated much breathless speculation that something — journalism, diplomacy, life as we know it — had profoundly changed forever. Soon after Rusbridger’s call, we sent Eric Schmitt, from our Washington bureau, to London. Schmitt has covered military affairs expertly for years, has read his share of classified military dispatches and has excellent judgment and an unflappable demeanor. His main assignment was to get a sense of the material. Was it genuine? Was it of public interest? He would also report back on the proposed mechanics of our collaboration with The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel, which Assange invited as a third guest to his secret smorgasbord. Schmitt would also meet the WikiLeaks leader, who was known to a few Guardian journalists but not to us. Schmitt’s first call back to The Times was encouraging. There was no question in his mind that the Afghanistan dispatches were genuine. They were fascinating — a diary of a troubled war from the ground up. And there were intimations of more to come, especially classified cables from the entire constellation of American diplomatic outposts. WikiLeaks was holding those back for now, presumably to see how this venture with the establishment media worked out. Over the next few days, Schmitt huddled in a discreet office at The Guardian, sampling the trove of war dispatches and discussing the complexities of this project: how to organize and study such a voluminous cache of information; how to securely transport, store and share it; how journalists from three very different publications would work together without compromising their independence; and how we would all assure an appropriate distance from Julian Assange. We regarded Assange throughout as a source, not as a partner or collaborator, but he was a man who clearly had his own agenda. By the time of the meetings in London, WikiLeaks had already acquired a measure of international fame or, depending on your point of view, notoriety. Shortly before I got the call from The Guardian, The New Yorker published a rich and colorful profile of Assange, by Raffi Khatchadourian, who had embedded with the group. WikiLeaks’s biggest coup to that point was the release, last April, of video footage taken from one of two U.S. helicopters involved in firing down on a crowd and a building in Baghdad in 2007, killing at least 18 people. While some of the people in the video were armed, others gave no indication of menace; two were in fact journalists for the news agency Reuters. The video, with its soundtrack of callous banter, was horrifying to watch and was an embarrassment to the U.S. military. But in its zeal to make the video a work of antiwar propaganda, WikiLeaks also released a version that didn’t call attention to an Iraqi who was toting a rocket-propelled grenade and packaged the manipulated version under the tendentious rubric “Collateral Murder.” (See the edited and non-edited videos here.) Throughout our dealings, Assange was coy about where he obtained his secret cache. But the suspected source of the video, as well as the military dispatches and the diplomatic cables to come, was a disillusioned U.S. Army private first class named Bradley Manning, who had been arrested and was being kept in solitary confinement. On the fourth day of the London meeting, Assange slouched into The Guardian office, a day late. Schmitt took his first measure of the man who would be a large presence in our lives. “He’s tall — probably 6-foot-2 or 6-3 — and lanky, with pale skin, gray eyes and a shock of white hair that seizes your attention,” Schmitt wrote to me later. “He was alert but disheveled, like a bag lady walking in off the street, wearing a dingy, light-colored sport coat and cargo pants, dirty white shirt, beat-up sneakers and filthy white socks that collapsed around his ankles. He smelled as if he hadn’t bathed in days.” Assange shrugged a huge backpack off his shoulders and pulled out a stockpile of laptops, cords, cellphones, thumb drives and memory sticks that held the WikiLeaks secrets. The reporters had begun preliminary work on the Afghanistan field reports, using a large Excel spreadsheet to organize the material, then plugging in search terms and combing the documents for newsworthy content. They had run into a puzzling incongruity: Assange said the data included dispatches from the beginning of 2004 through the end of 2009, but the material on the spreadsheet ended abruptly in April 2009. A considerable amount of material was missing. Assange, slipping naturally into the role of office geek, explained that they had hit the limits of Excel. Open a second spreadsheet, he instructed. They did, and the rest of the data materialized — a total of 92,000 reports from the battlefields of Afghanistan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Next Page » Bill Keller is the executive editor of The New York Times.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/business/25amex.html?ref=mastercardinc">Revenue Grows 13% at American Express<date>Published: January 24, 2011</date><text>The American Express Company, the credit card lender and payment network, said Monday that its fourth-quarter revenue grew 13 percent from the period a year earlier, as consumer spending increased and the company earned more from fees.The company said that it had $7.3 billion of total revenue net of interest expense in the quarter, compared with $6.5 billion a year earlier. American Express narrowly missed analysts’ expectations last week when it said it had earned $1.1 billion, or 88 cents a share, for the quarter. It also said it was cutting 550 customer service jobs. The company said the increase in revenue resulted from an accounting change as well as increased spending on American Express cards. The chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in the earnings statement that customers increased their spending on their cards by 15 percent in the quarter. The company also benefited from fewer losses on soured loans. “Unemployment levels and housing remain a concern, but other aspects of the economy continue to show signs of improvement,” he said. American Express, which lends directly to consumers but also competes with Visa and MasterCard to process credit card transactions, has recovered from the financial crisis more fully than many other consumer lenders. The company’s shares closed down less than 1 percent at $45.79 on Monday, and fell about 1.1 percent in after-hours trading.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/your-money/brokerage-and-bank-accounts/15money.html?ref=mastercardinc">As Big Banks Raise Fees, You Have Options — Your Money<date>Published: January 14, 2011</date><text>So now we know what the big banks’ New Year’s resolution was: Keep the profits flowing from basic checking accounts.Earlier this month, Bank of America announced its intent to test a number of different monthly fees for customers in some states, depending on the balance in their accounts or other relationships with the institution. Right before the new year, meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase informed customers that under certain circumstances it would add monthly fees to many of the accounts it inherited from the now-deceased Washington Mutual. This must feel awfully good for the veteran branch banking executives at Chase who looked stingy by comparison when WaMu ran ads all over the United States in the 1990s and 2000s telling consumers that free checking was a basic human right. But Chase sure doesn’t sound happy. In a remarkable display of staying on message, it gave the same comment last week when The Wall Street Journal, CNN Money and the trade publication US Banker asked it to explain the reasoning for the new monthly fees. “We don’t want to raise fees on our customers,” a company spokesman said. “But unfortunately, regulation is forcing us to do it. And as a result, some customers may end up unbanked.” This statement is striking for a number of reasons, and the eye-popping earnings the bank announced on Friday don’t exactly make the company more worthy of sympathy. So I’ve spent the last week trying to figure out why I was so sure I did not believe it the instant I read it. So let’s take it apart, shall we? First of all, Chase does want to raise fees on customers. It’s not the only bank that wants to, and this is a fine thing if you are a shareholder. After all, any business ought to strive to produce a product or offer a service that is so good or necessary that customers will keep on using it even after a price increase. What companies don’t want to do is raise fees so much that they attract the attention of regulators or people who do what I do for a living. Yet this is exactly what the banks have done in the last decade. First, they raised overdraft fees until the fees were often many times higher than the amount of the actual transaction that pushed the account balance below zero. At the same time, the banks and their partners at Visa and MasterCard forced merchants to pay ever more for the privilege of accepting these cards. Eventually, consumers and merchants howled loud enough in protest that we ended up with overdraft fee regulation. There is also a Federal Reserve proposal percolating that may allow merchants to pay big banks much less when they accept those banks’ debit cards. And so we arrive at Part 2 of Chase’s statement: regulators are making the bank raise prices. Um, no. Regulators are making it lower prices, or at least make fees more transparent. All actors in this play do have the ability to improvise. And some of the big banks relied heavily on overdraft fees to hit whatever internal goals they set for themselves in their branch banking units. Chase, for instance, estimated that the overdraft legislation would cost it about $700 million a year. It’s also worried sick about the possibility of earning much less from merchant fees. Chase and similar banks have to make that up somehow. But it’s not regulators that are making them do so. Shareholders are. So it’s no wonder that you generally don’t hear this sort of reasoning from, say, credit unions, which are subject to the same rules but don’t ultimately answer to the same master. It is true that many more banks (and some credit unions, too, no doubt) will add monthly fees to their checking accounts, especially now that bigger institutions like Chase and Bank of America have given them cover. But they won’t all do so. In fact, ING Direct, the online banking colossus, wasted no time last week in sending out gleeful notes reminding the world that it has always offered free checking in an interest-bearing account and will continue to do so. Finally, Chase worries about those who will abandon its checking accounts in the wake of its price increase. And by fretting that those people will end up “unbanked,” it invokes the bogeyman — the rapacious check casher standing behind bulletproof glass in a grimy strip mall somewhere hard by the liquor store. I sincerely doubt, however, that many former bank customers, having tasted the good life with a debit card and nice people on the phone who can help when the card isn’t working, will turn to check-cashing enterprises if they get fed up with monthly bank fees. In fact, there is an entire niche of the card industry that has quietly grown up to serve them in recent years. Known variously as “prepaid” or “reloadable” cards, this is plastic that has a Visa or MasterCard logo and works a lot like a debit card. You can use it in a store or to buy something on Amazon.com or to reserve a rental car. The difference is you don’t get the card at a bank. Instead, a company like Green Dot offers it online and sells it on a rack in various stores next to the gift card displays. In fact, Green Dot has about 3.3 million active accounts, many of which it has issued with Wal-Mart under the “Walmart MoneyCard” brand. Cardholders in the Green Dot system had loaded about $10 billion onto the cards as of Sept. 30, 2010. This is not a free service, though it can come pretty close. With the Green Dot-branded card, it’s free to buy and activate the card online, though it can cost up to $4.95 if you do it in person (the Wal-Mart card pricing is slightly different). Then, there’s the $5.95 monthly fee, but the company waives it if you make 30 purchases or more or load $1,000 or more onto it in a month. Also, there’s a $2.50 A.T.M. fee for people who don’t use machines that are part of Green Dot’s partner network. The money does not earn interest after consumers load it onto the card. Direct deposit is possible, as is online bill paying, and the funds are insured by the F.D.I.C., which makes the product an awful lot like an online bank. There are no overdraft fees, though. Green Dot simply doesn’t put the transaction through if it determines that you don’t have enough money to cover it. Green Dot takes in about $5 a month per cardholder in user fees. For consumers doing comparison shopping who don’t mind losing access to a teller and paper checks, that makes it competitive with old-fashioned banks that are now charging $8 and up for customers who don’t maintain minimum balance levels or have the right relationships with the bank. Regulators could subject Green Dot to more scrutiny at some point. Meanwhile, the federal government is partnering with the company on a pilot program to deposit income tax refunds directly onto prepaid cards. That said, prepaid card customers who don’t know any better can easily end up in the wrong hands. Last year, the Kardashian sisters, famous mostly for dating other famous people and humiliating themselves on television, invited further embarrassment when the Connecticut attorney general questioned the legality of a prepaid “kard” marketed with their name on it. In the face of criticism over high fees, they got themselves out of the deal. So there is risk for consumers who turn their backs on the banks and their new fees. But most people won’t, and the banks know this. Changing checking accounts is a pain. Convenience matters, too, for people who need to deposit cash or have other reasons to lean heavily on a branch. Those who do make the change can switch to a credit union or the ING Directs of the world. And as more people see Green Dot’s commercials, they’ll realize there are other alternatives that can be cheaper if they’re careful with the products. Meanwhile, Green Dot’s founder and chief executive, Steve Streit, says that he’s reasonably certain that major banks are quietly planning to introduce their own reloadable prepaid cards. Perhaps he’s a bit paranoid. But you can bet that if his company gets big enough, plenty of big banks will mimic his product. After all, once they do have similar cards, they’ll have a convenient place to dump checking account customers who are no longer profitable enough to make the shareholders happy.</text></article>

The editors of credit card comparison site CardRatings.com recently announced their  take on the worst and best credit cards of 2010. The cards rated the worst included those with high rates, high fees and little disclosure while those rated the best “bucked a trend toward fewer rewards and higher fees” while offering “ value, service, and convenience.” So which cards made the cut? Among the cards cited for the editors’ “Razzie Awards for the Worst Credit Cards of 2010” were a new First Premier MasterCard with “an astonishing 79.99 percent A.P.R.” (cited for having the highest interest rate) and the short-lived prepaid debit card endorsed by the Kardashians (cited for being the most hated card). Also on the list were Best Buy’s Reward Zone MasterCard, which CardRatings.com said had little disclosure of details, and the Applied Bank Unsecured Visa Gold Card, which CardRatings.com said was the most expensive way to rebuild credit. CardRatings noted that the Applied Bank card offered no grace period, meaning that interest begins accruing on your purchase the moment you swipe your card, not three or four weeks later as most credit cards do. Meanwhile, cards that the editors rated the best in the cash-back category were the PenFed Visa Platinum Cashback Rewards Card and the Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express Card. In the airline and travel credit card category, the PenFed Premium Travel Rewards American Express Card and Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card were rated the best. The Simmons Visa Platinum and the PenFed Promise Visa Card, meanwhile, were cited as the best low-interest rate cards and the Citi Platinum Select MasterCard and the Discover More Card were cited for being the best low-introductory rate credit cards. CardRatings.com, meanwhile, cited the Chase Sapphire Card and Zync from American Express for being the best reward point credit cards. CardRatings.com also released new ratings of the cards it said consumers liked best, which included: -Best Cash Back Credit Card: Blue Cash from American Express -Best Airline Credit Card: Blue Sky from American Express -Best Reward Points Credit Card: Chase Sapphire Card -Best Value Credit Card: USAA World MasterCard -Best Customer Service: American Express The consumer results were based on responses collected from September through December. How do the results compare to your own experiences? What would you rate the best and worst credit cards of 2010?</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/business/03wikileaks-bank.html?ref=mastercardinc">Facing WikiLeaks Threat, Bank of America Plays Defense<date>Published: January 2, 2011</date><text>By the time the conference call ended, it was nearly midnight at Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., but the bank’s counterespionage work was only just beginning.A day earlier, on Nov. 29, the director of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, said in an interview that he intended to “take down” a major American bank and reveal an “ecosystem of corruption” with a cache of data from an executive’s hard drive. With Bank of America’s share price falling on the widely held suspicion that the hard drive was theirs, the executives on the call concluded it was time to take action. Since then, a team of 15 to 20 top Bank of America officials, led by the chief risk officer, Bruce R. Thompson, has been overseeing a broad internal investigation — scouring thousands of documents in the event that they become public, reviewing every case where a computer has gone missing and hunting for any sign that its systems might have been compromised. In addition to the internal team drawn from departments like finance, technology, legal and communications, the bank has brought in Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, to help manage the review. It has also sought advice from several top law firms about legal problems that could arise from a disclosure, including the bank’s potential liability if private information was disclosed about clients. The company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, receives regular updates on the team’s progress, according to one Bank of America executive familiar with the team’s work, who, like other bank officials, was granted anonymity to discuss the confidential inquiry. Whether Mr. Assange is bluffing, or indeed has Bank of America in its sights at all, the bank’s defense strategy represents the latest twist in the controversy over WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange. The United States government has been examining whether Mr. Assange, an Australian, could be charged criminally for the release by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of classified Pentagon and State Department diplomatic cables that became the subject of articles in The New York Times and other publications last month. The Swedish government is also seeking to question Mr. Assange about rape accusations against him. As he fights extradition from Britain in that case, he remains under house arrest in an English mansion. Mr. Assange has said the timing of the rape accusations was not coincidental, and that he was the victim of a smear campaign led by the United States government. Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Assange’s threats have grown more credible with every release of secret documents, including those concerning the dumping of toxic waste in Africa, the treatment of prisoners held by the United States at Guantánamo Bay, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and, most recently, the trove of diplomatic cables. That Mr. Assange might shift his attention to a private company — especially one as politically unpopular as Bank of America or any of its rivals, which have been stained by taxpayer-financed bailouts and the revelation of improper foreclosure practices — raises a new kind of corporate threat, combining elements of law, technology, public policy, politics and public relations. “This is a significant moment, and Bank of America has to get out in front of it,” said Richard S. Levick, a veteran crisis communications expert. “Corporate America needs to look at what happens here, and how Bank of America handles it.” Last month, the bank bought up Web addresses that could prove embarrassing to the company or its top executives in the event of a large-scale public assault, but a spokesman for the bank said the move was unrelated to any possible leak. Then, on Dec. 18, Bank of America may have antagonized Mr. Assange further when it said it would join other companies like MasterCard and PayPal in halting the processing of payments intended for WikiLeaks, citing the possibility the organization’s activities might be illegal. Mr. Assange has never said explicitly that the data he possesses comes from Bank of America, which is the nation’s largest bank, though he did say that the disclosure would take place sometime early this year. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Dash and Louise Story contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/business/24jewelry.html?ref=mastercardinc">Men Turn to Jewelry for Last-Minute Purchases<date>Published: December 23, 2010</date><text>SEATTLE — At this time of year, jewelers rely on last-minute men.They are the spouses, the boyfriends, the loved ones, all who, up until this week, have been steering clear of malls and anything that requires gift-wrapping. But in these last few days, they have suddenly assumed a predictable stance, bending over glass counters and snapping up necklaces, bracelets and rings. During what retailers call “desperation week,” spending on jewelry stands out, spiking high at the end of the holiday season. And the procrastinating male shopper gets much of the credit. “You’re talking about a lot of male purchases, a lot of last-minute purchases there,” said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks all sales. “That tends to be an area where you can get a lot of purchasing done in a very efficient amount of time.” Both higher-end retailers, like Tiffany and De Beers Diamond Jewellers, and mass chains like J. C. Penney say that this week is typically strong for jewelry. Last year, for instance, more than $709 million was spent on jewelry on Dec. 23 and 24 alone, representing 10 percent of the entire month’s jewelry sales, according to SpendingPulse. This year, with jewelry sales up just slightly at the front end of the holiday rush, and the price of gold rising, retailers are depending heavily on what they see as the manly tradition. They consider themselves experts on the procrastinating male, especially when it comes to sparkle and glitter. Alexis Bittar, who sells jewelry at his own stores as well as at 650 retailers worldwide like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, has witnessed the seasonal gender shift among his shoppers. More than half his customers are men during this busy week, but drop to about 5 percent at any other time of the year. “I think men, I don’t want to say they’re not as thoughtful, because that sounds wrong, but their thoughtfulness seems to tip toward the last week before Christmas,” Mr. Bittar said. Alex Allen, who works at a downtown Seattle mutual fund company, used his lunch hour this week to dip in and out of Tiffany’s, and conceded that he personified the last-minute male shopper. “I have 20 minutes left,” Mr. Allen declared. “I know exactly what I’m doing. I have a plan.” He chose a pair of silver beaded earrings for his girlfriend. “Last Christmas, I did get her jewelry as well. She enjoys it, and it’s a good investment,” he said. “Clothes, she’ll grow out of, and if I’m going to spend a decent amount of money, I would prefer it’s something she’ll have for a long time.” “I’m a procrastinator, and every year I tell myself I’m going to start earlier, and I don’t,” Mr. Allen said. “Maybe I enjoy the adrenaline rush.” Like Mr. Allen, 21 percent of men surveyed, according to a recent Consumer Reports poll, had not started their shopping by Dec. 19, compared with 13 percent of women. Researchers and analysts also suggest that marketing plays on gender stereotypes, too, influencing what men tend to buy. “Ritual behavior, including gift-giving and the creation of the holidays, is still traditionally relegated as women’s work, because it falls into the sphere of the domestic,” Cele C. Otnes, a professor at the University of Illinois’s College of Business who studies consumer behavior and advertising, said via e-mail. “Women are the main purveyors of the gift culture, but men realize (a little later than women) in the season that there is this little aspect to gift giving called reciprocity, which sets men in motion.” “Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the main jewelry chains engage in heavy promotion in places where men can be found — during certain TV programs and in the newspaper,” Professor Otnes said. Jewelry is a safe bet for most men, says Nelson Barber, an associate professor at University of New Hampshire’s Whittemore School of Business and Economics, who researches shopping behavior. Men tend to feel less rewarded by purchases and consumption than women do, he said. Instead, they choose gifts that impress. Buying clothes like a blouse, for example, carries a high potential for error. He posited these outcomes: A wrong size — (“So you think I look this big?” or “So you want me to look this small?”); an ill-suited color (“This makes me look washed out”); or an unfashionable fashion (“This is for an older woman”). Also, men do not like to ask for help, which clothes buying almost always requires, and they would rather “grab something easy to buy, rather than appear not to know something,” Professor Barber said. “Women are more social, and communicating with others is a solid way to affirm the selections, beliefs or share ideas without any fear of failure.” With jewelry, “waiting until the last moment is easy, and can suggest thoughtful reflection by the male shopper,” he said. At Silverworks, a store in a downtown Seattle mall, Mike Pfab, a graphic designer, conceded that he was among those who wait too long to shop. “I always run out of time, and I’m a bad, bad procrastinator,” said Mr. Pfab, 38, who was on his lunch break. He settled on a pair of dangly earrings and a sparkly cherry-shaped keychain for his wife. She would also get, he said, “whatever else I find from now until Christmas Eve.” Mr. Bittar, the jewelry designer, issues an entire set of instructions to sales clerks to help guide men like Mr. Pfab. “When the panic sets in, the guys need more steering,” he said. He coaches employees to ask about the colors that spouses or partners wear, whether they prefer gold or silver, and if they favor big or small earrings. “They don’t know what they’re looking at, and unless they have great taste and style, they’re really unsure of themselves and that really comes across,” Mr. Bittar said. At a Nordstrom here, Bryant Higgins, 71, said he had learned his wife’s dislikes over the years, but still could not settle on the right gift this time. “I don’t get her earrings, because she’s fussy about her earrings and I never get it right,” said Mr. Higgins, a salesman at Sears. He had been looking at necklaces and bracelets, guessing that she would prefer smaller, classic styles over the bigger, more contemporary ones. “Everything else is done,” Mr. Higgins said of his Christmas shopping, “but my wife. That’s probably common for me.” Kevin Lewis, a retired floor-covering salesman, had returned to Tiffany after browsing there with his wife last week, hoping to surprise her with some crystal votives she had admired. Other than that, he plans to get her “whatever else she wants. She’s a princess,” said Mr. Lewis, 68. The men did seem to have put forethought into their gifts — though it came with a looming deadline. Perhaps, as François Delage, the chief executive of De Beers Diamond Jewellers, put it: “I would not necessarily call it last minute, as long as it’s still the right moment.”</text></article>
    <article index="15" href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/will-the-feds-debit-fee-rule-help-merchants/?ref=mastercardinc">Will the Fed's Debit Fee Rule Help Merchants?<date>December 21, 2010, 5:30 pm</date><text>Last Thursday, after the Federal Reserve floated an aggressive plan to limit the amount banks can collect from retailers for debit card transactions, MasterCard Worldwide registered its disapproval with a statement that provocatively cast the issue as a conflict between retailers and their customers. “If adopted as proposed,” Mastercard said, “the regulations would shift merchant costs directly to consumers.” With its proposed rule — actually two alternative proposals — the Fed is carrying out an obligation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that became law last summer. Dodd-Frank directs the banking board to ensure that debit card transaction fees are “reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred.” Fees for debit card transactions vary by card and issuer, but on average, at least 1 percent of the sale amount goes to the bank that issued the card. (The Fed says 1.14 percent; The Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter, says about 1.3 percent.) The Fed, by its own estimates, would force banks and card networks to cut merchant costs by at least 70 percent — to no more than 12 cents per transaction — if either of the alternatives it has circulated is enacted. “Experience demonstrates that consumers, not banks or payments networks, are the biggest losers as a result of this regulation,” said Noah J. Hanft, MasterCard’s general counsel, in the statement. Presumably, consumers would bear those costs in the form of more expensive banking services. Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, lamented in a statement that the Fed’s rules would “result in diminished revenue that banks currently use to fight fraud, make loans and provide low-cost basic banking services.” If banks really were to follow through with raising the costs of other services, then MasterCard’s claim would seem indisputable. Retailers and other merchants would be free from the burden of the fees; bank customers would pay those fees in disguise. But advocates for retailers, and people who study the industry, say not only that MasterCard’s zero-sum formulation misstates the true cost of debit card transactions to consumers now, but also that in fact the buying public, too, stands to gain once those costs are capped. For one thing, consumers already pay the costs of using debit cards, which like all other expenses are embedded in prices, said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “As swipe costs have gone up, prices have risen. When swipe costs come down, prices will follow,” he said by e-mail. “If the MasterCard claims were true, when swipe fees tripled over the past decade, bank fees would have fallen. Instead they exploded, too.” What would prompt retailers to pass the savings in lower transaction costs to customers, rather than keep the money for themselves? According to Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, another merchant trade group, it’s the prospect of steering customers away from credit cards, which are usually more expensive for merchants — often much more so. However, there is some overlap between credit and debit card seller fees, said Mr. Duncan, “and since the merchant doesn’t know how expensive a debit card is going to be upfront, as a practical matter, it’s hard to offer an incentive to use one.” (The ability to offer such incentives is also new: under another Dodd-Frank provision, credit card companies cannot prohibit merchants from favoring one form of payment over another.) But if the Fed adopts one of the proposals it published last week, debit card fees would become fairly standardized, and much lower than their credit counterparts, and sellers could split the difference with their buyers. “This makes it possible for us to offer significant discounts to our customers,” Mr. Duncan said. The amount of savings a merchant would see would not be huge — probably under one percentage point, and perhaps as little as 10 or 20 basis points (or one-tenth to one-fifth of a percent). But in low-margin sectors, “a retailer saving 20 basis points could see a 10 percent increase in profits,” said Robert Blattberg, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. “I have merchants who come to me and talk about trying to save four basis points when financing inventory,” Mr. Duncan said. Consumers, too, would most likely bite, even if the discount were as small as 1 percent — which is roughly equal to the value of credit card rewards programs. “Just think about how many people drive around different locations to save 10 cents on a gallon of gas,” said Mr. Blattberg. “People are quasi-irrational about it.” In fact, according to Jason Carpenter, who studies consumer behavior at the University of South Carolina, “Debit card use has already been increasing since the beginning of the latest economic recession, with consumers being increasingly careful about spending on credit.” “We sell more goods at $99 than at $100, so if we can provide a discount to our customers for using a cheaper form of payment, then it’s a win-win,” said Mr. Duncan, who likened a debit card to “a plastic check.” (Federal law requires checks to be paid at full value.) However, the victory might be short-lived. “If the spread between a debit card and a credit card increases, why would a bank issue a debit card?” asked Mr. Blattberg. Indeed, Mr. Yingling, of the banking association, hinted at just that in his statement. The Fed’s rules, he said, “will also discourage further innovation in the payments system.” The Federal Reserve will take comments on the proposals through Feb. 22. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the board to complete its regulations by April 21; they will take effect three months later. Robb Mandelbaum has been on something like paternity leave (twins!) and is posting less frequently. He will return to the blogosphere more regularly once he is able to start sleeping again.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/your-money/brokerage-and-bank-accounts/15money.html?ref=mastercardinc">As Big Banks Raise Fees, You Have Options — Your Money<date>Published: January 14, 2011</date><text>So now we know what the big banks’ New Year’s resolution was: Keep the profits flowing from basic checking accounts.Earlier this month, Bank of America announced its intent to test a number of different monthly fees for customers in some states, depending on the balance in their accounts or other relationships with the institution. Right before the new year, meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase informed customers that under certain circumstances it would add monthly fees to many of the accounts it inherited from the now-deceased Washington Mutual. This must feel awfully good for the veteran branch banking executives at Chase who looked stingy by comparison when WaMu ran ads all over the United States in the 1990s and 2000s telling consumers that free checking was a basic human right. But Chase sure doesn’t sound happy. In a remarkable display of staying on message, it gave the same comment last week when The Wall Street Journal, CNN Money and the trade publication US Banker asked it to explain the reasoning for the new monthly fees. “We don’t want to raise fees on our customers,” a company spokesman said. “But unfortunately, regulation is forcing us to do it. And as a result, some customers may end up unbanked.” This statement is striking for a number of reasons, and the eye-popping earnings the bank announced on Friday don’t exactly make the company more worthy of sympathy. So I’ve spent the last week trying to figure out why I was so sure I did not believe it the instant I read it. So let’s take it apart, shall we? First of all, Chase does want to raise fees on customers. It’s not the only bank that wants to, and this is a fine thing if you are a shareholder. After all, any business ought to strive to produce a product or offer a service that is so good or necessary that customers will keep on using it even after a price increase. What companies don’t want to do is raise fees so much that they attract the attention of regulators or people who do what I do for a living. Yet this is exactly what the banks have done in the last decade. First, they raised overdraft fees until the fees were often many times higher than the amount of the actual transaction that pushed the account balance below zero. At the same time, the banks and their partners at Visa and MasterCard forced merchants to pay ever more for the privilege of accepting these cards. Eventually, consumers and merchants howled loud enough in protest that we ended up with overdraft fee regulation. There is also a Federal Reserve proposal percolating that may allow merchants to pay big banks much less when they accept those banks’ debit cards. And so we arrive at Part 2 of Chase’s statement: regulators are making the bank raise prices. Um, no. Regulators are making it lower prices, or at least make fees more transparent. All actors in this play do have the ability to improvise. And some of the big banks relied heavily on overdraft fees to hit whatever internal goals they set for themselves in their branch banking units. Chase, for instance, estimated that the overdraft legislation would cost it about $700 million a year. It’s also worried sick about the possibility of earning much less from merchant fees. Chase and similar banks have to make that up somehow. But it’s not regulators that are making them do so. Shareholders are. So it’s no wonder that you generally don’t hear this sort of reasoning from, say, credit unions, which are subject to the same rules but don’t ultimately answer to the same master. It is true that many more banks (and some credit unions, too, no doubt) will add monthly fees to their checking accounts, especially now that bigger institutions like Chase and Bank of America have given them cover. But they won’t all do so. In fact, ING Direct, the online banking colossus, wasted no time last week in sending out gleeful notes reminding the world that it has always offered free checking in an interest-bearing account and will continue to do so. Finally, Chase worries about those who will abandon its checking accounts in the wake of its price increase. And by fretting that those people will end up “unbanked,” it invokes the bogeyman — the rapacious check casher standing behind bulletproof glass in a grimy strip mall somewhere hard by the liquor store. I sincerely doubt, however, that many former bank customers, having tasted the good life with a debit card and nice people on the phone who can help when the card isn’t working, will turn to check-cashing enterprises if they get fed up with monthly bank fees. In fact, there is an entire niche of the card industry that has quietly grown up to serve them in recent years. Known variously as “prepaid” or “reloadable” cards, this is plastic that has a Visa or MasterCard logo and works a lot like a debit card. You can use it in a store or to buy something on Amazon.com or to reserve a rental car. The difference is you don’t get the card at a bank. Instead, a company like Green Dot offers it online and sells it on a rack in various stores next to the gift card displays. In fact, Green Dot has about 3.3 million active accounts, many of which it has issued with Wal-Mart under the “Walmart MoneyCard” brand. Cardholders in the Green Dot system had loaded about $10 billion onto the cards as of Sept. 30, 2010. This is not a free service, though it can come pretty close. With the Green Dot-branded card, it’s free to buy and activate the card online, though it can cost up to $4.95 if you do it in person (the Wal-Mart card pricing is slightly different). Then, there’s the $5.95 monthly fee, but the company waives it if you make 30 purchases or more or load $1,000 or more onto it in a month. Also, there’s a $2.50 A.T.M. fee for people who don’t use machines that are part of Green Dot’s partner network. The money does not earn interest after consumers load it onto the card. Direct deposit is possible, as is online bill paying, and the funds are insured by the F.D.I.C., which makes the product an awful lot like an online bank. There are no overdraft fees, though. Green Dot simply doesn’t put the transaction through if it determines that you don’t have enough money to cover it. Green Dot takes in about $5 a month per cardholder in user fees. For consumers doing comparison shopping who don’t mind losing access to a teller and paper checks, that makes it competitive with old-fashioned banks that are now charging $8 and up for customers who don’t maintain minimum balance levels or have the right relationships with the bank. Regulators could subject Green Dot to more scrutiny at some point. Meanwhile, the federal government is partnering with the company on a pilot program to deposit income tax refunds directly onto prepaid cards. That said, prepaid card customers who don’t know any better can easily end up in the wrong hands. Last year, the Kardashian sisters, famous mostly for dating other famous people and humiliating themselves on television, invited further embarrassment when the Connecticut attorney general questioned the legality of a prepaid “kard” marketed with their name on it. In the face of criticism over high fees, they got themselves out of the deal. So there is risk for consumers who turn their backs on the banks and their new fees. But most people won’t, and the banks know this. Changing checking accounts is a pain. Convenience matters, too, for people who need to deposit cash or have other reasons to lean heavily on a branch. Those who do make the change can switch to a credit union or the ING Directs of the world. And as more people see Green Dot’s commercials, they’ll realize there are other alternatives that can be cheaper if they’re careful with the products. Meanwhile, Green Dot’s founder and chief executive, Steve Streit, says that he’s reasonably certain that major banks are quietly planning to introduce their own reloadable prepaid cards. Perhaps he’s a bit paranoid. But you can bet that if his company gets big enough, plenty of big banks will mimic his product. After all, once they do have similar cards, they’ll have a convenient place to dump checking account customers who are no longer profitable enough to make the shareholders happy.</text></article>

The editors of credit card comparison site CardRatings.com recently announced their  take on the worst and best credit cards of 2010. The cards rated the worst included those with high rates, high fees and little disclosure while those rated the best “bucked a trend toward fewer rewards and higher fees” while offering “ value, service, and convenience.” So which cards made the cut? Among the cards cited for the editors’ “Razzie Awards for the Worst Credit Cards of 2010” were a new First Premier MasterCard with “an astonishing 79.99 percent A.P.R.” (cited for having the highest interest rate) and the short-lived prepaid debit card endorsed by the Kardashians (cited for being the most hated card). Also on the list were Best Buy’s Reward Zone MasterCard, which CardRatings.com said had little disclosure of details, and the Applied Bank Unsecured Visa Gold Card, which CardRatings.com said was the most expensive way to rebuild credit. CardRatings noted that the Applied Bank card offered no grace period, meaning that interest begins accruing on your purchase the moment you swipe your card, not three or four weeks later as most credit cards do. Meanwhile, cards that the editors rated the best in the cash-back category were the PenFed Visa Platinum Cashback Rewards Card and the Fidelity Investment Rewards American Express Card. In the airline and travel credit card category, the PenFed Premium Travel Rewards American Express Card and Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card were rated the best. The Simmons Visa Platinum and the PenFed Promise Visa Card, meanwhile, were cited as the best low-interest rate cards and the Citi Platinum Select MasterCard and the Discover More Card were cited for being the best low-introductory rate credit cards. CardRatings.com, meanwhile, cited the Chase Sapphire Card and Zync from American Express for being the best reward point credit cards. CardRatings.com also released new ratings of the cards it said consumers liked best, which included: -Best Cash Back Credit Card: Blue Cash from American Express -Best Airline Credit Card: Blue Sky from American Express -Best Reward Points Credit Card: Chase Sapphire Card -Best Value Credit Card: USAA World MasterCard -Best Customer Service: American Express The consumer results were based on responses collected from September through December. How do the results compare to your own experiences? What would you rate the best and worst credit cards of 2010?</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/03/business/03wikileaks-bank.html?ref=mastercardinc">Facing WikiLeaks Threat, Bank of America Plays Defense<date>Published: January 2, 2011</date><text>By the time the conference call ended, it was nearly midnight at Bank of America’s headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., but the bank’s counterespionage work was only just beginning.A day earlier, on Nov. 29, the director of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, said in an interview that he intended to “take down” a major American bank and reveal an “ecosystem of corruption” with a cache of data from an executive’s hard drive. With Bank of America’s share price falling on the widely held suspicion that the hard drive was theirs, the executives on the call concluded it was time to take action. Since then, a team of 15 to 20 top Bank of America officials, led by the chief risk officer, Bruce R. Thompson, has been overseeing a broad internal investigation — scouring thousands of documents in the event that they become public, reviewing every case where a computer has gone missing and hunting for any sign that its systems might have been compromised. In addition to the internal team drawn from departments like finance, technology, legal and communications, the bank has brought in Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, to help manage the review. It has also sought advice from several top law firms about legal problems that could arise from a disclosure, including the bank’s potential liability if private information was disclosed about clients. The company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, receives regular updates on the team’s progress, according to one Bank of America executive familiar with the team’s work, who, like other bank officials, was granted anonymity to discuss the confidential inquiry. Whether Mr. Assange is bluffing, or indeed has Bank of America in its sights at all, the bank’s defense strategy represents the latest twist in the controversy over WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange. The United States government has been examining whether Mr. Assange, an Australian, could be charged criminally for the release by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of classified Pentagon and State Department diplomatic cables that became the subject of articles in The New York Times and other publications last month. The Swedish government is also seeking to question Mr. Assange about rape accusations against him. As he fights extradition from Britain in that case, he remains under house arrest in an English mansion. Mr. Assange has said the timing of the rape accusations was not coincidental, and that he was the victim of a smear campaign led by the United States government. Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Assange’s threats have grown more credible with every release of secret documents, including those concerning the dumping of toxic waste in Africa, the treatment of prisoners held by the United States at Guantánamo Bay, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and, most recently, the trove of diplomatic cables. That Mr. Assange might shift his attention to a private company — especially one as politically unpopular as Bank of America or any of its rivals, which have been stained by taxpayer-financed bailouts and the revelation of improper foreclosure practices — raises a new kind of corporate threat, combining elements of law, technology, public policy, politics and public relations. “This is a significant moment, and Bank of America has to get out in front of it,” said Richard S. Levick, a veteran crisis communications expert. “Corporate America needs to look at what happens here, and how Bank of America handles it.” Last month, the bank bought up Web addresses that could prove embarrassing to the company or its top executives in the event of a large-scale public assault, but a spokesman for the bank said the move was unrelated to any possible leak. Then, on Dec. 18, Bank of America may have antagonized Mr. Assange further when it said it would join other companies like MasterCard and PayPal in halting the processing of payments intended for WikiLeaks, citing the possibility the organization’s activities might be illegal. Mr. Assange has never said explicitly that the data he possesses comes from Bank of America, which is the nation’s largest bank, though he did say that the disclosure would take place sometime early this year. 1 2 Next Page » Eric Dash and Louise Story contributed reporting.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/24/business/24jewelry.html?ref=mastercardinc">Men Turn to Jewelry for Last-Minute Purchases<date>Published: December 23, 2010</date><text>SEATTLE — At this time of year, jewelers rely on last-minute men.They are the spouses, the boyfriends, the loved ones, all who, up until this week, have been steering clear of malls and anything that requires gift-wrapping. But in these last few days, they have suddenly assumed a predictable stance, bending over glass counters and snapping up necklaces, bracelets and rings. During what retailers call “desperation week,” spending on jewelry stands out, spiking high at the end of the holiday season. And the procrastinating male shopper gets much of the credit. “You’re talking about a lot of male purchases, a lot of last-minute purchases there,” said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which tracks all sales. “That tends to be an area where you can get a lot of purchasing done in a very efficient amount of time.” Both higher-end retailers, like Tiffany and De Beers Diamond Jewellers, and mass chains like J. C. Penney say that this week is typically strong for jewelry. Last year, for instance, more than $709 million was spent on jewelry on Dec. 23 and 24 alone, representing 10 percent of the entire month’s jewelry sales, according to SpendingPulse.

Alex Allen, who works at a downtown Seattle mutual fund company, used his lunch hour this week to dip in and out of Tiffany’s, and conceded that he personified the last-minute male shopper. “I have 20 minutes left,” Mr. Allen declared. “I know exactly what I’m doing. I have a plan.” He chose a pair of silver beaded earrings for his girlfriend. “Last Christmas, I did get her jewelry as well.

He coaches employees to ask about the colors that spouses or partners wear, whether they prefer gold or silver, and if they favor big or small earrings. “They don’t know what they’re looking at, and unless they have great taste and style, they’re really unsure of themselves and that really comes across,” Mr. Bittar said. At a Nordstrom here, Bryant Higgins, 71, said he had learned his wife’s dislikes over the years, but still could not settle on the right gift this time. “I don’t get her earrings, because she’s fussy about her earrings and I never get it right,” said Mr. Higgins, a salesman at Sears. He had been looking at necklaces and bracelets, guessing that she would prefer smaller, classic styles over the bigger, more contemporary ones. “Everything else is done,” Mr. Higgins said of his Christmas shopping, “but my wife. That’s probably common for me.” Kevin Lewis, a retired floor-covering salesman, had returned to Tiffany after browsing there with his wife last week, hoping to surprise her with some crystal votives she had admired. Other than that, he plans to get her “whatever else she wants. She’s a princess,” said Mr. Lewis, 68. The men did seem to have put forethought into their gifts — though it came with a looming deadline. Perhaps, as François Delage, the chief executive of De Beers Diamond Jewellers, put it: “I would not necessarily call it last minute, as long as it’s still the right moment.”</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/21/will-the-feds-debit-fee-rule-help-merchants/?ref=mastercardinc">Will the Fed's Debit Fee Rule Help Merchants?<date>December 21, 2010, 5:30 pm</date><text>Last Thursday, after the Federal Reserve floated an aggressive plan to limit the amount banks can collect from retailers for debit card transactions, MasterCard Worldwide registered its disapproval with a statement that provocatively cast the issue as a conflict between retailers and their customers. “If adopted as proposed,” Mastercard said, “the regulations would shift merchant costs directly to consumers.” With its proposed rule — actually two alternative proposals — the Fed is carrying out an obligation under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that became law last summer. Dodd-Frank directs the banking board to ensure that debit card transaction fees are “reasonable and proportional to the actual cost incurred.” Fees for debit card transactions vary by card and issuer, but on average, at least 1 percent of the sale amount goes to the bank that issued the card. (The Fed says 1.14 percent; The Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter, says about 1.3 percent.) The Fed, by its own estimates, would force banks and card networks to cut merchant costs by at least 70 percent — to no more than 12 cents per transaction — if either of the alternatives it has circulated is enacted. “Experience demonstrates that consumers, not banks or payments networks, are the biggest losers as a result of this regulation,” said Noah J. Hanft, MasterCard’s general counsel, in the statement. Presumably, consumers would bear those costs in the form of more expensive banking services. Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, lamented in a statement that the Fed’s rules would “result in diminished revenue that banks currently use to fight fraud, make loans and provide low-cost basic banking services.” If banks really were to follow through with raising the costs of other services, then MasterCard’s claim would seem indisputable. Retailers and other merchants would be free from the burden of the fees; bank customers would pay those fees in disguise. But advocates for retailers, and people who study the industry, say not only that MasterCard’s zero-sum formulation misstates the true cost of debit card transactions to consumers now, but also that in fact the buying public, too, stands to gain once those costs are capped. For one thing, consumers already pay the costs of using debit cards, which like all other expenses are embedded in prices, said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “As swipe costs have gone up, prices have risen. When swipe costs come down, prices will follow,” he said by e-mail. “If the MasterCard claims were true, when swipe fees tripled over the past decade, bank fees would have fallen. Instead they exploded, too.” What would prompt retailers to pass the savings in lower transaction costs to customers, rather than keep the money for themselves? According to Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, another merchant trade group, it’s the prospect of steering customers away from credit cards, which are usually more expensive for merchants — often much more so. However, there is some overlap between credit and debit card seller fees, said Mr. Duncan, “and since the merchant doesn’t know how expensive a debit card is going to be upfront, as a practical matter, it’s hard to offer an incentive to use one.” (The ability to offer such incentives is also new: under another Dodd-Frank provision, credit card companies cannot prohibit merchants from favoring one form of payment over another.) But if the Fed adopts one of the proposals it published last week, debit card fees would become fairly standardized, and much lower than their credit counterparts, and sellers could split the difference with their buyers. “This makes it possible for us to offer significant discounts to our customers,” Mr. Duncan said. The amount of savings a merchant would see would not be huge — probably under one percentage point, and perhaps as little as 10 or 20 basis points (or one-tenth to one-fifth of a percent). But in low-margin sectors, “a retailer saving 20 basis points could see a 10 percent increase in profits,” said Robert Blattberg, a professor emeritus at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. “I have merchants who come to me and talk about trying to save four basis points when financing inventory,” Mr. Duncan said. Consumers, too, would most likely bite, even if the discount were as small as 1 percent — which is roughly equal to the value of credit card rewards programs. “Just think about how many people drive around different locations to save 10 cents on a gallon of gas,” said Mr. Blattberg. “People are quasi-irrational about it.” In fact, according to Jason Carpenter, who studies consumer behavior at the University of South Carolina, “Debit card use has already been increasing since the beginning of the latest economic recession, with consumers being increasingly careful about spending on credit.” “We sell more goods at $99 than at $100, so if we can provide a discount to our customers for using a cheaper form of payment, then it’s a win-win,” said Mr. Duncan, who likened a debit card to “a plastic check.” (Federal law requires checks to be paid at full value.) However, the victory might be short-lived. “If the spread between a debit card and a credit card increases, why would a bank issue a debit card?” asked Mr. Blattberg. Indeed, Mr. Yingling, of the banking association, hinted at just that in his statement. The Fed’s rules, he said, “will also discourage further innovation in the payments system.” The Federal Reserve will take comments on the proposals through Feb. 22. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the board to complete its regulations by April 21; they will take effect three months later.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/business/17fees.html?ref=mastercardinc">Fed Proposes Rules to Cut Debit Card Fees<date>Published: December 16, 2010</date><text>The Federal Reserve, fulfilling a Congressional order to examine whether merchants were being charged excessive fees to process debit card transactions, proposed new rules on Thursday that analysts said could cut those fees as much as 90 percent.The Fed’s report went much further than the 50 percent reduction that Wall Street analysts had expected. Shares of Visa and MasterCard, which could come under increasing pressure from banks seeking to make up billions of dollars in lost revenue if the Fed proposal was adopted, plunged more than 12 percent. “It’s bad for the issuers and the card networks,” said Rod Bourgeois, a payments analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. As part of the Dodd-Frank Act’s overhaul of the financial code, Congress directed the central bank, which oversees the regulation of electronic payments, to ensure that the swipe fees charged by the banks and payment card networks like Visa and MasterCard were “reasonable and proportional” to the cost of processing the transaction. On Thursday, the Fed proposed limiting those so-called interchange fees from 7 cents to 12 cents per transaction, or roughly 0.3 percent of the face value of a purchase. Merchants now pay debit card processing fees averaging about 1.3 percent, according to the Nilson Report, a payment industry newsletter. Smaller retailers are charged more because of lower transaction volume and limited bargaining power. The Fed proposed that it re-evaluate the fee cap every two years and asked for more time to consider whether it should be increased to reflect the costs of fraud protection. The new rules will be open for public comment until February. Final rules are to be completed by April and put in place in July. Both Visa and MasterCard argued that the Fed had not considered all the costs incurred to operate debit card programs. Visa said it had “concerns that the Federal Reserve’s proposal includes artificial caps on debit interchange that do not realistically reflect the value of card acceptance.” MasterCard went a step further and openly criticized the proposal, saying it would simply shift costs to consumers from merchants. “This type of price control is misguided and anticompetitive and in the end is harmful to consumers,” Noah J. Hanft, MasterCard’s general counsel, said in a written statement. Henry O. Armour, chief executive of the National Association of Convenience Stores, said his members were generally pleased with the proposal. “The proposed rules that the Federal Reserve issued today are a positive step in addressing the anticompetitive behavior of banks and credit card companies,” he said in a conference call with reporters. But he and other advocates for the merchants argued that even if the Fed’s rules were adopted, interchange fees would still be too high. He compared debit cards to paper checks. “You look at checks clearing at par, which means there is no interchange,” he said. “We believe the standard for debit should be the same.” In most American stores today, customers pay the same price for goods, whether they use credit, debit or dollar bills, even though each costs the merchant a different amount. That will almost certainly change soon, the result of the legislation and recent court settlements that have set out to reduce processing fees and abolish rules by the major card companies that have made it impractical for merchants to give discounts to customers using cheaper forms of payment, like cash. Already, the balance of power has begun tilting toward merchants and away from the financial industry, with some visible results. Gate Petroleum, which operates about 100 gas stations in the Southeast, has seized on a separate piece of the Dodd-Frank Act that lets merchants charge different prices to customers using different forms of payment. This fall, Gate began offering a discount to customers who used cash to buy one of the company’s new prepaid gas cards. Just over two months into the discount program, about 20,000 cards are in use, the company said. David Dill, the company’s vice president for sales and marketing, said Gate saved about 4 cents a gallon whenever it made a sale that did not touch a Visa or MasterCard payment network. Customers receive a discount of 3 cents a gallon; the other penny goes toward the cost of operating the card program. “It’s really a loyalty program for the customer,” Mr. Dill said. For years, some gas stations charged higher prices when customers used credit cards, sometimes simply in defiance of the card processing contracts and other times taking advantage of legal technicalities. In many states, gas stations could comply with the rules by posting separate prices for cash and credit. That approach was impractical for most other retailers because they stocked different products on their shelves. Dodd-Frank lifted that barrier by allowing merchants to steer customers toward the payment method that is cheapest for them to process, without having to post separate prices.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/business/media/14adco.html?ref=mastercardinc">Times Square Tie-Ins for New Year’s Eve Erupt<date>Published: December 13, 2010</date><text>SURELY there is no moment when more Americans lock lips than at midnight on Dec. 31, when a kiss marks the New Year, and that is why Nivea Lip Care ties its biggest marketing effort of the year to New Year’s Eve.For the third consecutive year, Nivea is an official sponsor of the New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square, and along with sponsoring a stage called the Nivea Kiss Platform, it will hand out about 30,000 samples of lip balm to revelers in the hours before the countdown. “The brand is based on the insight that something wonderful happens when skin touches skin and humans connect, and the New Year’s Eve kiss sets the tone for the new year to come,” said Magnus Jonsson, vice president for marketing at Beiersdorf, parent company for Nivea. This year, Nivea also is holding a contest on its Facebook page where couples in long-distance relationships vie for a chance to win a free trip to New York to be reunited in Times Square on New Year’s, with two couples who garner the most votes on Facebook winning.  Nivea is among a bevy of sponsors for this year’s celebration, which is produced jointly by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment. But sponsorship is not open to just any company willing to write a check. “We look for sponsors that can be organically integrated in our event, and there are some sponsors that we say no to because it’s not a natural fit,” said Jeffrey Straus, president of Countdown Entertainment. “This is first and foremost a civic event for New York City and sponsors have to tie into that event without it being a commercial message.” The most obvious example, of course, is the crystal ball that descends on Times Square for the countdown, which does not have a logo festooned on it but is known by even casual television viewers to be provided by Waterford Crystal. Nearly as prominent as the ball are the numerals that light up to mark the dawning year, and Duracell, the battery brand, is hoping to become similarly synonymous. For the third consecutive November, the brand set up what it calls the Duracell Power Lab in Times Square, which consists of four stationary bikes that when pedaled charge batteries that will subsequently be used to light the sign. This year the bikes are housed in a trailer that for the rest of the year will be deployed to disaster areas, where it will provide charging stations for items including cellphones, laptops, and rechargeable batteries. When a camper who hears a rustling outside the tent reaches for a flashlight, the batteries had better work, and Bob Jacobs, marketing director for Duracell, a Procter &amp; Gamble brand, said the moment when numerals light up in Times Square functions as “a large-scale analogy” for consumers. “We talk a lot about people trusting Duracell when it just has to work,” said Mr. Jacobs. When the numerals light up, “it’s that one iconic moment of the holiday season when millions of people are watching and it’s a great association for Duracell batteries being trusted in an important moment,” Mr. Jacobs said. The Times Square Alliance estimates that one million people attend the New Year’s Eve festivities. A Trylon Strategic Media Relations study commissioned by the group pegged the international audience at more than one billion. This is the first year for several sponsors, including Get Married Media, which publishes Get Married magazine and hosts a Web site, GetMarried.com. The company held a contest for a New Year’s Eve wedding in Times Square, with the winning couple receiving not just a trip to New York but also a wedding gown, wedding bands and a honeymoon in the Dominican Republic. Bethany Phillips and Geoffrey Dubie, a couple from Jacksonville, Fla., who met while serving as Marines in Iraq, won the contest, and their wedding will be featured live on LED screens in Times Square as they take their vows there. “The holiday season is one of the biggest times of the year for people to get engaged, and about 70 percent of the New Year’s Eve television viewers are 19 to 35, and that is kind of the bridal target,” said Anita Brady, president of Get Married Media, which is based in Atlanta.  Another new sponsor, MasterCard, will donate $1 for every transaction with one of its credit cards in Times Square to Stand Up To Cancer, which pays for cancer research. About 90 businesses, from American Eagle Outfitters to The Westin hotel, are participating, and MasterCard will donate up to $1.5 million during the promotion, which began on Nov. 26 and ends Jan. 1, 2011. A marketing campaign to promote the fund-raiser, by the Robertson Schwartz Agency, will reach inbound tourists with public service ads on Virgin America flights, at New York airports, at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, on videos in cabs and, naturally, on the two large Toshiba screens in Times Square itself. Leading up to New Year’s, another sponsor, Cintas, the document management company, will host Good Riddance Day on Dec. 28 in Times Square. Participants are encouraged to bring items like pictures of old flames or bosses, credit card statements, and report cards — and to feed them into paper shredders provided by Cintas. The first in line will be Tiffany Bradley, of Knoxville, Tenn., who won an online contest for a free trip to New York based on the documents she wished to shred: medical bills from a life-threatening operation she had in 2009 and paid off in 2010. “Shredding these bills would represent finally having them paid off and would be a great way to celebrate my recovery,” Ms. Bradley wrote in her winning entry. “It has taken forever, but I actually feel like myself again.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/world/10wiki.html?ref=mastercardinc">Web Attackers Find a Rallying Cry in WikiLeaks<date>Published: December 9, 2010</date><text>They got their start years ago as cyberpranksters, an online community of tech-savvy kids more interested in making mischief than political statements.But the coordinated attacks on major corporate and government Web sites in defense of WikiLeaks, which began on Wednesday and continued on Thursday, suggested that the loosely organized group called Anonymous might have come of age, evolving into one focused on more serious matters: in this case, the definition of Internet freedom. While the attacks on such behemoths as MasterCard, Visa and PayPal were not nearly as sophisticated as some less publicized assaults, they were a step forward in the group’s larger battle against what it sees as increasing control of the Internet by corporations and governments. This week they found a cause and an icon: Julian Assange, the former hacker who founded WikiLeaks and is now in a London jail at the request of the Swedish authorities investigating him on accusations of rape. “This is kind of the shot heard round the world — this is Lexington,” said John Perry Barlow, a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a civil liberties organization that advocates for a freer Internet. On Thursday, the police in the Netherlands took the first official action against the campaign, detaining a 16-year-old student in his parents’ home in The Hague who they said admitted to participating in attacks on MasterCard and Visa. The precise nature of his involvement was unclear, but in past investigations, the authorities have sometimes arrested those unsophisticated enough not to cover their tracks on the Web. Meanwhile, a lawyer for Mr. Assange, 39, said he strongly denied that he had encouraged any attacks on behalf of WikiLeaks. “It is absolutely false,” the lawyer, Jennifer Robinson, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in London on Thursday. “He did not make any such instruction, and indeed he sees that as a deliberate attempt to conflate hacking organizations” with “WikiLeaks, which is not a hacking organization. It is a news organization and a publisher.” Although Anonymous remains shadowy and without public leaders, it developed a loose hierarchy in recent years as it took on groups as diverse as the Church of Scientology and the Motion Picture Association of America. The coordination and the tactics developed in those campaigns appeared to make this week’s attacks more powerful, allowing what analysts believe is a small group to enlist thousands of activists to bombard Web sites with traffic, making them at least temporarily inaccessible. Experts say the group appears to have used more sophisticated software this time that allowed supporters to repeatedly visit the sites at a specific time when the command was given. The Twitter account identified with the Anonymous movement contained messages with little more than the words “Fire now.” The attacks thus far have been of limited effect, shutting down the MasterCard Web site, not its online transactions. But to security experts and people who have tracked or participated in the Anonymous movement, they indicated a step forward for cyberanarchists railing against the “elites” — corporations and governments with power over both the machinery and, critics increasingly argue, the content on the Web. “In the past, Anonymous made quite a lot of noise but did little damage,” said Amichai Shulman, chief technology officer at Imperva, a California-based security technology company. “It’s different this time around. They are starting to use the same tools that industrial hackers are using.” Despite the name, Anonymous can be found in many locations and formats. Members converse in online forums and chat rooms where friendships and alliances often build. “It’s the first place I go when I turn on my computer,” said one Anonymous activist, reached on an online chat service, who did not want to be named discussing the structure of the organization. Groups of these friends, who form new conversations, or threads, sometimes decide on a topic or an issue that they feel is deserving of more attention, the activist said. “You post things, discuss ideas and that leads to putting out a video or a document” for a campaign. In the case of WikiLeaks, the activist said, it appears that two groups decided almost simultaneously to mount a concerted effort against the site’s enemies. “I got e-mailed these two links on Sunday or Monday,” he said. Denouncing “what’s being done to Julian and WikiLeaks,” he said, he decided to join in. These ideas bubble up, but ultimately a small group decides exactly what affiliated site should be attacked and when, according to a Dutch writer on the Anonymous movement, who writes a blog under the name Ernesto Van der Sar. There is a chat room “that is invite only, with a dozen or so people,” he said, that pick the targets and the time of attack. He described the typical Anonymous member as young; he guessed 18 to 24 years old. While Anonymous has recently had success with attacks on sites related to copyright infringement cases, the WikiLeaks cause has brought a much greater intensity to its efforts.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/business/10shop.html?ref=mastercardinc">Cash Is King for More Consumers This Holiday Season<date>Published: December 9, 2010</date><text>Christmas will no longer be on credit for many shoppers, despite tempting offers from retailers and credit card companies trying to coax the plastic out of consumers’ wallets.The lowest percentage of shoppers in the 27-year-history of a national survey said they used credit cards over the Thanksgiving weekend, while the use of general credit cards like Visa and MasterCard fell 11 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, according to the credit bureau TransUnion. “Cash is the route I’m taking this year, from past experiences with credit cards and being in debt and trying to pay it off for so many years,” said Liz Gonzalez, a community-college employee in Signal Hill, Calif. Her debt problems started two Christmases ago, when she charged the gifts that turned into the bills that sent her life into disarray. Ms. Gonzalez, 40, still owes $2,200 from that Christmas, and said her recent divorce had been caused in part by the stress of debt. So this year, she is buying gifts only for her two children, and will use cash to stay on a $500 budget. “I was spending so much with them,” she said of the credit cards. “I lost control.” Britt Beemer, chief executive of America’s Research Group, a survey firm, said that was a common sentiment. “The consumer really feels a lot of pressure from previous debts, and they just aren’t going to dig themselves into that kind of hole,” he said. After the Thanksgiving shopping weekend, the group found that just about 17 percent were paying with credit — just over half of last year’s level and the lowest rate in the 27 years it has conducted a survey. Some people are shunning credit cards for budgeting reasons, while others do not have a choice. More than 15 million Americans lost their cards because of strict credit-card regulations that were passed last year, or when issuers cut back on credit during the recession, said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a credit card industry newsletter. If consumers like Ms. Gonzalez are trying to be careful this holiday, retailers, banks and credit card companies are hoping for a little less caution. The amount that consumers said they spent over Black Friday weekend, a crucial shopping period, was up more than 6 percent this year from last year, according to the National Retail Federation. When people overspend, credit card issuers reap profit from consumers who pay only part of their bills. Shoppers using retailers’ branded cards tend to spend more and visit stores more, said Robert S. Drbul, an analyst at Barclays Capital. So all are offering big incentives to get people to use plastic. The Chase Freedom and Discover More cards, for instance, are offering $100 bonuses when new credit card customers spend a certain amount within the first three months, along with 5 percent cash back on holiday purchases at department stores and other categories. Citibank is giving Dividend cardholders 5 percent back on spending at department, clothing and electronics stores through Dec. 31. Target is giving its cardholders a 5 percent discount on purchases, Neiman Marcus is advertising extra rewards points on most purchases on certain days this month, and Sears has been running a variety of no-payment, no-interest offers on its credit cards throughout the holidays. “The credit card companies are falling all over themselves trying to make those rewards even better,” Mr. Robertson said. But, with customers moving to cash or debit, the companies are “simply less profitable,” he said. James Hansen has been avoiding credit cards for months. He began accumulating debt when he went on short-term disability leave from his job as a maintenance engineer about three years ago, just after getting married and having a second child. “Half of my payments were interest,” said Mr. Hansen, 34, who lives in Kihei, Hawaii. “I’m still working on paying off the bills.” This holiday season, he said, “I’ll buy a few gifts with cash if I can. It’s not going to be easy.” Even for people with steady income through the recession, like Ms. Gonzalez, credit is no longer attractive. In 2008, with a new baby and a teenage son, plus a big extended family, she would go grocery shopping using her Sam’s Club and Costco cards, and add Christmas gifts to her cart. “It was so convenient,” she said. She knew she was charging a lot — she also had Macy’s and Kohl’s cards, and a State Farm Visa that was carrying a balance from an earlier Costco card — but she thought cash-back rewards programs would help. “In the back of my mind, I was thinking, ‘Well, I’ll get extra cash at the end of the year,’ ” she said. But on the Costco card, for instance, she got about $80 back — a fraction of the $4,000 she had charged, or the $3,000 on her Sam’s card. Mortgage and car payments piled on the debt. “With the interest rates, it just seemed like I never paid it off,” she said. She had to face up to the debt when she and her husband began looking for a bigger house to accommodate their growing family. Ms. Gonzalez said she had been paying the bills, and the couple had not discussed their finances in detail until they began house-hunting around Christmas 2008. “There was too much debt,” she said. That stress, she said, helped lead to divorce. “One of the main causes of the divorce — I was married for 17 years — other than miscommunication and growing apart, the money was a big one,” she said. Ms. Gonzalez had to account for how much she owed when she filed for divorce in 2009. She had hit the limit on the Costco and Sam’s cards, and owed smaller amounts on the department store cards. Based on a segment she had seen on “Oprah,” she made a list of what she could pay, and began paying it off little by little. She has now paid off the State Farm, Sam’s and department store cards. She still owes $2,200 on the Costco card, where her interest rate went up after a few late payments. Ms. Gonzalez hopes to pay that off, finally, by the spring, so she can qualify for a home loan. (She moved in with her mother after the divorce). To avoid the temptation to charge gifts again, she opened a savings account where she has put spare cash throughout the year — $5 when she skips buying lunch, $10 when she is reimbursed for work expenses. The $500 will go to a camera for her son and clothes for her daughter.“I’m very strict right now,” she said. “I didn’t have a choice.”</text></article>

An additional $55 million will be paid if the unit hits performance goals. Travelex makes ''chip and pin'' debit-type cards that, like traveler's checks, are a way of carrying and spending money abroad. MasterCard will take over the operations that manage cards used for international payroll as well as other expenses, but will not issue its own cards through them. Prepaid cards may not be subject to the same Dodd-Frank regulations as debit cards, and could offer financial services companies a way to maintain profitability as the new rules cut into traditional profits. Ajay Banga, president and chief executive of MasterCard, said in a statement on Thursday that the cards were one way of reaching an underserved market, and might well be used by government agencies to distribute payments for programs like Social Security. He was not sure, however, how the new law would affect the sector. Asked in a conference call about the valuation of Travelex, Mr. Banga emphasized the growth prospects of the card business outside of the United States, saying the Travelex unit was profitable on its own. MasterCard, which expects the transaction to break even by 2012, already has a prepaid program but does not currently disclose its profits from the unit. The global prepaid-card sector, according to a study commissioned by MasterCard, will reach $840 billion by 2017. ''This acquisition enables MasterCard to play a greater role in the prepaid value chain, allowing us to shape the future of prepaid, especially in high-growth markets and in the attractive cross-border payments space where we can displace cash and traveler's checks,'' Mr. Banga said. Peter Jackson, head of Travelex, the largest nonbank wholesale foreign exchange provider, said the deal would help the company grow in Africa and South America. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/us/politics/09rules.html?ref=mastercardinc">Washington Rule Makers Out of the Shadows<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Federal rule makers, long the neglected stepchildren of Washington bureaucrats, suddenly find themselves at the center of power as they scramble to work out details of hundreds of sweeping financial and health care regulations that will ultimately affect most Americans.In Bethesda, Md., more than 200 health regulators working on complicated insurance rules have taken over three floors of a suburban office building, paying almost double the market rate for the space in their rush to get started. Executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been meeting almost daily with financial rule makers to air concerns about regulations they say threaten to curtail commerce. And at the White House, senior officials receive several status reports a week on a process that all sides agree has vast implications for the country as a whole and for the Obama administration’s political fortunes. The boom in rule-making — the bureaucratic term for the nitty-gritty of drafting regulations — is a result of the mega-bills approved by Congress this year at the urging of President Obama: the health care bill signed into law in March, and the financial overhaul law signed in July. “There has never been a period like what we are going through now, in terms of the sheer volume and complexity of rule-making,” said Paul Dennett, senior vice president of the American Benefits Council, a trade group for large employers. And what was already shaping up as a rancorous lobbying battle over the rules is likely to become more contentious when Republicans take control of the House, having been swept to power on a pledge to influence health care and financial regulation. At the very least, Republicans will be able to hold public hearings to spotlight financial regulations they see as too restrictive and health care rules they see as too disruptive, and they could pressure regulators to soften them. The debate over federal spending has already slowed the development of financial rules, as hundreds of new rule-making positions have gone unfilled because of a lack of new financing. Congress provided a road map for measures aimed broadly at getting more Americans covered by health insurance and providing more federal safeguards against risky financial practices. But the laws were so broad and complex that executive-branch regulators have wide leeway in determining what the rules should say and how they should be carried out. In all, the bills call for drafting more than 300 separate rules on a rolling schedule by about 2014, plus dozens of other studies and periodic reports. That may be only the beginning. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service said the publication of rules under the health care law could stretch out for decades to come. Regulators at various agencies are trying to answer questions like these: ¶How much should a credit-card company be able to charge a shopkeeper for administrative fees when you swipe your card for a purchase? ¶Which types of financial companies are so “systemically important” to the overall economy that they should be subject to greater federal oversight? ¶What services must be covered by all insurers as part of the “essential health benefits” package? And at what point would an increase in an insurer’s premiums be considered so “unreasonable” that state and federal regulators could step in? These and many other questions are now in the hands of government lawyers, doctors, bankers, accountants, actuaries and other regulatory specialists. With the rules spread across agencies, no one is certain how many employees are working on them, but the number is certainly in the hundreds or higher. At the Federal Reserve, for instance, most of more than 50 lawyers in the legal division are now spending significant parts of their days on rule-making issues, like the question of how to carry out and enforce the so-called Volcker Rule, named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, restricting banks from making certain types of speculative investments. No longer are these considered arcane questions that draw scrutiny only from the few Washingtonians who read the “notices of proposed rule-making” in the Federal Register. These days, the rule makers are attracting attention from Congressional officials, industry advocates and lobbyists, with dozens of executives from firms like Goldman Sachs, Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse meeting with federal regulators recently to give input on specific rules and try to influence the outcome, according to public online postings by federal regulators on many of the meetings. “I wake up in the morning thinking about this stuff, and I go to sleep at night thinking about it,” said Tom Quaadman, a senior Chamber of Commerce executive who is leading a group of 10 staff members seeking to shape the financial rules. The discussions are in the early stages. But though all sides talk of finding consensus, conflicts have emerged.</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/technology/09net.html?ref=mastercardinc">Hackers Defend WikiLeaks, Testing Online Speech<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>A hacking free-for-all has exploded on the Web, and Facebook and Twitter are stuck in the middle.On Wednesday, anonymous hackers took aim at companies perceived to have harmed WikiLeaks after its release of a flood of confidential diplomatic documents. MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, which had cut off people’s ability to donate money to WikiLeaks, were hit by attacks that tried to block access to the companies’ Web sites and services. To organize their efforts, the hackers have turned to sites like Facebook and Twitter. That has drawn these Web giants into the fray and created a precarious situation for them. Both Facebook and Twitter — but particularly Twitter — have received praise in recent years as outlets for free speech. Governments trying to control the flow of information have found it difficult to block people from voicing their concerns or setting up meetings through the sites. At the same time, both Facebook and Twitter have corporate aspirations that hinge on their ability to serve as ad platforms for other companies. This leaves them with tough public relations and business decisions around how they should handle situations as politically charged as the WikiLeaks developments. Some internet experts say the situation highlights the complexities of free speech issues on the Internet, as grassroots Web companies evolve and take central control over what their users can make public. Clay Shirky, who studies the Internet and teaches at New York University, said that although the Web is the new public sphere, it is actually “a corporate sphere that tolerates public speech.” Marcia Hofmann, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said, “Any Internet user who cares about free speech or has a controversial or unpopular message should be concerned about the fact that intermediaries might not let them express it.” She added, “Your free speech rights are only as strong as the weakest intermediary.” The problem came into relief on Wednesday, through an effort called Operation Payback, organized by a group calling itself Anonymous. The group spent much of the day posting notes on Facebook and Twitter that told followers which companies to single out and that documented hacking successes. But Facebook banned one of the group’s pages, saying that using the site to organize hacking attacks like that violated its terms of use. The group went on Twitter to complain. A Facebook spokesman issued a statement saying that the company was “sensitive to content that includes pornography, bullying, hate speech, and threats of violence” and would “take action on content that we find or that’s reported to us that promotes unlawful activity.” In an interview Wednesday morning, Joe Sullivan, Facebook’s chief security officer, addressed WikiLeaks’s own presence on the site. He said the company had not received any official requests to disable pages or accounts associated with the WikiLeaks organization. Facebook generally resists requests by governments or advocacy groups to take down material if that content is not illegal or does not violate Facebook’s terms of service, which prohibit attacks on individuals or incitements to violence. “Facebook is a place where people come to talk about all sorts of things, including controversial topics,” Mr. Sullivan said. It was not clear whether anyone had asked Facebook to take down the Operation Payback page. Twitter allowed the Operation Payback account to stay active most of Wednesday. But the group’s account was disabled late in the day, after it posted a link to a file that provided thousands of consumer credit card numbers, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. A Twitter spokesman declined to discuss the details of the situation. “We don’t comment about the specific actions we take around user accounts,” he said. The company is not overly concerned about hackers’ attacking Twitter’s site, he said, explaining that it faces security issues all the time and has technology to deal with the situation. Twitter is in a particularly delicate situation because its founders have celebrated their service’s role in political protest and free speech. They have not been shy about trying to capitalize on the good will engendered by playing that role. WikiLeaks’s own Twitter account remains active, and it is the group’s main channel for reaching supporters and the media. Last week, Amazon.com fell into a similar position when it decided to stop storing files for WikiLeaks. Advocates of WikiLeaks complained that Amazon.com was bowing to political pressure to cut the organization from its Web services. An Amazon.com spokesman said the company was simply banning an organization that had violated its terms of service by trying to distribute documents it did not own. The last week has given rise to a hacking war in which groups have blocked access to WikiLeaks’s Web sites by bombarding them with requests. And now the WikiLeaks supporters have responded in kind, flying the freedom of speech banner as the motivation for their actions.</text></article>
    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/world/09wiki.html?ref=mastercardinc">Cyberattackers Focus on Enemies of WikiLeaks’s Assange<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>LONDON — In a campaign that had some declaring the start of a “cyberwar,” hundreds of Internet activists mounted retaliatory attacks on Wednesday on the Web sites of multinational companies and other organizations they deemed hostile to the WikiLeaks antisecrecy organization and its jailed founder, Julian Assange.Within 12 hours of a British judge’s decision on Tuesday to deny Mr. Assange bail in a Swedish extradition case, attacks on the Web sites of WikiLeaks’s “enemies,” as defined by the organization’s impassioned supporters around the world, caused several corporate Web sites to become inaccessible or slow down markedly. Targets of the attacks, in which activists overwhelmed the sites with traffic, included the Web site of MasterCard, which had stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks; Amazon.com, which revoked the use of its computer servers; and PayPal, which stopped accepting donations for Mr. Assange’s group. Visa.com was also affected by the attacks, as were the Web sites of the Swedish prosecutor’s office and the lawyer representing the two women whose allegations of sexual misconduct are the basis of Sweden’s extradition bid. The Internet assaults underlined the growing reach of self-described “cyberanarchists,” antigovernment and anticorporate activists who have made an icon of Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian. The speed and range of the attacks also appeared to show the resilience of the backing among computer activists for Mr. Assange, who has appeared increasingly isolated in recent months amid the furor stoked by WikiLeaks’s Web site posting of hundreds of thousands of secret Pentagon documents on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Assange has come under renewed attack in the past two weeks for posting the first tranche of a trove of 250,000 secret State Department cables that have exposed American diplomats’ frank assessments of relations with many countries, forcing Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to express regret to world leaders and raising fears that they and other sources would become more reticent. The New York Times and four other news organizations last week began publishing articles based on the archive of cables made available to them. In recent months, some of Mr. Assange’s closest associates in WikiLeaks abandoned him, calling him autocratic and capricious and accusing him of reneging on WikiLeaks’s original pledge of impartiality to launch a concerted attack on the United States. He has been simultaneously fighting a remote battle with the Swedish prosecutors, who have sought his extradition for questioning on accusations of “rape, sexual molestation and forceful coercion” made by the Swedish women. Mr. Assange has denied any wrongdoing in the cases. American officials have repeatedly said that they are reviewing possible criminal charges against Mr. Assange, a step that could lead to a bid to extradite him to the United States and confront him with having to fight for his freedom on two fronts. The cyberattacks in Mr. Assange’s defense appear to have been coordinated by Anonymous, a loosely affiliated group of activist computer hackers who have singled out other groups before, including the Church of Scientology. Last weekend, members of Anonymous vowed in two online manifestos to take revenge on any organization that lined up against WikiLeaks. Anonymous claimed responsibility for the MasterCard attack in Web messages and, according to one activist associated with the group, conducted waves of attacks on other companies during the day. The group said the actions were part of an effort called Operation Payback, which began as a way of punishing companies that attempted to stop Internet file-sharing and movie downloads. The activist, Gregg Housh, who disavows a personal role in any illegal online activity, said that 1,500 supporters had been in online forums and chat rooms organizing the mass “denial of service” attacks. His account was confirmed by Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher at Arbor Networks, a Chelmsford, Mass., firm that tracks malicious activity on computer networks. Most of the corporations whose sites were targeted did not explain why they severed ties with WikiLeaks. But PayPal issued statements saying its decision was based on “a violation” of its policy on promoting illegal activities. Almost all the corporate Web sites that were attacked appeared to be operating normally later on Wednesday, suggesting that any economic impact was limited. But the sense of an Internet war was reinforced when Netcraft, a British Internet monitoring firm, reported that the Web site being used by the hackers to distribute denial-of-service software had been suspended by a Dutch hosting firm, Leaseweb. A sense of the belligerent mood among activists was given when one contributor to a forum the group uses, WhyWeProtest.net, wrote of the attacks: “The war is on. And everyone ought to spend some time thinking about it, discussing it with others, preparing yourselves so you know how to act if something compels you to make a decision. Be very careful not to err on the side of inaction.” Mr. Housh acknowledged that there had been online talk among the hackers of a possible Internet campaign against the two women who have been Mr. Assange’s accusers in the Swedish case, but he said that “a lot of people don’t want to be involved.” A Web search showed new blog posts in recent days in which the two women, identified by the Swedish prosecutors only as Ms. A. and Ms. W., were named, but it was not clear whether there was any link to Anonymous. The women have said that consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange became nonconsensual when condoms were no longer in use. The cyberattacks on corporations Wednesday were seen by many supporters as a counterstrike against the United States. Mr. Assange’s online supporters have widely condemned the Obama administration as the unseen hand coordinating efforts to choke off WikiLeaks by denying it financing and suppressing its network of computer servers. Mr. Housh described Mr. Assange in an interview as “a political prisoner,” a common view among WikiLeaks supporters who have joined Mr. Assange in condemning the sexual abuse accusations as part of an American-inspired “smear campaign.” Another activist used the analogy of the civil rights struggle for the cyberattacks. “Are they disrupting business?” a contributor using the name Moryath wrote in a comment on the slashdot.org technology Web site. “Perhaps, but no worse than the lunch counter sit-ins did.”</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/operation-payback-attacks-visa/?ref=mastercardinc">'Operation Payback' Attacks Fell Visa.com<date>December 8, 2010, 4:18 pm</date><text>A message posted on Twitter by a group of Internet activists announcing the start of an attack on Visa’s Web site, in retaliation for the company’s actions against WikiLeaks. Last Updated | 6:54 p.m. A group of Internet activists took credit for crashing the Visa.com Web site on Wednesday afternoon, hours after they launched a similar attack on MasterCard. The cyber attacks, by activists who call themselves Anonymous, are aimed at punishing companies that have acted to stop the flow of donations to WikiLeaks in recent days. The group explained that its distributed denial of service attacks — in which they essentially flood Web sites site with traffic to slow them down or knock them offline — were part of a broader effort called Operation Payback, which began as a way of punishing companies that attempted to stop Internet file-sharing and movie downloads. Visa’s Web site went offline minutes after the attack began and was down for more than an hour. On Twitter, the activists, who call Operation Payback “an ongoing campaign by Anonymous against major anti-piracy &amp; anti-freedom entities,” celebrated the apparent success of their attack on Visa’s Web site, writing: “IT’S DOWN! KEEP FIRING!!! #DDOS #PAYBACK #WIKILEAKS.” (For more on the Operation Payback activists see our post on the MasterCard attack and an article by my colleagues Ravi Somaiya and John Markoff. After Wednesday’s attacks, the group’s Facebook page was removed from the social network and its Twitter feed was suspended — although, within minutes, a new Twitter feed apparently sprang up in its place.) The move against Visa comes after a Web services company in Iceland, DataCell.com, which has supported WikiLeaks and still hosts a Web page facilitating donations to the organization, complained that the credit card company had tried to force it to stop working for the non-profit media site. The Icelandic news site Ice News reports that DataCell’s founder, Olafur Sigurvinsson, said in an interview that the company also hosts the Web site Wikileaks.ch. Ice News added that Mr. Sigurvinsson told Iceland’s national broadcaster RUV that “he finds Visa and MasterCard’s request that DataCell stop serving WikiLeaks highly distasteful, asking what business two private companies have dictating terms to another private company.” He added, “It is clear that they will never close WikiLeaks except by taking the whole Internet down.” The chief executive of DataCell, Andreas Fink, explained in a statement that his company has been operating “a payment gateway so people can donate” to WikiLeaks for two months. On Tuesday, Mr. Fink said that Visa had asked DataCell to stop accepting payment details from Visa cardholders who wanted to donate money to WikiLeaks. The company declined to do so, because, Mr. Fink explained: After discussions with our lawyers, we have decided that we can not honor such requests based on the pure simple fact of untrue and unverified accusations. Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship and/or limitation. The right to freedom of speech is recognized as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law. Furthermore freedom of speech is recognized in European, inter-American and African regional human rights law. It is simply ridiculous to even think WikiLeaks has done anything criminal. If WikiLeaks is criminal, then CNN, and BBC, The New York Times, The Guardian, Al Jazeera and many others would have to be considered criminals too as they publish the same information. Nobody even tries to touch them though. You can still buy a New York Times subscription and pay with your credit card I guess. On Wednesday, Mr. Fink added an update to his statement, in which he said that Visa and MasterCard had stopped processing all online payments facilitated by DataCell, affecting up to 3,000 clients, apparently to ensure that no money would make it to WikiLeaks. Mr Fink added that his company was taking “immediate legal actions to make donations possible again.” He also wrote: The suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with [Visa's] customers. Visa users have explicitly expressed their will to send their donations to WikiLeaks and Visa is not fulfilling this wish. It will probably hurt their brand much much more to block payments towards WikiLeaks than to have them occur. Visa customers are contacting us in masses to confirm that they really donate and they are not happy about Visa rejecting them. It is obvious that Visa is under political pressure to close us down. We strongly believe a world class company such as Visa should not get involved by politics and just simply do their business where they are good at. Transferring money. They have no problem transferring money for other businesses such as gambling sites, pornography services and the like so why a donation to a Web site which is holding up for human rights should be morally any worse than that is outside of my understanding…. This is not about the brand of Visa, this is about politics and Visa should not be involved in this.</text></article>

Travelex, a currency exchange company, has begun selling a preloaded debit card that uses the “chip and PIN” technology that is becoming the standard in Europe and other parts of the world. Travelex is upgrading its existing Cash Passport cards to include the familiar magnetic stripe as well as a microchip that works in tandem with a PIN, which is revealed by scratching off a strip as on a lottery card. Many self-service kiosks and some merchants in Europe accept only cards that use the chip and PIN technology, creating headaches for Americans who carry magnetic-stripe credit and debit cards. Although the smart cards are considered more secure, United States banks have been resisting a switch to the new technology. The Cash Passport smart cards will be available in euros or pounds and can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. Travelex is initially selling the cards at its airport and retail locations but plans to begin selling them online early next year. Jon Dario, president of Travelex, says the company does not charge a fee to purchase or use the card (its profit is built into the exchange rate offered), but some ATM operators abroad may charge fees of their own. Travelex does charge an inactivity fee of roughly $3 per month after the card hasn’t been used for a year, but customers can avoid this fee by cashing in their unused balance when they return home. “You can bring the card back to us at the end of your trip,” Mr. Dario said. “We’ll take the value off and give you back U.S. dollars with absolutely no fee and no additional exchange rate.”</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/us/politics/09rules.html?ref=mastercardinc">Washington Rule Makers Out of the Shadows<date>Published: December 8, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Federal rule makers, long the neglected stepchildren of Washington bureaucrats, suddenly find themselves at the center of power as they scramble to work out details of hundreds of sweeping financial and health care regulations that will ultimately affect most Americans.In Bethesda, Md., more than 200 health regulators working on complicated insurance rules have taken over three floors of a suburban office building, paying almost double the market rate for the space in their rush to get started. Executives from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have been meeting almost daily with financial rule makers to air concerns about regulations they say threaten to curtail commerce. And at the White House, senior officials receive several status reports a week on a process that all sides agree has vast implications for the country as a whole and for the Obama administration’s political fortunes. The boom in rule-making — the bureaucratic term for the nitty-gritty of drafting regulations — is a result of the mega-bills approved by Congress this year at the urging of President Obama: the health care bill signed into law in March, and the financial overhaul law signed in July. “There has never been a period like what we are going through now, in terms of the sheer volume and complexity of rule-making,” said Paul Dennett, senior vice president of the American Benefits Council, a trade group for large employers. And what was already shaping up as a rancorous lobbying battle over the rules is likely to become more contentious when Republicans take control of the House, having been swept to power on a pledge to influence health care and financial regulation. At the very least, Republicans will be able to hold public hearings to spotlight financial regulations they see as too restrictive and health care rules they see as too disruptive, and they could pressure regulators to soften them. The debate over federal spending has already slowed the development of financial rules, as hundreds of new rule-making positions have gone unfilled because of a lack of new financing. Congress provided a road map for measures aimed broadly at getting more Americans covered by health insurance and providing more federal safeguards against risky financial practices. But the laws were so broad and complex that executive-branch regulators have wide leeway in determining what the rules should say and how they should be carried out. In all, the bills call for drafting more than 300 separate rules on a rolling schedule by about 2014, plus dozens of other studies and periodic reports. That may be only the beginning. A recent report from the Congressional Research Service said the publication of rules under the health care law could stretch out for decades to come. Regulators at various agencies are trying to answer questions like these: ¶How much should a credit-card company be able to charge a shopkeeper for administrative fees when you swipe your card for a purchase? ¶Which types of financial companies are so “systemically important” to the overall economy that they should be subject to greater federal oversight? ¶What services must be covered by all insurers as part of the “essential health benefits” package? And at what point would an increase in an insurer’s premiums be considered so “unreasonable” that state and federal regulators could step in? These and many other questions are now in the hands of government lawyers, doctors, bankers, accountants, actuaries and other regulatory specialists. With the rules spread across agencies, no one is certain how many employees are working on them, but the number is certainly in the hundreds or higher. At the Federal Reserve, for instance, most of more than 50 lawyers in the legal division are now spending significant parts of their days on rule-making issues, like the question of how to carry out and enforce the so-called Volcker Rule, named for Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, restricting banks from making certain types of speculative investments. No longer are these considered arcane questions that draw scrutiny only from the few Washingtonians who read the “notices of proposed rule-making” in the Federal Register. These days, the rule makers are attracting attention from Congressional officials, industry advocates and lobbyists, with dozens of executives from firms like Goldman Sachs, Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse meeting with federal regulators recently to give input on specific rules and try to influence the outcome, according to public online postings by federal regulators on many of the meetings. “I wake up in the morning thinking about this stuff, and I go to sleep at night thinking about it,” said Tom Quaadman, a senior Chamber of Commerce executive who is leading a group of 10 staff members seeking to shape the financial rules.

On Twitter, the activists, who call Operation Payback “an ongoing campaign by Anonymous against major anti-piracy &amp; anti-freedom entities,” celebrated the apparent success of their attack on Visa’s Web site, writing: “IT’S DOWN! KEEP FIRING!!! #DDOS #PAYBACK #WIKILEAKS.” (For more on the Operation Payback activists see our post on the MasterCard attack and an article by my colleagues Ravi Somaiya and John Markoff. After Wednesday’s attacks, the group’s Facebook page was removed from the social network and its Twitter feed was suspended — although, within minutes, a new Twitter feed apparently sprang up in its place.) The move against Visa comes after a Web services company in Iceland, DataCell.com, which has supported WikiLeaks and still hosts a Web page facilitating donations to the organization, complained that the credit card company had tried to force it to stop working for the non-profit media site. The Icelandic news site Ice News reports that DataCell’s founder, Olafur Sigurvinsson, said in an interview that the company also hosts the Web site Wikileaks.ch. Ice News added that Mr. Sigurvinsson told Iceland’s national broadcaster RUV that “he finds Visa and MasterCard’s request that DataCell stop serving WikiLeaks highly distasteful, asking what business two private companies have dictating terms to another private company.” He added, “It is clear that they will never close WikiLeaks except by taking the whole Internet down.” The chief executive of DataCell, Andreas Fink, explained in a statement that his company has been operating “a payment gateway so people can donate” to WikiLeaks for two months. On Tuesday, Mr. Fink said that Visa had asked DataCell to stop accepting payment details from Visa cardholders who wanted to donate money to WikiLeaks. The company declined to do so, because, Mr. Fink explained: After discussions with our lawyers, we have decided that we can not honor such requests based on the pure simple fact of untrue and unverified accusations. Freedom of speech is the freedom to speak freely without censorship and/or limitation. The right to freedom of speech is recognized as a human right under Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and recognized in international human rights law. Furthermore freedom of speech is recognized in European, inter-American and African regional human rights law. It is simply ridiculous to even think WikiLeaks has done anything criminal. If WikiLeaks is criminal, then CNN, and BBC, The New York Times, The Guardian, Al Jazeera and many others would have to be considered criminals too as they publish the same information. Nobody even tries to touch them though. You can still buy a New York Times subscription and pay with your credit card I guess. On Wednesday, Mr. Fink added an update to his statement, in which he said that Visa and MasterCard had stopped processing all online payments facilitated by DataCell, affecting up to 3,000 clients, apparently to ensure that no money would make it to WikiLeaks. Mr Fink added that his company was taking “immediate legal actions to make donations possible again.” He also wrote: The suspension of payments towards WikiLeaks is a violation of the agreements with [Visa's] customers. Visa users have explicitly expressed their will to send their donations to WikiLeaks and Visa is not fulfilling this wish. It will probably hurt their brand much much more to block payments towards WikiLeaks than to have them occur. Visa customers are contacting us in masses to confirm that they really donate and they are not happy about Visa rejecting them. It is obvious that Visa is under political pressure to close us down. We strongly believe a world class company such as Visa should not get involved by politics and just simply do their business where they are good at. Transferring money. They have no problem transferring money for other businesses such as gambling sites, pornography services and the like so why a donation to a Web site which is holding up for human rights should be morally any worse than that is outside of my understanding…. This is not about the brand of Visa, this is about politics and Visa should not be involved in this.</text></article>

Travelex, a currency exchange company, has begun selling a preloaded debit card that uses the “chip and PIN” technology that is becoming the standard in Europe and other parts of the world. Travelex is upgrading its existing Cash Passport cards to include the familiar magnetic stripe as well as a microchip that works in tandem with a PIN, which is revealed by scratching off a strip as on a lottery card. Many self-service kiosks and some merchants in Europe accept only cards that use the chip and PIN technology, creating headaches for Americans who carry magnetic-stripe credit and debit cards. Although the smart cards are considered more secure, United States banks have been resisting a switch to the new technology. The Cash Passport smart cards will be available in euros or pounds and can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. Travelex is initially selling the cards at its airport and retail locations but plans to begin selling them online early next year. Jon Dario, president of Travelex, says the company does not charge a fee to purchase or use the card (its profit is built into the exchange rate offered), but some ATM operators abroad may charge fees of their own. Travelex does charge an inactivity fee of roughly $3 per month after the card hasn’t been used for a year, but customers can avoid this fee by cashing in their unused balance when they return home. “You can bring the card back to us at the end of your trip,” Mr. Dario said. “We’ll take the value off and give you back U.S. dollars with absolutely no fee and no additional exchange rate.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bucks.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/be-wary-of-credit-cards-with-no-spending-limits/?ref=mastercardinc">Be Wary of Credit Cards With No Spending Limits<date>December 1, 2010, 4:59 pm</date><text>Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Consumers may want to think twice before using credit cards cards without set spending limits. If you needed a reason to keep balances low on credit cards without set spending limits, here’s one. The way certain issuers report the cards with no preset spending limit (like Visa Signature and World MasterCard cards) to the credit bureaus could have a negative effect on your credit score if you carry a high balance. This is because of how the cards may affect the calculation of your credit utilization ratio, an important variable in calculating credit scores. Here’s how a statement sent on behalf of FICO, which calculates credit scores, explained it. If one of these cards is reported as an open account, it will not be factored into the FICO’s calculation of credit utilization and, thus, wouldn’t affect a credit score. On the other hand, if an issuer reports the card as a revolving account with a credit limit or the highest balance within a certain time period, the utilization ratio on the card could potentially be very high and have a negative impact on a consumer’s credit score –  especially if the consumer spent more than the limit and or had a high balance on the card. In general, with FICO scores, the lower the utilization ratio, the better. To determine how such cards from various issuers could potentially affect credit scores, the credit card comparison site CardHub.com recently contacted representatives from the major issuers and from FICO to find out how each card company reports the information about the  no preset limit cards. It then assigned ratings to the issuers based on how consumer-friendly their policies were, assuming that the most consumer-friendly practice (rated “good”) would be to report the cards in a way that excludes them from utilization ratio calculations and less consumer-friendly practices (rated “fair”) would be to report the cards in a way that includes them in such calculations. Here’s how the various issuers stacked up in CardHub.com’s recently released study. American Express, Chase and Citibank received “good” ratings, while Bank of America, Capital One, Wells Fargo and USAA received “fair ratings.” The full results can be viewed on CardHub.com’s site. “My advice is just don’t use” such cards, said Odysseas Papadimitriou, chief executive officer of CardHub.com. “There is just so much diversity” in how issuers report the information and “the issuers can change what they report and how they report it at any point in time and they don’t have to notify you.” Plus, according to CardHub.com, many of the cards “encourage cardholders to spend more than their ‘limit,’ which leads to circumstances in which lenders see the consumer as having a very high utilization ratio on that account, often close to 100 percent.” The FICO statement cautioned, however, against assuming that just because a card with no preset limit is included in utilization calculations, it will automatically have a negative impact on a credit score. The ultimate score, the statement said, depends on a particular person’s credit profile, including factors like how the utilization ratio of the card with no preset limit compares with that of the person’s other cards. If, for instance, an individual has a low utilization ratio on the no preset limit card, then the  FICO score could benefit from the card being included in the calculations. “The reverse scenario applies as well,” the statement said. There are cases where including the no preset limit card in the utilization calculation could increase the overall ratio, and have a negative impact on the credit score. As a result, keeping balances on these cards low “is the best way to ensure that these cards will have a positive impact on a FICO score,” the FICO statement said. Card issuers, meanwhile, said the study was misleading. “The CardHub report accurately describes how we report information on no preset spending limit cards; however, we disagree with the report’s conclusion that reporting a high balance or credit limit on a card necessarily has a negative impact on an individual’s credit score,” Betty Reiss, a Bank of America spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail. “It can also have some positive effect such as showing the customer has handled higher credit exposures,” she said. Spokeswomen for other issuers, meanwhile, including Capital One, USAA and Wells Fargo, said their reporting methods follow industry guidelines. “Reporting credit limits on these accounts is a regulatory expectation,” Pam Girardo, a Capital One spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail. “Our approach is supported by the industry standard reporting guidelines, which are published by a consortium of the credit bureaus,” she said, adding that “while we don’t control or necessarily even have insight into third party credit-scoring models, we don’t believe our reporting has a negative impact on the higher spend transactors that are the target audience for these cards.” CardHub.com also rated the issuers for their degree of transparency. A spokeswoman for Chase, which received a “poor” transparency rating, said “the reason we didn’t respond is that we’re in the process of evaluating how we handle these very questions.” What do you think about cards without a set spending limit?</text></article>

In moments, she found the perfect frames -- made by a French company called Lafont -- on a Web site that looked snazzy and stood at the top of the search results. Not the tippy-top, where the paid ads are found, but under those, on Google's version of the gold-medal podium, where the most relevant and popular site is displayed. Ms. Rodriguez placed an order for both the Lafonts and a set of doctor-prescribed Ciba Vision contact lenses on that site, DecorMyEyes.com. The total cost was $361.97. It was the start of what Ms. Rodriguez would later describe as one of the most maddening and miserable experiences of her life. The next day, a man named Tony Russo called to say that DecorMyEyes had run out of the Ciba Visions. Pick another brand, he advised a little brusquely. ''I told him that I didn't want another brand,'' recalls Ms. Rodriguez, who lives in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. ''And I asked for a refund. He got rude, really obnoxious. 'What's the big deal? Choose another brand!' '' With the contacts issue unresolved, her eyeglasses arrived two days later. But the frames appeared to be counterfeits and Ms. Rodriguez, a lifelong fan of Lafont, remembers that even the case seemed fake. Soon after, she discovered that DecorMyEyes had charged her $487 -- or an extra $125. When she and Mr. Russo spoke again, she asked about the overcharge and said she would return the frames. ''What the hell am I supposed to do with these glasses?'' she recalls Mr. Russo shouting. ''I ordered them from France specifically for you!'' ''I'm going to contact my credit card company,'' she told him, ''and dispute the charge.'' Until that moment, Mr. Russo was merely ornery. Now he erupted. ''Listen, bitch,'' he fumed, according to Ms. Rodriguez. ''I know your address. I'm one bridge over'' -- a reference, it turned out, to the company's office in Brooklyn. Then, she said, he threatened to find her and commit an act of sexual violence too graphic to describe in a newspaper. Ms. Rodriguez was shaken but undaunted. That day she called Citibank, which administers her MasterCard account, and after submitting some paperwork, she won a provisional victory. Her $487 would be refunded as the bank looked into the charge and discussed it with the owner of DecorMyEyes. A final determination, she was told, would take 60 days. As that two-month deadline approached, Mr. Russo had dropped his claim for the contact lenses he'd never sent. But, she said, he began an increasingly nasty campaign to persuade her to contact Citibank and withdraw her dispute. ''Call me back or I'm going to drag you to small-claims court,'' he wrote in an e-mail on Sept. 27. ''You have one hour to call me back or I'm filing online.'' A few hours later, Mr. Russo sent details of what appeared to be a lawsuit filed in Brooklyn. It included a hearing date and time, the address of the court, a docket number and a demand for $1,500, which, the e-mail said, ''includes my legal fees.'' Ms. Rodriguez did not respond. A few hours later, Mr. Russo raised the stakes sharply by sending another e-mail, this one with a photograph of the front of the apartment building where she and her fiancé lived. Then her cellphone started ringing. And ringing. Ms. Rodriguez and her fiancé went to the police station at 1 a.m. to file a complaint. ''At that point,'' she says, ''I was scared.'' An officer assured her that the police would take the issue seriously. Two days later, she received another e-mail from Mr. Russo. ''Close the dispute with the credit card company if you know whats good for you,'' he wrote. ''Do the right thing and everyone goes away. I AM WATCHING YOU!'' That same day an e-mail from Citi arrived. ''Thank you for contacting Citi Cards,'' it read. ''We have closed our investigation since you have indicated that you accept responsibility for this charge.'' And there was this: ''we have rebilled your account for this charge along with any related fees and interest charges.'' Someone posing as Ms. Rodriguez, she says, had called the bank and said she had changed her mind and no longer wanted a refund.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/26/business/26retail.html?ref=mastercardinc">Black Friday Kicks Off High Hopes<date>Published: November 25, 2010</date><text>Buy more, save more seems to be the mantra going into the holiday shopping season.Analysts are expecting one of the most heavily trafficked Fridays after Thanksgiving in years, and to attract those customers, retailers are expected to offer a rash of sales and door-buster specials that may eat into their profits. But the turnout may be a little lower, given predictions of snowstorms moving from the West to the Midwest and New England, and rainstorms in the New York area. The day after Thanksgiving is called Black Friday because it is the day that retailers hope to turn from unprofitable (in the red, in accounting terms) to profitable (in the black) for the year. Last year, consumers spent $18.6 billion on Black Friday, according to MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect November sales for stores open at least a year to increase 3.5 percent, a sharp uptick after last year, when sales increased just 0.5 percent. Hoping that consumers might finally be returning, retailers are trying just about anything to capture their cash. Many stores began running special offers in October this year. Online sites for Staples, Macy’s and Kohl’s offered Thanksgiving Day specials. Sears, Kmart and many Gap and Old Navy stores were open on Thanksgiving Day, with Toys “R” Us opening its doors at 10 p.m. on the holiday, and most Wal-Marts opening at midnight. “You’ve seen retailers getting much deeper in their discounts, but also much earlier and more aggressive — they’re doing anything they can to get the consumer to spend money,” said David Bassuk, managing director of retail at the consulting firm AlixPartners. “This holiday is going to be a big view into who’s winning and who’s losing,” he said. “The first data that’s going to be available is sales, and people are going to want to show sales. There’s a lot of ways to finagle the profit story later.” Here are five other trends that should define this shopping season: CROWDS, AT LAST Mall traffic this year is up more than 12 percent over last year, according to Remote Sensing Metrics, which uses satellite images to track how full mall parking lots are. And traffic has been increasing through November. Several malls owned by the developer Taubman reported that traffic was up the weekend before Thanksgiving. It was “clearly better than last year,” said Nick LeMasters, general manager of the Cherry Creek Shopping Center in Denver. That was echoed by malls nationwide, including ones in Auburn Hills, Mich.; Clinton Township, Mich.; Short Hills, N.J.; Plano, Tex.; and Norfolk, Va. “Several merchants reported better-than-expected, and better-than-last-year, numbers,” said Karen Winters, marketing director for the MacArthur Center in Norfolk. Bill Vetter, the general manager of Lawrence, part of the Tensator Group, which helps stores like Wal-Mart and Target with crowd control, said clients were expecting the highest traffic since 2006. Retailers are still quite cautious about security, he said, since a Wal-Mart employee was trampled to death when doors opened on Black Friday in 2008. One way they are trying to calm crowds is with single-file lines at the register, which Kohl’s, Target and T. J. Maxx are testing in busy stores this year. “You take the anxiety out of the guest experience,” Mr. Vetter said. SALES, SALES EVERYWHERE Especially in categories that have been sluggish this year, like electronics and adult apparel, analysts are expecting heavy promotions across the board. Last year on the Friday after Thanksgiving, Americans bought $1.3 billion worth of electronics — twice as much as the second most important day for electronics last year, which was Saturday Dec. 19, according to SpendingPulse. The electronics stores seem to have mastered the promotional push. At Best Buy last year, for example, an average of 700 people lined up outside each store on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the chain said. This year should be extraordinarily competitive because Wal-Mart has promised to match any competitor’s door-buster price as long as consumers bring in the competitor’s ads. In adult clothes, too, analysts are expecting heavy promotions. John D. Morris, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets who tracks how deep retail discounts are, estimated that this year was more promotion-heavy than last year, especially in the adult stores. Another reason so many adult clothes are marked down is that parents seem to be spending on their children first, then buying for themselves. “Women’s apparel numbers have really suffered at the expense of protecting spending on children,” said Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for SpendingPulse. Still, he said, women’s apparel spending picked up in October and early November. Brad Wilson, who runs the site BlackFriday2010.com, said that deals over all were better than last year. “The big stores are being so aggressive on price,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/22/business/22cybershop.html?ref=mastercardinc">Thanksgiving as an Online Shopping Holiday<date>Published: November 21, 2010</date><text>Amanda Thomas Perry used to skip sleeping on Thanksgiving night so she could be at Lowe’s or Wal-Mart before dawn on Friday for the special “door-buster” deals.But after too many so-called Black Fridays where she felt nauseated from lack of sleep — and one when her husband, overwhelmed by the discounts, arrived at the register with armfuls of digital photo frames they did not need — Ms. Perry will be starting her holiday sales shopping from the computer in her living room on Thanksgiving Day. “You’re warmer, and you don’t have to deal with cranky people,” said Ms. Perry, a college student who lives in Murray, Ky. A few years ago, Thanksgiving was not even considered a shopping day, as most stores are closed. But this year, retailers are driving customers to the Web with more specials than ever — door busters without the door — creating an online jump-start to the traditional Black Friday rush. “It’s going to be a very competitive day,” said Kevin Mansell, chairman and chief executive of Kohl’s, the department store chain with more than 1,000 outlets nationwide, which plans to offer almost all of its Black Friday specials online beginning on Thursday. The Web deals are wide-ranging. Walmart.com is offering discounts of up to 40 percent on almost 150 items, triple the number of specials in 2009. At Radio Shack, Best Buy, Macy’s and J. C. Penney, almost every Black Friday deal can be had online starting on Thursday. Even Web-only merchants like Amazon.com are offering steep discounts that day. “Just because they’re at home on Thanksgiving and most stores are closed, that doesn’t mean they don’t want the opportunity to go online, to shop, to build their gift list,” said Mr. Mansell of Kohl’s, which like most retailers will extend its Thursday deals to Friday, too. For several years now, both Thanksgiving and the Friday after have grown in importance for online retailers, which previously directed their late November promotions almost entirely to the Monday after Thanksgiving. Last year, $318 million was spent online on Thanksgiving, an increase of more than 10 percent from the year before, and $595 million was spent the next day, an increase of 11 percent. While the Cyber Monday total was bigger, $887 million, it grew only 5 percent from 2008, according to comScore, an Internet research company. Retail analysts and executives said they expected the numbers to be even greater this year. The reasons are chiefly economic: in-store sales for the last few years have been dreary, and the Internet is a crucial place to attract new customers who are not early risers. Retail sales have risen about 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year, according to SpendingPulse, an information service of MasterCard Advisors. By contrast, the most recent figures for e-commerce showed growth of more than 11 percent for early November alone, MasterCard said. “The competitive landscape is one driver leading retailers to be more aggressive earlier,” said Eric Best, chief executive of the Mercent Corporation, which aims to help brands sell products on e-commerce sites. Retailers say they are also responding to their customers. “I don’t think retailers would tell you it was our target to start shopping earlier — that’s what consumers wanted,” said Steve Nave, senior vice president and general manager of Walmart.com. “As broadband penetration, specifically, started to grow, customers on that day, once they were done with their Thanksgiving celebrations, they weren’t necessarily ready to go to a store, but it’s pretty easy to pull up a Web page and start researching.” Wal-Mart is trying to capitalize on those advance researchers. On Monday, it plans to announce that it will match any competitor’s Black Friday prices in Wal-Mart stores as long as customers bring in the competitor’s ads. Also, traffic to retail Web sites began to grow as stores put Black Friday ads and tools online. At Walmart.com, for instance, shoppers can print out in-store maps that label where specially discounted product are located. The increased online traffic led many retailers to offer Web deals so visitors would buy something, not just browse. Michael J. Boylson, chief marketing officer, said: “We think it’s a way to get some of that early business. We’d rather capture it online than open on Thursday.” Marie Prophete, a 23-year-old college student in Fullerton, Calif., made the switch to online holiday shopping after she went to a Wal-Mart on the morning of Black Friday and found that not only was the store out of specially discounted video game consoles, but also that every popular video game was gone. “Online, they have a warehouse of the stuff, so you’ll know you’ll get it — they won’t run out in a few seconds,” Ms. Prophete said. “I was like, oh, man, never mind. I’ll just shop online.” Even if shoppers do wind up in the stores on Black Friday, they often end up buying online anyway, said Craig Berman, a spokesman for Amazon.com. “There are lots of customers who will be out and about, and maybe comparing prices via mobile devices and may end up shopping on Black Friday through their smartphones,” he said. Though it expands potential customers, running online deals on Thursday and Friday poses challenges for retailers. Shoppers who wait for hours in line and find that a door-buster deal has been snapped up — but that people on the Web got the item without even waiting — could feel some ill will. To avoid that problem, Kathee Tesija, executive vice president of merchandising for Target, said the company Web site and stores ran different deals. “We don’t want any confusion between online and in stores,” she said. “There are limited quantities, and our intent is for them to last the whole two days, but sometimes we do run short.” Another risk for stores is that retailers traditionally earn little profit on door-buster specials to get shoppers inside, hoping they will add other, more profitable, items to their shopping carts. Online, that is less likely to happen. “I can budget better,” said Ms. Prophete, the California student. “When I go to the store, you make a list, but you usually get stuff that’s not on the list.” Not that online shopping cannot be fun for bargain seekers who enjoy the thrill of the hunt. In Kentucky, Ms. Perry said she would be at home on Thanksgiving, but poised for the virtual version of rushing the door. She has created accounts at Walmart.com, BestBuy.com, Toysrus.com and others to store her shipping address. She plans to have the product pages for the Microsoft Xbox and flat-screen televisions pulled up before the sales start. She has even typed her credit card number into a Word document so she can copy and paste it into the ordering site rather than typing it out and risk taking too long. “You have to get in quick or they’re gone, like within five minutes,” she said. “It’s still a competition.”</text></article>

Over Economic Terms of Contract<date>Published: November 12, 2010</date><text>Budweiser’s decades-long connection to Major League Baseball frayed Friday when the giant brewer’s parent company, Anheuser-Busch, alleged in a federal lawsuit that baseball reneged on an agreement reached earlier this year to extend the beer maker’s sponsorship.With Budweiser’s sponsorship set to expire this year, the company said that it negotiated the terms of a multiyear renewal last April. The sides even exchanged congratulatory messages. One baseball executive, John Brody, then the head of corporate sales and marketing, sent an e-mail to Budweiser that read, “We are excited about the extension of this amazing partnership.” But within a month, the deal began to unravel when Anheuser-Busch became the official beer sponsor of the National Football League, according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court against Major League Baseball Properties. At that point, the suit said, Tim Brosnan, an executive vice president in charge of business, “began to complain that the economic terms of the April renewal agreement were no longer satisfactory and that the market had changed,” according to the court papers. The lawsuit did not cite financial terms of any of the deals, but the lawsuit said that Brosnan demanded Anheuser-Busch pay “several times” more than had been negotiated. In September, Brosnan informed the brewer that baseball was going to try to sell the beer sponsorship to other brewers. On Oct. 1, Brosnan informed David Peacock, the president of Anheuser-Busch, that baseball was “going to disavow” the April deal. A week later, Anheuser-Busch sent letters to some of its domestic competitors informing them that it would defend its rights should any of them negotiate a deal with Major League Baseball. In response to the lawsuit, M.L.B. issued a statement saying: “Major League Baseball Properties hasn’t been served with the complaint and our lawyers have yet to review it. We don’t normally discuss active litigation; however, we have a different view of what has been reported.” Keith Levy, the vice president for marketing for Anheuser-Busch, said in a statement, “As our renewal with M.L.B. begins with the 2011 season, a timely resolution is important, and we hope to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.” Anheuser-Busch is asking the court to declare the April agreement valid and enforceable, and to prohibit baseball from negotiating with another brewer. The lawsuit does not involve Budweiser’s sponsorship of 26 major league teams. Jim Andrews, the editorial director of IEG, a sponsorship consulting and valuation firm, said that Anheuser-Busch had paid baseball an annual sponsorship fee of about $10 million, while its fee to the N.F.L. for its Bud Light sponsorship starts at a reported $43 million a year and rises to $50 million in the sixth and final year. In both cases, there are additional expenses like buying advertising on national broadcasts. Andrews said that if baseball could find other suitors, one option could be MillerCoors, whose Coors Light brand was replaced as the N.F.L.’s official beer by Anheuser Busch’s Bud Light. “You’re talking beer and baseball,” he said. “It’s such a natural category.” He said he could remember only one case like the one between M.L.B. and Anheuser-Busch: In 2006, MasterCard sued FIFA for entering a deal to make Visa the credit-card sponsors of the 2010 and 2014 World Cups in violation of its contractual right to renew. A district court ruling that favored MasterCard was reversed by an appeals court; eventually, FIFA paid MasterCard a $90 million settlement.</text></article>

With Budweiser’s sponsorship set to expire this year, the company said that it negotiated the terms of a multiyear renewal last April. The sides even exchanged congratulatory messages. One baseball executive, John Brody, then the head of corporate sales and marketing, sent an e-mail to Budweiser that read, “We are excited about the extension of this amazing partnership.” But within a month, the deal began to unravel when Anheuser-Busch became the official beer sponsor of the National Football League, according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court against Major League Baseball Properties. At that point, the suit said, Tim Brosnan, an executive vice president in charge of business, “began to complain that the economic terms of the April renewal agreement were no longer satisfactory and that the market had changed,” according to the court papers. The lawsuit did not cite financial terms of any of the deals, but the lawsuit said that Brosnan demanded Anheuser-Busch pay “several times” more than had been negotiated. In September, Brosnan informed the brewer that baseball was going to try to sell the beer sponsorship to other brewers. On Oct. 1, Brosnan informed David Peacock, the president of Anheuser-Busch, that baseball was “going to disavow” the April deal. A week later, Anheuser-Busch sent letters to some of its domestic competitors informing them that it would defend its rights should any of them negotiate a deal with Major League Baseball.

When politicians vied for Alan Greenspan’s favor and fell all over themselves praising his wisdom?Now poor Ben S. Bernanke, who succeeded Mr. Greenspan as Fed chairman, is being blasted from all sides. It is bad enough that his latest effort to revive the American economy has taken on a name previously used for a 40-year-old cruise ship that no longer sails — QE2. He is attacked by Americans for printing money and by overseas officials for trying to help American trade by undermining the dollar. Some Republicans claim to believe the country would be better off without a central bank at all. If the stock market were falling, you can be sure the Fed would get the blame. But it has been rising of late, and in some critiques that is proof of the Fed’s perfidy. The Fed is creating inflation, its critics say. Overseas, there is a widespread belief that the purpose of QE2, for the second round of quantitative easing, must be to depress the dollar and thus give the United States an unfair trade advantage. “It’s inconsistent,” thundered the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, in an interview with Der Spiegel, “for the Americans to accuse the Chinese of manipulating exchange rates and then to artificially depress the dollar exchange rate by printing money.” Oddly enough, the dollar rallied in the week after the latest plan was announced, even though the normal expectation would be for a weakening. The currency slipped after Mr. Bernanke signaled such a move was likely, but it seemed unlikely the currency was a major consideration in the Fed’s decision. If the central bank does manage to kick-start economic growth, the dollar is likely to rise further. The Fed did not deserve the praise it used to get. It presided over bubbles and huge debt creation. When things were good, it forgot the injunction of a former Fed chairman, William McChesney Martin, that the Fed’s job was to “take away the punch bowl” when everyone was having a good time. We would be much better off if the Fed had noticed there was a bubble inflating in housing, rather than take the doctrinaire position that there were no bubbles, or, if there were, no one could figure out if they were too big. Some Fed officials say they have learned that lesson, and will act differently when something similar happens. Right now, we can only hope we’ll get the chance to see if they will be wiser the next time. For now, there is no party at all, let alone one with spiked punch. Yet no less eminent an economist than Martin Feldstein, a Harvard professor, former president of the National Bureau of Economic Research and chairman of Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers when the country was recovering from a severe recession in the early 1980s, is worried. Anticipation of QE2, he wrote in The Financial Times, caused prices of commodities and common stocks to rise. “Like all bubbles, these exaggerated increases can rapidly reverse when interest rates return to normal levels,” he said. “The greatest danger will then be to leveraged investors, including individuals who bought these assets with borrowed money and banks that hold long-term securities. These risks should be clear after the recent crisis driven by the bursting of asset price bubbles. Although the specific asset prices that are now rising are different from last time, the possibility of damaging declines when bubbles burst is worryingly similar.” The threat of rising prices also was clear to Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor, who asserted that “everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so. Pump-priming would push them even higher. And it’s not just groceries. Oil recently hit a six-month high, at more than $87 a barrel.” Those worries seem excessive. The Fed is clearly more concerned about deflation than inflation, and it has a point. Inflation may be a longer-term problem, but that term is likely to be longer than you would guess from a lot of the commentary. To be sure, some prices are up. But that could mean that markets are more encouraged about growth prospects than they were when the American recovery stalled this summer and brought on talk of a double-dip recession. It seems that the third-quarter growth rate of gross domestic product will be revised higher from the 2 percent initially reported. Kamalesh Rao, the director of research for MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which monitors retail sales, says those sales grew about 3 percent in October. “It is not an extraordinary rate of growth, but it indicates we are coming out of that summer lull,” he said. Near the end of 2008, oil traded below $35 a barrel and the Standard &amp;Poor’s 500-stock index, now around 1,200, fell below 800. What has changed since then is not inflation, or inflation expectations. The Consumer Price Index for September was a little below the figure for two years earlier. The arrival of Great Depression II seems less likely now.</text></article>

The company, which processes credit card transactions but does not lend directly to people, makes money each time someone buys something with one of its credit or debit cards. It was relatively insulated from the credit losses that banks suffered during the financial crisis, but its revenue faltered in the last two years as consumers spent less money. “The numbers were well ahead of expectations” and illustrated “a fundamental turn in their business,” said James T. Tierney Jr., chief investment officer of W.P. Stewart, which owns MasterCard shares. The company is cultivating new business in emerging markets, and consumers in Asia, Europe and especially Latin America spent more money with MasterCard-branded credit and debit cards in the quarter. MasterCard reported a 32 percent jump in debit card purchase volume growth outside the United States, meaning that many people who once relied on cash are starting to replace it with cards. Cross-border volumes also rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, indicating that more people and businesses are spending money on travel and using their cards abroad. The chief executive, Ajay Banga, was cautious regarding the United States economy. Spending on MasterCards in the United States shrank slightly during the quarter, although much less than it did a year ago. The company has relatively few opportunities for growth in the United States, where rival Visa dominates the debit processing market and most consumers already use credit and debit cards. MasterCard earned $518 million, or $3.94 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $452 million, or $3.45 a share, a year earlier.

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/22/your-money/credit-and-debit-cards/22cards.html?ref=mastercardinc">The Mundane Credit Card Gets a Modern Makeover<date>Published: October 21, 2010</date><text>The simple credit card is about to get a makeover.Next month, Citibank will begin testing a card that has two buttons and tiny lights that allow users to choose at the register whether they want to pay with rewards points or credit, at most any merchant they please. Other card issuers are testing more newfangled cards, including some that can double as credit and debit cards, and cards with fraud protections baked right into the plastic. One, for instance, shows a portion of the account number only after the cardholder enters a PIN. The microscopic engine powering the plastic will help breathe new life into a 1950s-era technology — the black magnetic stripe found on the back of the 1.8 billion credit and debit cards circulating in the United States. Much of the world has already moved to using more advanced cards, like the ones in Europe that require a PIN and use a chip instead of a magnetic strip. Even with the innovations, no one knows how long plastic cards will reign. They may eventually be rendered obsolete by technologies that will transform consumers’ cellphones into virtual wallets, and a large number of companies, including Visa, MasterCard and Apple, are developing these. But several card analysts say it will probably take a while before any one technology standard becomes available across all phones and merchants. In the meantime, banks are hedging their bets. Citi’s cards — known as 2G, for second generation — are no thicker and just as flexible as conventional plastic, but they contain a battery with a four-year life, an embedded chip and, of course, the buttons, which took nearly a year and hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop. “It’s a big deal,” said Megan Bramlette, director of research for the Auriemma Consulting Group, a payments industry consultant in New York. “If once a month a consumer can fill up their gas tank for free, and they don’t have to do anything except push a button before they swipe their card, that’s cool. And that is something that I think will resonate with consumers.” Dynamics Inc., the company that developed the minicomputers-in-a-card, said that it had more cards in the works and that its bank partners would introduce its electronic cards on their own schedules. Citi’s cards will be tested by a select group of cardholders beginning in November, though some Citi employees have been testing the cards since May. The pilot program will expand as Citi incorporates user feedback. The bank plans to make the cards available on a broader scale in mid to late 2011. The 2G card will be offered on two of Citi’s existing rewards cards, including the Citi Dividend Platinum Select MasterCard, whose holders earn 1 percent cash back on all purchases and 2 percent on categories that change seasonally, as well as the Citi PremierPass Elite, whose holders generally earn one point for every dollar spent and mile flown. To pay with points, users press the request-rewards button before swiping the card; the button marked regular credit allows a straight credit transaction. Pressing the buttons changes the data imprinted on the magnetic stripe, so it still works like conventional plastic and can be swiped through existing card terminals nationwide. At least for now, cardholders need to know how many points they have, and if they don’t have enough, the transaction will be processed using credit. “We’ve developed a proprietary technology that will allow Citi to do the conversion when the transaction comes through,” said Terry O’Neil, executive vice president of Citi Cards. “All they need to do is push that request-rewards button and we take care of everything else for them. They leave the store with the merchandise they selected.” The cards are going to be most valuable to bigger spenders. The average cardholder spends about $6,300 a year, according to The Nilson Report, and, on a typical rewards card, users may earn one point for each dollar spent. At one penny a point, that translates into about $63 in annual rewards. Still, that is enough for a free cup or two of coffee each month. Citi may yet change its rewards equation or decide that redeeming points at certain locations will yield better returns. “What we want is to get feedback directly from the customers, which will influence how we will roll the cards out,” Mr. O’Neil said. “We want to dig a little deeper on what the right redemption model is.” American Express recently made its Membership Rewards points redeemable at Amazon.com, though they are not worth much: one point is equal to seven-tenths of penny that can be spent at the online retailer. “Creating greater flexibility on how you redeem rewards points has been percolating in the industry for two or three years now,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. “The novelty of being first to market is a plus for Citi. But I anticipate that other issuers will have the technology as well.” The technology that makes the new Citi card possible was created by Jeffrey D. Mullen, the 32-year-old chief executive of Dynamics, an electrical engineer and former patent lawyer who started the company in 2007 while he was working on his master’s degree in business at Carnegie Mellon. Months after he graduated, he secured $5.7 million in venture capital financing from Adams Capital Management. (Citi initially declined to issue him one of the electronic cards he had created, because he had used his entire credit line to start the company. He ultimately received one.) “We are just scratching the surface with what these cards can do with these initial products,” said Mr. Mullen, whose innovation won business plan competitions, as well as $1 million in free advertising at a recent technology conference. “We are trying to be the innovation arm of an industry that has never had one. With this card, which is the baby-step card, you need to acclimate the consumer.” Another Dynamics card would allow cardholders to have multiple accounts on one card, like a corporate and personal card. The company introduced another card this week, which he said would reduce fraud associated with “skimming,” when thieves steal your account number using a small scanner, but not your physical card. All the cards, which are being produced by laptop and cellphone manufacturers, were tested by robots to make sure they would hold up for thousands of swipes. They can also withstand the washing machine. Clearly, they cost more to develop than conventional plastic; Mr. Mullen declined to provide specifics. Citi said it had not yet determined whether customers would be required to pay for the cards once officially introduced. “The U.S. is the last bastion of the magnetic-stripe technology and shows no near-term desire to switch to chip technology,” said Mr. Robertson of The Nilson Report. “So what Dynamics is doing is extending the life of the mag stripe by adding a number of features that you find on chip cards.”</text></article>

The program will identify people based on fingerprints and retina scans, and could make it easier for the government to route food stamps and other payments to people below the poverty line. Mr. Banga says he believes he has a simple way to process the payments: via the MasterCard network. ''I wasn't educated in the U.S.; I was educated in India. I understand what you are trying to do,'' he said during a news conference at the Trident Hotel, in the financial center here. ''I think it's a huge opportunity for our government and people and companies like ours.'' Though Mr. Banga has risen to the top ranks of American business, the roots of his success are firmly planted in India, where he was born, raised and got his start in business. His success at MasterCard may well depend on India, too. Observing that 85 percent of the world's transactions are still in currency, he has declared a ''war on cash'' to nudge as many consumers as possible toward electronic payments, preferably processed by MasterCard. Although competition to handle payments is intense in the United States, the wider battlegrounds are in countries like India and Brazil, which have vast numbers of people without bank accounts, and a growing middle class. Capturing only a small fraction of those customers -- with prepaid debit cards, mobile payment systems or credit cards -- could exponentially expand MasterCard's business and profits. ''Whether it's 200 million or 400 million, it's a lot of millions,'' says Mr. Banga, referring to estimates of the size of the emerging global middle class over the next five years or so. Nevertheless, Mr. Banga, 50, is taking over MasterCard as it faces huge challenges, from new rules governing credit and debit cards in the United States to nimble new rivals offering online and wireless transactions. And, of course, there's Visa, its much larger rival. ''Visa and MasterCard are going to have to generate new business, and that's overseas,'' says David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. ''What you want to do is find new virgin territory where the margins aren't compromised by competition.'' In Mr. Banga, MasterCard believes it has found an ideal, if unconventional, candidate for tackling such tasks. A Sikh with a jet-black mustache and beard, Mr. Banga says he loves fine wine, the New York Mets, Lady Gaga, Elvis Presley and Sikh spirituals, in no particular order. During a recent dinner of Southeast Asian food at the luxurious Imperial Hotel in New Delhi, he teased Vicky S. Bindra, a regional MasterCard president, for ordering khichdi, a simple Indian dish of rice and lentils. Mr. Banga ordered the $90 tasting menu and a $300 bottle of Tuscan wine. ''It's a $70 bottle in New York,'' he noted. His globe-trotting identity and animated personality are in jarring contrast to previous MasterCard chief executives, who were typically buttoned up, American and, often, Ivy League-educated. ''He brings a different vibe, a different sense of urgency to the company,'' says Adam Frisch, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''I expect MasterCard's velocity to change.'' For example, Mr. Banga shook up the company by declaring that any request to headquarters not acted upon in two weeks would be automatically approved -- a directive meant to speed decision-making. For its first four decades of existence, MasterCard -- originally known as MasterCharge -- was owned by the nation's banks and was a reliable cash cow for them. Visa was also owned by the same banks, so there wasn't much head-to-head competition between the two. Nonetheless, MasterCard developed a reputation for being more conservative and flat-footed than Visa. Not only was Visa more aggressive in pursuing the debit card market in the United States, which it has come to dominate, but it pushed ahead of MasterCard in the nascent prepaid-card market and in pursuing new business in developing countries in Latin America and Asia.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/business/06markets.html?ref=mastercardinc">September Rally Extends Into October<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>Stock markets continued a robust rally Wednesday in Asia, a day after the market in the United States turned in one of its best performances in months.The gains in Asia - Japan’s Nikkei index was up 1.4 percent by midday - came after a strong rise Tuesday in equities markets in the United States, where it appeared that that the rally that produced the best September performance since 1939 was being extended into October. American markets jumped after the Bank of Japan took new currency measures Tuesday to support its economy, and after a report in the United States on the services sector showed improvements in hiring that exceeded analysts’ expectations. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 193.45 points Tuesday, or 1.8 percent, to 10,944.72. It was the Dow’s highest close since May 3, when it ended at 11,151.83. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index gained 23.72 points, or 2.09 percent, to 1,160.75, while the Nasdaq rose 55.31 points, or 2.36 percent, to 2,399.83. The markets have continued a rally this month that began in September, when the S.&amp; P. rose nearly 9 percent. The index is up just over 4 percent in the year to date. On Tuesday, most of the S.&amp; P. sectors were up more than 2 percent. “It is a pretty remarkable day from the get-go,” said Peter Tuz, president at Chase Investment Counsel. “With the, I guess you would call it, quantitative easing in Japan, it just seemed to propel U.S. stocks higher. There is global pressure to keep interest rates low and keeping interest rates low is generally a good thing for the stock market.” Material stocks, gold and oil were strong, he noted, “the sector set that you would think would do well with economic growth around the world.” The markets took off Tuesday after the Bank of Japan lowered its benchmark lending rate to near zero and said that it would set up a fund of 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) to buy Japanese government bonds, commercial paper and other asset-backed securities amid concerns about weakening growth in Japan’s economy. Momentum seems to be building for the Federal Reserve to buy more government securities — perhaps as soon as its next meeting in early November. The Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have signaled that the central bank may resume buying government debt to spur the recovery. The Japanese move, the likelihood of the Fed’s quantitative easing and even expectations of Bank of England action along the same lines were all helping to push stocks higher. But the bank’s efforts did little to weaken the yen, which traded at about 84 to the dollar after the announcement, but later slipped to 83.23. A stronger yen has hurt Japan’s export-driven economy. The euro strengthened against the dollar, and the United States currency slid against other major and emerging market currencies. Shares in Tokyo rose 1.5 percent, and in London, the FTSE 100 index gained 79.79 points, or 1.44 percent. Gold continued to rise, and the rates on 10-year Treasury notes dropped to 2.47 percent from 2.48 percent late Monday. Shares also got a lift from a services-sector index for September, which, in the minds of traders, helped to confirm that the economy was not headed toward a double-dip recession. The Institute for Supply Management said its service sector index rose to 53.2 last month from 51.5 in August, topping expectations of 52. Shares of the credit card company American Express fell 77 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $38.28 after it said that it would challenge an antitrust complaint filed by the Justice Department. Shares of its two rivals, MasterCard and Visa, rose on a proposed settlement in the same case, which came after those companies agreed not to prohibit merchants from offering customers discounts or rebates for using a particular kind of card. MasterCard rose $3.26, to $225.90. Shares of Visa rose $1.75, to $74.99.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/05card.html?ref=mastercardinc">U.S. Proposes Settlement With MasterCard and Visa<date>Published: October 4, 2010</date><text>Consumers may see more discounts for using cash instead of a credit card under a tentative deal announced Monday by the Justice Department and the credit card companies Visa and MasterCard.The proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, came after a two-year investigation into rules imposed by Visa, MasterCard and American Express that often prohibit merchants from steering customers toward cash, checks or other payment types that avoid transaction fees. “We want to put more money in consumers’ pockets, and by eliminating credit card companies’ anticompetitive rules, we will accomplish that,” the attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said at a news conference. The Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Visa, MasterCard and American Express on Monday. But while the government had already worked out a settlement with Visa and MasterCard, American Express said it would fight the claim. Seven states participated in the lawsuit. Every time a consumer uses a prepaid card, debit card or credit card to make a purchase, the card network charges the merchant a swipe fee, usually a penny or two for each dollar spent. The size of the swipe fee varies depending on the risk of nonpayment and the reward points tied to the card. Therefore, fees are generally lower for debit cards that take money directly from a bank account and higher for credit charges in which the consumer promises to pay later. The fees are even higher when the credit card being used is linked to a rich rewards program. Last year, those fees, which are divided between payment networks and the banks that issue their cards, cost merchants $35 billion, the Justice Department said. “The companies put merchants and consumers in a no-win situation: accept our card, pay our fees and don’t even think about trying to get a discount,” Mr. Holder said. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, merchants could offer consumers an immediate discount or rebate for using a particular type of payment, a particular credit card network (Visa versus American Express), or a low-cost card within that network (a Visa debit card rather than a Visa credit card). That may give merchants an incentive to steer consumers toward paying with cash or with no-frills credit cards without rewards programs because the swipe fees for those options are lower. The settlement also allows merchants to post the cost of using different types of payments. The settlement, however, does not allow merchants to levy a surcharge on credit and debit payments beyond the cost of the transaction, as some merchants had sought. Still, the deal was a victory for the nation’s merchants, which have long battled the payment networks over what they say are monopolistic practices. The two sides have been fighting in court for more than a decade. Merchants had already scored a major victory against the credit card networks earlier this year. As part of a major overhaul of financial regulation, Congress passed legislation that is expected to limit the swipe fees that Visa and MasterCard can charge merchants for each debit card transaction. “The tectonic plates underpinning this cartel are beginning to shift,” said Mallory Duncan, senior vice president and general counsel of the National Retail Federation. “It’s not just merchants complaining. It’s Congress who is looking at it. The Fed is looking at it. The state attorney generals are looking at it. And there are private lawsuits.” “People are beginning to realize this is unacceptable behavior,” he said. Visa and MasterCard played down the significance of the settlement, and some analysts seemed to agree. “We feel that many merchants may find it impractical to implement discounting by card type, and that V/MA earn network fees regardless of product type, so that a direct impact from the rule change will likely be minimal,” Jason Kupferberg, an analyst with UBS Investment Research, wrote in a note to investors. Shares of both companies fell on Monday. Visa shares dropped 8 cents, to $73.24, while MasterCard declined $2.14, to $222.64. American Express vowed to fight the lawsuit, saying the settlement deal gave an unfair advantage to Visa and MasterCard. Edward P. Gilligan, the vice chairman of American Express, said the company had spent billions to build an affluent customer base and to differentiate itself from Visa and MasterCard. He said it would be unfair for merchants to take advantage of the investment by American Express and then steer customers to another network. Shares of American Express dropped 6.5 percent, or $2.73, on Monday, to $39.05. But Mr. Holder maintained that merchant rules of American Express were the most restrictive. In addition, American Express has the highest fees of any credit card company, he said. “Because of American Express’ current rules, some consumers will continue to pay higher prices,” he said. “That is unacceptable.” The changes resulting from the settlement could become visible to cardholders of Visa and MasterCard almost immediately, Mr. Holder said. “If you use a preferred, lower-cost credit card, an airline could offer you more miles or a merchant could provide you with a rebate,” he said. Mr. Duncan, of the National Retail Federation, said he could envision retailers offering free shipping on large-ticket purchases if a consumer used a less expensive type of card. “It will be as different as merchants are creative, which is how the market is supposed to work,” he said.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/09/21/business/21corporate.html?ref=mastercardinc">Tools to Make Short Work of Expense Reports<date>Published: September 20, 2010</date><text>The corporate card is changing, not in ways that business travelers will see on the road but that they will notice back home when they fill out expense reports.Credit network processors like Visa and MasterCard as well as the banks that issue cards have been developing new tools for corporate customers in anticipation of a rebound in business travel. The volume of travel and entertainment charges has increased by 20 to 30 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009, when recession-related declines first began to reverse, according to Kevin Phalen, a commercial card executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The new tools are largely aimed at helping business travelers and travel managers do a better job of tracking where and how company money is being spent. The idea, Mr. Phalen said, is to offer more “visibility into cash flow.” The financial crisis in 2008 prompted a call for greater transparency in how public companies spend their money, particularly on travel. The reaction began after reports that the insurance giant the American International Group had run up a bill of about $440,000 on a company retreat in October 2008 at a Southern California resort hotel, shortly after the company accepted an $85 billion federal bailout. That so-called A.I.G. effect, in turn, led to a demand for programs that monitor both card use and expense reporting. “Travel managers are getting more and more data around where their cards are used,” said Hubert J. P. Jolly, a managing director in the global transactions services business at Citigroup. As the tools give managers a more complete picture of their company’s spending, “we’re seeing corporations use that data to renegotiate,” he said. New imaging technology, for example, lets travel managers look at a hotel bill line by line, rather than just seeing a single charge with a total dollar amount. This way, they can see if the traveler took bottled water from the minibar or paid for Internet service, both charges that can be bundled into a corporate rate when companies bargain with hotels. Many of the new programs cater to small businesses, traditionally the ones that first experience a rebound in an economic recovery. “What we find in smaller companies is that current penetration of expense management tools is very low,” said Jay Cary, a vice president at American Express Global Commercial Card. “In many cases, they’re hand-writing or using an Excel spreadsheet,” he said. American Express worked with the travel expense software firm Concur to roll out Concur Breeze, an expense-reporting tool aimed at companies with 100 or fewer employees that the company introduced, in June. “Expense reportage decoupled from the card is a pain in the neck,” said Elena Donio, executive vice president and general manager for Concur Breeze. Letting small businesses automate their expense management cuts down on the time that cardholders and their managers need to spend on the process. Hillel Zafir can attest to this. As chief technology officer for EMI Yoshi, a party goods manufacturing and distribution company in North Brunswick, N.J., Mr. Zafir said that managing the travel expenses of the company’s 10 salesmen was time- and labor-intensive. The reporting was all done in Excel, and salesmen would have to print out and mail hard copies of receipts to headquarters. “The charges they put in didn’t always coincide, and if there was a discrepancy, it became a problem,” he said. Now, Mr. Zafir said the hourlong reporting process has been shaved to a few minutes of work. Salesmen like Zevi Mayer are using the program to take photos of receipts for cash transactions using their smartphones and add it to their expense reports. Other new tools are aimed at travel managers or meeting planners. Banks have begun offering corporate customers the ability to create an account number that is valid only for a single transaction. While some financial institutions have long offered this service to their customers so that, for instance, they do not have to expose their debit card numbers when making an online purchase, this tool gives corporate buyers the ability to control the amount charged. “That is the product where we’re seeing the fastest growth, 90 to 100 percent growth year over year,” said Eduardo Vergara, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase Businesses. Companies like this option, he said, because they — not the vendor — stipulate the amount charged, and because it simplifies billing by sending it back to an internal cost center. Hotels and other vendors like it because it means they will be paid promptly. Traditionally, vendors would bill the company and often receive a check a month or more after the fact. Also growing in popularity are meetings cards. “As we’ve seen an uptick in corporate travel, we’re seeing a lot more demand for the meeting card,” said Jim McCarthy, global head of product for Visa Inc. Since big corporate conferences can easily cost $100,000 or more, being able to consolidate all the expenses onto a single account gives companies a more complete picture of the total cost. It also gives meeting managers insight into areas where they can realize savings. And it gives them more clout when they negotiate with a hotel or other location for future business. For the future, he said, he envisioned an array of services provided by third-party developers in addition to Visa itself, much the way the App Store from Apple operates.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16markets.html?ref=mastercardinc">Wall Street Finishes the Day Higher<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>Stocks overcame an early slide Wednesday and closed higher as investors kept a September rally alive. Major indexes opened lower after a poor reading on factory activity in New York, but turned higher around midday after getting better news on industrial production. That report showed that the national industrial sector rose modestly in August. Even though September is historically a weak period for the market, better news on manufacturing has propelled stocks higher on nine out of the last 11 days. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 5.6 percent over that time. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.24 points, or 0.44 percent, to 10,572.73. It was the index’s highest close since Aug. 10. The Dow industrials are up 1.39 percent so far this year. Broader indexes also rose. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index gained 3.97 points, or 0.35 percent, to 1,125.07, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 11.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,301.32. In corporate news, the credit card company MasterCard gained $10.43, or 5.22 percent, to $210.18, after saying it expected its income to rise at least 20 percent this year. The food conglomerate Kraft Foods jumped 53 cents, or 1.72 percent, to $31.58, after saying its earnings would jump 9 percent to 11 percent over the next three years because of growth in developing markets. Traders focused on the industrial production report on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve said that output at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities edged up 0.2 percent last month. It rose 0.6 percent in July. Production rose for basic consumer goods, like food, clothing and paper, by more than 1 percent. Factories produced 0.7 percent more business equipment in August. Manufacturing has helped drive economic expansion over the last year. Companies built up their stockpiles in the first half of the year after slashing them during the recession. But factory output has slowed in recent months. Businesses are no longer rebuilding their inventories. At the same time, demand for goods remains weak because consumers are saving more and spending with caution. “Consumers have failed to take up the baton,” said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. Also, on Wednesday the Empire State Manufacturing Survey Index, which measured activity in the state in September, said growth was below expectations in New York’s manufacturing sector but there was growth. Weak demand will most likely keep economic growth slow through the end of 2010, Mr. Ashworth said. “The best that can be said is that the economy isn’t heading back into recession,” he said in a research note. European markets were lower, but the Nikkei in Japan surged 2.34 percent after the country’s government stepped in to weaken the yen. The yen had been hitting 15-year highs against the dollar, which makes it harder for Japanese exporters to compete on global markets. Japan sold an undisclosed amount of yen in foreign exchange markets to weaken the currency, which was threatening to endanger manufacturers like Toyota Motor and Sony that export goods around the world. The dollar rose 2.55 percent against the yen on Wednesday. The price on the 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to 99 5/32. The yield rose to 2.72 percent from 2.68 percent late Tuesday.</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/fashion/16FNO.html?ref=mastercardinc">On Fashion’s Big Night Out, It’s More About Building Brands Than Racking Up Sales<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>STYLISH revelers may have flooded the stores and streets of New York on Sept. 10 for the second year of Fashion’s Night Out, but for most shops the evening was more about brand building than racking up sales. Industry groups that track customer traffic and sales said that many more consumers visited stores this year than last year, though they did not spend more than they did a year ago. Foot traffic in the New York stores participating in Fashion’s Night Out increased about 48 percent over last year, according to ShopperTrak, a research and consulting firm. But over all, sales at New York stores remained at last year’s levels, according to SpendingPulse, an information service of MasterCard Advisors that estimates sales for all forms of payment, including cash, checks and credit cards. “The traffic was higher than last year’s number,” said Stephen I. Sadove, the chairman and chief executive of Saks Fifth Avenue, where on Friday consumers happily rubbed shoulders with Christian Siriano of “Project Runway,” the actress Claire Danes, the supermodel Karolina Kurkova and others. Mr. Sadove described the night as “more event publicity than a shopping night,” though down the road that publicity might translate into increased sales. “It brought out a different customer,” he said, “a very well-dressed, younger customer.” Retailers lured crowds with star power and exclusive merchandise, including Fashion’s Night Out T-shirts and bags, some of which sold out at destinations like Saks and Macy’s. Other stores, especially local retailers and pop-up shops, tried to inspire visitors to open their wallets by offering more affordably priced fashions. Some of the evening’s biggest boldface names were at the Macy’s flagship in Herald Square, which drove sales of Jennifer Lopez’s new perfume, Love and Glamour, by enabling customers who spent at least $135 to have their photos taken with Ms. Lopez, who was on the eighth floor with the china and linens. Fans of the band Train were told that the first 100 attendees to make a $100 Tommy Hilfiger purchase would receive V.I.P. access to the band’s performance at the store, along with a copy of the group’s CD “Save Me San Francisco.” “It’s a celebration of shopping and about making shopping fun and entertaining for the customer,” Terry J. Lundgren, the president and chief executive of Macy’s, wrote in an e-mail message. “By bringing out the celebrities and designers to our stores and giving them a chance to meet, listen and see our customers who buy and wear their products, we are closing the gap from the catwalk to the store.” A combination of celebrity draw and lower-priced clothes spurred sales at Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen’s pop-up shop for their Elizabeth and James label. The stars signed autographs and posed for photos with hordes of fans at the West Village storefront. Customers also snapped up accessibly priced pieces from the sisters’ new denim division, TEXTILE Elizabeth and James, which offers chunky knits, plaid button-downs and T-shirts starting at $55, according to an e-mail from Kristen Walsh, the director of brand management and marketing at the Olsens’ company, Dualstar Entertainment Group. At Jeffrey New York, partiers tried on four-figure-plus shoes. The store sold out of its 100 limited-edition Proenza Schouler black satchels, which cost $225. While some stores said their sales surpassed those of last year, many said that next year they hoped the industry would explore ways to make the night even more of a shopping event. “It was a great party, and we all need a good party,” said Jeanette Bird, who has owned and operated the If Boutique in SoHo for more than 25 years. Some 800 people swarmed into the store to mingle, drink and dance to two rock bands from Brooklyn, though Ms. Bird said that the night was not about selling. After all, she proffers coveted and costly labels like Comme des Garçons and Rick Owens. “You need quiet to shop here,” she said. “We aren’t selling T-shirts.”</text></article>

Starting on Sept. 8, that registration process will require a $14 fee, paid by credit or debit card. ESTA approval, which went into effect in early 2009, allows travelers to enter the United States without a full travel visa, which can cost over $100. The ESTA authorization lasts for two years (or until the individual’s passport expires), and is valid for multiple entries. This creates another potential roadblock for visitors from ESTA-participating countries, who will now need both Internet access and a MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover card (or a debit card within those networks). (The C.B.P. says it is looking into expanding to other forms of payment.) The bulk of the $14 fee will fund tourism promotion, with the remainder going toward operation of the ESTA program. Of course, visitors from those participating countries — mostly European and far East Asian — will still need a valid passport for entry.</text></article>
    <article index="14" href="http://events.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/nyregion/29dinect.html?ref=mastercardinc">At Goose Bistro, New American in a Lively Setting<date>Published: August 27, 2010</date><text>THE BLACK GOOSE in Darien has morphed into the Goose American Bistro and Bar — and the change involved a lot more than new owners and staff. The configuration of the space, the décor and the menu have been altered considerably, and the atmosphere has gone from quiet dining to buzz-conscious cacophony.The new, hipper Goose opened two and a half months ago and quickly emerged as a popular hangout and the place for family parties. It seems to be crowded and hopping almost every night. Our foursome at dinner literally could not hear one another talk without screeching. If you want to enjoy a conversation while you eat, go for lunch, when the room is quieter. The menu is the same as it is at dinner, and the food, whatever the noise level, is quite good. I loved the subtle smokiness of the crab and corn chowder with smoked bacon. The Vidalia onion and forest mushroom soup was also delicious, with good, clear flavors of both ingredients. Salads are the Goose’s forte and can double as a light meal. This is especially true of an enormous Cobb salad, a fiesta of bibb lettuce, avocado, chicken breast, smoked bacon, hard-boiled egg and tomato with a sharp, creamy Gorgonzola dressing (balsamic vinaigrette is a second option). Just as large and appealing was the mildly sweet baby arugula salad, tossed with Spanish Marcona almonds and pistachios, cranberries, Belgian endive, Stilton cheese, yellow and red tomatoes, and radicchio and sprinkled with a tasty vin-cotto-and-truffle vinaigrette. Smaller but also satisfying was a roasted red and yellow beet salad, replete with red onions and two toasty goat cheese “fritters.” From the selection of sandwiches and burgers, I’d recommend the tasty Goose burger, a thick beef patty with smoked bacon, blue cheese, horseradish cream and crispy onions. Of the four grilled pizzas offered, I opted for one with baby leeks, taleggio cheese and black summer truffles — a good choice, though the thin crust had less flavor and was more breadlike than the usual pizza dough. Like the salads, the eight small plates at the Goose are ample meals in themselves. I am partial to the pistachio-crusted yellowfin tuna — sushi-rare slices of fish, embroidered by a carrot-ginger coulis and served alongside lightly dressed microgreens. Crispy Point Judith fried calamari had lots of crunchy “legs” and came with a peppy tomato dip. Mussels with fresh herbs were big and juicy. Their aromatic, garlicky broth, with fresh tomatoes, lemon, shallot and white wine, was delicious enough in itself, without adding the anomalous texture and tartness of capers and giant caperberries. Entrees also come in generous portions. An order of steak frites brought us a well-marinated, tender Angus New York strip presented in an eddy of béarnaise sauce and served with a stack of hand-cut French fries. Another agreeable entree was the day boat sea scallops, pan-seared to mahogany-colored perfection and plated with black beluga lentils, fresh grilled asparagus and a pomegranate coulis added in dribbles à la Jackson Pollock. Grilled salmon, a tad overcooked to my taste, was served on a bed of toasted Sardinian couscous with a blanket of caponata full of olives, capers and tomatoes. While dessert wasn’t necessary, the Goose has several scrumptious ones. The Key lime pie is flavorful, though I prefer a tarter version. And I couldn’t fault the smoothly luscious crème caramel or a tasty multi-layered black magic chocolate cake with real whipped cream. But one night, a special stole the show: fresh-tasting peach Melba with a berry sauce and vanilla ice cream.

Marketers are signing up to support the second Stand Up to Cancer telethon, scheduled to be presented by multiple television networks and channels on Sept. 10.

The content includes public service announcements and the first telethon, held in 2008. The Virgin America passengers are also able to swipe their credit cards while in flight and make donations to the organization. Flight attendants on the airline will also wear T-shirts and buttons that promote Stand Up to Cancer and its Web site (standup2cancer.org). Others taking part in fund-raising for the organization include FlipCam, sold by Cisco Systems; MasterCard; Major League Baseball; and Sony PlayStation, sold by the Sony Corporation of America. The telethon is to begin at 8 p.m. (ET) on Sept. 10 on the ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC networks and cable channels that will include Discovery Health, E!, G4, HBO, Showtime and VH1.</text></article>
