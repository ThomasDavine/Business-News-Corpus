Speaking at the Oracle OpenWorld convention on Tuesday, Mr. Dell laid out why his company, Dell Inc., the world’s second-largest maker of PCs, likes what many consider a low-margin business with poor growth prospects. In August H.P., the biggest PC company, announced it was thinking about what to do with its business, including a spinoff or sale. Oracle OpenWorld Dispatches from the conference. “There are many reasons to stay committed,” said Mr. Dell, who did not need to mention H.P. to make the distinction to the tech-savvy crowd. He said that 5 percent of the world’s microprocessors go into servers and storage and 95 percent go into PCs. The same is true for disk drives and other components, he said. The indication was that the PC business, in itself a low margin affair, gives a big hardware maker steady supply and pricing power for other products. “Give up that scale and you need to raise your prices.” Besides, Mr. Dell said, “Dell is an end-to-end solutions company,” offering hardware that ranges from the biggest computer servers to low-priced PCs for business and consumers. It was a reasonably cogent argument for the PC, but it did ignore a critical fact: The H.P. chief executive who made the announcement about possibly getting out of PCs, Léo Apotheker, lost his job in late September, in part for the bad way he handled its announcement. The new chief executive, Meg Whitman, has said she will look at the business afresh. Apparently Mr. Dell thinks she should keep competing with him. Mr. Dell was introduced by Oracle’s president, Mark Hurd, who used to compete against Mr. Dell as H.P.’s C.E.O. Mr. Hurd had made similar points about the PC business’s enabling supply and pricing power when he ran H.P. On Tuesday morning, however, he was all about Dell, calling it “a great company to work with,” and adding, “we value their access to emerging markets.” That may not be all Mr. Hurd values. Oracle is going to great lengths at this conference to portray itself as a comprehensive company something like an enterprise computing version of Apple, designing hardware and software to work together from the start. The most notable gap in Oracle’s own end-to-end proposition is any kind of personal device. In addition, the kind of high-end data center networking that Dell picked up with last year’s acquisition of a company called Force 10 is a critical part of Oracle’s boast that its servers and storage systems are multiples faster than the competition. Is this something Oracle needs as it continues its seemingly relentless growth? With $62 billion in revenue, Dell seems like a company too big to acquire. But those PCs are so low margin that Dell’s market cap is just $26 billion, including $15 billion in cash on its balance sheet. The net price, though, is still about twice the $5.6 billion that Oracle paid for Sun in 2009.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/technology/as-pcs-wane-companies-look-to-tablets.html?ref=dellinc">As PCs Wane, Companies Look to Tablets<date>Published: August 19, 2011</date><text>Although the world is dependent on personal computers, making them has not been a great business for most American companies for almost a decade.The announcement on Thursday by Hewlett-Packard that it was considering offloading its PC business, even though it is the undisputed worldwide market leader, was a clear sign of the difficulties. If H.P. goes through with the idea, it would follow I.B.M., an early PC maker, which was one of the first to recognize the long-term problems and, in 2005, sold its business to Lenovo, a Chinese company. Other American makers like Compaq (acquired by H.P.), Gateway and Packard Bell were absorbed by others or just faded away. Depending on how H.P. sheds the unit — it could sell or spin it off as a separate company — only two American PC makers would remain. One of them, Dell, struggles for every percentage point of market share. The other, Apple, prospers. And the reason it does highlights the shift from a PC-centric era to one dominated by smartphones and tablets. H.P., Dell and, indeed, every PC maker worldwide, has been unable to make a tablet consumers feel they must have. At the same time H.P. said that it might spin off PCs, it killed off its tablet, the TouchPad, after just a few weeks on store shelves. Computer makers are expected to ship only about 4 percent more PCs this year than last year, according to IDC, a research firm. Tablets, in contrast, are flying off store shelves. Global sales are expected to more than double this year to 24.1 million, according to Forrester Research. More than two-thirds of those tablets, however, are sold by Apple. Sales of its iPad pulled in $9 billion in just the first half of the year, or 30 percent more than all of Dell’s consumer PC business in the same period. The joke in Silicon Valley is that there is no tablet market, only an iPad market. (That was also true of Apple and the iPod market.) The other observation that is no joke: Apple is the only maker with strong PC growth. Spending on desktops and laptops grew 16 percent in the latest quarter, while Dell’s consumer product sales increased 1 percent. “It’s definitely weighing on the computer makers, and it is something that will weigh on them for some time,” said Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Collins Stewart. “The tablet effect is real,” said Leo Apotheker, H.P.’s chief executive, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledging that the TouchPad had failed to live up to expectations and that it would have cost too much to compete. “It’s very different from where the business was going 10 years ago,” Mr. Apotheker said. On Friday, H.P.’s shares fell 20 percent in reaction to his plans. Michael S. Dell, Dell’s chief executive, took the opportunity to poke fun at the prospect of H.P. unloading its PC unit by saying in a message on Twitter that “they’re calling it a separation, but it feels like a divorce.” Following up with more sarcasm, he said, “If HP spins off its computer business ... maybe they will call it Compaq.” Mr. Dell was clearly enjoying the moment, but his company faces the same market forces as H.P. Its overall PC business has been flat. Recently, Dell has pared back some of its consumer products, including a 5-inch Streak tablet, while keeping a 7-inch tablet. Together, they eked out barely 1 percent of the market, according to ABI Research. Like H.P., Dell is pushing its enterprise business, which has higher margins. But David Johnson, Dell’s senior vice president of corporate strategy, said his company had no plans to follow in H.P.’s footsteps and split off its PC business. “We have no plans to change our strategy,” he said. Tablets remain the hope of other PC makers and phone makers. By next year, tablet sales in the United States will outpace those of netbooks, the mini-laptops people use to surf the Web, according to Forrester Research. Netbooks were considered a salvation for the PC industry when they were introduced a few years ago, but they have since fallen out of favor with consumers. But buyers see little need to buy any tablet other than iPad, even if it is slightly more expensive than some of its rivals, analysts said. “The performance still isn’t there for a lot of them,” said Richard Doherty, research director for the Envisioneering Group, a market research and consulting firm. “And it’s not just the product, it’s the ecosystem behind it.” For that matter, selling tablets is no easier for the smartphone makers. Motorola Mobility, which Google said this week that it would buy, got nowhere with its Xoom. Research in Motion entered the tablet market this spring with a long history of building mobile devices. Still, the company has struggled to get consumers to buy its tablet, the PlayBook, which it introduced earlier this year. RIM says it shipped 500,000 PlayBooks during its last fiscal quarter. Kevin Burden, a vice president at ABI Research, estimated that only 40 to 50 percent of those tablets found buyers. Shoppers were not charmed by the PlayBook’s inability to directly check corporate e-mail — they have to connect wirelessly to BlackBerry phones — and lack of applications. 1 2 Next Page »Although the world is dependent on personal computers, making them has not been a great business for most American companies for almost a decade.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/technology/dell-posts-flat-sales-but-its-profit-rises.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Posts Flat Sales but Profit Rises 63 Percent<date>Published: August 16, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Dell’s sales flattened in its latest quarter as government spending declined and the company pared low-margin sales, but its net income rose 63 percent. The mixed results on Tuesday combined with a lowered revenue forecast for the rest of the year to send Dell’s shares down 7.9 percent in after-hours trading to $14.55. Dell said that net income in the quarter ending July 29, the second of its fiscal year, rose to $890 million, or 48 cents a share, from $545 million, or 28 cents, a year ago.. The company said revenue grew 1 percent to $15.66 billion from $15.53 billion. The adjusted income of 54 cents per share exceeded analysts’ expectations, while revenue was slightly below expectations. Analysts had predicted 49 cents a share on that basis and revenue of $15.76 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Brian T. Gladden, chief financial officer for Dell, attributed the flat revenue to a strategy of eliminating low-margin products in the consumer sector and paring its business of selling software from other companies. But Mr. Gladden acknowledged that demand for Dell’s products weakened because of the economy. “It’s clear that the demand environment is weaker and a bit more uncertain than what we had in our previous view,” he said. The company, based in Round Rock, Tex., showed mixed results in the face of a weakening economy that is causing companies to think hard about buying new technology. Large corporations increased their spending with Dell just 1 percent to $4.6 billion, raising concern that they will reduce technology equipment purchases during any further downturn. Government sales weakened because of tight budgets, in keeping with a pattern at other technology companies like Cisco Systems. Sales to public agencies, schools and hospitals fell 3 percent to $4.5 billion during the quarter. Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, pointed out that the economy did not seem to have affected Apple, which had routinely reported record earnings despite the slowdown. But he called Dell’s focus on higher-margin products a sound, but slow, strategy. "They are not going to turn that tanker ship around in a short amount of time," he said. Dell, the second largest maker of personal computers behind Hewlett-Packard, is trying to expand beyond its roots in laptop and desktop computers to higher margin products like servers and data storage for corporations. The effort is showing modest results in servers and networking equipment, which grew by 9 percent, to $2.1 billion, while services grew 6 percent to $2 billion. Dell’s consumer business remained sluggish with a 1 percent increase in sales to $2.9 billion. Shoppers were reluctant to buy new laptops and desktop computers, partly because of the economy, but also because they preferred smartphones and Apple iPads. Consumers account for around 20 percent of Dell’s overall revenue. Dell sells mobile phones and the Streak tablet to consumers, but they have failed to get much traction. The company raised its expectations for operating income for the year to a gain of 17 percent to 23 percent, from 12 percent to 18 percent. However, it lowered its forecast for revenue growth to 1 percent to 5 percent, from 5 percent to 9 percent. Dell said it expected third-quarter revenue to be flat compared with the second quarter, far short of the $16.2 billion that analysts had expected. Dell’s shares had gained 1.9 percent in regular trading to close at $15.80.SAN FRANCISCO — Dell’s sales flattened in its latest quarter as government spending declined and the company pared low-margin sales, but its net income rose 63 percent.

Computer shipments grew 2.3 percent during the quarter to 85.2 million, the technology research firm Gartner said on Wednesday. Its rival, IDC, said in a similar report that shipments grew 2.6 percent to 84.4 million. Neither firm includes tablet computer shipments in their quarterly tallies. Neither breaks out tablet shipments separately. The results are a small bright spot for computer makers, which have tried to downplay the extent to which tablet computers, mostly the Apple iPad at this point, have diverted spending from the PC and laptop. But clearly the competition is affecting computer sales, the two reports concluded. “Given the hype around media tablets such as the iPad, retailers were very conservative in placing orders for PCs,” Mikako Kitagawa, a Gartner analyst, said in a statement. “Instead, they wanted to secure space for media tablets. Some PC vendors had to lower their inventory through promotions, while others slimmed their product lines at retailers.” The IDC report, meanwhile, mentioned the shifting consumer appetite for tablets, particularly in the United States, as a drag on computer sales. In addition to tablets, second quarter computer shipment totals faced a tough comparison from last year. Global shipments soared 12 percent during that quarter, according to IDC and, and such growth could not be sustained. The United States market was weak over all, with shipments declining 4.2 percent, IDC said. The biggest reason was a drop in netbook shipments, the mini-laptops that sold strongly before the rise of tablets. However, gains in computer shipments to Asia, Latin America and Japan offset those declines. Gartner said that Hewlett-Packard retained its position as the top computer maker with 14.8 million computers shipped, a 3 percent increase. Dell moved up to second position, its first time in that spot since 2008, with 10.6 million computers shipped, up 3.3 percent. Acer dropped from second to fourth in global shipments behind Lenovo. The company specializes in netbook computers, sales of which are declining rapidly. In the United States, Hewlett-Packard led with 4.5 million computers shipped, down 1.2 percent. Dell followed with 3.8 million, down 9.8 percent. Apple rose from fifth to third position, with 1.8 million, up 8.5 percent, based on strong sales of its Mac and MacBook computers. It passed Acer and Toshiba.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/24/dell-tries-again-with-a-thin-laptop/?ref=dellinc">Dell Tries Again With a Thin Laptop<date>May 24, 2011, 2:40 pm</date><text>Dell’s new XPS 15z. Dell’s mixed results selling consumer products has not stopped it from trying yet again. Dell hopes its new XPS 15z will compete with the Apple Air laptops. The latest effort came Tuesday with the introduction of the XPS 15z, the first in a series of laptops that are billed as thinner and more elegantly designed. Dell is trying to demonstrate that it understands what consumers want– in addition to what business customers, its core market, want. Dell has struggled to find the right formula for consumers. A number of its consumer products have failed to gain much traction like its Streak tablet and Venue smartphones. The new laptop, which has an aluminum and magnesium alloy body, appears to have drawn some of its inspiration from Dell’s failed line of Adamo notebooks along with Apple’s MacBook Air and Pro. The XPS 15z is less than an inch thick, which Dell said made it the thinnest 15-inch PC laptop on the market. (The Apple Air, though, still appears to retain that title.) Previous XPS laptops had been criticized in reviews as clunky-looking and heavy. The latest version is noticeably sleeker and starts at a weight of 5.54 pounds, nearly a pound lighter than its predecessor. In terms of specs, the XPS 15z uses Intel i5 2410M (2.3 GHz) or i7 2620M (2.7 GHz) dual core processors. Memory is 4GB to 8GB. Its screen is 15.6 inch with a 1080p resolution. Standard battery life is listed as up to 8:22 hours. The XPS 15z starts at $999, making it hundreds of dollars cheaper than its would-be Apple competition. Dell is trying to reinvigorate its consumers business following a 7 percent decline in consumer sales to $3 billion during its most recent quarter. The decline was part of a broader slowdown in consumer computer sales because of a shaky economy and a shift by shoppers to tablets. Stephen J. Felice, president of Dell’s consumer, and small and medium sized business division, said in an interview that the company had been retooling its consumer business over the past year. It remained a large source of revenue at Dell – about 20 percent of the company’s overall business – and one with continued potential, he said, despite concerns that Dell might de-emphasize the division. To underscore his point, Mr. Felice said that there was an increasingly strong link between sales to consumers and small businesses. A new hybrid is emerging, called “prosumer” shoppers, people who use their computers at both work and home.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/21/technology/21foxconn.html?ref=dellinc">Fatal Blast at Foxconn May Affect iPad Supply<date>Published: May 20, 2011</date><text>An explosion and fire at a plant that makes Apple and Dell products in China killed two people and injured 16 and brought production to a halt, a spokesman for the plant said. The plant was operated by the Foxconn Technology Group, maker of Apple’s iPhone and Dell computers, in southwest China’s Sichuan province. Brian White, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities, told Reuters that the factory made a large quantity of iPads. The blast, on Foxconn’s Chengdu campus, occurred about 7 p.m. local time on Friday, Edmund Ding, a company spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. The fire department had the incident under control, and the company was cooperating with an investigation and contacting the families of affected workers, he said. “The company has halted production at the site of the explosion until the investigation is complete,” Mr. Ding wrote. In earlier phone interviews, Mr. Ding said that he could not comment on what products were made at the plant and that the company was still assessing the effect on production. Foxconn has been shifting production to Chengdu and other interior cities in China like Wuhan and Chongqing, where labor is about a third cheaper than in the country’s south. The plant where the explosion took place, a $2 billion laptop factory, opened in October, Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, said. “We are working closely with Foxconn at this point to understand what caused this terrible event,” Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, said in a phone interview on Friday. ”We are deeply saddened by the tragedy.” Mr. Dowling declined to comment on any possible supply disruptions, referring questions to Foxconn.An explosion and fire at a plant that makes Apple and Dell products in China killed two people and injured 16 and brought production to a halt, a spokesman for the plant said.

He added that “even though our consumer PC expectations had been cautious, the steepness of our Q2 decline is greater than what we had anticipated.” H.P. said that sales of personal computers in the fiscal quarter ending April 30 fell 5 percent, to $9.4 billion. A 23 percent decline in consumer computer sales far outweighed a 13 percent increase in sales to businesses. Companies that make personal computers, like H.P. and Dell, are vulnerable to changes in consumer spending because of the fragile economy. But despite the tight wallets in a slowly recovering economy, shoppers have been eager to buy tablet computers, a market that H.P. will finally enter this summer with its planned release of the TouchPad, a rival to Apple’s dominant iPad. Analysts attribute some of the weakness in consumer PC sales to the rise of tablets. Overall PC sales declined 1 percent to 3 percent during the first three months of the year, according to slightly different estimates by IDC and Gartner, two market research firms. But they also blamed the economy and a lack of innovation in PCs. H.P., based in Palo Alto, Calif., reported net income in the quarter rose 5 percent to $2.3 billion, or $1.05 a share, from $2.2 billion, or 91 cents, in the year-ago quarter. It said that overall revenue in the quarter climbed 3 percent to $31.6 billion. The adjusted income of $1.24 a share was slightly above the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.21 a share and revenue of $31.54 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. Revenue during the current quarter is expected to be $31.1 billion to $31.3 billion, slightly below analyst forecasts of $31.8 billion. Adjusted income is expected to be around $1.08 a share, which was also below the $1.24 that had been predicted. Full-year revenue is pegged at $129 billion to $130 billion with adjusted income of at least $5 a share, also below analysts’ predictions.  For Dell, sales of servers, computers and storage devices to businesses continued to help offset weaknesses that have plagued its consumer business the last few years. Brian Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer, said that consumer sales were even weaker than the company had expected during the quarter. But he added that the consumer market accounts for only 20 percent of Dell’s total revenue, “a dynamic that is really good for us.” The company reported that in its first quarter, net income nearly tripled to $945 million, or 49 cents a share, from $341 million, or 17 cents a share. Revenue rose 1 percent to $15 billion. Analysts had forecast earnings of 43 cents a share, on average, on $15.4 billion in revenue for the first quarter. Sales to large corporations increased 5 percent to $4.5 billion, while Dell’s sales to consumers declined 7 percent. The company expects stronger growth — midsingle-digit revenue growth in its second fiscal quarter, which is slightly above its normal, sequential seasonal growth of 2 percent to 3 percent. Sales of personal computers could get a lift from a good back-to-school season, strong demand for Dell products using Intel’s new Sandy Bridge chip and end-of-year government spending, the company said. Shares of Dell rose 5.5 percent in after-hours trading to $16.78. Some analysts predict the consumers will continue to be a problem. “The consumer market is very weak and that situation is not going to improve,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. “The bigger picture is they are transforming into a solutions company, which will mean less volatility.” H.P. was sluggish in other segments of its business. H.P.’s services business, which caters to corporate clients, gained 2 percent, to $9 billion. Mr. Apotheker said inadequate investment was to blame, a thinly veiled criticism of his predecessor, Mark V. Hurd, who was known as a cost-cutter. H.P. said that it planned to reorganize its services business to focus on more profitable and higher-growth categories. However, analysts worried about the effect on profits and the time it would take for the extra investment to pay off. “We are making tough decisions today to set us up for the future,” Mr. Apotheker said. Louis Miscioscia, an analyst for Collins Stewart, said about H.P., “The frustrating thing is that it’s been a series of issues over the past year, not just one issue here and one issue there.” A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, called the quarter disappointing. He added that “clearly, it’s an inauspicious start” for Mr. Apotheker, who has spent just over six months on the job, and raises fears that the company is not going to be as strong under him as it was under Mr. Hurd. Investors sent H.P.’s shares down 7.3 percent on Tuesday to $36.91. It was their lowest level in nearly two years. H.P. and Dell are also feeling the effect of Japan’s disasters. H.P. said it expected a $700 million hit in the second half of its fiscal year because of reduced demand for its products, higher costs for components and the need to ship its products by air rather than by sea. Dell executives have said the company has experienced relatively minor disruptions in its supply chain as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan during the quarter. But Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, warned that Dell, along with H.P., would probably face higher component costs over the next few quarters. </text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/technology/18dell.html?ref=dellinc">Sales to Businesses Fuel Dell’s Strong Earnings<date>Published: May 17, 2011</date><text>Strong sales to businesses continued to prop up Dell’s earnings in the first quarter despite a weak economy and still-sluggish demand from consumers.

But Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, warned that Dell, along with H.P., would probably face higher component costs the next few quarters. Despite the strong quarter, Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., has much work ahead of it, even as the corporate market continues to regain momentum. The company’s future, analysts say, continues to rest on its ability to provide services and equipment for large data centers as corporations increasingly rely on cloud computing, a phrase used to describe products and services delivered online. Mr. Dell, who returned to run the company in 2006, is hoping to grab more corporate business by bringing greater efficiency to its services. Last month, Dell announced it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand its service offerings for cloud computing.Strong sales to businesses continued to prop up Dell’s earnings in the first quarter despite a weak economy and still-sluggish demand from consumers.

Sales to large corporations increased 5 percent to $4.5 billion, while Dell’s sales to consumers declined 7 percent. “We’re off to a solid start in our fiscal year 2012,” Michael Dell, chief executive of the company, said in a news release. “Our substantial profit increase demonstrates that our strategy is working and our execution is improving.” Over all, Dell executives have said the company has experienced relatively minor disruptions in its supply chain as a result of the earthquake in Japan during the quarter. But Brian Marshall, an analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company, warned that Dell, along with H.P., would probably face higher component costs the next few quarters. Despite the strong quarter, Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., has much work ahead of it, even as the corporate market continues to regain momentum. The company’s future, analysts say, continues to rest on its ability to provide services and equipment for large data centers as corporations increasingly rely on cloud computing, a phrase used to describe products and services delivered online. Mr. Dell, who returned to run the company in 2006, is hoping to grab more corporate business by bringing greater efficiency to its services. Last month, Dell announced it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand its service offerings for cloud computing.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/dells-future-beyond-the-pc-business/?ref=dellinc">Dell's Future Beyond the PC Business<date>May 2, 2011, 3:30 pm</date><text>Michael Dell built his company and his fortune in the personal computer business. But the company’s future is increasingly going to rest on services and the bigger gear used in data centers — server computers, storage and networking equipment. That was Mr. Dell’s overall theme in a pair of interviews on Friday, one onstage at a health technology and investment conference in California and one afterward. The company has changed considerably, especially since Mr. Dell returned as chief executive in January 2007, though its reputation is still as a PC company. “A lot of people think of Dell as what it was five or 10 years ago,” he said. “But we’ve moved much more into the core of information technology, into the data center.” Services are big part of the shift. In fact, 44,000 of the company’s 103,000 employees are in its services business. And it was no quirk that Mr. Dell appeared at a gathering of health industry companies, start-ups, policy officials and investors, held annually by Health Evolution Partners, a fund that invests in health companies. Dell is the No. 1 provider of health technology services, according to Gartner. The company’s big step into health came with Dell’s $3.9 billion purchase of Perot Systems, which had a large health consulting and services business, in 2009. Dell’s health care business points to how much the company is moving up from being a supplier of hardware to providing skills and services to make health care more efficient. For example, the company stores more than 4 billion medical images in its data centers, so hospitals do not have to grapple with that chore on their own. “When we go into a hospital today and we talk about things we can do for them, we’re really talking about patient outcomes, patient results,” Mr. Dell said. “We’re not talking about the shiny boxes.” Services is a $7.7 billion a year business for Dell, representing about 12 percent of total revenue. But Mr. Dell is still a hardware guy. Dell’s software business is still mostly reselling other companies products. And his strategy for grabbing business by bringing greater efficiency to services — as Dell did with PCs by selling directly to customers over the phone or the Internet — leans heavily on hardware. The opportunity, he said, lies in mixing hardware, software and services, to automate the business by providing more services as Web-based offerings, delivered remotely from Dell data centers in the so-called cloud model. The big potential new market, Mr. Dell said, is in offering services to midsize businesses, typically companies with from a few hundred to a few thousand employees. He suggested that Dell’s larger rivals in services, like I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, had more costly business models aimed at serving large corporations. “The midsized business sector is very exciting for us and kind of inaccessible to our traditional competitors,” Mr. Dell said. People have been talking about “industrializing services” for years. It remains uncertain whether Dell can really do that without holding a strategic position in software, the main automating technology in computing. Still, Dell does show signs of becoming an increasing force in the services business.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/business/15cloud.html?ref=dellinc">Business Wakes Up to Cloud Computing<date>Published: April 14, 2011</date><text>The big spenders on technology are businesses and government agencies. They buy about 75 percent of the computing goods and services sold worldwide. Yet it is increasingly evident they are not driving the new ideas, excitement and powerhouse technology companies in ascent these days.“The cutting edge of innovation is on the consumer side — digital technologies for consumption activity, play, entertainment and social-networked communication — and not in corporations anymore,” observed Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford. Nowhere is that more apparent than in cloud computing, the technology industry’s buzz term for customers’ accessing information held in big data centers remotely over the Internet from anywhere, as if the services were in a cloud. In the early days of computers, technology advanced because of government-financed research projects and work in corporate laboratories. Hobbyists developed the first personal computers, but it was only when I.B.M. entered the field in 1981, lending its seal of approval, that the PC industry really took off. Selling to businesses paved the way for the leading PC software and chip suppliers, Microsoft and Intel, to become giant corporations. But marquee companies of the Internet era have made their names and fortunes mainly in the consumer market — both the first-generation Web winners like Amazon and Google, and the second-generation successes like Facebook and Twitter. And they have grown big and grown fast by offering search, shopping and social-networking services in the cloud. Cloud computing, though, is more than a hyper-efficient means of distributing digital services. The cloud model is animated by a set of Internet technologies for juggling computing workloads in data centers far more efficiently than in the past — potentially reducing costs by about half, analysts say. Yet to date, the large, established technology companies — and their businesses and government customers — have trailed in cloud computing. The marketing of the cloud, analysts say, is way ahead of real offerings by suppliers and its adoption by business customers. But there are some recent signs of change. Last week, I.B.M. introduced a range of cloud services, including paying for computing resources like processing and storage on a metered pay-for-use formula, almost as if modeled on an electric utility. I.B.M. will offer customers an à la carte menu, in which they pay for different levels of guaranteed security, support and availability. I.B.M., a bellwether in the corporate technology market, forecasts that it will have $7 billion in cloud revenue by 2015. Of the total, $4 billion will be customers shifting to cloud delivery from the company’s traditional software and services, and $3 billion is expected to be entirely new business. “We’re moving to where the puck is going in this industry,” said Steven A. Mills, I.B.M.’s senior vice president for software and hardware. “And we’re more than willing to make this transition.” In another industry move announced last week, Dell said that it would invest $1 billion over the next two years to build 10 new data centers and expand customer support, largely for cloud offerings. The largest single customer for computing goods and services, the United States government, endorsed the cloud model this year. Vivek Kundra, the White House chief information officer, wrote a “Federal Cloud Computing Strategy” report, and identified $20 billion, or one quarter of the government’s total spending on information technology, as “a potential target” for migration to the cloud. That document has certainly caught the attention of the government’s technology suppliers, like Lockheed Martin, the largest. “We’re keenly focused on cloud computing,” said Melvin Greer, a senior fellow at Lockheed Martin. Still, the outlook is for an evolutionary shift toward the new technology spanning several years, even a decade or more, analysts say. People set the pace of technology adoption, and corporate data centers are filled with people whose skills and livelihoods are based on older technology and ways of doing things. But technology managers, surveys show, are also genuinely concerned about security, reliability and liability if confidential corporate data resides on another company’s computers — and getting locked into proprietary clouds, controlled by one company. Standards groups are moving to set technical rules for sharing data across different clouds, including a working group established last week by the IEEE, a professional electronic and computer engineering organization. 1 2 Next Page »The big spenders on technology are businesses and government agencies.

Despite an improved economy, worldwide shipments of computers fell 3.2 percent in the first quarter to 80.5 million, IDC said in its quarterly PC Tracker report. Gartner released a similar report that showed a 1.1 percent decline in worldwide computer shipments in the first quarter to 84.3 million. Japan’s natural disasters along with the uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa played a key role in the decline. Computer shipments in Japan fell 15.9 percent during the first quarter compared with the comparable period a year earlier, according to IDC. Japan’s earthquake on March 11 temporarily shut down that nation’s economy because of the widespread destruction, power outages and supply shortages. IDC and Gartner had forecast small gains in the shipments for the quarter. “While the consequences of events in the Middle East and Japan remain unclear, these will surely be factors that will influence short term market performance for 2011,” Jay Chou, an analyst with IDC, said in a statement. In the United States, shipments slipped 10 percent as consumers held onto their older computers or bought tablets, IDC said. New computers offer improved performance, but not enough to give consumers a reason to upgrade. “The U.S. and worldwide PC market continues to work through a difficult era that we expect will continue into next quarter, but will start to improve in the second half of the year,” Bob O’Donnell, a vice president with IDC, said in a statement. He continued: “While it’s tempting to blame the decline completely on the growth of media tablets, we believe other factors, including extended PC lifetimes and the lack of compelling new PC experiences, played equally significant roles.” IDC said Hewlett-Packard retained its position as the world’s largest computer maker, although its sales fell 2.8 percent to 15.2 million. Dell came in second with 10.3 million shipped computers, down 1.8 percent. Acer Group’s shipments fell 15.8 percent to 9 million largely because its netbook niche has fallen out of favor with consumers. Meanwhile, Lenovo showed considerable strength with a 16.3 percent increase in shipments to 8.2 million. In the United States, H.P. led all manufacturers with 4.3 million computers shipped, down 2.4 percent, IDC said. Dell, which has been struggling with weak sales for some time, followed with 3.7 million, down 11.1 percent. Toshiba’s shipments increased 10.4 percent to 1.7 million. Apple passed Acer to fourth place with a 9.6 percent increase in shipments to 1.4 million. Acer’s shipments slipped 42.1 percent to 1.3 million. Gartner says Apple did even better than IDC says. It reported that Apple’s PC shipments in the United States rose 18.9 percent in the quarter in a market that slipped 6.1 percent.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/technology/16dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell’s Earnings More Than Double<date>Published: February 15, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Businesses loaded up on new computers and servers from Dell during its fourth quarter in a sign that companies are increasing their spending on technology despite a weak economy. Dell said Tuesday that net income in the fourth quarter more than doubled, to $927 million, or 48 cents a share, from $334 million, or 17 cents, in the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue for the quarter, which ended Jan. 28, climbed 5 percent to nearly $15.7 billion from $14.9 billion. In after-hours trading after the earnings announcement, Dell’s shares rose more than 5 percent, to $14.72. In regular trading, Dell’s shares fell 18 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $13.91. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., said that sales to large companies grew 12 percent to $4.7 billion in the fourth quarter compared with the period a year ago. Among small and medium-size businesses, sales rose 12 percent, to $3.7 billion. Some other large technology companies have reported strong corporate sales in recent weeks including I.B.M., Intel and Microsoft. One exception was Cisco Systems, which last week said that it was in transition and issued a tepid financial forecast. “The corporate refresh cycle is alive and well,” said Brian Marshall, analyst with Gleacher &amp; Company. But Dell’s consumer business remained slow. Although businesses are replacing their old electronics, consumers are far more cautious about buying a new laptop or desktop computer. Consumer sales, which account for about 20 percent of Dell’s overall business, fell 8 percent in the fourth quarter, to $3.3 billion, compared with the same period a year earlier. Michael S. Dell, Dell’s chief executive, reiterated that consumer demand was muted. But the company also said that it faced a tough comparison because last year at this time many people were buying new computers loaded with the new Windows 7 operating system. Dell’s forecast for fiscal year 2012 was optimistic, with revenue expected to grow from 5 to 9 percent. Adjusted profit is expected to rise 6 to 12 percent along with what the company said would be “continued strong execution on cash flow.” “We are heading into the new year with strength and optimism," said Mr. Dell in a telephone call with analysts. Investors have been skeptical that Dell could revamp a business that that many consider to be increasingly stodgy. Dell is trying to expand beyond its roots in personal computers to products with higher profit margins, like services, data storage, servers and mobile devices. But it has made limited progress and those areas taken together remain smaller than the company’s traditional desktop and laptop business. Dell’s mobile devices, in particular, have failed to gain much traction despite several new products like the Streak tablet. Mr. Dell has been optimistic about the new sector, saying it offers “great opportunities for us.” But over the last year, Dell’s shares have been flat despite a big run-up in the overall stock market. Still, the increased corporate business, along with cost-cutting and cheaper computer components, helped lift gross profit margin to 21 percent, an increase from 16.6 percent for the same period a year ago. Mr. Marshall, the analyst, remained skeptical that Dell would continue to improve its profit margin because such a large portion of its business is selling low-margin personal computers. Like many large technology companies, Dell is also hampered by a slowdown in spending in the public sector, which includes government agencies, hospitals and schools.

Charges 6 in Insider Trading Cases<date>February 3, 2011, 2:36 pm</date><text>The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges of insider trading against six people associated with expert network firms after criminal cases brought earlier by the Justice Department against the same group. The S.E.C. charges that four consultants leaked privileged information about companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Apple and Dell to hedge fund managers and others eager to get an edge in the markets. The investors earned about $6 million in illicit gains from the tips, the complaint said. The sharing of that nonpublic information was facilitated by two employees at the expert network firm Primary Global Research, which connected the money managers to the executives for fees, the complaint said. “Company executives and other insiders moonlighting as consultants to hedge funds cannot blatantly peddle their company’s confidential information for personal gain,” said Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division. The Primary Global “consultants and employees schemed to facilitate widespread and repeated insider trading by several hedge funds and other investment professionals.” The charges are part of the widening insider trading investigation by the federal government. So far, the inquiry has led to raids at four hedge funds, as well as a round of subpoenas to several prominent money managers. Primary Global, which connects corporate executives with investors, has been at the center of the latest wave of insider trading charges. The S.E.C. alleged in its complaint that Primary Global “garnered substantial subscription and transaction-based fees” from clients in exchange for providing access to inside information. Those charged by the S.E.C. on Thursday include: Mark Anthony Longoria, a manager at A.M.D.; Daniel L. DeVore, a manager at Dell; Winifred Jiau, a consultant who is said to have obtained inside information about Marvell Technologies and others; and Walter Shimoon, an executive at Flextronics International. Bob Nguyen and James Fleishman, both employees of Primary Global, were also charged by the S.E.C. In January, Mr. Nguyen pleaded guilty to criminal charges of insider trading. On Thursday, Mr. Fleishman was indicted in the criminal case. The details of Mr. Nguyen’s involvement are laid out in greater detail in the S.E.C. complaint than in his guilty plea, which was unveiled last month by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. Mr. Nguyen, who is cooperating with prosecutors, vetted prospective consultants, measuring their “ability and willingness” to give inside information, the complaint said. He told consultants that conversations would not be recorded and even offered to let them use pseudonyms. He and Mr. Fleishman also served as information hubs for clients who did not want to talk with the consultants directly, the complaint said. Mr. DeVore, who also pleaded guilty to the criminal charges in December, provided inside information to Mr. Nyugen about Dell sales forecasts and details about contracts that the computer maker had with Seagate and Western Digital, the complaint said. Mr. DeVore is said to have passed that information along to an unnamed hedge fund. The fund traded on that information, making profits of about $500,000, the complaint said.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/intel-chip-flaw-cause-delays-for-pc-makers/?ref=dellinc">Intel Chip Flaw Causes Delays for PC Makers<date>February 2, 2011, 7:09 pm</date><text>Computer makers have been forced to shut down some of their assembly lines because of a design flaw in chips produced by Intel.

The offer represents a 35 percent premium to Terremark’s closing price on Thursday. The board of Terremark unanimously approved the deal. The deal for Verizon is a play on the rapid growth in remote, or cloud computing, an area where the company has been lagging behind competitors like AT&amp;T. Terremark, provides data storage services for big companies and government agencies. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Press release “For Verizon, $1.4 billion is a drop in the bucket and it provides a lot of strategic value,” said Colby Synesael, an analyst at Cowen And Company. Verizon knows Terremark’s work firsthand. Last year, Verizon signed a deal for 25,000 square feet in Terremark’s data centers. The company also started selling Terremark’s hosting services. “Cloud computing continues to fundamentally alter the way enterprises procure, deploy and manage IT resources, and this combination helps create a tipping point for ‘everything-as-a-service,’” Lowell McAdam, president and chief operating officer of Verizon, said in a statement. “Our collective vision will foster innovation, enhance business processes and dynamically deliver business intelligence and collaboration services to anyone, anywhere and on any device.” Revenue at Terremark increased 22 percent to $84.9 million in the latest quarter — although the company posted a loss of 12 cents a share. Cloud computing has been a hot area for deal-making. In recent months several technology giants, including Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Dell and I.B.M., have bought a slew of data storage companies. In mid-December, Dell announced plans to buy Compellent Technologies, an acquisition that valued the company at nearly $1 billion. After Terremark, Mr. Synesael figures more deals could follow. Among the potential targets: Savvis, Rackspace Hosting, Internap Network Service and NaviSite. Verizon was represented by Goldman Sachs and Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in the deal, while Terremark worked with Credit Suisse Securities and Greenberg Traurig.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/technology/19blue.html?ref=dellinc">Services Recovery Helps I.B.M.

I.B.M. shares rose 2.8 percent in extended trading after the company reported that fourth-quarter net income rose 9 percent, to $5.3 billion. Its earnings of $4.18 a share easily exceeded its $3.59 of the year-earlier quarter and the Wall Street average forecast of $4.08, according to Thomson Reuters. Investors were particularly relieved with the increase in services contracts, an early indicator of future revenue from outsourcing and other technology projects. I.B.M., which has been shifting its focus from commoditized hardware to higher-margin services and software over the last decade, said it signed services contracts worth $22.1 billion during the quarter, up 18 percent. Analysts also noted $142 billion worth of backlog in the services business, up $5 billion from a year earlier — a sign of strong revenue growth ahead. I.B.M. forecast 2011 earnings of “at least $12.56” a share, up from $11.52 in 2010. It said that it was on track to hit its operating earnings goal of $20 a share by 2015. Its gross profit margin rose to 49 percent, from 48.3 percent a year earlier. “We think that the risk-reward here is pretty attractive and we see fairly limited downside to I.B.M.,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors. He said he saw room for the shares to rise, but not too much more than the overall market. I.B.M.’s price-to-earnings ratio of 12 lags behind multiples of about 14 for Oracle and Accenture, but is higher than those of Dell and Hewlett-Packard. The company’s quarterly revenue rose to $29.0 billion from $27.2 billion, higher than the market’s forecast for $28.3 billion. Sales rose throughout the business, with systems and technology revenue up 21 percent and its software revenue excluding its divested operations up 11 percent.

I.B.M., which has been shifting its focus from commoditized hardware to higher-margin services and software over the last decade, said it signed services contracts worth $22.1 billion during the quarter, up 18 percent. Analysts also noted $142 billion worth of backlog in the services business, up $5 billion from a year earlier — a sign of strong revenue growth ahead. I.B.M. forecast 2011 earnings of “at least $12.56” a share, up from $11.52 in 2010. It said that it was on track to hit its operating earnings goal of $20 a share by 2015. Its gross profit margin rose to 49 percent, from 48.3 percent a year earlier. “We think that the risk-reward here is pretty attractive and we see fairly limited downside to I.B.M.,” said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager at Capital Advisors. He said he saw room for the shares to rise, but not too much more than the overall market. I.B.M.’s price-to-earnings ratio of 12 lags behind multiples of about 14 for Oracle and Accenture, but is higher than those of Dell and Hewlett-Packard. The company’s quarterly revenue rose to $29.0 billion from $27.2 billion, higher than the market’s forecast for $28.3 billion. Sales rose throughout the business, with systems and technology revenue up 21 percent and its software revenue excluding its divested operations up 11 percent. Shares of I.B.M. rose 65 cents, or 4 percent, to close at $150.65.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/investors-see-need-for-change-at-expert-network-firms/?ref=dellinc">Investors Say Expert Networks Need to Change Their Ways<date>January 13, 2011, 8:56 am</date><text>In the wake of a string of arrests in the federal investigation of insider trading, there is mounting pressure for change in the expert network industry. According to a new report from the research firm TABB Group, released on Wednesday, more than half of the 112 investment professionals, regulators and other market players interviewed believed that expert networks needed some guidance. About 78 percent said the compliance controls in place at these firms were not enough to prevent violations. “The industry clearly believes that the business practices of expert networks walk a fine line between legitimate and illegitimate research, and that the industry is in need of a clear code of conduct,” the TABB report said. As DealBook reported in December, the inquiries and arrests have had a chilling effect across the expert network industry and the broader investment community. Although the arrests have so far centered on expert network employees or consultants — particularly those tied to Primary Global Research — a wide range of financial firms have pulled back on their use of these services and are reviewing their internal policies. The clampdown on expert networks, analysts say, reflects the desire of these firms to avoid regulatory cross hairs and shore up investor confidence, which has been bruised by the parade of inquiries. About 63 percent of those interviewed in the TABB report said the investigations had hurt investor confidence. Nearly all of the TABB respondents, 98 percent, said they believed the current investigations would reduce revenue at expert networks — 39 percent said the decline would be limited while 29 percent predicted a severe drop. “The need to invest in costly compliance measures — post regulation — could have a negative impact on the use of expert networks,” the report said. The report also indicated a consensus on the issue of whether employees of public companies should be allowed to work for expert networks — 66 percent of respondents said employees should be “banned from collecting fees.” In the federal insider trading investigation, prosecutors accused Daniel DeVore, a former Primary Global consultant and Dell supply manager, of providing clients with nonpublic information on Dell’s products, forecasts and financial results.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/a-look-at-5-new-defendants-in-the-insider-case/?ref=dellinc">A Look at the New Defendants in the Insider Trading Case<date>December 16, 2010, 9:10 pm</date><text>Prosecutors cast a wider net in its sprawling insider trading investigation on Thursday, arresting four more people. Federal authorities filed charges against Walter W. Shimoon, Mark Anthony Longoria, Manosha Karunatilaka and James M. Fleishman. The government also announced that it had accepted a guilty plea from Daniel DeVore. Although their connection to the expert-network firm Primary Global Research is now well known, there is relatively little personal information available about these defendants. DealBook has compiled a brief field guide on the latest names. We culled information from previous employers, federal documents, local records and personal LinkedIn profiles. James M. Fleishman, 41, Santa Clara, Calif. Tony Avelar/Bloomberg News James M. Fleishman, one of four people arrested in the government’s insider trading investigation, as he left the federal court in San Jose, Calif. Mr. Fleishman is an account representative for Primary Global Research, where he handled clients that included as hedge funds and asset managers. He has been placed on leave by his firm, which is based in Mountain View, Calif. According to the government’s complaint, Mr. Fleishman is connected to two consultants, Mark Anthony Longoria and Daniel DeVore, and corresponded frequently with an unnamed Primary Global Research client, CW-2. According his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Fleishman joined the firm in June 2006 and closed more than 30 accounts, handling firms with over $100 billion in managed assets. His former employers include MailFrontier, where he was a corporate sales representative and Generic Media, where he was an office manager. He has held several addresses in Santa Clara County, including homes in Mountain View and Palo Alto. Mr. Fleishman graduated from San Jose State University in 1992, where he received a bachelor of arts in environmental sciences. He also received an elementary school teaching certificate in 2000 from San Jose State. “I’ve always enjoyed talking to people, explaining what I know and learning new things,” Mr. Fleishman wrote on his LinkedIn profile. “I have been fortunate enough to get paid to do this as an English teacher in Korea, a salesman at a software start-up in Silicon Valley and most recently on Wall Street working with money managers at institutional power-houses. It’s been fascinating to work in so many different worlds and I look forward to what the next will be.” Mark Anthony (Tony) Longoria, 44, Round Rock, Tex. Mr. Longoria was an expert consultant for Primary Global Research from March 2006 to March 2010. He was also an employee at the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices from January 2007 to Oct. 22, 2010, when he resigned. In his last role, he was a senior supply chain manager, and he had knowledge of significant data on the company’s processor chips, forecasts from other manufacturers and sales numbers. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was responsible for managing inventory targets and interacting with various departments, such as marketing, sales, engineering and logistics. In an e-mail cited in the government’s complaint, Mr. Fleishman called Mr. Longoria “one of our best experts — in high demand from clients.” The complaint also outlines one conversation with the unnamed Primary Global client, CW-2, in which Mr. Longoria tells CW-2 that A.M.D. will report $1.18 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2009. His prediction, made in advance of A.M.D.’s public announcement, proved correct. According to the United States attorney’s office, Primary Global paid Mr. Longoria more than $200,000 for his services from January 2008 to March 2010. Over all, Mr. Longoria has 13 years of experience in the technology industry; before joining A.M.D., he was an employee at Western Digital and Dell. According to his LinkedIn profile, his interests include “new technology, fishing, running, all sports.” He graduated from Southern Illinois University, with a bachelor of science degree in industrial technology. Manosha Karunatilaka, 37, Marlborough, Mass. Mr. Karunatilaka served as an expert consultant with Primary Global Research from September 2007 to July 2010. He was an employee of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for four years, during which time he worked on “the ‘capacity allocation side’ and looked at ‘incoming orders,’” according to the complaint. In a conversation with the unnamed Primary Global client, CW-2, Mr. Karunatilaka discussed order numbers, the company’s forecasts, and pricing and margin information. Taiwan Semiconductors did not immediately return calls for comment. According to the United States attorney’s office, Primary Global paid Mr. Karunatilaka more than $35,000 for his services from January 2008 to June 2010. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Karunatilaka was a business development manager at Taiwan Semiconductor and previously worked at NEC Electronics, Avaya, Avici Systems and Lucent Technologies. He graduated in 1998 from City University of New York with a degree in electrical engineering. Walter W. Shimoon, 39, San Diego Mr. Shimoon served as an expert consultant with Primary Global Research from August 2007 to November 2010. He was also a longtime employee of Flextronics, an electronics manufacturing services provider, and had worked at the company for nearly a decade. According to the complaint, at Flextronics Mr. Shimoon participated in contract negotiations with Apple and had knowledge of sensitive information. In a conversation with the unnamed Primary Global client, CW-2, according to the complaint, he disclosed sales estimates, release dates and discussed new features coming on the iPhone and the iPad, which was a “highly secretive project” at that time. According to the United States attorney’s office, Primary Global paid Mr. Shimoon more than $22,000 for his services from January 2008 to June 2010. Mr. Shimoon was previously an employee at Altera, Wyle Electronics and Nortel, according to his LinkedIn profile. And he was a 1995 graduate of Carleton University, with a bachelor’s degree in engineering. His brother is Justin Shimoon, founder of AffinityClick, a start-up based in Ottawa, Canada. Justin Shimoon said he had no comment and rarely spoke to his brother. According to Flextronics, Walter Shimoon has been terminated. Daniel DeVore, Austin, Tex. Mr. DeVore is a former global supply manager for Dell in Austin, Tex., and a former consultant for Primary Global Research. According to the firm, he served as an expert consultant from August 2006 to October 2010. Mr. DeVore has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with investigators. He started working for Dell in 1996. According to a person briefed on the matter but who was not authorized to speak publicly, Mr. DeVore recently left Dell. In calls to an unnamed Primary Research client, Mr. DeVore discussed Dell’s notebook and hard drive business, hard disk drive demand, forecasts, pricing and Dell’s financial results, according to the complaint. He also was privy to Dell’s master planning report, which he received weekly. According to the United States attorney’s office, Primary Global paid Mr. DeVore about $145,750 for his services from late 2007 to August 2010.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DD1730F937A25751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=dellinc">Dell Deal Leaves Few Data Firms To Acquire<date>Published: December 14, 2010</date><text>7:32 p.m. | Updated The number of takeover targets is rapidly dwindling in the fast-growing data storage sector. On Monday, Dell announced plans to buy Compellent Technologies, for $27.75 a share, in a deal that values the company at $960 million. The computer maker said Thursday that it was in talks to buy the data storage maker for $27.50 a share. Shares of Compellent fell 2.5 percent on Monday, to close at $27.98, and Dell's stock slid 3.9 percent to $13.36. Now, investors are waiting for the next deal to drop. While several private companies are still up for grabs, including Pillar Data Systems and BlueArc, only a handful of public firms are left, namely CommVault and NetApp. Data storage is a lucrative market. With the volume of e-mail, spreadsheets and other documents ballooning, companies need ever more tools and space to manage their data. All of that has raised sales and margins in the group; the overall storage hardware market increased 18.5 percent, to $7 billion, in the third quarter, from a year ago, according to research firm IDC. As the technology giants race to capitalize on the surge in remote, or cloud, computing, Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Dell and I.B.M. have all snapped up data-storage businesses in recent months. Dell lost a battle over 3Par in September to H.P., which agreed to buy the high-end storage player for about $2.4 billion. Among the remaining public companies, the software maker CommVault, with a market value of $1.4 billion, may be the easier deal to swallow. In fact, many thought CommVault - not Compellent - would be No. 2 on Dell's wish list after the loss of 3Par. While CommVault management recently said it preferred to remain independent, a tie-up with Dell would make sense. The two have a longstanding relationship. Dell is one of CommVault's largest customers, accounting for roughly 25 percent of revenues. With $14 billion in cash, Dell could still make a play for CommVault, said Eric Martinuzzi, an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital. H.P. is also a potential bidder. Shares of CommVault, which specializes in backup and recovery software, have risen more than 70 percent since mid-July. NetApp has been the subject of takeover speculation for years. In September, Oracle's chief, Lawrence J. Ellison, told financial analysts that he would ''love'' to have part of NetApp's storage business, at the least. His desire is understandable. NetApp's revenue has jumped more than 30 percent in each of the last three quarters. And the company now ranks behind EMC and I.B.M. in terms of market share, according to IDC. While NetApp would be the big prize, it would not be easily or cheaply won. At $55.58 on Monday, shares of the company were up more than 80 percent since February. It is now one of the industry's behemoths, with a market value of $19.6 billion. A buyer would need deep pockets, and be eager to take on an extensive suite of data-storage products. Along with Oracle, Cisco Systems also fits that description, analysts said. Both lack a significant data-storage business, and the two have plenty of money for deal making. Cisco is sitting on $39 billion in cash, and Oracle has $24 billion. ''The one piece Oracle is missing is a broad and deep storage offering,'' said Alex Kurtz, an analyst at Merriman Curhan Ford &amp; Company. ''It's just a question of how badly Oracle wants it.'' But Oracle may not be able to take on a large purchase now. It is still busy digesting its $7.4 billion takeover of Sun Microsystems, a transformative deal that moved Oracle into the hardware business for the first time. With Oracle preoccupied, Cisco may have the edge, Mr. Martinuzzi said. A deal for NetApp would dovetail nicely with the company's long-term strategy to become a one-stop information technology shop. ''Since March 2008, Cisco has said that we want to be about unified computer systems,'' said Mr. Martinuzzi. ''But in order to do that you need to have networking, servers and storage. Cisco only has two of those three pieces.''

A decade ago Bill Gates, founder and former chief executive of Microsoft, presented a new class of computing to the world: a tablet PC that offered a fully functional computer with the “intuitive aspects of pencil and paper.” Since then, Microsoft has struggled to gain traction with a slate-like device, yet each year the company announces new products, software or operating systems that try to promote a world of Windows-based slate computers. Next month, at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Microsoft will give it another try, presenting a slew of new slates that it hopes will offer some competition to the Apple iPad, which has quickly become the leader in this market. According to people familiar with Microsoft’s plans, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, is expected to  announce a number of these devices when he takes the stage at C.E.S., showcasing devices built by Samsung and Dell, among a number of other manufacturing partners. The people with knowledge of these devices asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly by Microsoft or partnering companies. Microsoft declined to comment about coming products that have not been announced. The Samsung device is described as “similar in size and shape to the Apple iPad, although it is not as thin. It also includes a unique and slick keyboard that slides out from below for easy typing.” The people familiar with this device said it would run the Windows 7 operating system when in landscape mode, but will also have a layered interface that will appear when the keyboard is hidden and the device is held in a portrait mode. Microsoft hopes these slates will offer an alternative to the iPad because they move beyond play, people familiar with the tablets said. “The company believes there is a huge market for business people who want to enjoy a slate for reading newspapers and magazines and then work on Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint while doing work,” explained a person familiar with the company’s tablet plans. A person who works at Microsoft said the company was encouraging partners to build applications for these devices that use HTML5, the Web programming language. This person said the applications would  not be sold in an app store, as with the Apple iTunes model, but Microsoft will encourage software partners to host the applications on their own Web sites, which will then be highlighted in a search interface on the slate computers. It is unclear if these applications will be ready for C.E.S. as most are still in production. Another person with knowledge of Microsoft’s plans said Steve Ballmer might demonstrate a tablet and other companion devices running the next operating system, Windows 8.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEFDB1031F933A25751C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=dellinc">Dell Offers 18% Below Market Price to Buy a Data Storage Company<date>Published: December 10, 2010</date><text>7:40 p.m. | Updated Dell may have lost the fight over 3Par, but it has found a consolation prize in another data storage company: Compellent Technologies. The two companies announced on Thursday that Dell was in talks to buy Compellent for $27.50 a share. The proposed deal is effectively a take-under, with a bid that is 18.3 percent below Compellent's closing price on Wednesday of $33.65. Shares of Compellent have nearly doubled in the last two months on takeover speculation. More fuel was added on Dec. 7, when the company's chief financial officer canceled an appearance at a technology conference scheduled for the next day. Dell's offer values Compellent, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., at $876 million. But the companies cautioned that the proposal could fall apart. ''There can be no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will be consummated,'' the two said in a statement. Compellent stock tumbled 13.7 percent on Thursday to close at $29.04 a share. Dell ended down 0.2 percent, at $13.65 a share. The data storage sector has consolidated rapidly in the last two years, as technology giants rush to capitalize on the growth in cloud computing. Dell, EMC and Hewlett-Packard have offered rich prices for the market's top players. Three weeks ago, EMC agreed to buy Isilon Systems for $2.25 billion, a 28.8 percent premium over Isilon's closing price the previous day. Hewlett-Packard and Dell battled for weeks this summer over 3Par. Dell initially bid $18 a share. After a string of counteroffers, H.P. emerged the victor with an offer of $33 a share, or $2.4 billion. Compellent's rivals - like Isilon, 3Par and Data Domain - sell high-end data storage solutions that can be ramped up to meet the needs of even the largest companies. That's why suitors are offering to pay more than nine times revenue for the companies, said Paul H. Mansky, a managing director at the research firm Cannacord Genuity. Compellent specializes in products for medium-size businesses, a less lucrative segment. Dell's bid is roughly 4.5 times next year's sales, Mr. Mansky estimated. ''All the big acquisitions have been of high-end storage vendors,'' he said. ''This is the strategy Dell wanted, and they fell short.'' Even so, Compellent may make sense for Dell, analysts say. Dell first gained a stronghold in data storage with its 2007 purchase of EqualLogic for $1.4 billion. The computer maker also sells EMC products through a nearly decade-long partnership agreement. But Dell is winding down its relationship with EMC, a Compellent competitor, analysts say. Dell's bid for 3Par was considered the first strike against EMC and a sign that Dell was ready to build its own storage business. ''If 3Par was a public separation, this announcement is the divorce,'' said Mr. Mansky. Compellent also fits nicely into Dell's distribution model, which caters to small and midsize businesses. While Dell's motivations are clear, the real question is why Compellent's board would entertain such a low offer. Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair &amp; Company, said it could reflect underlying business issues. ''If your stock is at $33, why would you be willing to sell at $27?'' Mr. Ader asked. ''What does that tell you about what they're thinking about their business longer term? Are they worried about their prospects?''

The Inspiron Duo ($549) is a portable computer with a 10.1-inch display. It features a 1.5 GHzIntel Atom processor and 2GB of RAM. Storage can be as much as 320GB. A webcam is built in and the computer ships with Windows 7 Home Premium. On top of Windows, Dell has added a layer of software the company calls Duo Stage. From this, a collection of touchable icons can be reached, opening up music, photos and other tablety applications that Dell expects consumers to use. One thing, though, right off the spec sheet that might put a kink in Dell's tablet plans: weight. The Inspiron Duo hits the scales at a hefty 3.39 pounds. That's, for perspective's sake, more than twice the weight of the iPad, which comes in at 1.5 or 1.6 pounds, depending on whether 3G is installed. Samsung's seven-inch Galaxy Tab is a comparative bantamweight at 0.8 pounds. While hybrids may be the future for cars, they may not work for computers.

While the part of the business that sells to businesses, governments and other institutions performed well, the company’s consumer products — computers for home use, along with mobile devices — made minuscule gains. “They went through a period where they didn’t have the right product and they didn’t have a strong reputation for service,” said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “That reputation may be lingering.” Sales of Dell’s consumer products in the third quarter rose 4 percent to $3 billion, compared with the same period in 2009. Commercial sales, in contrast, grew 24 percent to $12.4 billion. In a sign of its consumer problems, Dell announced on Wednesday that Ronald G. Garriques, a former Motorola executive who oversees Dell’s mobile products unit, would be leaving in January. The company said the communications division, which included mobile devices, would be closed and its operations folded into other parts of the company. Dell is grappling with its consumer business, particularly its relatively small footprint in mobile devices. Dell’s mobile products, including the Streak tablet, have failed to catch on with consumers. “They are almost nonexistent,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. Dell’s consumer mobile business competes against Apple and the popular iPhone and iPad. Nevertheless, Michael. S. Dell, Dell’s chief executive, described mobile devices as “great opportunities for us.” Stephen J. Felice, president of Dell’s consumer products, said that the company spent the last year learning about mobile, adding that they could also be sold to businesses. Dell, he said, is now more bullish on the niche. Dell’s consumer business is only 19 percent of Dell’s overall business. Most of its revenue comes from selling computers, servers and data storage to corporations, hospitals, schools and government agencies. Dell said it expected revenue from consumers would be “muted” in the current quarter, but it saw “continued strength” from the corporate sector. Dell’s third-quarter profit more than doubled to $822 million, or 42 cents a share, from $337 million, or 17 cents, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter, which ended Oct. 29, climbed 19 percent, to $15.4 billion, from $12.9 billion a year ago. The adjusted net income of 45 cents a share was above Wall Street analysts’ expectations of 32 cents a share. Revenue fell just short of analysts’ estimates of $15.74 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Shares of Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, gained close to 4.57 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement. They had closed up 2.36 percent in regular trading at $13.66. Revenue from large enterprises rose 27 percent, and revenue from the public sector, which includes government, hospitals and other institutions, climbed 20 percent. Revenue from small- and medium-size business was up 24 percent. Investors have been watching for signs of a slowdown in technology spending during the quarter. Comments last week by executives at Cisco Systems about government agencies cutting back on technology spending had worried Wall Street and raised questions about whether other companies would also feel the effect. After Cisco said last week that orders from government fell 25 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, and 48 percent from the previous quarter, shares of Cisco fell 16 percent.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/technology/19docs.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Faces New Questions Over Faulty Computers<date>Published: November 18, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Documents unsealed Thursday in a three-year-old lawsuit against Dell have raised more questions about how the company handled an unprecedented number of faulty computers sold to governments, schools and corporations from 2003 to 2005. A judge in the Federal District Court in North Carolina unsealed hundreds of documents linked to a lawsuit filed by Advanced Internet Technologies that had accused Dell of trying to hide defects in its desktop computers from customers. For instance, the court documents show that the City of New York filed incident reports with Dell on 20.2 percent of a batch of 5,000 computers purchased during this period. A purchase of 2,800 computers by Microsoft resulted in issues with 11 percent of the machines; General Electric, William W. Backus Hospital, Denison University and the Montana Justice Department were among dozens of other organizations that experienced similar results. The documents also show how Dell had resisted informing many of its customers about the extent of the problem. Despite widespread reports from the field, Dell salespeople and technicians were encouraged to keep customers in the dark about the known defects that left computers inoperable. As it tried to deal with the mounting issues, Dell began ranking customers by importance, putting first those who might move their accounts to another PC maker, followed by those who might curtail sales and giving the lowest priority to those who were bothered but still willing to stick with Dell. The company declined to recall the systems and did what it called “proactive field replacements” for customers that met certain sales and failure rate thresholds. In September, Dell settled the lawsuit with Advanced Internet Technologies without disclosing the terms of the agreement. The New York Times sought access to the documents that had remained under seal. The issues with the computers revolved around the capacitors that dot computer motherboards. A typical Dell computer could have up to 20 of these capacitors, which cost a fraction of a penny each and help regulate electrical operations of the machines. Earlier this decade, capacitors made in Asia with a bad chemical recipe were sold to numerous makers of televisions, PCs and other electronic devices. The capacitors would bulge when they became too hot and cause devices to malfunction or stop working altogether. Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Apple and others were aware of these issues and tried to pull faulty computers from the market and to fix the computers. But even while keeping an eye on the problem, Dell continued to receive faulty capacitors from suppliers. It waged a three-year battle to identify the troublesome components. Studies conducted by Dell and a third party showed that the company shipped 11.8 million computers from May of 2003 to July 2005 that were at risk of breaking. What shocked customers and Dell was the rate at which the computers failed. For example, the unsealed court documents included a Dell study from 2004 in which the component issues charged past the company’s initial forecasts. In June of that year, Dell expected that a minimum of 12 percent of its SX270 Optiplex computers would result in incident reports from customers over a period of three years. By September, Dell raised the minimum incident report forecast to 45 percent and noted it could run as high as 97 percent. The same Dell study covered issues with the GX270 computer and noted that the company planned to help customers who had bought more than 50 computers and who had at least 5 percent of those systems fail. Other customers fell into the “fix on fail” category, meaning they would need to report issues to Dell after their computers had broken, the documents show. Internal Dell presentations from this time and later about the capacitor problems suggested that employees “Don’t bring this to customer’s attention proactively” and “emphasize uncertainty.” Dell also provided a type of question and answer sheet to employees, which included this exchange: “Why has Dell not taken a more proactive approach to rectifying the issue? Our approach to this issue delivers the best customer experience because it minimizes disruption.” In 2005, Dell took a $300 million charge tied to the cost of fixing or replacing troubled computers. In regard to the Dell internal studies, David Frink, a company spokesman, said: “The percentages were theoretical maximums and significantly exceeded the actual failure rates. That said, Dell actively investigated failures, we fixed on fail computers that suffered a capacitor issue and we extended the warranties on all the possibly affected motherboards.” Dell said it replaced motherboards on 22 percent of the 21 million Optiplex computers it shipped from 2003 to 2005. “This was an industrywide issue and to our knowledge no other manufacturer issued a recall either,” Mr. Frink said. Dell officials have characterized the Optiplex problems as an old issue and noted that the company has since improved its systems for handling these types of problems. The Dell presentations that instructed employees on how to respond to customer questions around the faulty computers included reassurances that no data loss would occur when a PC failed. The court documents, however, depicted customers complaining of data loss issues. “Are we just going to continue to go through the typical support channels to have the motherboards replaced when they fail (often corrupting users hard drives and compromising data) or will we have a final resolution to this never-ending stagnation of Dell’s reluctance/reticence/red tape?,” Mark O’Dell, an employee with Choice Hotels, wrote in an e-mail to Dell support staff. “When will Dell actually take care of the problem and fix our system failures?”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/dell-sets-its-sights-on-the-cloud-with-boomi-deal/?ref=dellinc">Dell Buys Boomi to Bolster Cloud Computing<date>November 3, 2010, 5:02 am</date><text>Dell has agreed to buy Boomi, a cloud-computing services start-up, in an effort to shore up its ability to provide software over computer networks. Dell did not disclose terms of the deal for Boomi, which counts Salesforce.com among its clients and helps integrate so-called cloud-based applications and smooth data transfers between programs, The Associated Press said. Boomi raised $4 million in 2008 in an initial round of institutional funding led by the venture capital firm FirstMark Capital. The company is based in Berwyn, Pa., and was founded in 2000. Privately held Boomi was mentioned as a potential buyout target after I.B.M. bought Cast Iron Systems earlier this year. Dell has been on the acquisition trail, but lost out recently in a bidding battle with its larger rival Hewlett-Packard for the high-end data-storage maker 3PAR. Michael Dell, the chief executive, had said at an industry event in Hong Kong that the company would announce a cloud-computing acquisition on Tuesday, spurring a round of market speculation about potential targets.

But now that Hewlett-Packard has trumped Dell’s takeover bid for 3Par, EMC and Dell are trying to patch up their bruised relationship. “We are again in discussions to see if we could do something more meaningful and lasting,” EMC’s chief executive, Joseph M. Tucci, said Tuesday, according to Reuters. “Both companies would like to do that, but the key is, it’s got to be meaningful, and it’s got to be lasting for me to tell you that it’s back on track” Dell’s affection has been fading for a number of years, with EMC reporting a decline in the percentage of revenue it gets from Dell. And as Reuters notes, the 3Par bid caused a severe strain that had the potential to be final: Mr. Tucci told investors on Tuesday that Dell’s bid for 3Par undermined the two companies’ relationship. Dell has resold billions of dollars of EMC’s data storage equipment, mostly to small and mid-sized businesses. “Dell went after 3Par and obviously cooled things off,” Mr. Tucci said in a conference call with analysts discussing EMC’s third-quarter results. But the two tech giants are now trying to resolve their differences, he said. Indeed, Dell also made an effort on Tuesday to smooth over the relationship. “EMC is a strategic partner and plays an important role in our storage portfolio,” a Dell spokesman, David Frink, said in a statement. He noted to Reuters that Dell had started selling two new EMC product lines this year. So can this relationship be saved? One analyst told Reuters he thinks so — at least in the short term: “EMC is not going to risk all that business just because they got a little egg on their face,” said Steve Duplessie, an analyst with the Enterprise Strategy Group. “I’m sure they’ll get over it.” Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/business/26ping.html?ref=dellinc">Meet the Defenders of Open-Source Software<date>Published: September 25, 2010</date><text>ARMIJN HEMEL, 32, lives with his parents in Tiel, a town smack-dab in the middle of the Netherlands. He works as a technology consultant, but spends several hours a week on his avocation: pestering some of the world’s most powerful consumer electronics and technology companies.Mr. Hemel serves as a volunteer watchman for free, open-source software like the Linux operating system, which competes with Microsoft’s Windows. The use of free software has exploded, particularly in gadgets as varied as exercise bikes, energy meters and smartphones. Companies like Google, TiVo and Sony often opt to piggyback on the work of others rather than going through the ordeal of building all of the software for their products from scratch. The problem that Mr. Hemel and others have stumbled upon is that some companies, even some technology savvy ones, may be violating the rather easy-to-follow requirements associated with free software licenses. Typically, these include making tweaked versions of a free software product available to the public, or simply giving credit to the original developers. Last month, for example, Dell received a public tongue-lashing from the geek kingdom and a cease-and-desist letter courtesy of Mr. Hemel for shipping its new Streak tablet without providing the underlying open-source software code. Dell representatives acknowledged the issue and later put the code on a Web site. “We are committed to fulfilling all of our obligations when using open-source code in our product,” said a Dell spokesman in a company blog. Mr. Hemel says companies should make sure they know the ins and outs of everything they sell. “If we all play by the rules, we can make some really good stuff,” he says. Quite often, companies that fail to live up to these requirements do so out of ignorance about the rules of engagement. Nonetheless, they become exposed to potentially expensive lawsuits. For the moment, companies with open-source compliance issues are in luck. Most of the people, like Mr. Hemel, who prowl about for violations seek neither fortune nor painful retribution. The creators of open-source software tend to just want a modicum of recognition and for companies to do the right thing. “Going to court is not the nice thing to do,” Mr. Hemel says. Typically, Mr. Hemel, who volunteers for gpl-violations.org, an organization named after a popular open-source license, receives an e-mail complaint from someone who suspects that a product may use open-source software without adhering to the rules. Mr. Hemel will sometimes then hop on his bike, ride to a local retailer, conduct a test purchase and then analyze the product to see whether it uses free software and whether the company selling the product has lived up to its end of the bargain. “We’re amazed by what people send in,” Mr. Hemel says. “There are wireless routers, PC cameras, phones and even an exercise bike that had a small computer so people could race against it.” The problem may become only worse as the use of open-source software spreads to industries far afield of the somewhat clued-in technology sector. Carmakers, for example, often use open-source software in their entertainment consoles, while energy companies have started to offer smart meters to their customers. “We are being flooded with more reports than ever before,” Mr. Hemel says. In the past, he called companies’ customer support lines to tell them about open-source compliance issues. But few call-center operators acted on his concerns, he says. These days, Mr. Hemel tries to find a contact in the legal department at the companies to discuss the issues. If no response or action follows, a cease-and-desist letter arrives. When the problem lingers, a lawsuit follows. Gpl-violations.org and similar organizations have pointed a finger at some high-profile companies. In recent years, Cisco Systems, Samsung, Best Buy, Verizon Communications, and many others have been sued by the Software Freedom Law Center. Lawsuits are typically settled out of court. For example, after Cisco was sued over the software included in its home routers; it agreed to make the software code available, tapped a point person to be responsible for open-source issues and paid an undisclosed amount to settle the case. Representatives of companies dealing with these complaints say it’s a far more amicable engagement than one would find in the proprietary software world, where hard-charging lawyers come seeking serious payback for what they view as violations of intellectual property rules. The nonprofit Linux Foundation has started a program meant to teach companies how to comply with open-source licenses. Cisco, Google, Intel, I.B.M., Sony and a host of other companies have backed the effort. “One of the things that makes this tough is that you have increasingly complicated supply chains,” says Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation. “These devices are made up of different components made all over the place.” Hewlett-Packard, in particular, has helped develop a standardized inventory list for software so that companies can keep track of their code and licenses. It has also built a tool that lets companies analyze their software. “These days a developer will do a Google search, find five open-source products that fit his need and the next thing you know one of them is in a product,” says Phil Robb, director of H.P.’s open-source program office. “The same questions should be asked about open-source software that have been asked for commercial software.” Many companies using free software fear that open-source supporters will become more aggressive and pursue large payments over possible violations. “The thing that terrifies companies is the thought of shipping millions of TVs or phones and then having someone figure out that you didn’t follow the licensing requirements,” says Mark F. Radcliffe, a lawyer at DLA Piper, who handles a variety of cases tied to open-source software. “It could be very costly.” Mr. Hemel, for his part, says he thinks the situation will improve with these new programs in place. “Over the last five years,” he says, “I have gone from rage and anger to understanding what the problem is and trying to fix it.”</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/technology/25dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Settles Lawsuit Over Concealing Defects<date>Published: September 24, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Dell settled a lawsuit Thursday that accused it of selling faulty computers and then trying to conceal the defects from its customers. The suit, filed in Federal District Court in North Carolina by Advanced Internet Technologies, an Internet services company, cast a harsh light on Dell’s response to its manufacturing problems, which left at least 11.8 million computers made from May 2003 to July 2005 at risk of failure. Terms of the tentative settlement were not disclosed. The three-year-old case had yet to go to trial. Clarence E. Briggs III, chief executive for Advanced Internet, in Fayetteville, N.C., declined to comment about the settlement, as did his lawyer. David S. Frink, a spokesman for Dell, in Round Rock, Tex., said “settling the matter is better and more cost effective for the company than taking the case to trial.” Dell had disputed the allegations. Dell’s troubles stemmed from faulty capacitors that it had bought from Asian suppliers. The capacitors, which control the flow of electricity to various components, were prone to leaking fluids that could cause malfunctions in Dell’s OptiPlex desktop computers, sold primarily to businesses and government. Rival computer makers also had problems with the bad components, but to a lesser degree. Advanced Internet, which had bought 2,000 Dell computers, accused Dell of ignoring its responsibility to fix the defects. As a result, Advanced Internet said it had lost millions of dollars in business. As part of its suit, Advanced Internet pointed to internal Dell documents in which Dell employees had discussed playing down the problems when customers called to complain. Salespeople were told not to bring up the defects to potential customers unless asked and then to “emphasize uncertainty.” An internal Dell study showed that up to 97 percent of all OptiPlex computers were expected to have problems over three years of use, according to the lawsuit. Dell had assured customers that the leaking did not cause the loss of data or pose a fire hazard. However, some customers complained that they had indeed lost their data, and computer experts have said the leaking posed a limited safety risk. Dell argued that it had fixed millions of computers that had the potential for problems and that it had extended their warranties. In 2005, Dell took a $300 million charge to cover, at least in part, the cost of fixing or replacing troubled computers.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/17/business/17dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Plans to Expand in Western China<date>Published: September 16, 2010</date><text>Dell said Thursday that it planned to open a manufacturing, sales and service center in Chengdu in 2011 that could eventually employ more than 3,000 workers. The new operations center is a response to rapid growth in business in Western China, Dell said.Over the next decade, Dell said it expected to spend about $100 billion on China operations. It spent $23 billion in China in 2009. China has been courting foreign investors for projects in its western regions for more than a decade. Dell would not say what sort of incentives it was offered to build new facilities in Chengdu. Dell already employs about 6,000 people in China. It also contracts with electronics manufacturers in the country.

On Oct. 22, Microsoft has mandated (with some exceptions) that PC makers stop offering ''factory downgrades'' in their current computer ranges, which means that Windows 7 will be the OS of choice. Depending on your point of view, Dell has either jumped the gun or taken the bull by the horns, by announcing that it will discontinue the XP option by late September. ''We will stop offering XP as an option for customers starting this month in preparation for next month's deadline,'' read the post on Dell's Web site, Direct2Dell. Microsoft's quest to eliminate XP from new PCs in favor of its newer operating systems has been going on for more than two years, back when most PC makers changed over to the Vista OS. In the face of public annoyance, Microsoft did continue supplying XP in netbooks and some other models, but back in April 2008, the company did make clear that Oct. 22 was end of the line for the factory-installed downgrade option. There are asterisks, however. For instance, Dell says its corporate customers will continue to have the option for XP beyond Oct. 22 through the company's Custom Factory Integration service. ''Otherwise, customers who order new machines with Windows 7 Professional or higher can run XP applications in Windows XP mode,'' said the company. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Repeat.<date>Published: September 11, 2010</date><text>YOU know how steam wafts above the heads of really furious cartoon characters, usually as they clench their fists and hop around and fume?Well, those vapors should swirl atop the Haggler’s computer every day, because his e-mail queue is basically one large pileup of outrage and frustration. It’s like that five-day, Chinese traffic jam, but with a spam filter. In this episode, we follow one young woman’s journey into the great big bottleneck of consumer despair. And then we get stern with the company that drove her there. Q. When the hard drive on my Dell computer crashed, I mailed it to the company, with assurances that I would have it back in less than 10 days — in plenty of time for my law school finals. When there was no sign of the computer after three weeks, I called Dell and was told that it couldn’t help me because the computer had been shipped via FedEx and was out of its system. I frantically called FedEx, gave it my correct address and set up a delivery. Unfortunately, I also called Dell to let it know that I had located my computer and had taken matters into my own hands — which turned out to be a big mistake. When the delivery date came and went without a package in sight, I called FedEx. A rep there told me it had heard from Dell after my call and was instructed to send the box back to the company. Company policy, Dell explained. Deep breaths. When Dell re-resent my computer, it once again slapped the wrong address on the box. This time, I simply took a $70 taxi ride to the Bronx and demanded my computer. Problem solved? Oh no. The replacement hard drive that had been installed did not function properly. Back to Dell it went. When it was finally re-re-resent, Dell had failed to include the necessary driver/installation discs. I had to call and beg for those. Let’s summarize: I went computerless for about two months, spent many hours on hold, dropped $70 on a cab and almost went nuts. The lowlight of the ordeal was surely when one of the Dell customer reps kept me on the line for hours while doing nothing to help. I actually could hear him making a point of ignoring me. I asked Dell supervisors to listen to all my calls and to reread all my communications, and to check out that specific on-hold incident, which is its policy to do. But no one ever did. I have my computer now, but I will never buy anything from Dell again. Helen Gugel Brooklyn A. “Dell, please come to the principal’s office. Dell, to the principal’s office, please.” Yes, the Haggler at times feels like the chief disciplinarian at a middle school filled with unruly youngsters who need a lecture and a week of detention. Or perhaps a bit of third-grade punishment, like an afternoon spent writing, “We will not mistreat our customers” on a chalkboard a few hundred times. Actually, the first step for Dell might be a policy that keeps wicked nincompoops away from its customer help desks. Ms. Gugel said last week that she wasn’t exaggerating about the hours she waited on hold, although “hold” isn’t the right word when you’re locked in what amounts to a bizarre game of attrition with someone who refuses to speak to you. For several of the lengthier vigils, Ms. Gugel’s friends chipped in by taking turns with the phone. Dell was more responsive when the Haggler reached out to the company’s publicist. Shortly thereafter, someone at Dell’s corporate office called Ms. Gugel to apologize for her ordeal, as well as to reimburse her for her taxi ride. Less impressively, the rep also sent her a $100 coupon, to be used on the Dell Web site. At Haggler Central, this is known as a non-remedy remedy, given that Ms. Gugel has sworn off Dell. So, what does the company have to say for itself? Amazingly, a spokeswoman, Jennifer Davis, did not open a conversation with the Haggler last week with rending of garments and a lengthy mea culpa. O.K., there was some culpa, but it came later. Out of a sense of decency, the Haggler will skip the part of the interview wherein a tiny portion of blame for this fiasco was ever so subtly laid at Ms. Gugel’s feet. Suffice it to say, none of it was remotely relevant. When the Haggler suggested that it might make more sense for Dell to emphasize its contrition, Ms. Davis agreed. She said that customer service is hugely important to Dell and that the company is in the midst of a very broad effort to upgrade its customer service system. Unfortunately, that effort appears to have commenced well before Ms. Gugel’s ordeal, suggesting that there is a lot of tinkering to do. “It’s a constant striving for improvement,” Ms. Davis said, when the Haggler pointed this out. Ms. Davis also said that when there are breakdowns like the one chronicled above, the company takes great pains to figure out what happened and why. So, what was the fate of the phone rep who would neither speak nor hang up? “I need to go back and dig into this a little more,” Ms. Davis said.  Now, a request to readers: Have you had trouble with a rental car? The Haggler would like to hear from you.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/03/technology/03views.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Loses 3Par, and Shareholders Seem Not to Care<date>Published: September 2, 2010</date><text>Are Dell’s shareholders on Xanax? The computer maker has finally bowed out of its mad bidding war for 3Par, the data storage company. Yet its investors displayed neither much concern about overpaying nor relief about the deal’s being dropped. After a decade of scandals, missed opportunities and dismal performance, they may have stopped caring. There was reason to worry. Dell looked desperate for 3Par. It raised its offer multiple times to compete with Hewlett-Packard. H.P.’s $2.1 billion winning bid was more than three times 3Par’s undisturbed market capitalization and values the company at almost 10 times estimated sales. Based on a typical tech premium of around 40 percent, H.P. appears to have overpaid by more than $1 billion. Dell’s investors should be happy to have lost. 3Par’s final price tag would have been about 4 percent of Dell’s market capitalization. Moreover, Dell received a $72 million breakup fee for its troubles. Yet its shares rose only about 2 percent after Dell withdrew from the 3Par action on Thursday. The tranquilized market reaction reflected a seeming lack of ability to feel much anger or sadness during the battle. Dell’s shares fell little after its initial bid or the subsequent offers. Maybe shareholders never thought Dell had a chance at 3Par. But a better explanation could be they have given up on the stock. Dell’s shares are down about 70 percent over the last decade. The company has gained a reputation for producing inferior products and offering poor tech support. An accounting scandal recently cost the company $100 million. Apple stands as a bigger threat to Dell’s computer sales while H.P., I.B.M. and Oracle are far ahead in offering one-stop shopping for clients. While Dell’s weak record of late could easily persist, such investor apathy can be the sign of a stock’s bottoming. The shares trade at less than 10 times estimated earnings for this year, and the company’s cash flow yield is about 15 percent, according to Merrill Lynch. Dell also has more than $7 billion of net cash on its balance sheet. Perhaps the shares have become so unloved there is finally a case for a bit of enthusiasm. An Oily Slope Petroleo Brasileiro is shaping up to be more like Gazprom than Exxon Mobil. By overpaying for five billion barrels of reserves, the Brazilian oil group, known as Petrobras, is transferring up to $17 billion of value to the government, whose stake will also rise. The company is looking more like an instrument of the state than a guardian of shareholder interests. A year after the capitalization plan was first announced, Petrobras shareholders are finally getting some clarity. That earned a relief rally in the beaten-down shares on Thursday. But the news over all isn’t good. At $8.51 a barrel, Brazil is charging its captive oil company too much for the new reserves. A more reasonable price might have been closer to $5 a barrel, which means Brasilia is gaining at the expense of Petrobras shareholders. The deal will require issuing to the government $42.5 billion in new shares. Private investors, meanwhile, will probably see their economic interest, currently more than two-thirds, decline because they won’t be willing to buy enough additional new shares to maintain their stakes. To retain the same size stake, investors would need to pump in about $80 billion based on the government’s oil-for-shares deal. Rather, what’s being discussed is private investors kicking in another $25 billion, which will leave them diluted. Of course, Petrobras was never a pure private sector play. The government, after all, owns a majority of its voting stock. Losing out in the oil-for-shares swap serves to remind shareholders of that. It is risky, however, for Brasilia to push Petrobras shareholders around too much. Even with fast-rising cash flow, it will need about $58 billion by 2014 to meet ambitious capital spending goals. Raising that cash should be a breeze for a company expecting to double output by 2020, growth unmatched by rivals. But investors will lose enthusiasm if they perceive the government’s interests come long before their own. The Russian state-controlled Gazprom trades at just five times estimated 2010 earnings, the low end of its peer group and less than half Exxon’s multiple. Petrobras falls somewhere in between. Private-sector owners will be hoping the Brazilian government starts distancing itself more clearly from the Gazprom model.

Outbids Dell for 3Par, a Data Storage Company<date>Published: September 2, 2010</date><text>Hewlett-Packard offered to buy 3Par, a maker of storage systems, for about $2.3 billion, ending an 18-day bidding war with Dell. Dell declined to match H.P.’s $33-a-share offer, Dave Johnson, Dell senior vice president for corporate strategy, said Thursday in a statement. “We took a measured approach throughout the process and have decided to end these discussions,” he said. H.P.’s offer is more than three times the closing price for 3Par’s stock on Aug. 13, before Dell’s initial bid was made public. It is about 10 times 3Par’s revenue over the last four quarters. The premium reflects a growing urgency to use acquisitions to fuel growth and underscores the dearth of affordable runners-up in the storage market. “It looked like H.P. was willing to bid for this asset at any price,” said Shaw Wu, an analyst at Kaufman Brothers in San Francisco. “It’s tough for Dell or anyone to compete with a determined bidder.” The $2.3 billion price excludes 3Par’s cash and near-term investments of about $104.3 million. Dell began the public bidding for 3Par at $18 a share on Aug. 16, going on to offer as much as $32. Dell said it was entitled to a $72 million termination fee, based on a previous agreement with 3Par. Kaushik Roy, an analyst at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco, said H.P. overpaid for the deal. “They need something to stop the bleeding,” he said, referring to H.P.’s market share in the computer-storage market. Gina Tyler, a spokeswoman for H.P., declined to comment. John D’Avolio, a spokesman for 3Par, had no further comment. 3Par has struggled to turn a profit because of high research and development spending on chips and other hardware technology, said Mr. Wu. In 3Par’s fiscal year that ended in March, the company spent about 25 percent of sales on research and development. H.P. might accelerate 3Par sales to about $1 billion within a year or two, easing the research and development burden on sales, Mr. Wu said. “The bigger question is whether it can scale larger than that,” he said. “A billion dollars for H.P. isn’t a whole lot.” Hewlett-Packard had almost $15 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of July, according to the company’s financial statements. Dell’s latest bid, which was made privately and disclosed by 3Par, included an increased termination fee of $92 million as well as a multiyear reseller agreement if 3Par accepted a different offer, 3Par said. The company’s board rejected the terms. 3Par gained 80 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $32.88. H.P. rose 47 cents to $39.68. Dell advanced 24 cents to $12.36. H.P. is looking to strengthening its storage products, said Aaron Rakers, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. In addition, the company wanted to show it could complete the deal after the departure of its chief executive, Mark V. Hurd. He left Aug. 6, after a company inquiry found that inaccurate expense reports filed by him or on his behalf had the effect of concealing a personal relationship with a marketing contractor.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/hewlett-packard-raises-3par-bid/?ref=dellinc">Hewlett-Packard Raises 3Par Bid<date>September 2, 2010, 9:15 am</date><text>9:21 a.m. | Updated Hewlett-Packard has raised its offer for data storage company 3Par to $33 a share, up from $30 a share. The move came soon after Dell raised its offer to $32 a share, 3Par said in a statement. 3Par said its board had accepted the H.P. offer as a “superior proposal.” Dell, under the terms of an earlier agreement with 3Par, has three business days to respond. Dell is reevaluating its options, people briefed on the discussions said. The bidding has been quickly escalating since Dell first announced an agreement with 3Par for $18 a share on Aug. 16. Valuations for 3Par, a company that has lost money in its three years as a public company, have long since reached the stratosphere: H.P.’s offer values 3Par at more than nine times annual revenue. Yet clearly both companies can afford to pay more: H.P. has nearly $15 billion in cash available (although it has also committed to a $10 billion stock buyback), while Dell has some $13 billion.

Raises Bid for 3Par Again, Topping Dell<date>Published: August 27, 2010</date><text>Hewlett-Packard raised its bid for 3Par, the data-storage company, to $1.88 billion on Friday, topping Dell’s latest offer by 11 percent. H.P. made its bid, for $30 a share, just hours after Dell matched the $27 bid that H.P. made on Thursday. The latest price is three times what 3Par was trading at before Dell made its first bid last week, for $18 a share, or $1.13 billion. Dell and 3Par said earlier Friday that 3Par’s board had accepted the latest bid from Dell, which has only to match the terms of other offers under its initial agreement with 3Par. Stock in 3Par, which is based in Fremont, Calif., rose $6.43, or 25 percent, to $32.46 on Friday, a price that signaled that investors expected Dell to respond. In a statement, a Dell spokesman, David Frink, said the company would review H.P.’s latest offer and “act in the best interests of our customers, shareholders and long-term value creation.” H.P. and Dell, among the world’s largest personal computer makers, see 3Par as a way to build their “cloud computing” businesses, delivering software, data storage and other services to customers over the Internet. The two rivals are also trying to expand beyond the P.C. business, where profits are shrinking as PC makers compete with lower prices, and the cost of parts has increased. Dell, H.P. and others are taking advantage of the trend by offering cloud computing services on a subscription basis and selling equipment and software to help customers build their own cloud systems. Shares in Dell, which is based in Round Rock, Tex., gained 14 cents, to close at 11.89.

Raises Its Bid for 3Par, Topping Dell Again<date>Published: August 26, 2010</date><text>In a rapidly escalating bidding war, Hewlett-Packard raised its offer for the data storage company 3Par to $1.8 billion after the close of regular trading on Thursday, topping a $1.6 billion bid by Dell that came just hours earlier.Shares of 3Par, considered a crucial strategic asset by both companies as they look to shore up their corporate solutions businesses, jumped 6 percent in after-hours trading. They had fallen 2.7 percent during the regular session on disappointment that Dell’s revised offer, announced on Thursday morning, came in just a sliver above H.P.’s first bid. Hewlett-Packard, which analysts say has the upper hand because of its much larger revenue and cash position, is now offering $27 a share in cash, trumping Dell’s latest of $24.30 a share. Dell’s new offer was just 30 cents a share above H.P.’s opening bid. Some analysts had said that the meager difference suggested Dell might give up if H.P. were to retaliate with a much higher price. H.P. reported $115 billion of annual revenue last year compared with $53 billion at Dell. “Even though Dell has the balance sheet to step up the offer, they’re probably reaching the upper limits of what they can offer,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Rodman &amp; Renshaw. “At the end of the day, Hewlett-Packard is in a better position to close the deal.” On Thursday morning, 3Par accepted Dell’s revised offer and said that the two companies had raised their termination fee to $72 million from $53.5 million. The pursuit of 3Par comes as Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as other large technology vendors like I.B.M. and Cisco Systems, are trying to expand into new products and services. 3Par specializes in high-end data storage, a crucial part of “cloud computing” — an increasingly popular technology that enables computer users to access data and software over the Internet, allowing companies to save costs. The company competes with EMC as well as I.B.M. and other data storage companies, and 3Par’s expertise in the high end has made it attractive. August has been an unusually active month for deals, after Intel’s $7.7 billion bid for McAfee, the maker of security software. On Thursday alone, Cisco announced it would buy the online video software company ExtendMedia, while Hewlett-Packard said it would buy Stratavia, a software company involved in cloud computing. Many analysts say the bidding war has driven up valuations to unreasonable heights. 3Par now trades at around 135 times forward earnings, according to the research firm StarMine’s SmartEstimates forecast, compared with less than 15 times for EMC and other competitors. H.P.’s latest, sharply higher offer appeared to dash speculation that it might decide to back off given increasing concerns about the global economy. The lack of a chief executive after Mark V. Hurd’s sudden resignation may also be a factor. A survey by Reuters of nine fund managers and analysts found that most expected another bid or two, and a final price of about $29 a share. Dell shares closed at $11.75, but dipped to $11.70 after H.P.’s revised offer was announced. H.P. shares were little changed at $38.22.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/technology/personaltech/26askk.html?ref=dellinc">Those Tricky Fingerprint Scanners on a Laptop<date>Published: August 25, 2010</date><text>Q. Do you have any tips on using the fingerprint scanner on my Dell laptop? I either do not press hard enough, long enough or smoothly enough. I have had the reader reinstalled once because it simply was not reading. Is this a common issue? A. Fingerprint readers, which let you replace a typed password with a finger swipe across a sensor, can be finicky if everything isn’t just so. Make note of the brand of the fingerprint reader installed on your laptop, as well as the software used with it. Then make sure you have the latest hardware drivers and software for the reader. The support area of Dell’s Web site (support.dell.com) should have the files you need. Once you are sure your drivers and software are up to date, check to see if the reader is still being picky. If it is, open your fingerprint program, delete your old prints and try “re-enrolling” a new set of prints for the reader to keep on file. Make sure your hands are clean before you swipe your fingers. When scanning your prints, run your finger across the reader at a comfortable angle that you can easily recreate. Even a slight change in angle can later make the reader reject your fingerprint as a failed match. Some readers have problems recognizing prints if the fingers are too dry or too oily. Before you swipe, lightly moistening your fingertip may help. Playing Video On an iPod Q. I just bought a TV show video from the iTunes Store to play on my laptop and iPod, but I keep getting a message that says the video “cannot be played on this iPod.” A. Check your iTunes library to see if you have two versions of the show. If you buy the high-definition version to watch on a computer, you typically get another copy in standard definition that downloads as well. The iPad and iPhone 4 are the only mobile Apple devices that can play HD content from the iTunes Store. If you try to manually transfer the high-definition version of the show to the iPod instead of the standard definition file, you get the error message. (If you automatically synchronize your iPod content, iTunes should transfer the standard-definition version to the iPod.) Some video podcasts in the iTunes Store may not play properly on the iPod. If you have trouble with podcasts, even if they did not come from the iTunes Store, try selecting the file in your iTunes window, going to the Advanced menu and choosing “Create iPod or iPhone Version.” Transfer the converted file to the iPod and see if it plays. TIP OF THE WEEK You don’t need to have an e-reader to read e-books from the major online bookstores like Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. But e-readers like the Kindle and Nook do have an advantage over the glowing screen of a computer, tablet or smartphone: a grayish screen that is easy on the eyes. Most major e-book apps include a setting that lets you change the background of an e-book on your smartphone or tablet from the standard bright white to a more subdued tone. In Amazon’s Kindle app, for example, you can choose among a white, black or sepia background by tapping the View Options icon at the bottom of the screen. Barnes &amp; Noble’s Nook app offers a choice of colors in its own settings area, and Apple’s iBooks app lets you toggle a sepia background off and on. In most apps, this same settings area is also where you can change the point size of the screen text. J. D.

Dump Its 3Par Bid for McAfee?<date>August 25, 2010, 5:31 pm</date><text>Sure, Hewlett-Packard appears to have made an aggressive play by trumping Dell‘s bid for 3Par, a data storage company. Indeed, the bidding war seemed to be heating up even further on Wednesday, with Reuters reporting that Dell was getting ready to come back with a higher bid. But an analyst at the 451 Group, a technology investment research firm, has dismissed H.P.’s move as “fairly defensive” and he wonders why the company did not try to steal McAfee away from Intel instead. The analyst, Brenon Daly, notes that H.P. is “already pretty well covered on the storage side” of the computer business, but that it has “a giant hole in its security portfolio” that McAfee, a security software maker, would fill. Mr. Daly offers this argument why H.P. should pursue McAfee instead of 3Par: All in all, looking to derail Dell’s offer for 3PAR appears to be at odds with much of H.P.’s previous strategy and rationale around storage. And while it pursues that deal (cost what it may), H.P. passes on McAfee, a one-of-a-kind security asset that would instantly make it much more competitive with IBM, EMC and Cisco Systems. If H.P. has sincere aspirations about outfitting the next generation of data centers, we might suggest that it needs to actually own its intellectual property (IP) for security. Of course, there is a little matter of money that separates the two target companies. H.P. is offering about $1.6 billion for 3Par, while Intel has agreed to pay about $7.7 billion for McAfee. But Mr. Daly notes that H.P. has been willing to pay heavily for other things it has wanted, and he asks, “Couldn’t the same rationale be used for McAfee?” Go to Report from the 451 Group »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/technology/24hewlett.html?ref=dellinc">H.P. Trumps Dell’s Bid for 3Par<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Data storage used to be one of the more mundane corners of the technology industry. Now it is where an increasing number of tech companies — and Wall Street — want to be.On Monday, Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest technology company, started a bidding war against its rival Dell for the rights to 3Par, an 11-year-old storage company based in Fremont, Calif. H.P.’s bid of $1.6 billion, or $24 a share, is 33 percent higher than what Dell offered last week, $18 a share. It is also 149 percent higher than where 3Par was trading before the Dell offer. “You see deals go in vogue, and we are clearly seeing that now,” said A. M. Sacconaghi Jr., an analyst with the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Companies need a place to store vast amounts of data: video clips, e-mail, reports and presentations. They also need tools to help them search, shrink, shuffle and otherwise manage it. The makers of those tools, like 3Par, have turned into some of the hottest properties in Silicon Valley. Last year, EMC, the largest storage company worldwide, trumped its main competitor NetApp to buy Data Domain for $2.3 billion. The lofty price was the result of two months of haggling that added $800 million to Data Domain’s value. The deal was the largest purchase of a technology company backed by venture capital last year. Storage companies like 3Par and Data Domain are becoming attractive because they come to the rescue of large corporations at a desperate time. The amount of data stored continues to double about every 18 months, said Deni Connor, the principal analyst at Storage Strategies Now. Keeping track of all that information across hundreds or thousands of computing systems has proved a nightmare, as has working with the data in a speedy fashion. “The amount of storage needed by these companies is getting out of control,” Ms. Connor said. Storage experts foresaw this problem years ago and set to work refining techniques for compressing information, eliminating duplicate files and spreading huge amounts of data across cheap computers in practical ways. Data Domain and 3Par, which both went public in 2007, were part of a wave of storage companies that sought to profit from their mastery of new data manipulation techniques. David Scott, a former H.P. executive and now chief executive at 3Par, spent nine years shepherding 3Par and has ended up as the belle of the ball. The company manages complex data sets across a large corporate network and reduces the number of hardware systems a company must buy. Large companies already buying this technology may find the pitch more attractive with H.P. or Dell’s name behind it. “They buy these companies and then put them through their huge distribution channels,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. “They have really been able to expand sales, and the formula is a reasonably proven one.” With gross margins above 60 percent, 3Par would provide a boost to those of both H.P., at 23 percent, and Dell, at 18 percent. Storage companies tend to create tight links between software and hardware, which allows them to sell bundles rather than a stand-alone product to customers and to innovate at a quick clip, said Garth Gibson, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon University. These trends, along with the importance of data, have helped storage systems outflank computer servers in importance. “The computers are just providing cycles and have become rather inexpensive,” Mr. Gibson said. “Your data, on the other hand, is really the primary asset in an organization.” Dell and H.P. have experience adding storage wares to their arsenal. Dell acquired EqualLogic for $1.4 billion in 2007, and H.P. bought LeftHand Networks, a company with similar storage technology, for $360 million a year later. Dell, in particular, has emphasized the importance of storage as the company tries to rework its business away from mere hardware sales. The hope is that storage software sales will provide Dell with higher profits, while also opening a more meaningful relationship with customers that centers on their information. For its part, H.P. last year hired Dave Donatelli, who worked for 22 years at EMC, as its head of corporate hardware, signaling a desire to expand its storage business. Analysts have pointed to companies like Compellent, CommVault and Isilon Systems as possible beneficiaries of the storage acquisition wave. Shares of all three companies were up more than 10 percent on Monday on the back of H.P.’s bid for 3Par.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/business/24views.html?ref=dellinc">3Par and Hewlett’s Hunger for Acquisitions<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>Hewlett’s HungerFor Acquisitions Mark Hurd turned out to be a man of hearty appetites — including one for deals. Before resigning as Hewlett-Packard’s chief executive this month under a cloud, Mr. Hurd led a mergers and acquisitions tear that included the purchases of 3Com, Palm, and Electronic Data Systems. But any bankers worried that the tech group’s lust for deals might wane after his departure can breathe easier. H.P.’s unsolicited bid for 3Par, announced on Monday, could even be taken as a sign the company’s takeover libido has been given a boost. If that were to prove sustainably the case, though, shareholders might find it troubling. A single $1.6 billion offer by a company with a $90 billion market value is, literally, no big deal. And H.P. says 3Par’s data storage technology fits perfectly into its product portfolio in the arena of cloud computing. Moreover, the tech giant can point to early successes from its 3Com purchase. But 3Par has been on the block for some time. So it’s surprising suddenly to see an unsolicited offer just a week after Dell, H.P.’s archrival, agreed to a friendly deal at the end of a competitive auction. And there’s the question of price. Dell agreed to buy 3Par for $18 a share. To make 3Par think again, H.P. is throwing down $24 a share — more than seven times its target’s sales, and nearly two-and-a-half times what 3Par was worth before it went on sale. H.P.’s delayed reaction also means 3Par must pay Dell $54 million if it wants to go with H.P. instead. Companies often wait to see their competitors’ cards before moving. But H.P.’s comportment in this process is curious. Perhaps unfairly, it leaves the impression that under Mr. Hurd the company was less eager to pay up for 3Par, but that with the penny-pinching boss gone, more spendthrift voices are being heard. That would be a concern for shareholders. And it could explain why muscling in on 3Par, a small and strategically reasonable deal, albeit at a generous price, wiped nearly $2 billion off H.P.’s market cap. A Tax on Mining Nature may abhor a vacuum, but Australia needn’t. The country’s first hung Parliament in 70 years should not frighten investors. The bad news is that a proposed “supertax” on mining, despite its appealing logic, may not survive the political wrangling. Two days after votes were cast, Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s incumbent Labor Party looks likely to emerge three seats short of a majority in the 150-seat lower house. Australia’s benchmark index has barely budged, and the Aussie dollar has risen slightly. The reason? The economy needs little work. Unemployment is probably as low as it can go, and debt is a meager 6 percent of gross domestic product. Ms. Gillard must now woo the stragglers, likely to include one Green lawmaker and three independents. With little to play for in terms of economic policy, the bulk of the horse trading will revolve around secondary issues like broadband access in rural areas, water usage and carbon trading. But the biggest bargaining chip looks to be the proposed mining tax, which would raise an estimated 10.5 billion Australian dollars ($8.94 billion) in two years by applying a levy to mining profits. The opposition National Liberal Coalition is unambiguously against the tax. Labor is in favor, though Ms. Gillard has already watered down the proposal inherited from her ousted predecessor, Kevin Rudd, by cutting the headline rate to 30 percent from 40 percent. Taxing mining profits rather than levying fixed rents on production, as happens now, is a good idea. It would make the good times less good, but the bad times less bad. It would also capture some of the gains that commodity producers have earned as a result of easy money disgorged by governments, which has helped to push up prices. While it is too early to call, the odds of independent candidates, who represent rural areas, backing the tax as it stands look slim. That would be a shame. Mining’s contribution to Australia’s economy is easy to overstate — it generates 6.7 percent of the country’s G.D.P. but accounts for just 3 percent of jobs. Yet measured by gross profit margins, it is by far the country’s most profitable industry. If the tax is dumped, the mine operators — not Australia — will have won.

Scandal has rattled both boardrooms and tarnished the reputations of their chief executives. Yet both companies delivered solid quarterly results on Thursday, easing investors’ concerns. Some analysts warned that boardroom troubles at H.P. and Dell could affect those companies’ performance at a time when competition from the nimble PC companies in Taiwan — Acer and Asustek — was increasing. “When a company stumbles, many of their hardware and software partners try to negotiate deals on better terms, and we are hearing that may be happening with both H.P. and Dell,” said Richard Doherty, research director for the Envisioneering Group, a technology research and consulting company. “Over the next few weeks and months, if trouble at these companies continues, we may see ripples.” Mr. Doherty cautioned that it often took some time for these kinds of situations to play out and that boardroom issues failed to register with consumers. But both suppliers and corporations tend to try and seize on a perceived weakness, he said. H.P. spent the last two weeks answering questions about the abrupt resignation of its chief executive, Mark V. Hurd. The company’s board urged Mr. Hurd to resign after an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint from an H.P. contractor. While H.P.’s board found no evidence of sexual harassment, it concluded that Mr. Hurd’s personal relationship with the contractor, who had acted in racy films, was a conflict of interest and that Mr. Hurd had filed fraudulent expense reports. Supporters in both camps have since engaged in a nasty public spat, leaking details about H.P.’s investigation. At Dell last month, the company paid $100 million to settle charges of accounting fraud leveled by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which examined about five years of the company’s financial results. The S.E.C. accused Dell of misleading investors by playing down how much the company had come to rely on rebates from the chip maker Intel to meet its earnings goals. Michael S. Dell, founder and chief executive at Dell, agreed to pay $4 million as well, while not admitting any wrongdoing. During a subsequent shareholder vote, about 25 percent of the votes cast opposed Mr. Dell’s presence on the company’s board. Historically, shareholders had shown near unanimous support for Mr. Dell. While these issues continue to play out, sales of computing gear to consumers and corporations made by H.P. and Dell have marched along. H.P. reported Thursday that its third-quarter revenue rose 11 percent to $30.7 billion from the $27.6 billion it posted in the same period a year ago. Its net income rose 6 percent, to $1.8 billion, or 75 cents a share. Dell’s second-quarter revenue surged 22 percent to $15.5 billion, from $12.8 billion last year. The company posted a 16 percent rise in net income to $545 million, or 28 cents a share. Executives at both companies have talked about rising corporate demand for new PCs, and their results backed that up. Desktop sales rose 17 percent at Dell, while notebook sales were up 21 percent. H.P.’s computer sales rose 17 percent on a large increase in desktop sales. But both H.P. and Dell can hear the footsteps coming from Taiwan. Acer has introduced an ultra-low-cost business model that centers on selling laptops through retail partners, while Asustek has flooded the market with flashy laptops and game-playing products. Last year, Acer surpassed Dell in PC sales, the first time that a foreign PC maker could boast being the world’s second-largest computing company, behind H.P. And through the first half of this year, Acer has been closing the gap on H.P. for the title of the world’s No. 1 PC seller. For its part, Asustek climbed into the top five in the second quarter, according to the research firm Gartner, with 78.5 percent growth. H.P. executives dismissed concerns the Asian PC makers were outflanking the company. “We feel that we have a very strong, very competitive PC business,” Cathie Lesjak, H.P.’s chief financial officer and interim chief executive, said in a conference call with reporters. Ms. Lesjak noted H.P.’s strong sales to corporations, also a source of strength for Dell. The Asian rivals tend to cater more to consumers. “In general, I would say, bring it on,” Ms. Lesjak said. Dell has tried to counter the Asian onslaught by selling in brick and mortar retail stores and sending more of its manufacturing overseas to lower costs. And, as the largest seller of corporate PCs, Dell hopes to ride a big businesses refresh cycle as the economic recovery gains strength. The entire PC market is in the throes of great change with mobile phone makers and carriers getting into the tablet market. Both H.P. and Dell will have to contend with those upstarts, while trying to establish their own place in the tablet world. Before Mr. Hurd departed, he cleared the acquisition of the smartphone company Palm to give H.P. its own technology for competing in the mobile and hand-held market. Shares of H.P. fell more than 1 percent during Thursday’s trading to $40.76, and then lost about 1 percent more in after-hours trading. Dell’s shares closed on Thursday at $12.04, down more than 1.2 percent, and fell an additional 2 percent in after-hours trading.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/technology/18dell.html?ref=dellinc">Michael Dell Is Chided by Shareholders<date>Published: August 17, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Dell’s shareholders delivered a sharp rebuke of Michael S. Dell, the company’s founder and chief executive, when a fourth of the investors withheld support of Mr. Dell in a recent vote. In a regulatory filing released Tuesday, Dell disclosed that about 378 million of 1.5 billion votes opposed Mr. Dell’s continued presence on the company’s board. Dell held its annual meeting with shareholders earlier in the month. “Mr. Dell is quite properly an iconic figure at the company,” said Joseph A. Grundfest, a Stanford law professor and co-director of the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance. “It is extremely rare to have that amount of shareholder disaffection directed toward an executive who is so central to the company’s past, present and future.” Last month, Dell settled charges of accounting fraud presented by the Securities and Exchange Commission by paying $100 million. Mr. Dell also agreed to pay a $4 million penalty as part of the same inquiry, but did not admit wrongdoing. The S.E.C. accused Dell of misleading investors by not disclosing the full extent that regular payments from the chip maker Intel had come to play in Dell’s overall financial performance. The investigation into Dell’s accounting included e-mails from Mr. Dell and other top executives discussing how the company depended on rebates from Intel to meet Wall Street’s expectations from quarter to quarter. David Frink, a spokesman at Dell, said, “Our board of directors has previously reaffirmed its confidence in Mr. Dell’s leadership and a majority of shareholders agreed.” The protest vote faced by Mr. Dell, who owns 11.7 percent of Dell’s outstanding shares, is unusual, but not unprecedented. In 2008, Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s co-founder and then chief executive, was re-elected to the board but faced a 33.7 percent negative vote. Three months later Mr. Yang announced that he would step down as chief.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/technology/17dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell to Buy Data Storage Company for $1.15 Billion<date>Published: August 16, 2010</date><text>The computer maker Dell Inc., said on Monday Dell that it was the data storage company 3Par for about $1.13 billion cash.

Dell. The filing is the latest twist in a three-year-old lawsuit brought by A.I.T. that accuses Dell of selling at least 11.8 million faulty PCs over three years and then trying to hide problems with the computers from customers. A.I.T., an Internet services company, says it lost business as a result of the broken Dell machines. Dell disputes the accusation. “We disagree with A.I.T.’s contention that we violated the discovery order and will be filing our response with the court soon,” said David Frink, a spokesman at Dell. “We take all court orders and our obligations to comply with them very seriously.” A.I.T. declined to comment. Documents that have already been made public in A.I.T.’s lawsuit show Dell grappling with faulty parts in the PCs and trying to isolate the problems they had caused. But in its filing, A.I.T. asserted that Dell had provided only a snippet of the communications among top executives about the faulty computer problems. In its filing, A.I.T. argued that Dell must have had more high-level communications than a “talking points” memorandum sent to Mr. Dell and Kevin Rollins, then the chief executive, because of the severity of the problem. Some of the company’s largest customers were affected by the problem, and Dell had to take a $300 million charge related to the replacement of the bad computers. Larry E. Daniel, a digital forensics expert, has filed an affidavit in the case, stating that the handful of messages Dell provided appeared altered and incomplete. Mr. Daniel suggested that Dell should provide access to the underlying e-mail files rather than cutting and pasting text. In its most recent filing, A.I.T. has produced communications that showed Dell’s management discussing how to frame the PC problems for investors, the news media and customers. Mr. Dell and Mr. Rollins were informed by the vice president for investor relations, Lynn Tyson, in an August 2005 e-mail that Dell would “continue our reactive posture with the media” about the PC situation. She told the executives that the public would hear that “the problem poses no risk of safety or data loss for our customers,” that “we have been working with our customers to resolve problems in the most effective manner possible” and that “we’re committed to fixing any systems that fail.” But customers with the faulty PCs have complained about data loss when their computers malfunctioned, and computer experts have since said that the electrical problems with the computers presented a limited safety risk. In June, a number of documents in the A.I.T. case were unsealed. They pointed to Dell’s struggles to deal with faulty components that plagued its OptiPlex computers from about 2003 to 2005. Internal Dell communications showed that lower-level employees had known that millions of PCs sold to businesses were likely to malfunction. In addition, Dell employees were encouraged to play down the problems when speaking to customers, according to documents in the lawsuit. Dell told some customers about the problems, fixed their computers and extended its warranties on the systems. Mr. Frink, the Dell spokesman, said the company had replaced 22 percent of the motherboards inside the OptiPlex computers shipping from 2003 to 2005 and added that only a small proportion of the computers had component problems. Still, many customers complained that their computers were breaking at unprecedented rates and that Dell was not doing enough to fix the situation. The companies feared that their businesses could be disrupted at any time because of the machines. For example, even Alston &amp; Bird, the law firm representing Dell in the lawsuit, had to fight for Dell to address 1,000 questionable computers and argued that its business had been put at risk. “The problem was unquestionably the worst we have ever seen in this business,” said John Hess, the president of CompuCycle, a company in Houston that refurbishes computers and dealt with 5,000 faulty Dell machines. “I would suspect this has been part of the decline in Dell’s reputation.” The problems with Dell’s OptiPlex business PCs were part of an industrywide dilemma caused by so-called bulging capacitors. The capacitors cost just a fraction of a penny each and helped control the flow of electricity to various computer components. Bad batches of these capacitors burst at their seams when they overheated, leaking fluid that caused further problems with electronic components. The latest complaint was filed just after Dell’s lawyers urged that the lawsuit’s trial date be delayed to December, from October. Two lawyers with Alston &amp; Bird who represented Dell in the case withdrew this month, saying they had left the law firm.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/disgraced-c-e-o-try-private-equity/?ref=dellinc">Disgraced C.E.O.? Try Private Equity<date>August 12, 2010, 6:14 am</date><text>Mark V. Hurd, forced to resign last week as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, may have a career ahead of him in private equity rather than as head of a publicly held company, analysts and executive recruiters told Bloomberg News. While the scandal that led to Mr. Hurd’s resignation might preclude C.E.O. positions at businesses like Nokia or competitors like Dell, Mr. Hurd probably won’t settle for a smaller company after almost eight years as chief of H.P. and his previous employer NCR, said Steven Kaplan, a professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. A private equity firm — or a company owned by one — may be an acceptable compromise. “There is a market for talented people,” Mr. Kaplan said. “As long as he didn’t do anything beyond what we know now has happened — that he messed up his expenses and it was a one-time mistake, and not fraud or something worse — he will be very attractive to private equity.” Go to Article from Bloomberg News »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/business/media/05adco.html?ref=dellinc">Vice, a Media Company, Shows Big Brands How to Reach the Hip Crowd<date>Published: August 4, 2010</date><text>Vice is happy to be known as a hipster media company. From its headquarters in a former warehouse in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, the company oversees magazines covering youth culture in 23 editions distributed in 26 countries, an online television network and a record label.Vice’s identity — and skill at content creation — is precisely what makes its current partnerships with Dell and Intel both possible and surprising. The deals call for Vice to create sites filled with images, videos and text that evoke a cool-kid image those companies want to connect with, although not necessarily with specific products. It’s an unusual arrangement for a media company. But Shane Smith, a co-founder of Vice, said his pitches to clients usually start simply: “Every company is now a media company.” Getting companies to agree with that sentiment is the easy part, Mr. Smith said, as most are now familiar with the opportunity to get their message out through social media. Much tougher is getting a company to move away from the usual marketing tropes, like 30-second advertisements and online banner ads. That approach is much easier when the target is the so-called millennial generation, those in their late teens to their early 30s, a notoriously tough demographic to reach, and the one that Vice considers to be its core audience. “We have to appreciate that it’s not a passive age group, sitting in front of the TV with ads blaring at them,” said Deborah Conrad, chief marketing officer at Intel, which started talking to Vice a couple of years ago. “We trust that Vice knows their audience.” So last year Intel decided to put its faith in the idea that Vice could produce events and populate a Web site with material that would appeal to that demographic. Intel is not alone in investing in content. In 2009, companies spent $47.2 billion on custom marketing — from magazines to Web sites — according to a survey conducted by the Custom Content Council, an industry group in New York, and ContentWise, a newsletter. “I think a lot of brands are realizing that they have to create content, and when they do it, it works,” said Gene Liebel, a partner in the Brooklyn agency Huge, which is not working with Vice or the two technology companies, though it has worked with Intel previously. The partnership between Intel and Vice includes the creation of a Web site, thecreatorsproject.com, which began in May. Earlier this year, the partnership also began producing events in five cities around the world — New York, London, São Paulo, Seoul and Beijing — that are one part concert, one part art exhibit, one part conference and many parts party, as the doors open in early afternoon and close after midnight. The Intel and Vice logos are present, but subdued. The drinks are free. Still, it’s the Web site, Ms. Conrad said, that’s really the “nerve center” for the partnership. The site says it is meant to “continually identify and celebrate the work of visionary artists.” Each week, it introduces a new short video — often around six minutes long — presenting a profile of one of those artists. Vice decides which artists to consider visionary, and then produces the video. One of them is the musician Alan Palomo, a composer for Neon Indian, a band that relies heavily on electronic sounds made with synthesizers and other technology and who performed at the New York event in late June. In a video on the Creators Project site, Mr. Palomo describes how video games from the 1980s influenced his music and how the band uses projectors at its concerts. And in an interview, he said that he found the Intel connection at the New York event “refreshing,” because it did not seem that the company was selling any product. “It’s like you’re expecting the usual suspects, like a Converse banner,” he said.  The deal with Dell is similar. On motherboard.tv, a site that describes itself as devoted to “sniffing out the smartest, most groundbreaking arbiters and advances of tech-related culture,” Vice oversees the blog posts and videos. Dell’s logo is incorporated into the site’s logo, but the connection is otherwise out of sight. Artists and topics that can connect with a young demographic are valuable assets, said Ian Schafer, chief executive of Deep Focus, an ad agency that has worked with Vice in the past, but is not involved in the Dell or Intel deals. It’s a model, he said, that more media companies may need to consider. “With something as scarce as good and quality content, the price has upward pressure on it,” Mr. Schafer said. “It’s what prevents all of advertising from a race to the bottom.” Neither Vice, Intel nor Dell would discuss the financial terms of their deals. Ms. Conrad and Michael Tatelman, vice president for sales and marketing at Dell, said they knew there was an inherent risk in handing over the content oversight to Vice, whose magazine and Web site have a long history of running occasional nude images. These relationships do not always work out for the best. Last year, Microsoft teamed up with the television show “Family Guy” to promote the Windows 7 operating system. A special commercial-free show was to include references to the Windows 7. But Microsoft executives backed out of the show, reportedly after finding some of the topics distasteful.  “We have values and norms that support our brand,” Mr. Tatelman said. “Vice has been great about staying within those brand tenets.” But at the same time, Ms. Conrad and Mr. Tatelman said the value of working with Vice was the ability to capitalize on the media company’s cachet with the chic crowd. They said that the two sides must find a middle ground that did not tarnish either Vice’s brand or theirs. So far, no interventions have been necessary. And walking that fine line has also allowed the companies to touch the trend-setters, a group usually out of their reach. “It’s so cool, when you think about it for us, to see how people are using technology,” Ms. Conrad said. “You can only get so excited about spreadsheets.”</text></article></page><page index="6"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/business/23dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell to Pay $100 Million to Settle Fraud Case<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Dell, several former executives, and its founder, Michael S. Dell, agreed Thursday to pay more than $100 million in penalties to settle charges of disclosure accounting fraud filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The S.E.C. had accused Dell of misleading investors by using money the company received from the chip maker Intel to pad its quarterly earnings statements. Company executives, according to the S.E.C., relied on the payments from Intel to meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations. Intel paid Dell in the form of rebates as part of an agreement to ensure that Dell would not use computer chips made by Advanced Micro Devices in its personal computers and computer servers, according to the civil charges. Those rebates are the subject of federal and state antitrust inquiries of Intel. When Dell eventually picked A.M.D. as a second supplier, Intel cut the rebates, and Dell’s financial performance suffered, the complaint said. The S.E.C. said in its charges that investors were not aware of the extent of the payments and how they were being used. “Dell manipulated its accounting over an extended period to project financial results that the company wished it had achieved but could not,” said Christopher Conte, associate director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, in a statement announcing the settlement. “Dell was only able to meet Wall Street targets consistently during this period by breaking the rules.” Without the Intel payments, Dell would have missed the consensus estimate for earnings per share published by Wall Street analysts who followed the company in every quarter during its fiscal years from 2002 through 2006. The exclusivity payments constituted a steadily growing part of what Dell reported as its operating earnings, from 10 percent in fiscal 2003 to 38 percent in the fiscal 2006, then jumping to 76 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the S.E.C. said. To settle the S.E.C. charges, which were filed Thursday in Federal District Court here, Dell agreed to pay a $100 million penalty. As is common in S.E.C. settlements, the company did not admit or deny the accusations, and agreed to an order permanently enjoining it from future similar violations. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., announced last month that it had set aside the amount of the penalty for a potential settlement. In 2007, it also had restated its earnings results from 2003, through the first quarter of 2007, to admit manipulating earnings. Mr. Dell, the company’s chairman and chief executive, and Kevin Rollins, the former chief executive, each agreed to pay a $4 million penalty. They did not admit or deny the charges but agreed to an order prohibiting them from violating federal securities laws. Dell’s former chief financial officer, James M. Schneider, agreed to pay a $3 million fine under similar settlement terms, and paid an additional $83,096 in disgorgement and $38,640 in prejudgment interest. Nicholas A. R. Dunning, a former regional vice president for finance, agreed to pay $50,000 in penalties. Leslie L. Jackson, a former assistant controller, agreed to settle charges of improper accounting without admitting or denying guilt and is barred from appearing or practicing before the S.E.C. for three years. The S.E.C. credited the Federal Trade Commission with assistance on the Dell case, a sign that the two agencies shared considerable information about the practices by Intel that are the subject of a pending antitrust lawsuit by the F.T.C. Though that lawsuit is scheduled for trial in September, Intel and the F.T.C. are discussing a settlement, and this week extended the deadline to reach an agreement to Aug. 6. The F.T.C. investigation is one of at least five government antitrust investigations of Intel, including in Europe, Asia and New York State. Intel also was the subject of a private antitrust suit by A.M.D., the Intel competitor that was involved in the case settled on Thursday. In a statement, the presiding director of Dell’s board, Sam Nunn, the former senator from Georgia, said the board “reaffirms its unanimous support for Mr. Dell’s continued leadership.” Mr. Nunn said the settlement “is in the best interest of the company, its customers and its shareholders, as it brings a five-year S.E.C. investigation to closure.” From 2003 through 2007, the payments to Dell from Intel totaled $4.3 billion, the S.E.C. said. Though the payments were said by the two companies to be based on complex pricing assessments, the S.E.C. said detailed schedules drawn up by the companies were “a meaningless exercise” to make the payments appear to be something other than what they were. Although the payments were intended to keep Dell from using computer chips made by A.M.D., according to the S.E.C. charges, in 2003, Dell was in talks with Microsoft, A.M.D. and I.B.M. on a deal that would have had Dell take an ownership interest in A.M.D. During the talks, though, Intel offered to substantially increase its payments to Dell, and Mr. Dell ordered the negotiations with A.M.D. and the other companies to end, the S.E.C. said. Dell frequently sought additional rebates from Intel near the end of the quarter to meet earnings targets, according to the S.E.C. complaint, which also said, “Dell was quite open with Intel about the reasons it was requesting additional money.” When Dell announced in May 2006 that it would use A.M.D. products in its computers, Intel immediately cut its payments by a quarter of a billion dollars, an amount that accounted for three-quarters of the decline in Dell operating profits that period, the S.E.C. said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/07/20/dell-nabs-ocarina-networks/?ref=dellinc">Dell to Aquire Ocarina Networks<date>July 20, 2010, 6:56 am</date><text>From Stephen Lawson at IDG News Service: Dell announced Monday that it planned to acquire Ocarina Networks, a maker of hardware and software aimed at reducing the amount of storage capacity enterprises need, for an undisclosed sum.

The company came up with an unusual reason for the computers’ demise: the school had overtaxed the machines by making them perform difficult math calculations.Dell, however, had actually sent the university, in Austin, desktop PCs riddled with faulty electrical components that were leaking chemicals and causing the malfunctions. Dell sold millions of these computers from 2003 to 2005 to major companies like Wal-Mart and Wells Fargo, institutions like the Mayo Clinic and small businesses. “The funny thing was that every one of them went bad at the same time,” said Greg Barry, the president of PointSolve, a technology services company near Philadelphia that had bought dozens. “It’s unheard-of, but Dell didn’t seem to recognize this as a problem at the time.” Documents recently unsealed in a three-year-old lawsuit against Dell show that the company’s employees were actually aware that the computers were likely to break. Still, the employees tried to play down the problem to customers and allowed customers to rely on trouble-prone machines, putting their businesses at risk. Even the firm defending Dell in the lawsuit was affected when Dell balked at fixing 1,000 suspect computers, according to e-mail messages revealed in the dispute. The documents chronicling the failure of the PCs also help explain the decline of one of America’s most celebrated and admired companies. Perhaps more than any other company, Dell fought to lower the price of computers. Its “Dell model” became synonymous with efficiency, outsourcing and tight inventories, and was taught at the Harvard Business School and other top-notch management schools as a paragon of business smarts and outthinking the competition. “Dell, as a company, was the model everyone focused on 10 years ago,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor of international business administration at Harvard. “But when you combine missing a variety of shifts in the industry with management turmoil, it’s hard not to have the shine come off your reputation.” For the last seven years, the company has been plagued by serious problems, including misreading the desires of its customers, poor customer service, suspect product quality and improper accounting. Dell has tried to put those problems behind it. In 2005, it announced it was taking a $300 million charge related, in part, to fixing and replacing the troubled computers. Dell set aside $100 million this month to handle a potential settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over a five-year-old investigation into its books, which will most likely result in federal accusations of fraud and misconduct against the company’s founder, Michael S. Dell. The problems affecting the Dell computers stemmed from an industrywide encounter with bad capacitors produced by Asian PC component suppliers. Capacitors are found on computer motherboards, playing a crucial role in the flow of current across the hardware. They are not meant to pop and leak fluid, but that is exactly what was happening earlier this decade, causing computers made by Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Apple and others to break. According to company memorandums and other documents recently unsealed in a civil case against Dell in Federal District Court in North Carolina, Dell appears to have suffered from the bad capacitors, made by a company called Nichicon, far more than its rivals. Internal documents show that Dell shipped at least 11.8 million computers from May 2003 to July 2005 that were at risk of failing because of the faulty components. These were Dell’s OptiPlex desktop computers — the company’s mainstream products sold to business and government customers. A study by Dell found that OptiPlex computers affected by the bad capacitors were expected to cause problems up to 97 percent of the time over a three-year period, according to the lawsuit. As complaints mounted, Dell hired a contractor to investigate the situation. According to a Dell filing in the lawsuit, which has not yet gone to trial, the contractor found that 10 times more computers were at risk of failing than Dell had estimated. Making problems worse, Dell replaced faulty motherboards with other faulty motherboards, according to the contractor’s findings. But Dell employees went out of their way to conceal these problems. In one e-mail exchange between Dell customer support employees concerning computers at the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett law firm, a Dell worker states, “We need to avoid all language indicating the boards were bad or had ‘issues’ per our discussion this morning.” In other documents about how to handle questions around the faulty OptiPlex systems, Dell salespeople were told, “Don’t bring this to customer’s attention proactively” and “Emphasize uncertainty.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EED71438F937A15755C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=dellinc">Dell Expects Its Revenue To Rise 14% to 19% in 2011<date>Published: June 24, 2010</date><text>Dell forecast a 14 percent to 19 percent jump in fiscal 2011 revenue as consumer and corporate spending returns. That matched analysts' expectations, but investors were focusing on whether the company can sustain margins. At Dell's annual financial analysts' conference on Thursday, the focus is likely to be about whether the computer company can shore up profitability after gross margins fell short of expectations in its fiscal first quarter. Dell, which has steadily ceded market share to Hewlett-Packard and Acer, has also been squeezed by higher costs for components like memory. ''We believe Dell intends to maintain gross margins in the range of 18 percent, though consistency has proved to be a challenge,'' BMO Capital Markets wrote in a client note. Dell forecasts that its revenue for the 2011 fiscal year will grow 14 percent to 19 percent from the previous year as more customers buy new computers after holding back during the economic downturn. The outlook confirmed a long-awaited recovery in technology spending. Michael S. Dell, the chief executive, said on Wednesday that the company, which has not provided a formal financial outlook since 2006, felt more comfortable providing a forecast now. ''This year we have seen more stability in the business,'' said Mr. Dell, who founded the company in 1984. For now, the company hopes to ride a 2010 corporate upgrade cycle. Dell estimated the percentage of commercial PC users who have updated to Microsoft's Windows 7 as still in single digits. ''We are still very early on.'' Dell's outlook compared to the average analyst forecast for revenue to rise around 16 percent to $61.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. The computer maker also forecast its full-year operating income, excluding special items, would increase by 18 percent to 23 percent from a year earlier.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/technology/11dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell in Talks to Settle Intel Claims With S.E.C.<date>Published: June 10, 2010</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Dell said on Thursday that it was in talks with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve allegations that it and its founder and chief executive, Michael S. Dell, engaged in financial irregularities related to the company’s dealings with Intel. The company said that any settlement would not bar Mr. Dell’s service as an officer and director of a public company, and would be made without admitting or denying the agency’s allegations. The disclosure that the S.E.C. has been investigating aspects of the relationship between the two companies is new, as is its focus on Mr. Dell. A person briefed on the case, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is confidential, said that the S.E.C.’s allegations related to how Dell accounted for payments and rebates that it had received from Intel. The allegations are not criminal. Dell also said that it had set aside $100 million for a possible settlement of these allegations, as well a separate long-standing investigation by the S.E.C. into its accounting practices. That investigation, which began in 2005 and became formal in 2006, has already led to admissions of misconduct by Dell and prompted the computer maker to restate financial results from 2003 to the first quarter of 2007. “We are hopeful that these settlement discussions will achieve a comprehensive resolution in the near future,” Sam Nunn, director of Dell’s board said in a news release and a former United States senator. As to Mr. Dell’s standing with the board’s independent directors. Mr. Nunn said, “He continues to have our complete confidence and support.” The relationship between Dell and Intel had already come under scrutiny in an antitrust lawsuit filed in November by Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, against Intel. In that suit, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, was accused of using rebates and co-marketing arrangements as bribes to persuade Dell and other manufacturers to use its products in computers and servers rather than switching to lower-cost chips from its rival, Advanced Micro Devices. Intel has denied the allegations. Intel declined to comment. Dell declined to comment beyond its news release. A spokesman for the S.E.C., John Nester, also declined to comment. The company said that Mr. Dell’s settlement with the S.E.C. would relate to the “company’s disclosures and alleged omissions” and “would involve alleged violations of negligence-based fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as other nonfraud-based provisions.” Dell also said that it would record a $100 million liability for the settlement of its long-standing accounting problems. As a result, it will reduce its net income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 by the same amount, or 5 cents a share. Dell’s shares dropped about 2 percent in after-hours trading following the company’s disclosure. But analysts said the news of a possible settlement should be seen as positive by investors. Since Dell’s troubles with the S.E.C. began in 2005, the company stock has lost about two-thirds of its value. “We didn’t know much about the S.E.C. investigation,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst with the research firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “I view this as good news. Uncertainty has been taken off the table, and a $100 million fine is nothing for investors.” Dell had nearly $11 billion in cash and short-term investments as of April 30. Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit against Intel revealed e-mail messages between Mr. Dell and Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive of Intel, in which Mr. Dell complained of losing business to rivals using A.M.D. chips. In those conversations, Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $1 billion in the last year and said that was “more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues.” According to the suit, Dell delayed buying chips from A.M.D. and Mr. Otellini later wrote an e-mail message to a colleague describing Dell as “the best friend money can buy.”</text></article><article index="6" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/dell-chief-has-considered-taking-company-private/?ref=dellinc">Dell Chief Has Considered Taking Company Private<date>June 3, 2010, 5:23 pm</date><text>Dell‘s chief executive, Michael S. Dell, said Thursday afternoon that he had considered taking the company he founded private and that the transformation of the computer maker was still incomplete, Reuters reports. In response to a question at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York, Mr. Dell acknowledged that he had thought about making Dell a private company, but he declined to comment when asked what would prompt him to consider that possibility more seriously. A Dell spokesman declined to elaborate to Reuters on Mr. Dell’s plans. According to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, Mr. Dell is the largest single shareholder in his company, with an 11.6 percent stake. More from Reuters: After a period of huge growth that culminated in the company’s claiming the title of world’s biggest personal computer maker, Dell has struggled over the past few years. It has fallen to No. 3 in the global rankings on a unit basis and lost market share to Hewlett-Packard and Acer. Mr. Dell stepped down as chief executive in 2004, but he returned to the post in 2007. The company has been shedding jobs and cutting costs as it focuses on profitability over growth. Dell has been moving to diversify its business away from its core of low-margin PCs and into businesses such as information technology services. PCs still account for roughly half of the company’s revenue. At his remarks at the investor conference, Mr. Dell said the company’s transformation was taking a bit longer than expected and was not yet complete. But he said the I.T. vendor was seeing encouraging signs in the shift of the mix of its businesses. “I think this is a company that can grow its operating income in dollars pretty substantially and that’s our intent,” Mr. Dell said. “If people look at the progress around services,” he said, “and the server business, there’s a whole lot there to like.” Last month, Dell reported quarterly sales and profit that beat expectations, but its gross margin fell short of analysts’ forecasts. Dell made its largest ever acquisition last year, buying technology services provider Perot Systems for $3.9 billion. When asked about the company’s M.&amp;A. plans, Mr. Dell said there was “not necessarily” a high probability that the company would make an acquisition of more than $2 billion, and said the company was focused on smaller deals. Shares of Dell rose 64 cents, or 4.9 percent, to close at $13.76 in Nasdaq trading. They retreated 9 cents in after-hours trading.

It is now also the focus of criticism and troubling questions about a wave of suicides among its workers at a pair of factories here that serve as major suppliers to global brands like Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Sensing a public relations fiasco and facing questions from Foxconn suppliers, Mr. Gou traveled here Wednesday from Taiwan on what company executives said was an emergency trip. As part of a hastily assembled, carefully orchestrated news conference and tour led by Mr. Gou, Foxconn executives defended their labor practices, even as they vowed to do everything possible to prevent more young people from taking their own lives. The company also presented a panel of mental health professionals to discuss the likely causes of suicide in China generally. At least one of the panelists placed the blame on social issues in the country beyond Foxconn’s control. And perhaps in a sign of desperation, the company said it had even begun putting safety nets up on factory buildings to deter suicide attempts. (Not soon enough in at least one case, apparently. Hours after the news conference, another Foxconn employee fell to his death from one of the complex’s buildings, according to the official news agency Xinhua. It was not immediately known whether the death was an accident or suicide.) “We’re reviewing everything,” said Mr. Gou, whose Taiwanese company controls Foxconn Technology, which operates two sprawling factories here with about 420,000 employees. “We will leave no stone unturned and we’ll make sure to find a way to reduce these suicide tendencies,” Mr. Gou said. Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, whose own corporate images are at risk from the suicides, say they, too, are now investigating conditions at Foxconn. Mr. Gou, the 59-year-old founder of Foxconn and its parent company, the Hon Hai Group, sought to calm growing concerns that Foxconn’s labor practices and highly regimented operations were to blame for the rash of suicides on its two Shenzhen campuses this year. The most recent confirmed suicide took place early Tuesday, when a 19-year-old employee fell to his death here. It was the ninth suicide this year at one of Foxconn’s two Shenzhen campuses, police said. Another two workers survived suicide attempts but suffered serious injuries. In an interview Wednesday, Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, said that his company was “saddened and upset” by the suicides and that Apple was determined to ensure that Foxconn workers were treated with respect and dignity. Apple, whose popular iPod is among the products made by Foxconn, has conducted labor audits of the company in the past and sought improvements. But questions about Foxconn’s labor practices have lingered. At a separate news conference late Wednesday, Shenzhen city officials suggested that the company was partly to blame for the accidents, although they offered few details. And several labor rights groups are calling for an independent investigation into the deaths and labor practices at Foxconn. Workers are paid about $32 for a regular 40-hour workweek, which is above minimum wage in the area, and often seek to work large amounts of overtime. “Foxconn’s production line system is designed so well that no worker will rest even one second during work; they make sure you’re always busy for every second,” says Li Qiang, executive director of the China Labor Watch, a New York-based labor rights group. “Foxconn only values the enterprise benefits but totally ignores the social benefits.” Those claims have been bolstered in recent weeks by some of China’s state-run newspapers, which have published a series of sensational reports about the suicides, alongside exposés detailing what they claim are the harsh conditions inside Foxconn factories. Some articles have described the company’s authoritarian management style, the heavy burdens workers face in trying to meet Foxconn production quotas. Others say the company has cramped dormitories that sometimes house 10 to a room. But at Wednesday’s press conference, Foxconn executives extolled Shenzhen campus amenities that they said included modern dormitories, swimming pools and other recreational facilities. The company also said it had regularly passed stringent social audits conducted by Apple and other major customers, although some of those audits have cited labor infractions. And while executives acknowledged a sharp rise in the rate of suicides on the Shenzhen campuses this year, they said there was no single or clear-cut cause. They insisted that personal problems and social ills, like the nation’s rising income gap, were largely to blame for the deaths — not the company’s management style.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/technology/26suicide.html?ref=dellinc">String of Suicides Continues at Electronics Supplier in China<date>Published: May 25, 2010</date><text>SHANGHAI — A 19-year-old employee was found dead Tuesday morning in what appears to have been the ninth suicide this year at a factory in southern China operated by Foxconn Technology, one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturers, according to China’s state-run news media.Foxconn, which produces electronics and computer components for Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other global companies, has been struggling this year to explain a string of suicides among young workers at its huge complexes in the city of Shenzhen, where the company employs about 420,000 workers. A spokesman for Foxconn, a unit of Hon Hai Precision Industry of Taiwan, could not be reached for comment Tuesday, and the Shenzhen police did not return phone calls. But Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said the Shenzhen police had reported that a young man they identified as Li Hai had apparently jumped to his death at 6:20 a.m. Tuesday at Foxconn. Wang Tongxin, vice chairman of the general labor union in Shenzhen, a government-controlled organization, said the Shenzhen police had alerted his organization to the death Tuesday. “We have already sent an investigation team to the factory, and our city government is paying a lot of attention to this,” Mr. Wang said by telephone. Nine Foxconn employees have committed suicide since late January in Shenzhen, according to the police, and two others attempted suicide but survived with serious injuries. While the suicide rate at Foxconn is still below estimates of the national rate of about 14 per 100,000 people in China, according to the World Health Organization, Foxconn executives say the figures are significantly higher than in previous years. Sociologists say some of the Foxconn suicides may be copycat attempts committed by distraught youths who had learned of the earlier suicide attempts. Copycat suicides and so-called suicide clusters are common in most parts of the world, particularly in Asia, and health experts believe that news media reporting on suicides sometimes leads to such a contagion. Some labor rights groups have accused Foxconn of operating military-style factories and abusing workers. They also have called some of the deaths suspicious and have asked for an independent investigation. On Tuesday, labor rights advocates staged a protest outside one of Foxconn’s campuses in Shenzhen, demanding that the company improve its management and labor conditions and pay higher wages to workers. “From our recent research outside a Foxconn’s facility in Shenzhen, most of the workers agree that they feel stress in the production lines,” one of the labor groups, Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, said in a statement late Tuesday. “They are not allowed to talk to each other when working. Even in the same production line, workers do not have chance to get to know their colleagues.” Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn and its parent company, Hon Hai Precision Industry, told the China News Service on Monday that Foxconn was not a sweatshop and that the company was doing everything it could to prevent more suicides. Company executives say Foxconn is planning to hire psychiatrists, counselors and monks, and intends to bring in 2,000 singers, dancers and gym trainers to improve life on its two sprawling campuses in Shenzhen. China’s state-run news media also reported Tuesday that Foxconn was building tall fences at its dormitories to prevent workers from jumping to their deaths.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/technology/21dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Posts a 52% Increase in Profit, but Still Awaits a Wave of Corporate PC Buying<date>Published: May 20, 2010</date><text>Dell presented Wall Street with tidy first-quarter results on Thursday, but the numbers lacked some of the luster presented by other technology bellwethers in recent weeks.Like the others, Dell has depended on improving demand for computing equipment to climb out of the recession. Its first-quarter results showed rising sales across its major product lines and a much higher profit than at the same time last year. Dell, however, continues to rely on large companies to buy new PCs, more than do other PC makers, and large companies still seem content with their old machines. “Until corporate spending really comes back, Dell will remain in the penalty box,” said Ashok Kumar, a technology analyst with Rodman &amp; Renshaw. This familiar refrain has haunted Michael S. Dell, the company’s founder, since he returned more than three years ago as chief executive in a bid to turn Dell into a more diverse company. In its first quarter, Dell based in Round Rock, Tex., posted a profit of $441 million, or 22 cents a share, a 52 percent rise from the same period last year. The hardware maker’s revenue increased 21 percent, to $14.87 billion from $12.34 billion. Excluding charges, Dell earned 30 cents a share. Both the sales and earnings figures eclipsed the forecasts of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, who had predicted earnings, excluding charges, of 27 cents and revenue of $14.27 billion. Sales in most of Dell’s businesses surged when compared with the same quarter last year. Desktop PC sales, for example, rose 13 percent, while laptop sales rose 18 percent. Dell’s data center equipment business did particularly well with computer server and switch sales jumping 39 percent. “We had a solid first quarter,” said Brian T. Gladden, the chief financial officer at Dell, in a telephone interview. “Demand has picked up, especially with our commercial customers.” But the $14.87 billion in revenue remained well off the $16.07 billion in first-quarter revenue that Dell had reported two years ago before the recession hit hard. Other companies tied to the PC industry, like Microsoft and Intel, have recently posted record all-time sales figures, and Dell’s rival Hewlett-Packard also just reported results well above prerecession levels. Analysts also noted that Dell’s profit margins fell from last year, and company executives said that higher component prices hurt it during the quarter. During a down day for the market, shares of Dell fell 4.4 percent during regular trading on Thursday to $14.32, and dropped another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $13.93. Dell traded at $23.50 a share when Mr. Dell took back the chief executive position in early 2007. According to Mr. Kumar, Dell has benefited from rising interest in the sales of things like servers, switches and storage systems to corporate customers but needs the PC refresh cycle to begin in earnest for Dell to post banner figures. Dell boomed during the years in which companies refreshed their computers at a regular pace to keep up with faster chips and quickly evolving hardware. These days, though, many large organizations view the PC and its complementary software as static. Their updates of equipment have little to do with the latest release of Windows or a similar product. “We used to churn our PCs every three years, but now we are out to four,” said Gerry McCartney, the chief information officer at Purdue University. “Frankly, the hardware isn’t changing as rapidly in performance as it was 10 years go.” In addition, Dell was caught off guard by the rising interest in preconfigured laptops. Such machines could be made more cheaply at factories in China than at Dell’s factories, which specialized in customizing PCs on the fly. Hewlett-Packard, Acer, Asustek and others took advantage of the Chinese factories, and Dell has since been playing catch-up by shifting more of its business to contract manufacturers. Mr. Dell has methodically been shifting Dell’s focus away from corporate PCs by increasing the company’s presence in retail outlets, buying storage and software companies and getting back into the mobile device market with phones and forthcoming tablet computers. Dell’s biggest diversity move came last year when it spent $3.9 billion to acquire Perot Systems, a services company. Dell’s services revenue rose 32 percent to $2.79 billion, while its product revenue rose 18 percent to $12.09 billion, during the quarter. Analysts have long said that Dell should benefit far more than most technology companies when companies finally start upgrading their four- and five-year-old computers. Mr. Gladden said that less than 5 percent of the commercial customers surveyed by Dell have upgraded to Microsoft’s Windows 7 operating system, which is thought to be the major PC refresh catalyst. “I think it is still very early,” Mr. Gladden said. “There are a lot of good signs, and we are beginning to see the first stages of that refresh process.”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/technology/companies/02dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Is in Talks With S.E.C.

The former Dell employees had received Wells notices, which indicate that staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission had made a preliminary decision to recommend that the agency begin a civil or administrative action against them, Dell said in a regulatory filing. Dell said the notices were related to a previously reported S.E.C. inquiry, started in August 2005, into the accounting and financial reporting.

The company said profit was hurt by rising costs for computer parts, including memory chips, adding that a greater portion of its revenue came from consumer sales, which are less profitable than corporate sales. Despite the drop in earnings, revenue rose 11 percent as consumers snapped up low-cost laptops and businesses increased spending on servers and networking equipment. The greatest growth came from services, which surged 51 percent. Brian T. Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that the company saw “signs of life around the world” and was “cautiously optimistic” that demand would continue to rise this year as companies began to replace outdated technology  expenditures that many companies had postponed because of the recession. About 80 percent of Dell’s revenue comes from sales to businesses and government, rather than consumers. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., is hoping it will benefit significantly as spending picks up, but the company has lost market share in the past year to Hewlett-Packard and Acer. Rather than lowering prices to draw more customers, Dell has tried to improve its profit on each product, but its gross margin  the amount of money the company earns for each dollar in revenue  continues to dwindle. The margin was 17.4 percent in the fourth quarter, down from 18.2 percent the year before. Analysts greeted the company’s results with caution. Many were pleased with the increase in revenue, but others remained concerned about the gross margin, which had been expected to come in at 18 percent. “The controversy around Dell has largely been around execution  balancing revenue growth and profitability,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “Investors are looking for some signs that the market for computers is rebounding and that Dell will participate.” Dell’s net income dropped to $334 million, or 17 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Jan. 29, from $351 million, or 18 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, earnings fell to 28 cents a share from 29 cents a year earlier, slightly better than Wall Street analysts had expected. Revenue grew to $14.9 billion in the quarter from $13.4 billion a year earlier, as sales of mobile computers and servers picked up. Once revered for the agility of its tailor-made computer business, Dell has fallen to third place among computer makers, behind No. 1 Hewlett-Packard and Acer. The company’s executives have recognized the shortcomings of its direct-sales model, which made Dell susceptible to steep losses as the economy worsened. Hewlett-Packard reported a 25 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, as businesses bought more servers and as sales of personal computers grew strongly after the recent debut of a new Windows operating system. While its competitors have sold more desktop computers, Dell’s desktop sales actually fell in the fourth quarter. And Hewlett-Packard reported a 25 percent increase in notebook sales in its most recent quarter, outpacing the 16 percent increase at Dell. Dell continued a major cost-cutting effort to rid its manufacturing process of inefficiencies. It has closed manufacturing plants, hired contract manufacturers to build laptops and laid off a large number of workers. The company said it had 72,000 employees at the end of the fourth quarter, excluding employees at Perot Systems, a technology services company that it recently bought, down from about 79,000 people in the same period a year earlier.

The $7.4 billion deal, which gives Oracle a vast hardware business for the first time, pits it against Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M., Dell and Cisco Systems, all of which have made a flurry of acquisitions and alliances. Many of these moves broadened the companies' products and services from their traditional specialties, like databases, computers or networking equipment. Each company wants to be able to claim to prospective customers that it, and it alone, has more of the parts to be an end-to-end service provider. ''The cost isn't in buying the pieces,'' Lawrence J. Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. ''The cost is in the labor of assembling them and making them work.'' On Wednesday, Oracle will hold an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters where executives from the company will talk in detail about the plans for Sun Microsystems. Mr. Ellison said that in the next few months, Oracle planned to lay off fewer than 2,000 people, while hiring more than 2,000 people in engineering, sales and other roles. He did not rule out that additional layoffs might occur later. Mr. Ellison added that he expected Sun's chief executive, Jonathan I. Schwartz, to resign and that he hoped that Scott G. McNealy, Sun's co-founder and chairman, would stay on at Oracle, although his title and duties were not clear. ''We need to have more conversations about his role,'' Mr. Ellison said. Oracle's purchase of Sun, which European regulators approved last week after months of scrutiny, stands out as the most game-changing corporate technology play made during the economic downturn, according to industry analysts. ''It's the most significant deal of the decade,'' said Dan Olds, an analyst with Gabriel Consulting. ''Oracle has a shot here to change the rules of the industry and usher in a new era.'' As analysts like Mr. Olds point out, the era is new only in relative terms. The corporate computing market began decades ago with I.B.M. selling customers systems that included most of the hardware and software they would need in a single package. As time went on, a host of minicomputer makers rose to prominence with a similar strategy, in which they would build all of the crucial pieces of a large system, including its chips, main software and networking technology. The older model of selling corporate systems was then disrupted by the rise of powerful, more standardized computers based on readily available chips from Intel and an innovative software market. Customers could suddenly choose the technology they preferred from a variety of suppliers and assemble those products in their own data centers. Prices of hardware and software declined under this competitive pressure. Oracle, for one, wants to revert to the more traditional model. The company plans to offer customers databases, business software, servers, storage systems and networking equipment from one place. In addition, Oracle will do the hard engineering work to make sure all this technology works well together, Mr. Ellison said. ''It is odd that the computer industry ships all these separate parts and expects customers to assemble them,'' Mr. Ellison said. ''You will now be buying this complete system, and don't have to hire I.B.M. or someone else to assemble it for you.'' While Oracle has long battled I.B.M. in the database market, its push into computer hardware places the company in direct competition with longtime partners like H.P. and Dell. Last year, Cisco Systems branched out from its roots as the world's largest networking company and began selling computer servers -- a move that pitted it against H.P., Dell and I.B.M. Cisco also formed a sales partnership with EMC and its software subsidiary VMware that further fanned competition. Traditionally, Cisco had teamed with H.P., Dell and I.B.M. in large data center deals.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/ex-perot-employee-returning-86-million/?ref=dellinc">Ex-Perot Employee Returning $8.6 Million<date>January 6, 2010, 6:41 am</date><text>A former employee of a Perot Systems affiliate who had been charged with insider trading has agreed to return about $8.6 million in illicit profits, federal regulators said Tuesday. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement with Reza Saleh to partly resolve allegations of insider trading in connection with Dell‘s $3.9 billion offer last September to buy Perot Systems, the technology services company founded by the former presidential candidate Ross Perot Sr. That acquisition, part of Dell’s bid to expand beyond the personal computer business, was completed in November. Mr. Saleh neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement, but did agree to refrain from future violations of the securities laws and not to work for any investment adviser firm. The S.E.C. said it also planned to ask the federal court in Dallas, which must approve the settlement, to impose a civil fine against Mr. Saleh and to appoint a third party to work out a distribution plan for the $8.6 million that Mr. Saleh has agreed to return to Perot’s shareholders. Mr. Saleh’s attorney didn’t immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. Mr. Saleh worked for Parkcentral Capital Management, Ross Perot’s Texas-based investment firm, and for Perot Investments, which managed Mr. Ross’ personal financial affairs, and sometimes attended Perot Systems planning meetings, according to the S.E.C.’s civil lawsuit filed in September. The agency alleged that Mr. Saleh learned nonpublic information about the Dell offer on Sept. 4 through his work. It said Mr. Saleh made “extremely large” purchases of call options for Perot Systems stock between Sept. 4 and Sept. 18, and then sold all of the 9,332 call options on Monday after Perot Systems’ stock soared on the official merger announcement. As a result, Mr. Saleh reaped an $8.6 million profit, the S.E.C. said.

''There are also some industrywide constraints on some components (like memory and larger-capacity hard drives) that are delaying the manufacturing of certain products for customers.''

And each December, he comes to New York, hosts a dinner and delivers a set of forecasts for the coming year. Kimberly White/Reuters Mark Anderson The dinner was at the Waldorf-Astoria on Thursday night, but I caught up with Mr. Anderson earlier for a preview of his after-dinner performance. One of his predictions, in particular, caught my attention. “Except for gaming, it is ‘game over’ for Microsoft in the consumer market,” he said. “It’s time to declare Microsoft a loser in phones. Just get out of Dodge.” Regardless of Microsoft’s performance, amid the rise of Apple‘s iPhone and phones using Google‘s Android software, it seems unlikely Microsoft will heed Mr. Anderson’s advice. The smartphone is becoming the innovative hub of software development and applications, far more so than the personal computer. If Microsoft loses in smartphones, Mr. Anderson noted, “It is pretty grim. Those applications are going to move upstream.” The underlying problem, Mr. Anderson said, is cultural. “Phones are consumer items, and Microsoft doesn’t have consumer DNA,” he said. “Walk the halls at Microsoft and you can see it is not a place that gets consumers,” Mr. Anderson said. “Just as if you walk the halls at Google, it’s obvious it is not a place that gets the enterprise world.” Unlike many, Mr. Anderson does not see cloud computing as a unifying force that would make consumer and business technology increasingly similar. “The computer world is splitting apart, into two separate continents, consumer and enterprise,” he said. In the consumer camp are Apple, Google and most of the Asian hardware makers, Mr. Anderson said. In the enterprise camp (large companies and government agencies) will reside I.B.M., Dell, Cisco and Microsoft.

While the Mini is available in any color as long as it's white, Zino has a selection of 10 replaceable, colorful lids you can purchase if you change the curtains or the sofa or just get bored with pink. The Zino will arrive in a few configurations, starting at about $230 running Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system. The processors in all models will be supplied by A.M.D. -- not your everyday Intel Atom (which is a good thing) -- and will be able to accommodate an optical multidrive as well as a Blu-ray disc player. The higher-priced model (preconfigured at $650, including a 20-inch monitor) also gets an HDMI output, a 500-gigabyte hard drive and Windows 7 Home Premium. The Apple Mini, meanwhile, starts at $600 and was recently updated with slightly faster processors and more memory.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Ed Lallo/Bloomberg News Michael S. Dell is trying to transform Dell from a direct seller of PCs into an organization that sells services to business customers. Related Times Topics: Dell Inc. The latest batch of disappointing financial results from Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., arrived on Thursday. The company reported a 54 percent drop in net income during its third quarter and a 15 percent decline in revenue. The company was optimistic, however. “We are seeing improvement in underlying demand trends in a number of areas,” said Brian T. Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer, during a conference call. Mr. Gladden said that companies had started buying more equipment and that Dell expected consumers to increase purchases during the holidays. Dell could be poised to capitalize on a resurgence in technology spending, said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. More than any other major computer company, Dell depends on sales to businesses rather than consumers and has typically benefited the most from surges in corporate spending coming after downturns. The big question this time is whether Dell has done enough, fast enough, to profit as much as competitors during an era that appears less favorable to the company’s historical strengths. “I think we are satisfied with what we have done on the cost side,” Mr. Gladden said, adding that the company had made progress shifting toward higher-margin businesses as well. But many investors focused more on the disappointing results than on the optimistic outlook. Dell reported net income of $337 million, or 17 cents a share, in the quarter that ended on Oct. 30, down from $727 million, or 37 cents a share, it earned in the same period last year. Excluding charges, Dell earned 23 cents a share in the quarter, missing the forecast of 28 cents a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Dell’s revenue fell to $12.9 billion from $15.16 billion, while analysts looked for the company to report revenue of $13.18 billion. Dell’s shares tumbled more than 6 percent to $14.87 in after-hours trading, after closing down about 1 percent at $15.87 on Thursday. Since Michael S. Dell, the founder of the company, returned as chief executive in 2007, Dell has been trying to redefine its strategy. The company that once championed direct sales of computers to businesses has been replaced by an organization seeking to sell more services to business customers. In addition, Dell has focused more on selling products to consumers at retail stores and on disposing of its own factories in favor of doing business with contract manufacturers. The global economic slump makes it difficult to judge how effective Dell has been at shifting its strategy, according to analysts. “The story has been muddied by the economic downturn,” said Mr. Sacconaghi. “I think the jury is still out.” In previous public remarks, Mr. Dell has acknowledged that the company took too long to shift away from its sole dependence on the direct sales model that turned Dell into one of the great business stories of its time. The extent of Dell’s long-term structural problems came to light this month in an unusual manner. New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, filed an antitrust lawsuit against Intel that contained numerous internal e-mail messages and exchanges between Dell and Intel executives. The messages depict a Dell that as far back as 2005 had privately lost faith in the vaunted Dell business model, though publicly proclaiming that it continued to be the exemplar described in business school case studies. Far from trumping rivals through its efficiency and unique operations, Dell had started to depend more and more on product rebates from Intel to meet its quarterly financial figures and produce higher profits than rivals, according to the lawsuit. The New York lawsuit alleged that Dell’s rebates were so high because it remained loyal to Intel, rather than buying products from the rival chip supplier Advanced Micro Devices. “If you extract those monster payments, they suddenly don’t look so profitable,” said Roger L. Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies, a consultancy for technology companies. Dell made the decision to stick with Intel alone despite customer requests for A.M.D.’s products. “We are losing the hearts, minds and wallets of our best customers,” Mr. Dell complained in an e-mail message to Intel’s chief executive Paul S. Otellini, according to the lawsuit. Today, Dell sells fewer PCs than Hewlett-Packard and Acer. Dell also finds itself well behind Hewlett-Packard in the services market and in the bid to fine-tune its PC manufacturing operations. While H.P. was shifting production of PCs and other products to contract manufacturers long ago, Dell was still building factories, including a plant in North Carolina that opened in 2005. In its most recent quarter, Dell reported a charge of $123 million that included costs tied to closing that factory this year.

The company announced last week that it would begin selling its first handset -- the Mini 3 -- in China through China Mobile by late November. It will go on sale in Brazil through the wireless carrier Claro (part of the América Móvil network) by year's end. The touch-screen phone, which does not have a physical keyboard, will run on the Android operating system from Google. Though the company is largely keeping silent on pricing and specifications, Dell has been boasting that the Mini 3 will have a 3.5-inch high-definition screen and high-quality internal speakers. No word yet on if or when the Mini 3 will be offered elsewhere, but Dell does hold agreements with Vodafone in Europe, Maxis in Malaysia and AT&amp;T and Verizon in the United States, among others. With the smartphone marketplace increasingly resembling a rugby scrum (the Verizon Droid versus the BlackBerry Storm versus the Palm Pre versus the HTC MyTouch versus the AppleiPhone), Dell understandably may choose to sit on the sidelines and see how things shake out.

Skip to next paragraph Gerard Cerles/A.F.P. — Getty Images P. Nikiforos Diamandouros has been the European Union's ombudsman since 2003. Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History The ombudsman, P. Nikiforos Diamandouros, said investigators for the European Commission failed to record in their official minutes a meeting they held in August 2006 with a senior executive for Dell, the computer maker, even though the meeting focused on the central allegations in the case. “This constituted maladministration,” he said. But Mr. Diamandouros said the oversight did not prevent Intel from mounting its defense. After a nine-year investigation, the commission ruled in May that Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, had used improper rebates and incentives to persuade computer makers to use its processors over those of Advanced Micro Devices. The commission, in a statement, said it “does not agree with the ombudsman’s position that a formal, agreed minute should have been prepared.” It added that its practices were in accordance with European legal principles and rules of procedure. A lawyer for Intel, Ian S. Forrester, said the ombudsman’s finding called into question the unchecked nature of the commission’s investigative powers and would bolster Intel’s efforts to overturn the ruling at the European Court of First Instance. “The issue raises the broader question of whether the current procedures used by the European Commission to determine facts are adequate,” said Mr. Forrester, a partner at the law firm White &amp; Case in Brussels. “The commission’s information-gathering process is in question. The European Commission has the only competition authority where the investigative team is the same one that drafts the decision.” Stephen Kinsella, a partner at Sidley Austin in Brussels, who is not representing either side in the case, said the ombudsman stopped short of ruling that Intel’s rights of defense had been infringed, limiting the finding’s effect in the appeal. He said a critical factor would be the nature of the statements made by the unidentified Dell executive  which the commission has not made public. “If it were possible to adduce evidence of what was said in that meeting and if it were seriously exculpatory, then I don’t doubt the court would take account of it,” Mr. Kinsella said. “But even then it would only be one piece of evidence among so many.” A person with knowledge of Intel’s legal strategy said the Dell executive was responsible for the computer maker’s account with Intel. According to this person, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, the executive refuted a main allegation in the case  that Intel had paid Dell, via preferential rebates, to favor its chips over A.M.D.’s. Prosecutorial errors have led the appeals court to overturn commission decisions in several prominent cases. In 2002, the court criticized the commission’s investigative work in overturning its decision to block the merger of two British travel operators, Airtours and First Choice. The same year, the court cited investigative errors in overturning the decision to block the merger of Schneider Electric and Legrand.

The computer maker, based in Round Rock, Tex., said its first phone, the Mini 3, would run on Google's Android operating system and be sold in China later this month and in Brazil by the end of the year. By beginning in emerging markets instead of the United States, Dell will not face the challenge of trying to displace established smartphone makers like Apple, and Research in Motion. ''Our entry into the smartphone category is a logical extension of Dell's consumer product evolution over the past two years,'' said Ronald G. Garriques, president of Dell's global consumer group, in a statement. ''We are developing smaller and smarter mobile products that enable our customers to take their Internet experience out of the home and do the things they want to do whenever and wherever they want.'' Dell declined to release specifications for the handset, but in a few photos provided by the company, it appeared that the phones were thin touch-screen models without physical keyboards. Dell's partner in China, China Mobile, is the largest mobile phone company in the world, with half a billion customers. In Brazil, the phone will be sold through Claro, which is part of América Móvil, a wireless holding company controlled by Carlos Slim Helú, the Mexican financier.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/05/technology/companies/05chip.html?ref=dellinc">State Accuses Intel in an Antitrust Suit<date>Published: November 4, 2009</date><text>In 2005, Michael S. Dell’s namesake company was getting pounded. His competitors were selling personal computers and servers built on cheap, popular and powerful chips from Advanced Micro Devices, while Mr. Dell had stuck loyally with slower chips from Intel. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Interactive Feature Intel's Antitrust History Related Times Topics: Intel Corporation Complaint (N.Y. v. Intel Corp.) (pdf) In an e-mail note to Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, Mr. Dell threatened to switch to A.M.D. “I am tired of losing business,” Mr. Dell wrote. “We are losing the hearts, minds and wallets of our best customers.” Mr. Otellini reminded Mr. Dell that Intel had paid Dell more than $1 billion in the last year. “This was judged by your team to be more than sufficient to compensate for the competitive issues,” he wrote. Dell delayed buying A.M.D. chips, and Mr. Otellini said in a later e-mail message to a colleague that Dell was “the best friend money can buy.” Such payments to PC makers, along with other aggressive business tactics, are at the heart of the antirust lawsuit filed against Intel on Wednesday by New York’s attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo’s case  the first antitrust charges against the company in the United States in more than a decade  follows similar actions by regulators in Europe and Asia. According to Mr. Cuomo’s lawsuit, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, has for years used large rebates and co-marketing arrangements to talk Dell and other manufacturers into sticking with its products rather than increasing their business with A.M.D., a much smaller chip maker. As the supplier of about 80 percent of the central chips that power PCs and servers, Intel had monopoly power, which it abused, according to Mr. Cuomo. “Intel has used illegal threats, coercion, fines and bullying to preserve its stranglehold on the market,” he said at a news conference Wednesday. “We intend to stop them.” An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said the company had done nothing wrong. “Neither consumers, who have consistently benefited from lower prices and increased innovation, nor justice are being served by the decision to file a case now,” he said. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., is no stranger to antitrust controversy. The company has spent the last five years defending itself against antitrust allegations, first in Asia and then in Europe. In May, the European Commission hit Intel with a record $1.45 billion fine for antitrust violations, which the company is appealing. Intel also faces a four-year-old antitrust lawsuit filed by A.M.D. in Federal District Court in Delaware and a continuing investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Although Intel has faced various antitrust claims for two decades, the cases against it have picked up steam in recent years because of developments in the chip industry. In 2003, A.M.D., Intel’s longtime nemesis, began selling a new line of chips widely regarded as superior in design and performance to Intel’s products. The chips were good enough to lift A.M.D. from the PC market into the higher-profit server computer market for the first time and begin selling to Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. It took Intel about four years to come up with chips that matched or surpassed A.M.D.’s products in performance. While A.M.D. did well both in sales and market share gains during that period, the company’s top executives have long argued that it could have sold far more products had Intel not used strong-arm tactics to blunt its advantage. The lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Cuomo in the Delaware court, stretches beyond the interests of A.M.D., which is building a $4.2 billion plant in Saratoga County in upstate New York through a spinoff company, GlobalFoundries. Mr. Cuomo argues that Intel’s behavior curtailed innovation in the industry and forced consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for computers. Under federal antitrust law, states have the power to bring charges independently of the federal government. The F.T.C. and other states may file similar cases, much as in the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft a decade ago. The major complaints surrounding Intel concern its use of rebates and marketing dollars to keep customers. The New York suit argues that Intel executives threatened to take away such incentives from customers if they did more business with A.M.D. In addition, the lawsuit contends that if businesses were close to buying A.M.D.-based computers from a company like H.P. or Dell, Intel would jump in to help the computer makers sell Intel-based machines at a large discount. Over all, the hardware makers often became dependent on Intel’s incentives to keep their computer businesses profitable, making them reluctant to make a meaningful shift to A.M.D., the lawsuit said. Communications cited in the lawsuit show that Dell executives turned to Intel for payments to help them meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly financial results. When Dell finally decided to make products with A.M.D. chips, Intel reduced its chip rebates for the company by $600 million, according to the suit. The suit also contends that Intel paid I.B.M. to halt the production of a server based on A.M.D.’s chips. Rebate payments and other incentives provided to customers fall into a murky area of the law, according to antitrust scholars. Intel’s critics must show that it went beyond the typical actions that one would expect from a company trying to protect its business. “A lot of what they are talking about here sounds nefarious, but others would look at it and say that is how markets work,” said John E. Lopatka, a professor and antitrust expert at Pennsylvania State University’s Dickinson School of Law. Harry First, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said Delaware was an odd venue for Mr. Cuomo to pick for the lawsuit against Intel. “I assume they filed there because A.M.D.’s litigation against Intel is pending there,” he said. Piggybacking on A.M.D.’s lawsuit could make sense since most of the current cases against Intel share much of the same evidence. More than 200 million pages of documents have been exchanged between the parties in A.M.D.’s case against Intel. Antitrust experts following Mr. Cuomo’s actions said that both A.M.D. and I.B.M.  which is based in Armonk, N.Y., and competes against Intel in the server chip market  have invested billions of dollars in chip manufacturing plants in New York. Keith N. Hylton, a professor at the Boston University School of Law, said that Mr. Cuomo could benefit politically by taking such a prominent stand on behalf of local workers and consumers. “An attorney general is understood to be an aspiring governor,” he said. “They are politicians, and they want to be on the gravy train for big cases.” During the news conference, Mr. Cuomo said that thwarting Intel’s abusive actions was important to consumers and businesses worldwide. “It is not just about New York,” he said.

The chips were good enough to lift A.M.D. from the PC market into the higher-profit server computer market for the first time and begin selling to Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems. It took Intel about four years to come up with chips that matched or surpassed A.M.D.’s products in performance. While A.M.D. did well both in sales and market share gains during that period, the company’s top executives have long argued that it could have sold far more products had Intel not used strong-arm tactics to blunt its advantage. The lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Cuomo in the Delaware court, stretches beyond the interests of A.M.D., which is building a $4.2 billion plant in Saratoga County in upstate New York through a spinoff company, GlobalFoundries. Mr. Cuomo argues that Intel’s behavior curtailed innovation in the industry and forced consumers and businesses to pay higher prices for computers. Under federal antitrust law, states have the power to bring charges independently of the federal government. The F.T.C. and other states may file similar cases, much as in the government’s antitrust case against Microsoft a decade ago. The major complaints surrounding Intel concern its use of rebates and marketing dollars to keep customers. The New York suit argues that Intel executives threatened to take away such incentives from customers if they did more business with A.M.D. In addition, the lawsuit contends that if businesses were close to buying A.M.D.-based computers from a company like H.P. or Dell, Intel would jump in to help the computer makers sell Intel-based machines at a large discount. Over all, the hardware makers often became dependent on Intel’s incentives to keep their computer businesses profitable, making them reluctant to make a meaningful shift to A.M.D., the lawsuit said. Communications cited in the lawsuit show that Dell executives turned to Intel for payments to help them meet or surpass Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly financial results. When Dell finally decided to make products with A.M.D. chips, Intel reduced its chip rebates for the company by $600 million, according to the suit. The suit also contends that Intel paid I.B.M. to halt the production of a server based on A.M.D.’s chips. Rebate payments and other incentives provided to customers fall into a murky area of the law, according to antitrust scholars. Intel’s critics must show that it went beyond the typical actions that one would expect from a company trying to protect its business. “A lot of what they are talking about here sounds nefarious, but others would look at it and say that is how markets work,” said John E. Lopatka, a professor and antitrust expert at Pennsylvania State University’s Dickinson School of Law. Harry First, a professor at New York University’s School of Law, said Delaware was an odd venue for Mr. Cuomo to pick for the lawsuit against Intel. “I assume they filed there because A.M.D.’s litigation against Intel is pending there,” he said. Piggybacking on A.M.D.’s lawsuit could make sense since most of the current cases against Intel share much of the same evidence. More than 200 million pages of documents have been exchanged between the parties in A.M.D.’s case against Intel. Antitrust experts following Mr. Cuomo’s actions said that both A.M.D. and I.B.M.  which is based in Armonk, N.Y., and competes against Intel in the server chip market  have invested billions of dollars in chip manufacturing plants in New York. Keith N. Hylton, a professor at the Boston University School of Law, said that Mr. Cuomo could benefit politically by taking such a prominent stand on behalf of local workers and consumers. “An attorney general is understood to be an aspiring governor,” he said. “They are politicians, and they want to be on the gravy train for big cases.” During the news conference, Mr. Cuomo said that thwarting Intel’s abusive actions was important to consumers and businesses worldwide. “It is not just about New York,” he said.

According to Mr. Dell, people who go out and buy a top-of-the-line PC with Windows 7 this week and then buy Office 2010 when it arrives next year will undergo a computing catharsis. ''You will love your PC again,'' Mr. Dell said, speaking on Tuesday night at event held by Silicon Valley's Churchill Club. ''We have not been able to say that for a long time.'' In the last eight years, Dell has gone to rather drastic lengths to route around the Vista operating system from Microsoft. Dell has been the most aggressive Tier 1 supporter of Linux, placing it on a range of computers. It has also poured vast sums of money into revamping its computer designs, offering everything from pink rigs to laptops with finishes done by contemporary artists and bamboo sheaths that wrap around desktops. Dell released a laptop last month that uses Linux and a minimotherboard to give customers near-instant access to things like their e-mail and the Web. That is to say, people can ignore Windows altogether by using this instant-on system to do their daily tasks. In Dell's own studies, people spent 70 percent of their time in this instant-on world rather than booting up Windows when they were at home. And, even as Windows 7 nears its release, Mr. Dell found time to champion computing devices and systems that have little to do with the PC at all. Mr. Dell pointed to Tencent, a Chinese Internet services company that buys Dell servers and storage systems. Tencent has a variety of online services that let people do things like instant-message, watch videos and conduct business on their phones. ''They have 650 million customers,'' Mr. Dell said. ''They are all the people in China who use cellphones. Their users are not using PCs. I think, 'Oh, that's pretty interesting.' We get kind of intrigued by that.''

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Strong and steady improvement, economists say, would suggest that the United States is truly emerging from the Great Recession. Yet if tech spending fades, it would mean that recovery is further off. So far, there are many encouraging signs. The technology giants Intel, I.B.M. and Google delivered better-than-expected quarterly financial results this week, and their executives expressed confidence that the worst was over and a rebound under way. Top executives at Dell, Cisco Systems and other tech companies have also been optimistic recently. “The worst of the recession is clearly behind us and because of what we have seen, we now have the confidence to be optimistic about our future,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, told analysts Thursday after the company’s strong earnings report. Much depends on how the nascent revival in the technology sector plays out. Computer hardware and software are building blocks of the modern economy, as basic as iron ore and coal were to the industrial era. Together, technology products represent about half of all business spending on equipment. Microchips and clever code animate consumer technology goods, like personal computers and Apple iPhones. Larger computers in data centers power e-mail, electronic commerce and the Internet. “This will be a technology-led recovery,” said Edward Yardeni, an economist and investment strategist. “And the improvement we’re seeing from the technology companies suggests the recovery has legs.” Paul S. Otellini, chief executive of Intel, the world’s largest semiconductor maker, pointed to his company’s solid third-quarter performance on Tuesday and said it showed that “computing is essential to people’s lives, proving the importance of technology innovation in leading an economic recovery.” Computer chips like those made by Intel are a key ingredient of technology goods, and spending on the equipment used to make semiconductors is projected to rise by 47 percent in the second half of this year, according to Gartner, a research firm. On Thursday, I.B.M., a leader in software and technology services sold to companies, reported profits and revenue that surpassed Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s net income rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion, or $2.40 a share. I.B.M. lifted its guidance for full-year profits by 15 cents a share from its previous projection, and added that it expected year-on-year revenue to grow in the current quarter. Revenue in the third quarter fell by 5 percent, adjusted for currency movements, to $23.6 billion. “We’re seeing more stability in the economy,” Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “That’s a big improvement over the relentless declines we had been seeing.” The strongest markets for technology suppliers have been in developing nations, like China, India and Brazil. In the United States, much of the technology spending so far has been by consumers, especially buying personal computers and smartphones. But analysts caution that it is too early to tell whether the spending pickup will carry through to a key market: corporations. “We’re seeing glimmers of improvement, but it would be premature to say we’re on a strong recovery path,” said Richard Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley. Managers who make technology purchase decisions have yet to really open their wallets, although recent surveys of their intentions have become far more positive. Corporate buying tends to trail an economic recovery because companies routinely take several months to budget and plan technology projects. “We’re seeing corporate budgets stabilize, and with greater clarity on budgets, companies are able to plan better and move ahead on technology projects,” said Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president for research at Gartner. Tech industry executives say corporations are preparing to replace their aging personal computers  purchases that were put off during the depths of the recession. There are already some signs that companies are buying new PCs again, executives say, and that could well accelerate after the introduction of the Windows 7 operating system, a Microsoft product that will be released next week. Companies typically buy new PCs six months or so after Microsoft introduces a new operating system, after they have the chance to test the software and plan their rollout. “I think there is a very powerful refresh cycle that is coming,” Michael S. Dell, chief executive of Dell, said in a speech this week. “We are seeing the planning and early stages of this from the clients we serve, which would be about 85 percent of the organizations in the United States that have more than 500 people.” John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco, was even more bullish recently, predicting a substantial increase in productivity at American companies driven by investments in Internet software and hardware. “I think we are entering a period very similar to 1997 to 2004, where you’ll see a decade run of productivity increases,” he said in an interview. Rising confidence and investment eventually translate into stepped-up hiring. That phase has just begun. Google, for example, began hiring again in August in response to a pickup in the company’s search and Internet advertising businesses, according to its chief executive, Mr. Schmidt. He said the company was also scouting for acquisitions again. “I can’t prove it,” Mr. Schmidt said, “but I would hope we’re a leading indicator.” Infosys, an Indian technology services and outsourcing company, plans to hire 1,000 workers in the United States over the next year. The move is part of its strategy to hire more locals as it expands in the American market. An improving economy would accelerate the program. “We are gaining momentum and will speed up the hiring,” said Nandita Gurjar, a senior vice president at Infosys. The steady march of digital technology, in industry after industry, is pushing the demand for information technology. The recession curbed spending for a while, and forced organizations to improve the efficiency of their data centers and technology operations. But that goes only so far. In health care, for example, rising demand is being driven by the push for computerized health records, the adoption of digital radiography, digital pathology techniques and telemedicine. “There is this huge growth in digital data coming in health care, and it is only going to add to the need for computing resources of all kinds,” said Daniel Drawbaugh, chief information officer of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, a large hospital and physician group. Yet the pervasive spread of computing across industries and society, analysts say, also means the long-term growth trend in the tech sector is as much a mirror of the economy as an engine. “It is a reflection over all of how the economy is performing,” said Stephen Minton, an analyst at the research group IDC.

Seems a Winner<date>Correction: September 25, 2009Published: September 22, 2009</date><text>PALO ALTO, Calif.  By many measures, it has been a tough year for employees of Electronic Data Systems. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Minh Uong/The New York Times Related Times Topics: Hewlett-Packard Company Enlarge This Image Jim Wilson/The New York Times From left, Shane Robison, Hewlett-Packards chief technology officer; Joe Eazor, general manager of H.P.'s enterprise services; and Ann Livermore, an executive vice president at H.P. who heads its services and data center products businesses; last week in Palo Alto, Calif. After Hewlett-Packard bought the computer services company last August for $13.9 billion, it immediately began hacking the work force. Led by a master cost-cutter, Mark V. Hurd, H.P. laid off 25,000 E.D.S. workers, and cut the salaries of some by more than 20 percent. Mr. Hurd even stripped the E.D.S. brass of their plush offices and corralled them into 6-by-6-foot cubicles. But despite the risk that disgruntled employees and customers would walk out the door, the acquisition has paid off big for H.P.  so well, in fact, that an important rival has decided to strike a similar deal. Dell announced Monday that it was paying $3.9 billion for Perot Systems, the Texas computer services company started by H. Ross Perot after he left E.D.S. Plenty of employees have complained about H.P.’s tactics, but the company says it has persevered through the turmoil to keep most of E.D.S.’s customers. Last quarter, H.P.’s operating profit margin on services hit 13.8 percent, the highest in a decade. And the combined company’s services division is H.P.’s biggest business in terms of revenue  a remarkable metamorphosis for what has long been viewed as a slow-growth PC and printer maker. On Wednesday, H.P. will take another big step toward full integration of E.D.S., extinguishing the 47-year-old company’s name. The new name, H.P. Enterprise Services, reflects the union of the services operations at the two companies. “I acknowledge that we have done a lot of hard stuff, but this is all about getting H.P. in a position where we can compete and win,” said Ann Livermore, an executive vice president at H.P. who heads its services and data center products businesses. In talks with E.D.S. employees, executives have put it more bluntly. At one meeting in August, Andy W. Mattes, who runs H.P.’s services business in the Americas, said that the deep salary reductions and broad cost cuts were for the good of the remaining employees. “Just letting things go on will result in much more bleak and horrible scenarios,” Mr. Mattes said, according to an audio recording of the meeting. The bloodletting pains Mort Meyerson, who served alongside Mr. Perot at E.D.S. and Perot Systems for many years. “It’s sad to see this happen because of the decades of work the men and women of E.D.S. put into the company,” he said. “But that’s what happens in business.” H.P. executives concede that the company’s aggressive pruning comes with costs, as workers fret about their futures and the overall business endures some disruption. But they say that tough actions were needed to bring E.D.S. in line with competitors like I.B.M., Infosys and Wipro Technologies. By common business yardsticks, the Hurd touch on E.D.S. appears to have worked better than investors and analysts had expected. When H.P. announced its intent to buy E.D.S. in May 2008, H.P.’s share price sank. E.D.S. had developed a reputation as a bloated has-been that had burned investors in the past through bad deals, accounting issues and an overreliance on services contracts with the government and automakers. And while E.D.S. received high marks from customers for its role in taking over their technology operations, it required far more people than competitors to accomplish the task. “It was almost, the closer you were to E.D.S., the more concern you had about the acquisition,” said Shannon Cross, an equities analyst with Cross Research. E.D.S.’s own efforts to lower costs had stalled, particularly since the company lacked the financial resources to undertake a major reorganization, according to Joe Eazor, a former E.D.S. executive who is now a senior vice president and general manager of services at H.P. Investors were also worried about change-of-control provisions in contracts that would allow customers to renegotiate or cancel long-term deals with E.D.S. But H.P. has held onto 199 of the top 200 accounts at E.D.S., according to Mr. Eazor. Some of the deals have been reworked, but H.P. points to its improving operating margins in services as evidence that any reductions in revenue have been minor. Meanwhile, as sales of printers, PCs and data center gear have plummeted during the recession, H.P. has used services to bolster its overall revenue and profits. “The deal has really helped insulate them from the downturn,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Barclays Capital. “Without E.D.S., things could have been a lot worse.” According to analysts, H.P. may have engineered the deal at just the right time. The down economy gave H.P. time to perform its painful restructuring and primed the company to grow when the good times returned. Historically, E.D.S. promoted computing gear from H.P. rivals like Sun Microsystems, Xerox and Cisco Systems. But Mr. Eazor says that more of H.P.’s own hardware is slated to go into deals that are currently up for bid. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 25, 2009 A picture caption on Wednesday with the continuation of an article about Hewlett-Packard’s integration of the technology services company Electronic Data Systems misstated the job title of a Hewlett-Packard executive.

And while E.D.S. received high marks from customers for its role in taking over their technology operations, it required far more people than competitors to accomplish the task. “It was almost, the closer you were to E.D.S., the more concern you had about the acquisition,” said Shannon Cross, an equities analyst with Cross Research. E.D.S.’s own efforts to lower costs had stalled, particularly since the company lacked the financial resources to undertake a major reorganization, according to Joe Eazor, a former E.D.S. executive who is now a senior vice president and general manager of services at H.P. Investors were also worried about change-of-control provisions in contracts that would allow customers to renegotiate or cancel long-term deals with E.D.S. But H.P. has held onto 199 of the top 200 accounts at E.D.S., according to Mr. Eazor. Some of the deals have been reworked, but H.P. points to its improving operating margins in services as evidence that any reductions in revenue have been minor. Meanwhile, as sales of printers, PCs and data center gear have plummeted during the recession, H.P. has used services to bolster its overall revenue and profits. “The deal has really helped insulate them from the downturn,” said Ben Reitzes, an analyst with Barclays Capital. “Without E.D.S., things could have been a lot worse.” According to analysts, H.P. may have engineered the deal at just the right time. The down economy gave H.P. time to perform its painful restructuring and primed the company to grow when the good times returned. Historically, E.D.S. promoted computing gear from H.P. rivals like Sun Microsystems, Xerox and Cisco Systems. But Mr. Eazor says that more of H.P.’s own hardware is slated to go into deals that are currently up for bid. 1 2 Next Page » This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 25, 2009 A picture caption on Wednesday with the continuation of an article about Hewlett-Packard’s integration of the technology services company Electronic Data Systems misstated the job title of a Hewlett-Packard executive.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Intel Corporation In an e-mail message, the executive warned his boss that the scale of retaliation by Intel would be so severe that Dell would “have to bite and scratch to even hold” its 50 percent discount on price of the Intel chips. He warned that using A.M.D. chips in computers for sales to companies would lead Intel to offer an even slimmer discount. “Boss,” the executive wrote, Intel is “prepared for” all-out war “if Dell joins the A.M.D. exodus.” The European Commission’s antitrust unit on Monday published the text of this e-mail message, from 2004, and a torrent of similar documents to back up its contention that the record $1.5 billion fine it imposed in May against Intel was justified. The documents, E.U. regulators argued, clearly show that computer manufacturers were sorely afraid to cross Intel, which holds 77 percent of the global market for computer chips, by buying from A.M.D., Intel’s only serious rival, with 23 percent. For its part, Intel fired back on Monday, alleging that the commission had engaged in unfair tactics of its own. Intel has appealed the fine in European court, claiming that the commission botched procedures in its investigation of chip sales. At stake is the strong market position Intel has long maintained over A.M.D., particularly if other antitrust regulators, like the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, follow the European ruling. Intel said Monday that a report on the antitrust investigation by the commission’s ombudsman, as yet unpublished, would be critical of the commission. European antitrust lawyers said the public back-and-forth between litigants was unlikely to influence the outcome of the appeal, which will not be heard by the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg until next year at the earliest. “I think the commission feels pretty confident about its actions, which appear to be sound and backed up by the evidence in the case,” said Michael Reynolds, an antitrust lawyer in Brussels at the law firm Allen &amp; Overy. “I don't think any public debate is going to have an influence on the appeals court's decision.” E.U. regulators first began investigating Intel in 2001, a year after A.M.D. filed a complaint with the E.U. authority in Brussels. In two sets of charges, in 2007 and 2008, the commission accused Intel of abusing its dominant position in computer chips by giving large rebates to computer makers, by paying computer makers to delay or cancel product lines and by offering chips for powerful server computers at prices below actual cost. The commission regulators claim that the e-mails released on Monday show a pattern of intimidation that they assert was repeated across the industry as Intel bound its customers in a complex web of rebates and incentives aimed at hobbling A.M.D. A commission official said “all-out war” was a paraphrase of the language in the internal Dell e-mail message, from 2004, as the original wording was too offensive to reproduce in a public document. The internal documents from executives at Dell, Hewlett Packard, NEC, Lenovo, and Media Saturn Holding, a German electronics retailer, describe how Intel conditioned its rebates on the companies outfitting 80 percent to 100 percent of their desktop and laptop computers with Intel chips. The e-mail messages also detailed how Intel based rebates to Acer, H-P and Lenovo on those companies delaying the introduction of computers based on A.M.D. chips. In one internal company presentation from 2003, Dell noted that switching any part of its supplies to A.M.D. from Dell risked retaliation by Intel that “could be severe and prolonged with impact to all LOBs,” or lines of business. Another computer maker, Hewlett-Packard, submitted an e-mail to the commission showing an H-P executive pleading with other members of the company to keep quiet about an apparently restrictive agreement with Intel. “PLEASE DO NOT ... communicate to the regions, your team members or AMD that we are constrained to 5% AMD by pursuing the Intel agreement,” the e-mail message, from 2002, said. 1 2 Next Page » Kevin J.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Allison V. Smith/Perot Systems, via Associated Press Michael S. Dell, left, with H. Ross Perot, center, and H. Ross Perot Jr., on Monday. The deal is expected to help Dell move into the growing field of electronic medical records. Multimedia Video Chief Executives on Dell Deal (CNBC) The company said Monday that it would spend $3.9 billion in cash to buy Perot Systems, a provider of technology services that is especially strong in the growing field of electronic health records. The government is pouring $19 billion over the next five years into technology to help doctors and hospitals digitize medical records. Dell and Perot were already working together on some medical projects, but the combination brings tremendous firepower to the task. Perot serves 1,000 hospitals  more, it says, than any other services firm. And Perot already helps automate the patient records of 200,000 doctors. While Dell has long taken a lean and focused approach to the computer business, devoting itself mainly to wringing the most efficiencies possible out of the manufacturing process, it has been forced to look for new ideas in recent years. The recession has hit Dell hard because it depends more than its rivals on sales to businesses, which have frozen their purchases of PCs and other data center equipment. Dell’s largest rivals  I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard  are leading players in computer services, which provide a steady revenue stream that is less vulnerable to the fluctuations of the economy. Dell is paying $30 a share for Perot Systems, a 61 percent premium over the company’s closing price Friday. Some investors found that price too expensive, and Dell’s stock fell about 4 percent in Monday trading to close at $16.01. A. M. Sacconaghi, a computer hardware analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said that Dell paid “a rich price.” But he said the deal was ultimately sound financially and strategically. In Mr. Sacconaghi’s view, since Dell is flush with cash, putting $3.9 billion into Perot will earn more than the interest that money would have garnered sitting in the bank. In addition, the companies hope to eliminate $300 million in annual costs as Dell’s services business is consolidated into Perot Systems. The combined unit will still use the Perot name and retain its Plano, Tex., headquarters, which is about 200 miles from Dell’s home office in Round Rock, Tex., on the outskirts of Austin. It will be run by Peter Altabef, now Perot’s chief executive. Dell plans to help Perot Systems expand to industries and countries that it currently does not serve. At the same time, it is counting on Perot to increase Dell’s sales in the health care industry. Michael S. Dell, the chief executive of Dell, said that Dell and Perot would continue to focus on finding the most efficient way to provide services to clients, including providing services from centralized, remote facilities. “This is about expanding what we do for a large number of customers,” he said. Mr. Dell said that the company would look to acquire more services companies to fold into Perot. He added that Dell was also hoping to make acquisitions in other areas. Perot Systems was founded in 1988 by H. Ross Perot, the two-time presidential candidate. He founded another services company, Electronic Data Systems, in 1962 and sold it to General Motors in 1984. E.D.S. was eventually spun out by the car company and bought last year by Hewlett-Packard for $13.9 billion. At the $30-per-share acquisition price, the Perot family’s stake in the company is worth $952 million, according to calculations by Bloomberg News. The two companies have been both flirting and working together for several years. Dell was interested in buying Perot in 2007, but the companies could not come to terms. “We had no interest selling the company,” said Mr. Perot’s son, H. Ross Perot Jr., who is chairman of Perot Systems. “Michael is a very good salesman. His vision got us excited and got my father excited.” The younger Mr. Perot said he believed this acquisition would turn out better than the family’s sale of E.D.S. to General Motors. “It’s a little bit different selling to an auto manufacturer than to Dell,” he said. “And also, this is a Texas transaction. I’ve known Michael since the 1980s. Our families are close. The cultures are close. There is not a lot of mystery in this relationship.” He added that Dell had a “test drive” of Perot Systems because it has used the firm to run some of its own technology projects. Perot Systems’ stock has bounced between $10 and $15 for the last eight years, in part because investors have been concerned about the tight margins in the services business. Perot also lost its largest client, the Swiss banking giant UBS, in 2007, said Joseph A. Vafi, who follows Perot Systems for Jeffries &amp; Company. The computer services business historically has involved high risks because the service providers need to buy and finance the hardware they use on behalf of their clients. Perot Systems shied away from that sort of big deal and sought projects in which it could manage computers it did not own. Dell has stepped up its pace of acquisitions recently, buying about 10 companies in the last two years after spending its first two decades making no deals of note. The largest previous buy for Dell was in late 2007 when it acquired the storage maker EqualLogic for $1.4 billion. Analysts have praised H.P.’s good timing in buying E.D.S. during a slump in the economy. The services revenue helped pad H.P.’s bottom line when PC, printer and data center hardware sales were plummeting. H. P. has spent the last year reworking E.D.S.’s cost structure through extensive layoffs and salary cuts. At a meeting with analysts this week, H. P. is expected to update Wall Street on its progress with these measures while boasting that it is ready to expand the E.D.S. business. Dell, by contrast, has spent the last year talking about making acquisitions, but did not spring into action until now.

Skip to next paragraph A blog from The New York Times that tracks the health care debate as it unfolds. More Health Care Overhaul News Multimedia Graphic Digital Doctoring Related Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary (September 10, 2009) Bits: Digital Health Records: The Hard Road Ahead The goal of moving paper medical records into the digital age has been championed for years by health care policy makers across the political spectrum, from Hillary Rodham Clinton to Newt Gingrich. As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama, too, was an advocate, and the economic crisis opened the door for an ambitious step  $19 billion put into the recovery package to encourage doctors and hospitals to install and use electronic health records. So even as the Obama administration and Congress struggle with broad health policy legislation, the technology industry is pursuing the opportunity in digital health records as never before. Although most of the government money will not start flowing until next year, the companies hoping to get their share include technology giants like General Electric, I.B.M. and the big telecommunications company, Verizon. Also in the hunt are smaller health technology specialists like Athenahealth, eClinicalWorks and Practice Fusion. On Thursday, Dell, the personal computer maker, plans to join the scramble in earnest, announcing its plan to form a partnership with hospital groups around the country to offer electronic health records  hardware, software, consulting services and financing  to their affiliated physicians. Dell, like the other players, sees the big opportunity as being in offices with 10 doctors or fewer, where three-fourths of the nation’s physicians practice medicine. To proponents, electronic health records, when thoughtfully set up and deployed, are a modern tool to improve care and help curb costs. They hold a patient’s health history, medications, lab tests and, when connected to databases, treatment guidelines. The potential benefits include fewer unnecessary tests, reduced medical errors and better care so patients are less likely to require costly treatment in hospitals. But doctors in small offices have not moved to digital records, mainly because today’s technology is costly and complex. What is needed, experts agree, are new models of delivery and easier-to-use technology to reduce the expense and technical headaches. The proposed offerings are typically bets on the new Internet-based service model, known as cloud computing, in which much of the computing firepower and data reside in remote data centers, which doctors, nurses and staff would use via the Web browsers on their personal computers. Faster networks, improved wireless connections and more affordable tablet PCs or small desktops promise to make the shift to digital patient records less cumbersome these days. But technical assistance and user guidance are also needed. And several companies plan to offer bridge financing to doctors to ease the burden of initial investment costs until the government begins making payments, which can be up to $44,000 for each doctor, from 2011 to 2015. Dell plans to act as the hardware supplier and general contractor, working with partners like eClinicalWorks, a maker of electronic health record software, and Perot Systems for data-center hosting, if the medical groups outsource that task. Dell already has pilot projects under way with a few hospital groups, including Memorial Hermann Healthcare System in Houston and Tufts Medical Center in Boston. This year, Dell announced it was teaming up with Sam’s Club, a division of Wal-Mart, to offer the hardware, software and services for electronic health records to doctors in small practices. “The technology has to be a simplified, affordable package for physicians,” said Jamie Coffin, general manager of Dell’s health care business. “We’re really going after this market in a concerted way.” The government’s effort to try to encourage a market in digital health records, experts say, faces formidable hurdles. The risk is that physicians buy lots of computer hardware and software, but see no improvements, leaving a legacy of wasted money, angry doctors and disrupted care for patients. “It’s certainly a gamble,” said Dr. David J. Brailer, former national health information technology coordinator in the Bush administration. “But I do think the net effect is going to be a lot of new efforts at innovation.” In many large medical groups, like Kaiser Permanente and the Mayo Clinic, all the doctors use electronic health records. Yet over all, only about 17 percent of America’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine. Encouraged by the stimulus financing, many companies besides Dell are hurrying to help lift that percentage considerably. G.E. is an established supplier of electronic health records that work as traditional personal computer software. The company, said Vishal Wanchoo, chief executive of G.E.’s health information technology business, has recently done a lot of prototype work on how to make the shift to digital records easier and less costly for small practices. Early next year, G.E. will offer a data-center hosted version of its electronic health records, delivered over the Internet. “It will help us reach more physicians,” he said. EClinicalWorks has added four data centers in the last year, bringing the total to 10, for hosting electronic health records as a service over the Internet. The company offers its records both as conventional PC software and as a Web service. “The software as a service is where the biggest growth is,” said Girish Kumar Navani, president of eClinicalWorks. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on September 10, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.On one proposal for health care reform at least, there is a rare bipartisan consensus: the push to computerize patient records.

The company offers its records both as conventional PC software and as a Web service. “The software as a service is where the biggest growth is,” said Girish Kumar Navani, president of eClinicalWorks. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/28/technology/companies/28dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Beats Forecasts, Then Surges<date>Published: August 27, 2009</date><text>For years, Dell feasted on a banquet of corporate technology spending, as large companies spent millions of dollars every three years or so to update their fleets of personal computers.

Related Times Topics: Dell Inc. Now, Dell’s involuntary diet looks as if it might be coming to an end. On Thursday, after Dell reported unexpectedly strong second-quarter earnings, executives said that its commercial business should pick up again in 2010, starting in the United States. The advent of new technologies from Intel and Microsoft, including October’s release of the Windows 7 operating system, and the cost of maintaining older machines will spur companies to replace their aging PC fleets, said Brian T. Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer. “We’ve seen the whole entire installed base is basically 12 to 15 months older than it usually is,” he said. A new refresh cycle could prove vital for the recovery efforts at Dell, which despite its recent struggles remains a top contender in the market for commercial desktop and notebook sales. The company, based in Round Rock, Tex., generates more than 80 percent of its revenue from commercial customers, and it continues to lean heavily on sales of PCs even as it expands its higher-end products and services. On a conference call with investors to discuss the quarterly financial results, Michael S. Dell, the chief executive, said the company already had won bids to upgrade several large computer fleets. While many deployments have been delayed because of tight budgets, he said, “we’re convinced they’ll occur.” Dell reported net income of $472 million, or 24 cents a share, for the quarter ended July 31. That was a 23 percent decline from the $616 million in net income, or 31 cents a share, reported in the period last year. Excluding costs associated with its continuing revamping, the company reported earnings of 28 cents a share, substantially exceeding the forecast of 23 cents a share from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Dell’s revenue declined 22 percent, to $12.8 billion, from $16.4 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $12.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Looking ahead, Mr. Dell said he expected revenue in the second half of the fiscal year to be stronger than in the first half. The better-than-expected performance caused Dell’s stock price to surge nearly 7 percent, to $15.65, in the final minutes of trading Thursday. The shares had been roughly flat, but about 15 minutes before the 4 p.m. market close, they started rising sharply on heavy volume. About three minutes before the market closed, the company put out its full earnings news release, which had been scheduled to come out after the close of trading. Jess Blackburn, a Dell spokesman, said the company accidentally posted some material from its quarterly financial presentation too early. “It was an inadvertent error on our part,” he wrote in an e-mail message. “Consistent with full disclosure, we immediately posted our news release as soon as we recognized what had happened.” The brightest spot for the quarter came from Dell’s public group, which includes government, school and health care customers. Buoyed in part by customers’ use of federal stimulus funds and strong sales to educational institutions, revenue for that group rose to $3.8 billion, a 20 percent increase over the previous quarter. David Bailey, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, said he was pleased to see that Dell’s gross profit margin actually rose slightly in the quarter. He said that the company appeared to be selling a more profitable mix of products. “That puts them in a better position in the near term,” he said. Dell’s efforts to improve its cost base should also put it in a good position to defend and perhaps expand its commercial market share, he said. The company has spent the last two years revamping its operations to gain a better competitive footing. Its ability to recapture or expand its share of large PC contracts will be a critical test of its reorganization efforts. Meanwhile, rivals have upped the ante. In particular, Hewlett-Packard has gained significant momentum in the last two years. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., now ships more PCs worldwide than any other computer maker. It accounted for 19.8 percent of worldwide PC shipments in the second quarter, according to IDC, a research firm. Dell, once the market leader, was a distant second with 13.7 percent. Throughout 2008, Dell retained its lead in market share for shipments to commercial customers, according to IDC. But during the second quarter, H.P. passed Dell in that segment, too, IDC said. “H.P. has a much higher proportion of its business in the consumer market, so it gets a proportionally better lift when consumers are buying and corporations aren’t,” said Roger L. Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates. “If corporations are buying, Dell gets a bigger swing than H.P.” A positive swing from corporate technology spending cannot come soon enough for Dell. Its commercial businesses showed some early signs of recovery in the company’s most recent quarter, but revenue and profit fell far short of last year. H.P.’s momentum could help sway a handful of corporate technology buyers, said Matthew Eastwood, vice president of enterprise platform research at IDC, but large companies do not change PC vendors on a whim. Companies typically want to maintain some consistency with vendors and supplies, he said, and being clued in on a computer maker’s road map for future products helps technology managers plan for what’s next. “Up until now, a lot of the end users and actual customers have been very quiet, sitting back and more or less trying to manage their infrastructure by looking in the rearview mirror,” Mr. Eastwood said. “Now they’re starting to shift and focus toward the future again: ‘What kind of investments am I going to make in I.T. to fuel my next business cycle?’ ” Computer makers need to have an answer for that question now, or they risk the loss of new hardware sales and sales of the more profitable services and products that go along with the computer. Sales of technology-management services like online monitoring of PC fleets have become increasingly important for computer makers as profit margins on hardware narrow. Dell has pushed hard into these services through acquisitions, partnerships and internal development work, but its list of services still lags the size and scope of H.P., especially after H.P.’s acquisition of Electronic Data Systems last year. “If you’ve got better services than your competitor, then you can drag your hardware in on the one-stop shopping idea,” Mr. Kay said. “H.P. is better positioned with its services and software acquisitions.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on August 28, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.For years, Dell feasted on a banquet of corporate technology spending, as large companies spent millions of dollars every three years or so to update their fleets of personal computers.

How Did That Happen?<date>Published: June 27, 2009</date><text>TAIPEI, Taiwan Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic The Challenger from Taiwan Enlarge This Image Ashley Pon for The New York Times Acer has risen swiftly on the strength of netbooks and laptops, and its chief, Gianfranco Lanci, sees an opening with smartphones. ABOUT three months ago, Gianfranco Lanci flew into San Francisco International Airport, got off the plane and made his way to the passport control stations. As he pulled out his documents, the passport agent immediately recognized him as the chief executive of Acer. “It was the first time in my life that has ever happened,” he says. Mr. Lanci may need to come to grips with his growing celebrity. After all, he has turned Acer, the personal computer seller based here, into a finely tuned organization that’s obliterating some of the computing industry’s longest-standing traditions and leading Taiwan’s charge up the technology food chain. This year, Acer appears poised to overtake Dell as the world’s second-largest seller of personal computers, which would put a real dent into one of America’s favorite dorm-to-empire business stories. And if this comes to pass, Acer would trail only Hewlett-Packard; no computer company based outside the United States has ever climbed so high. “That is a big achievement, and they have beaten the odds,” says Roger L. Kay, a PC industry analyst and president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a consultancy. “Acer is a real comer.” And so is Taiwan. Giants like Foxconn and Quanta have turned this island into a manufacturing hub, producing most of the music players, video game consoles, cellphones and computers bought by consumers and businesses. But the companies that sell these products  H.P., Dell, Apple and others  have put immense pressure on these manufacturers to keep prices low. So business leaders and the Taiwanese government are urging local companies to think bigger. As a result, many have set out to become household names around the world, to nurture their software businesses and to own more key intellectual property in fast-growing parts of the technology industry. “Most of the companies in Taiwan are slaves to the boom-and-bust cycles,” says Tien-haw Peng, the director of strategic planning at Prime View International, a company in Hsinchu, Taiwan that makes displays for computing devices. “There’s a goal to smooth things out by finding a better spot on the value chain. No Taiwanese company has done that faster, or more effectively, than Acer. To reach the No. 3 spot in the global computer business, Acer went through a corporate reinvention that offers fodder for business-school case studies. For close to 15 years, Acer suffered from a split personality. One part of the company built computers for other PC sellers that would then put their labels on the machines. Another part of Acer sold very similar computers under the company’s own brand. The arrangement created obvious conflicts, Acer executives say, with the group responsible for the Acer-branded products competing against the customers of the manufacturing arm. In 2000, Acer began cleaving off its manufacturing division. A year later it formed an independent company called Wistron to handle these operations. A smaller, nimbler Acer emerged, outfitted with a new logo and lofty, global aspirations. With a clean slate, Acer made what looked like counterintuitive decisions. It decided to focus on laptops for consumers, and to sell them through partners and retailers, avoiding any kind of direct sales. This approach placed Acer on a distinctly opposite path from Dell, which was the PC industry’s major success story in 2000. Dell had surged past rivals like Compaq, I.B.M. and H.P. through an ultra-lean direct sales model that hinged to a large degree on shipping desktop computers to big businesses. In the subsequent years, however, computer retailing shifted in favor of Acer. Consumers now buy more computers than businesses do, and these buyers tend to prefer laptops to desktops. The advantages that Dell once gained by mixing and matching components for customers at its factories have faded as consumers have flocked to stores to buy preconfigured computers. “When we split, we thought that if the PC is going to become more of a commodity, consumers will end up as the largest part of the business,” says Mr. Lanci, who became chief executive last year. “Going direct didn’t look like the right model for addressing that. After eight or nine years, it looks like we made a very good decision.” ACER’S ascent has accelerated during the global economic slowdown. The company made an aggressive move into the market for netbooks  the small, low-cost laptops that have been a rare bright spot during the worst slump the PC industry has ever faced. Dell, which depends far more on PC sales to businesses, has struggled as companies have avoided buying new computers. Last year, Acer’s market share grew by 3 percentage points, to 10.9 percent, while Dell gained just 0.1 percentage point, to 15 percent, according to the research company IDC. Acer has continued to narrow that gap this year, claiming 11.6 percent of the market to Dell’s 13.6 percent through the first quarter. Mr. Lanci says he thinks that Acer can keep growing, especially in the United States and China  the two most prized regions for PC sellers. In addition, he’s steering Acer into cellphones, arguing that the growing similarities between smartphones and laptops play directly to Acer’s strengths. “I think we have the know-how, and these two worlds are going to merge,” he says. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on June 28, 2009, on page BU1 of the New York edition.TAIPEI, Taiwan Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic The Challenger from Taiwan Enlarge This Image Ashley Pon for The New York Times Acer has risen swiftly on the strength of netbooks and laptops, and its chief, Gianfranco Lanci, sees an opening with smartphones.

It is a situation that continues to prove torturous for Dell and seems to have paralyzed parts of the company’s turnaround efforts. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Dell Inc. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., depends on selling computers to businesses and government bodies more than any of the other major computer makers. About three-quarters of its products go to such customers, while consumers make up the remainder. As businesses appear to be recovering more slowly than consumers, Dell is looking quite far ahead to find signs of optimism in the PC industry. “We are preparing for what we believe will be a powerful replacement cycle,” said Michael S. Dell, the company’s founder and chief executive, during a conference call on Thursday to discuss the company’s first-quarter results. Mr. Dell expects sales to pick up in 2010, when customers may buy new computers to run Microsoft’s next operating system, Windows 7. For now, Dell continues to struggle. In its first quarter, ended May 1, net income fell 63 percent, to $290 million, or 15 cents a share, from $784 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same period last year. Excluding restructuring and real estate charges, Dell earned 24 cents a share, beating analysts’ estimates by a penny. The company, however, missed the analysts’ forecast on revenue. It fell 23 percent, to $12.34 billion, from $16.08 billion last year. Revenue in all of Dell’s major businesses tumbled, including a 34 percent fall in desktop PC sales and a 20 percent drop in notebook PC sales. Dell has spent years trying to lessen its dependence on PCs by shifting its product mix toward data center equipment like server computers and storage systems. It has also tried to bolster its services segments and expand its consumer business. The company has long talked about making acquisitions, but it has sat on the sidelines during the recession and declined to make a major move. Mr. Dell said the time to strike might be close. “Asset prices are getting pretty attractive,” he said on the conference call. “Certainly, we are looking at how we will expand inorganically.” Analysts contend that Dell’s options may dwindle if the company fails to act soon. Oracle, for example, has snatched up Dell’s long-time rival Sun Microsystems, and Hewlett-Packard bought the services giant Electronic Data Systems last year. “Their targets are limited,” said Ashok Kumar, an analyst with Collins Stewart. “Eventually, Dell will have to step up their services profile, and the candidates are few and far between.” Dell had $9.7 billion in cash at the end of its first quarter. But it has less buying power with its stock. Dell’s shares hit a 52-week high of $25.63 in August and have since dipped as low as $8. Shares of Dell closed up more than 3 percent on Thursday, at $11.48. After the release of the first-quarter results, Dell’s shares rose above $11.60 in after-hours trading. While talking to financial analysts, Mr. Dell pointed repeatedly to the company’s recent cost-cutting measures. He stressed that Dell had focused on increasing its profits during the recession. Dell’s operating expenses declined $312 million year over year. In addition, it produced $761 million in cash during the quarter. The company acknowledges that its cost structure grew bloated in recent years, putting Dell at a disadvantage to Hewlett and Acer of Taiwan. Acer’s low costs have proved particularly beneficial during the downturn as its lower prices have helped it gain market share. According to technology analysts at Gartner, Acer is now tied with Dell as the second-largest PC maker in the world, trailing Hewlett. Even if PC sales pick up in 2010 as Mr. Dell expects, the company could continue to find itself in a difficult position. “Dell cannot afford to go up against Acer’s low cost structure in the consumer market,” Mr. Kumar said. “And, on the corporate side, they have their work cut out for them as well because H.P is more of a one-stop shop for equipment.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on May 29, 2009, on page B2 of the New York edition.In the midst of a global recession, businesses struggle to find the value in buying powerful new computers.

They prefer to buy a complete, customized machine from one supplier. Corporate customers increasingly want the same thing: a one-stop shop for hardware, software and services. And the largest technology companies are deploying their huge cash hoards to make acquisitions to bolster their ability to be that single provider. That trend drove Oracle, a leader in business software, to announce Monday that it was spending $7.4 billion to buy an ailing Sun Microsystems and get into the computer hardware business. Oracle beat out rival I.B.M., which considered buying Sun to enhance its own software offerings but ended serious acquisition talks about two weeks ago. ''Oracle will be the only company that can engineer an integrated system -- applications to disk -- where all the pieces fit and work together so customers do not have to do it themselves,'' Oracle's chief executive, Lawrence J. Ellison, said Monday. The drive to consolidate has made life difficult for independent companies like Sun, and the fall of such an industry stalwart highlights the mounting pressure on smaller firms in the computer, storage and software industries to find buyers. Even larger companies like EMC and Dell could be vulnerable, industry observers say. ''I believe that we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning consolidation game,'' said William T. Coleman III, a former Sun executive and co-founder of BEA Systems, who is now chief of the software start-up Cassatt. ''It's not over by any stretch of the imagination, and there are drastic things that still have to happen.'' Five years ago, Oracle bought PeopleSoft for more than $10 billion, igniting a furious rush to scoop up other business software makers. Oracle alone has since bought more than 40 other companies, spending close to $15 billion for BEA and Siebel Systems alone. Many of the companies purchased by Oracle had carved out a niche for themselves during the Internet build-out, providing unique functions that assisted a rapid infrastructure expansion. In the years after the dot-com bust, however, customers grew weary of visits from hordes of software salesmen peddling isolated wares. A simpler model evolved, in which a handful of companies like Oracle, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard bought dozens of smaller players and then competed to sell most of the software needed to run a modern business. ''The core just keeps getting denser and denser,'' said Randall N. Spratt, the chief information officer at McKesson, one of the nation's largest health care companies. ''We welcome large-scale players at the core.'' While software companies led the last round of consolidation, the hardware industry now appears poised for its own reshaping. ''I think we're at an inflection point,'' said Patricia C. Sueltz, a former I.B.M. and Sun executive, who runs the start-up LogLogic. For example, Rackable Systems, a smaller server computer maker, announced plans this month to buy Silicon Graphics for $25 million. Like Sun, Silicon Graphics started in 1982, and had been one of the fastest-growing businesses in America during its heyday, selling billions of dollars of computers a year. As the computer business has matured, companies that handcraft products for top performance face a harsh reality: Standard equipment can now handle most business tasks, and what matters most to customers now is large scale -- and the low prices that come with it. Over the last decade, H.P. has driven much of the consolidation through a series of large acquisitions. It bought Compaq Computer in 2001, which affected both the PC and server markets as other companies fought to expand and match H.P.'s reach. For example, the Chinese computer maker Lenovo bought I.B.M.'s PC business, and Acer, based in Taiwan, acquired Gateway, which had already acquired eMachines.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/technology/personaltech/26adamo.html?ref=dellinc">What’s in a Name?

It is called a phone. Skip to next paragraph Minh Uong/The New York Times A mobile internet device based on Nvidias Tegra chip. Josep Lago/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images A smartphone model called DX-900 by Acer. Emboldened by Apple’s success with its iPhone, many PC makers and chip companies are charging into the mobile-phone business, promising new devices that can pack the horsepower of standard computers into palm-size packages. The companies are also shifting gears because their technological feats of the last two decades  smaller laptops with faster chips to deliver snazzier graphics  no longer impress consumers, who increasingly find their three-year-old computers adequate for everyday tasks. “The action is really with the smartphones where everyone is competing to cram the most features into a phone,” said Linley Gwennap, a veteran chip industry analyst and head of the Linley Group. “I think of PCs as just kind of boring these days.” The new smartphones promised by PC companies will, among other things, handle the full glory of the Internet, power two-way video conferences, and stream high-definition movies to your TV. It is a development that spells serious competition for established cellphone makers and phone companies. Apple was the first to spot a sleepy industry, shaking up the handset category two years ago with the iPhone. Until recently, the handset makers were the ones reacting to the iPhone  and then with me-too products. Now fellow PC makers are announcing plans for smartphones in a variety of sizes, shapes and abilities. Acer, the big PC manufacturer, has gone from offering no cellphones to selling eight new models, with more to come this year. “The smartphone market is the natural direction of our long-term mobile strategy,” Gianfranco Lanci, chief executive of Acer, a Taiwan-based company, said as he announced the products at last month’s World Mobile Conference in Barcelona. “We’re just taking on another dimension.” Dell has also worked on prototype phones but has not committed to making a new product. And Asustek, the company that was first to market ultraportable laptops known as netbooks, has new smartphones coming. The suppliers to the PC industry have also started shifting to the new market. Intel announced a deal to supply the cellphone maker LG with chips for new mobile devices. Nvidia, the PC graphics-chip titan, signed a deal to provide three smartphone makers  which supply handsets to brand-name manufacturers and carriers  with its new Tegra processor. “The rise of the smartphone and things like graphics and 3D images weren’t important when the incumbents built this business,” said Michael Rayfield, the general manager of Nvidia’s mobile business unit. “This is a once in a lifetime deal where a huge market changes the things that are important to it.” With smartphones and PCs taking on many of the same functions, there is certainly a fear among PC makers that if they do not get into cellphones, cellphone makers will start building PCs. Acer has characterized the smartphone business as a volatile battlefield, saying it needs to fire first and go after the cellphone makers before they come after it. Indeed, Nokia, the world’s largest cellphone maker, has said it is weighing whether to get into the PC business. The convergence of the two devices has long been predicted, but it took a confluence of industry changes for it to begin in earnest. For decades chip manufacturers rushed to leapfrog one another with faster processors, and computer makers scrambled to squeeze more functions into smaller boxes. But ever-faster chips eventually become impractical. Their blazing speed requires vast amounts of power and cooling. The smartphones give the PC makers a chance to extend their newfound expertise in creating low-power products. In particular, Acer hopes to ride its success selling laptops and netbooks into the mobile phone market through a mix of new software and wireless data plans. It is working on software that will link all of its portable products together, synchronizing e-mail, contacts, media files and other information among the products. This could open up a way for carriers to sell more wireless 3G data services to consumers, since they could offer a single plan covering multiple devices. It is an extension of the model that Dell and others are already trying, in which carriers essentially give $400 netbooks away to consumers in exchange for two-year contracts to data plans. Such plans can cost as much as $1,500 over their lifespan. Deals that cover laptops as well as phones could prove troublesome for existing cellphone companies, as it would offer consumers a suite of products that were tightly integrated and supported. In addition, PC manufacturers come from an industry very familiar with low profit margins and tight cost structures, and would bring those pressures to bear on established cell manufacturers. “Acer has learned to live and prosper on very thin margins,” said Aymar De Lencquesaing, the head of the company’s smart hand-held business group. “I think we bring this kind of experience to a market that has perhaps has not yet had to endure similar rigor.” Both Acer and Nvidia have promised very low-cost smartphones, threatening the most lucrative part of the cellphone makers’ business. At the same time, the phone market has been bombarded with operating systems from Microsoft, Google and Intel. There is a concern among longstanding players in the industry that operating systems and phone designs are becoming commodities, and that the barrier to entering the marketplace is lower than when mobile-phone manufacturers were building each handset from scratch. This gives companies like Motorola and Nokia an entirely new set of problems besides falling sales and shrinking margins. “It’s cataclysmic for the phone guys, who were used to playing golf on Wednesday afternoons,” said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates, a research firm. “Those times start to look pretty good now.” Not that such a move will be easy for the PC makers. The PC industry has a spotty record for expanding into consumer electronics. Dell stumbled with its MP3 player, and Hewlett-Packard’s line of televisions failed to catch on with consumers. Both products have been discontinued. Also, the established mobile-phone makers have longstanding relationships with carriers, which remain reluctant to provide customer support for a wide array of devices from myriad manufacturers. Beyond that, traditional cellphone companies do not want to compete with the likes of Microsoft and Intel, which have grown over the years to dominate the PC business. Perhaps most critically, traditional phone and mobile chip companies have expertise in making phones that work. “It has to be a good cellphone first,” said Ed Snyder, an analyst with Charter Equity Research. “This is about as far away from PCs as raising elephants.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on March 16, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.The computer industry has hit upon its Next Big Thing.

Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Add to Portfolio Wal-Mart Stores Inc Go to your Portfolio » Wal-Mart’s move comes as the Obama administration is trying to jump-start the adoption of digital medical records with $19 billion of incentives in the economic stimulus package. The company plans to team its Sam’s Club division with Dell for computers and eClinicalWorks, a fast-growing private company, for software. Wal-Mart says its package deal of hardware, software, installation, maintenance and training will make the technology more accessible and affordable, undercutting rival health information technology suppliers by as much as half. “We’re a high-volume, low-cost company,” said Marcus Osborne, senior director for health care business development at Wal-Mart. “And I would argue that mentality is sorely lacking in the health care industry.” The Sam’s Club offering, to be made available this spring, will be under $25,000 for the first physician in a practice, and about $10,000 for each additional doctor. After the installation and training, continuing annual costs for maintenance and support will be $4,000 to $6,500 a year, the company estimates. Wal-Mart says it had explored the opportunity in health information technology long before the presidential election. About 200,000 health care providers, mostly doctors, are among Sam Club’s 47 million members. And the company’s research showed the technology was becoming less costly and interest was rising among small physician practices, according to Todd Matherly, vice president for health and wellness at Sam’s Club. The financial incentives in the administration plan  more than $40,000 per physician over a few years, to install and use electronic health records  could accelerate adoption. When used properly, most health experts agree, digital records can curb costs and improve care. But many, especially physicians in small offices, doubt the wisdom of switching to electronic health records, given their cost and complexity. Only about 17 percent of the nation’s physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine. The use of electronic health records is widespread in large physician groups, but three-fourths of the nation’s doctors work in small practices of 10 physicians or fewer. Wal-Mart, however, has the potential to bring not only lower costs but also an efficient distribution channel to cater to small physician groups. Traditional health technology suppliers, experts say, have tended to shun the small physician offices because it has been costly to sell to them. Taken together, they make up a large market, but they are scattered. “If Wal-Mart is successful, this could be a game-changer,” observed Dr. David J. Brailer, former national coordinator for health information technology in the Bush administration. In the package, Dell is offering either a desktop or a tablet personal computer. Many physicians prefer tablet PCs because they more closely resemble their familiar paper notepads and make for easier communication with the patient, since the doctor is not behind a desktop screen. EClinicalWorks, which is used by 25,000 physicians, mostly in small practices, will provide the electronic record and practice management software, for billing and patient registration, as a service over the Internet. This “software as a service” model can trim costs considerably and make technical support and maintenance less complicated, because less software resides on the personal computer in a doctor’s office. Dell will be responsible for installation of the computers, while eClinicalWorks will handle software installation, training and maintenance. Wal-Mart is using its buying power for discounts on both the hardware and software. Wal-Mart’s role, according to Mr. Osborne, is to put the bundle of technology into an affordable and accessible offering. “We’re the systems integrator, an aggregator,” he said. The company’s test bed for the technology it will soon offer physicians has been its own health care clinics, staffed by third-party physicians and nurses. Started in September 2006, 30 such clinics are now in stores in eight states. The clinics use the technology Wal-Mart will offer to physicians. “That’s where the learning came from, and they were the kernel of this idea,” Mr. Osborne said.

With sales of most manufactured goods plunging in this recession, demand for chips is evaporating. In January alone, chip sales plummeted by almost a third from the previous year, to $15.3 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. “This is the worst recession the semiconductor industry has seen since its inception,” said Sean M. Maloney, the chief sales and marketing officer at Intel, at a news conference Monday. Consumers have benefited from some of the underlying turmoil. Smartphones and the cheap laptops known as netbooks are getting more powerful even as they drop in price. And the prices for the memory chips used to store information in iPods, digital cameras and cable set-top boxes are plummeting as the companies making the products grapple with overcapacity at their factories. Major chip makers like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia have felt the sting of businesses and consumers curtailing their spending on computers. Last month, Hewlett-Packard, the world’s largest PC maker, reported a 19 percent drop in computer sales, while Dell, the second-largest PC maker, posted a 27 percent decline in desktop sales. On Monday, the research firm Gartner predicted that computer shipments would dive by 12 percent in 2009 to 257 million units  the steepest decline ever. In the memory chip industry, conditions have turned cataclysmic. In the last couple of years the production of memory chips swelled as companies chased rising interest in consumer gadgets. The result was a vast oversupply, which led to plummeting prices. Memory prices fell 60 percent last year and could fall 40 percent this year, according to Jim Handy, the director of the chip research firm Objective Analysis. Now, on top of the oversupply, memory makers like Spansion and Micron Technology must also deal with falling demand for the consumer devices that use their products. “We’re in unprecedented territory for the chip industry as a whole, and the memory makers are then in a category by themselves,” said Dale Ford, an analyst at the research firm iSuppli. “These companies put themselves in a position of putting in place so much capacity that they were bleeding cash when the downturn took place.” Burdened with aging chip factories, Micron announced in October that it would lay off close to 3,000 people, or 15 percent of its work force. In February, it said it would eliminate up to 2,000 additional jobs. Qimonda, a German memory maker, began insolvency proceedings in January. And over the weekend, Spansion, the largest maker of a type of memory popular in cellphones, automobiles and set-top boxes, filed for bankruptcy protection after having already cut 3,000 jobs, or 35 percent of its work force. The company has said it was open to acquisition proposals. “There is no relief valve from the credit markets,” said Thomas T. Eby, an executive vice president at Spansion, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Mr. Eby conceded that the memory chip makers brought some of this misery upon themselves by building too many factories, which led to the declining prices. But he added that chip makers must try to anticipate demand and pay for and build their expensive factories two to three years ahead of time. “The bigger issue is that no one had a crystal ball to see what was coming from the economy,” he said. With the complexity and cost of building chips only continuing to rise, the current market conditions could accelerate a trend toward consolidation while also making it less likely that start-ups will challenge the incumbents, say industry observers. And credit problems will probably result in some companies just disappearing, Mr. Ford said. “The industry doesn’t have its historical ability to manage through this.” More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on March 3, 2009, on page B1 of the New York edition.MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  While accustomed to the boom-and-bust nature of their industry, the companies making the semiconductor chips that run computers, cellphones, digital cameras and even cars find themselves in the middle of a collapse in sales that resembles total chaos.

Now, on top of the oversupply, memory makers like Spansion and Micron Technology must also deal with falling demand for the consumer devices that use their products. “We’re in unprecedented territory for the chip industry as a whole, and the memory makers are then in a category by themselves,” said Dale Ford, an analyst at the research firm iSuppli. “These companies put themselves in a position of putting in place so much capacity that they were bleeding cash when the downturn took place.” Burdened with aging chip factories, Micron announced in October that it would lay off close to 3,000 people, or 15 percent of its work force. In February, it said it would eliminate up to 2,000 additional jobs. Qimonda, a German memory maker, began insolvency proceedings in January. And over the weekend, Spansion, the largest maker of a type of memory popular in cellphones, automobiles and set-top boxes, filed for bankruptcy protection after having already cut 3,000 jobs, or 35 percent of its work force. The company has said it was open to acquisition proposals. “There is no relief valve from the credit markets,” said Thomas T. Eby, an executive vice president at Spansion, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Mr. Eby conceded that the memory chip makers brought some of this misery upon themselves by building too many factories, which led to the declining prices. But he added that chip makers must try to anticipate demand and pay for and build their expensive factories two to three years ahead of time. “The bigger issue is that no one had a crystal ball to see what was coming from the economy,” he said. With the complexity and cost of building chips only continuing to rise, the current market conditions could accelerate a trend toward consolidation while also making it less likely that start-ups will challenge the incumbents, say industry observers. And credit problems will probably result in some companies just disappearing, Mr. Ford said. “The industry doesn’t have its historical ability to manage through this.”</text></article></page><page index="10"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/technology/companies/27dell.html?ref=dellinc">Dell Income Drops 48% as It Seeks to Cut Costs<date>Published: February 26, 2009</date><text>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  During past downturns in technology spending, Dell tended to boast about its ability to weather the conditions better than competitors bogged down by higher-priced goods and cumbersome business models. Skip to next paragraph Related Times Topics: Dell Inc. In 2009, no such gloating has been heard. Like its peers, Dell has watched as businesses and consumers have sharply curtailed technology purchases. The decline in sales has proved so severe that Dell’s earnings have fallen to the lowest level since 2002. On Thursday, Dell reported that net income for the fourth quarter, ended Jan. 30, fell 48 percent, to $351 million from $679 million reported in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Revenue tumbled 16 percent, to $13.4 billion from $16 billion. Excluding one-time expenses, Dell earned 29 cents a share, 3 cents better than the consensus forecast of Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Instead of tough talk about trouncing competitors, Dell executives are focusing on their efforts to streamline the company. The stronger-than-expected earnings reflect work done as part of a $3 billion cost-cutting program, which has included layoffs, the closing of manufacturing plants and a shift toward using contract manufacturers to build more of its laptops. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., said Thursday that it would cut $1 billion more in annual costs over the next two years to improve the bottom line. “We will be the first to admit that this is a work in progress, and there is more to do,” Brian T. Gladden, the company’s chief financial officer, told Wall Street analysts in a call to discuss the quarterly results. Meanwhile, Dell’s 18-month effort to move away from personal computers and increase sales in potential higher-profit growth areas has stalled with the broader economy. “They are doing what they can, but are basically still treading water,” said Richard Kugele, an analyst with Needham &amp; Company. The main drag on Dell’s revenue came from plummeting desktop and laptop computer sales, which dropped 27 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Sales of Dell’s servers, software and services also fell, leaving storage products as the only area of growth. Michael S. Dell, the company’s founder and chief executive, insisted that it had made progress as part of a turnaround effort he started in 2007. “Our strategy is to develop disruptive technology and innovation and shift our business to higher margin products and services,” Mr. Dell said on the call. But in fact, Dell’s overall business appears very similar to what it was last year. For example, servers and higher-profit services and software account for the same overall percentage of Dell’s revenue as they did last year. And despite making its way into 24,000 retail outlets, Dell derives only 2 percent more of its revenue from consumer sales than it did a year ago. Investors may give Dell some leeway with its long-term transition given the state of the economy, which makes growth and expansion into new markets difficult. Still, they are demanding that Dell maintain profits in the near term as it chases changes in strategy. “I think the issue is that their profitability today is much lower than it was historically,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. Dell’s once-vaunted direct sales model continues to trail the overall profitability of Hewlett-Packard’s PC operation, Mr. Sacconaghi said. Competitors like Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. have also proved better equipped to deal with stagnant hardware orders because of vast services businesses, software sales and long-term contracts with customers. Shares of Dell fell 15 cents, to $8.21 Thursday, before the earnings announcement. In after-hours trading, Dell shares rose more than 1.8 percent, to $8.36.

Dell got rich building computers. His innovation was in pruning the PC supply chain and trimming production costs to undercut his competitors on price. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Yuko Shimizu Multimedia Graphic Beyond Computers Now some of the billions of dollars he earned in technology go toward a more traditional kind of pruning and trimming. Mr. Dell, the founder and chief executive of the computer maker bearing his name, also controls ValleyCrest, the largest landscape design, construction and maintenance company in the United States. Executives at the private company, which has received little attention in the mainstream press, said their company has managed to keep growing despite the weakening economy. ValleyCrest has a number of brand-name clients. It has primped the lawns of the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif.; the FedEx headquarters in Memphis; and the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta. It also planted the gardens at some of the biggest hotels in Las Vegas, like Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, the Wynn and the Venetian, and even installed the towering palm trees along the Las Vegas Strip. It manicures the lawns of the rich and famous as well. In fact, Mr. Dell discovered the company when it began landscaping his sprawling residential compound in Austin, Tex. Mr. Dell bought 51 percent of ValleyCrest in 2006 through a deal engineered by MSD Capital, the firm he created to exclusively manage the majority of his fortune. “He was very happy with the work we did on his house,” said Richard A. Sperber, the co-chief executive of ValleyCrest. The bulk of Mr. Dell’s estimated $17 billion fortune is spread across a portfolio of companies that is unusually diverse and low-tech for a technology mogul. MSD Capital has made investments in restaurant companies including those running IHOP, Applebee’s, Steak ’n Shake and Domino’s Pizza. It also holds stakes in car-related companies, including the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, the car rental company, and MSD Automotive Partners, which invests in luxury car dealerships. MSD Capital has vast real estate holdings in Hawaii, Mexico and California as well, and stakes in large real estate management firms that own hotels and resorts like the Hilton Times Square. Mr. Dell, who owns $2.14 billion worth of Dell stock, declined to discuss ValleyCrest or his other investments for this article. In the past, he has argued that his investment firm’s independence allows him to concentrate on managing Dell. And yet the firm’s investment style appears to mimic Mr. Dell’s pragmatic approach toward business. Indeed, much like Dell Inc., MSD Capital has set a pattern of jumping into consolidating markets and using its capital to give one player an edge in scale and efficiency. Mr. Dell’s investment in ValleyCrest has done well. Despite the roughest economy in decades, ValleyCrest, a private company, expects to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue this year, growing, as it has historically, by about 12 percent a year. “It’s been tough to communicate the state of the economy to the trees and convince them to stop growing,” Mr. Sperber joked. Over more than 60 years, ValleyCrest, based in this city in the San Fernando Valley, northwest of Los Angeles, has moved from local highway beautification projects to building a zoo and safari park in Abu Dhabi that will have exotic plants and tens of thousands of animals. “We’re lucky enough to have some of our designers catch the eye of the royal family in Abu Dhabi,” Mr. Sperber said. Burton S. Sperber, Richard’s father, founded the company after buying a nursery from the widow of his employer for $700 in 1949. ValleyCrest had mostly been an installation and maintenance operation, as the industry calls it, handling the back-breaking labor on projects designed by landscape architects. Today, in addition to maintaining the gardens of so many well-known properties, the company grows 12,000 varieties of trees for customers at an 800-acre nursery and also maintains golf courses. Richard Sperber, who became co-chief executive with his father last year, has tried to grow the company by taking on a flashier role in projects with a wider range of services for big jobs. ValleyCrest wants to manage every aspect of new projects from the design to the higher-profit maintenance work. To do it, ValleyCrest has poached some of the top landscape designers in the country from its old partners. For instance, Paul Comstock, a former director of landscape design for Walt Disney Imagineering, led projects like Disney’s Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Fla. The relationship with Mr. Dell and MSD Capital has fueled ValleyCrest’s ambitions, leading to some of its top design jobs. For example, investors in MSD Capital have relationships with the Kraft family, which owns the New England Patriots football team. That helped ValleyCrest win the contract for Patriot Place, a retail center next to Gillette Stadium, the Patriots’ home in Foxborough, Mass. But as ValleyCrest dives into the design business, it is causing friction with some of its longtime architecture partners. Lifescapes International, in Newport Beach, Calif., worked with ValleyCrest on several of the Las Vegas properties and has had a relationship with the company for 50 years. “It was a sad day when they decided to become competitors,” said Julie Brinkerhoff-Jacobs, president of Lifescapes. “We just don’t exchange leads like we once did.” ValleyCrest has spent the last few years acquiring smaller landscape companies throughout the United States, giving it access to large markets in Florida, Washington and elsewhere. Despite its growth and the presence of MSD Capital, ValleyCrest continues to operate like a small family-owned business. “It was a bit of a leap of faith with them coming in,” Mr. Sperber said. “But they have left us to run the business the way we know how to run the business.” ValleyCrest employs more than 11,000 people, though that number drops to about 8,000 in winter when work slows. It is one of the largest employers of Latino workers in America and takes pride in retaining staff through above-average wages and raises. And now Mr. Dell has started to put his touch on ValleyCrest’s traditions. As the company looks to reinvent the landscape supply chain by unifying design, construction and maintenance, it has tried to turn simplicity into a way of winnings customers. “The inefficiencies of the current system are just so archaic,” Mr. Sperber said, sounding a bit like Mr. Dell. Mr. Dell urged ValleyCrest to eliminate some of the wasteful practices in the field. After tapping a consulting firm to institute the program, ValleyCrest hired some efficiency gurus from Toyota to make the effort permanent. “We visited the factories at Dell, and it really opened our eyes to ways we could improve,” Mr. Sperber said.

Now Dell and other personal computer makers face a major test as they contemplate entering the mobile phone market: can they come up with that next great feature that will turn their products into the latest object of desire rather than the latest flop from a clumsy PC maker grasping at a new market? For months, rumors have swirled that Dell  like its rivals Acer, Lenovo, and AsusTek  will jump into the booming market for sophisticated smartphones. While brutally competitive and fashion-conscious, the mobile phone market holds an obvious attraction for PC makers: high growth at a time when computer sales are expected to decline for just the second time in the last 20 years. In addition, the devices could open opportunities for PC companies, weighted down by low margins, to team up with telecommunications companies on profitable business and media services. Computer firms, however, have suffered a string of defeats when it comes to consumer devices. And even savvy phone makers like Nokia, Motorola and Palm have struggled in the smartphone arena, which is dominated by R.I.M. and Apple. Phones “are very different and much tougher than PCs,” said Ed Snyder, a telecommunications industry analyst with Charter Equity Research. The small devices place a premium on engineering and require attention to unfamiliar details like the inclusion of sensitive, always-on cellular radios. “It’s a much more difficult engineering problem, especially on a mass scale,” Mr. Snyder said. Dell has been working on phone prototypes for months and evaluated both Google’s Android software and Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system to run it. Recently, some reports have suggested that company, which is based in Round Rock, Tex., will unveil a smartphone next month at a prominent mobile technology conference in Europe. But people knowledgeable about the company’s plans say the company does not plan to announce a product anytime soon. Dell continues to debate whether its current design, said to be based on an ARM processor like the one in the iPhone, will prove unusual enough to impress consumers and worthy of putting into the market. Meanwhile, the company is also exploring how to create a more powerful product that could ship in 2010 and introduce new features capable of challenging rivals. For example, Dell could put its Zing music software, originally intended for use in a line of portable music players, onto a smartphone. Dell’s consumer device efforts are led by Ronald G. Garriques, who used to run the mobile device division at Motorola, and Dell has a team in Chicago, made up in part of former Motorola executives, dedicated to making smaller devices like netbooks, a popular type of bare-bones laptop. Dell declined to comment Friday on “rumors and speculation.” It is unclear if Dell could make a ground-breaking move in the mobile phone market, although the company has shown off several sleek new computers, including one of the thinnest laptops ever made. Dell’s new attention to design has helped it gain ground in the consumer market. Dell’s previous struggles with consumer devices have become the stuff of legend. It shipped a hand-held digital assistant called the Axim, but dropped the device because of lackluster demand. The company entered and exited the television market in short order. Dell has also ventured into the market for MP3 music players. Its first device, the Dell DJ, was a bigger dud than the Zune from Microsoft.

Dell as part of his effort to restart the computer maker’s growth have departed, the company announced on Wednesday. Michael R. Cannon, president of Dell’s global operations, will step down on Jan. 31. He was hired by the company two years ago as one of the first major hires made by Mr. Dell after his return as chief executive to the company he founded. Mark Jarvis, who was hired from Oracle by Mr. Dell as the company’s first chief marketing officer, will also leave. Both Mr. Cannon and Mr. Jarvis will be consultants for Dell after their departure. The company said the moves were part of an effort to reorganize the company around global market segments. Dell said it was reorganizing three of its four major product segments  large corporations, small and medium-size businesses, and other institutions like government  into global entities. The company said the change would allow faster development and deployment of standardized products across the world. The company’s fourth major product group, which focuses on the consumer market, already operates globally. The changes reflect Dell’s desire to grow faster overseas. Company executives have also said the company is interested in making more acquisitions. But the overhaul also comes as Dell has continued to struggle against tough competition from Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Acer and a number of overseas makers. As consumer preferences shifted to laptops from desktops, Dell lost some of its cost advantages against those rivals. Mr. Cannon, in particular, as the former chief executive of Solectron, a major electronics contract manufacturer, was brought in to help the company cut supplier costs. His efforts included closing down Dell factories. In a statement, the company credited Mr. Cannon with “many contributions to transforming the company’s supply chain and improving its cost competitiveness.” Wall Street analysts have been concerned that Mr. Dell is not taking the right steps  and not moving fast enough  to enable the company to grow faster than rivals. Dell’s shares closed Wednesday at $10.24, up a penny. A year ago, the shares were trading at around $25.

Dell as part of his effort to restart the computer maker’s growth have departed, the company announced on Wednesday. Michael R. Cannon, president of Dell’s global operations, will step down on Jan. 31. He was hired by the company two years ago as one of the first major hires made by Mr. Dell after his return as chief executive to the company he founded. Mark Jarvis, who was hired from Oracle by Mr. Dell as the company’s first chief marketing officer, will also leave. Both Mr. Cannon and Mr. Jarvis will be consultants for Dell after their departure. The company said the moves were part of an effort to reorganize the company around global market segments. Dell said it was reorganizing three of its four major product segments  large corporations, small and medium-size businesses, and other institutions like government  into global entities. The company said the change would allow faster development and deployment of standardized products across the world. The company’s fourth major product group, which focuses on the consumer market, already operates globally. The changes reflect Dell’s desire to grow faster overseas. Company executives have also said the company is interested in making more acquisitions. But the overhaul also comes as Dell has continued to struggle against tough competition from Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Acer and a number of overseas makers. As consumer preferences shifted to laptops from desktops, Dell lost some of its cost advantages against those rivals. Mr. Cannon, in particular, as the former chief executive of Solectron, a major electronics contract manufacturer, was brought in to help the company cut supplier costs. His efforts included closing down Dell factories. In a statement, the company credited Mr. Cannon with “many contributions to transforming the company’s supply chain and improving its cost competitiveness.” Wall Street analysts have been concerned that Mr. Dell is not taking the right steps  and not moving fast enough  to enable the company to grow faster than rivals. Dell’s shares closed Wednesday at $10.24, up a penny. A year ago, the shares were trading at around $25.

Dell has grown tired of discussing his company’s reinvention. Skip to next paragraph Manish Swarup/Associated Press Its O.K. if everyone doesnt understand what were doing, said Michael S. Dell, founder and chief executive. Enlarge This Image Erich Schlegel for The New York Times Dell now makes server and storage parts out of metal rather than plastic because customers prefer the feel of metal handles. “It’s O.K. if everyone doesn’t understand what we’re doing,” Mr. Dell said in an interview at the headquarters of Dell, the computer maker. He mocks suggestions that the company he founded takes more risks than in the past. With a grimace and a curt comment  “I don’t appreciate the tone of your reference”  he parries questions about how Dell’s culture has changed. Mr. Dell’s weariness toward questions about what has gone wrong at the company, once the world’s largest PC vendor, is understandable. He was famous for gloating about Dell’s consistency and relentless growth, but its heralded direct-sales business model and cost-squeezing supply chain management no longer give Dell the advantages they once did. Mr. Dell has further cut costs and experimented with retail sales. The company, based in this small town just north of Austin, needs to do more. It plans a run of acquisitions to restore growth. But it finds itself playing catch-up in one of the most difficult economic times in its history. Its strategy hinges just as much on big bets as precise execution. “It appears they are boxed in on all sides,” said Ashok Kumar, a securities analyst with Collins Stewart. “I don’t know how they can possibly extricate themselves from the hole they are in.” Analysts fear that after all of Dell’s revamping, the company will end up right where it is  largely dependent on the whims of businesses that buy PCs. In that case, Dell’s second act would look very much like its first, with the company remaining a distributor. Except this time, it will be fighting in a world that has moved on to favor well-rounded, more flexible rivals. Fellow tech giants like Hewlett-Packard, EMC, Cisco Systems and Oracle have spent the last several years bulking up through a steady stream of acquisitions. H.P., for example, has increased its annual revenue to a projected $130 billion for the coming year, from $45 billion in 2001. Oracle has doubled its annual revenue over a similar period to more than $22 billion. EMC traced 76 percent of its revenue to hardware in 2000, but it now derives 57 percent from software and services thanks to acquisitions. These companies, along with Sun Microsystems and I.B.M., have scooped up many of the prized assets that either survived or thrived in the era after the dot-com bust, fattening their software and services arsenals. Dell’s growth, to revenue of $56 billion in 2006 from $5.3 billion in 1996, has come from within. But company executives now concede that they need to make a large acquisition, or a series of them, to tap the repeating, higher-margin revenue streams that come from the software and services businesses. But the company trails the major technology companies. Dell has $9 billion in cash, but a deflated share price, its unique culture and inexperience with absorbing a major acquisition raise serious questions about just how much change and breadth Dell can buy. “It’s not a question of size,” said Brian T. Gladden, chief financial officer at Dell. “I think the question is more around diversifying our revenue base and becoming bigger in some things that are attractive for the long term.” Dell executives point to any number of acquisition possibilities: servers and storage systems, software and services. “That is where we have to do an acquisition to become relevant,” Mr. Gladden said. “There is no question.” Wall Street analysts speculate that Dell was gearing up to make the largest acquisition in company history. Dell spent close to $7 billion on share repurchases over the last year, while Mr. Dell has also spent his own money buying close to $200 million in Dell stock. With these gestures of confidence, Dell’s share price rose to more than $25 in late August from an eight-year low of $18.24 in April. But Dell, like many of its peers in the tech industry, has been rocked by the overall slump in the stock market, and its shares closed last week at $11.48, a level investors have not seen since 1997. The shares closed at $11.13 on Monday. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Technology » A version of this article appeared in print on December 16, 2008, on page B1 of the New York edition.ROUND ROCK, Tex.  Michael S.

Related Times Topics: Dell Inc. Enlarge This Image Prakash Singh/Agence France-Presse  Getty Images Michael Dell, whose company reported declines in overall profit and revenue on Thursday. With most economists predicting that the deepening slump will hammer corporate technology spending over the next year, Dell said it intended to keep slicing costs and would be cautious with its $8.9 billion cash hoard even as it realigns its business model from a direct-sales model to one that relies more on retailers to sell its laptops and desktop PCs. Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., reported revenue of $15.16 billion in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. That was a 3 percent drop from the same quarter a year earlier and more than a billion dollars shy of the $16.22 billion that analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters. But the company’s profits greatly exceeded Wall Street’s forecasts, largely because of the company’s strong emphasis on cost cutting and a gradual shift toward more profitable products. Dell posted net income of $727 million for the third quarter, a 5 percent drop from the $766 million it earned a year ago. However, stock buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding by 14 percent over the last year, so on a per-share basis, net income for the quarter rose 9 percent to 37 cents, compared with 34 cents a year ago. Wall Street analysts expected net income of 31 cents a share. Dell’s shares, which have tumbled from $28.40 over the last year, closed at $9.81 in regular trading Thursday, down 54 cents. The stock recouped those losses in after-hours trading as investors digested the earnings report, which was released after the market closed. Over the last two years, Dell’s earnings have often arrived well outside of Wall Street’s forecasts. The company has oscillated between increasing profits and reducing prices to chase market share. For about the last year and a half, Dell has been revamping to increase its retail presence and shift a greater percentage of its sales to higher-profit products like laptops, computer servers and services. Dell embarked on this strategy after rivals, especially Hewlett-Packard, proved more competitive on cost and wooed away consumers who wanted to see products in stores before buying them. But Dell is seeing far more immediate effects from layoffs and changes in its production model. After years of making all of its products at company-owned plant, Dell said on Thursday that it now builds one-quarter of its products through contract manufacturers, mimicking its rivals. Dell now finds itself trying to navigate difficult product and structural transitions while consumers and businesses have curtailed their spending on all technology products. Companies ranging from technology giants like Intel and Cisco Systems to retailers like Best Buy have warned of a sudden, drastic drop in sales. Dell, however, has tried to turn the poor economy into a positive by claiming that its sophisticated supply and order systems let it react more quickly to fluctuations in demand. “We are ahead in seeing the decline in the market given our model, versus being buffered by a distribution channel,” said Brian T. Gladden, Dell’s chief financial officer. The company had plenty of declining markets to contend with. Sales of PCs fell 14 percent, and sales of servers and networking gear dropped 5 percent. In the Americas, where Dell gets 48 percent of its revenue, sales fell 8 percent. Still, some analysts focused on Dell’s bright spots during the quarter, which included rising sales to consumers, higher services revenue and significant cost reductions. “In any kind of turnaround situation, results can be choppy,” said Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Company. “But Dell’s performance here was well above our expectations, especially given that the environment was very difficult.” H.P., one of Dell’s major rivals, issued preliminary fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, reporting a modest increase in sales after excluding revenue from its recent acquisition of Electronic Data Systems. More important, H.P. felt comfortable enough to present Wall Street with relatively upbeat guidance for its next fiscal year, sending its shares soaring. H.P. benefits from a vast amount of revenue from software, services and printer ink. Sales in these areas tend to repeat like clockwork and are often tied to long-term deals. Dell, by contrast, is more dependent on consumer and corporate spending fluctuations on hardware. Because of the state of the economy, Dell declined to provide any projections of how results might look in the next quarter or the next year. The rise of wireless technology and slicker, lighter, cheaper products have driven customers toward laptops. Many consumers prefer to ogle and handle laptops in retail stores rather than buy them online or by phone. Dell was late in getting into such stores, where H.P. and its sister brand, Compaq, hold a leading position. As of the most recent count, Dell is in 20,000 stores worldwide. Dell also once outflanked competitors by putting the latest and greatest components into new computers and quickly passing on lower component costs to customers. Over the last few years, rivals have largely caught up. Customers also seem less driven to chase the latest chips since software makers have failed to produce applications that can tap into all that current chips have to offer. Ultimately, however, Dell appears capable of weathering these challenges  and the wobbly economy  about as well as its peers. The question is how Dell’s cost cutting and its decision to turn down low-margin deals will fare in a protracted slump, which might encourage rivals to start a price war. “It’s difficult to continue to show profits when the top-line revenue is going down,” said David Bailey, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the number of stores where Dell is selling computers. It is 20,000, not 17,000.

I talk about my family and my personal life. I found that if you can tell an engaging story and relate it to work, it may stick with people and have some impact over time. Recently I wrote about my 11-year-old son who miscommunicated with a hair stylist. The woman shaved my son’s head instead of just giving him a trim, as he had requested. He was traumatized, locked himself in his room for a few hours and wore a baseball cap until his hair grew back. I used the anecdote to discuss our responsibility regarding customer service, whether it involves an employee packing boxes in Florence, S.C., or someone answering the phones in Chesapeake, Va. When people realize we all have similar struggles, it creates a higher level of engagement and a connection. As told to Patricia R. Olsen.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17dell.html?ref=dellinc">Shares Slip as Dell Sees Cutbacks in Its Sector<date>Published: September 16, 2008</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO  For the second time in as many months, Dell rattled its investors by warning that its customers are reluctant about spending on computers and servers. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Dell Inc Hewlett-Packard Co International Business Machines Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On Tuesday, the computer maker cautioned that slumping demand for technology equipment across the globe was affecting its business. The somber message, issued halfway through Dell’s third quarter, caused a drop of more than 11 percent in the price of the company’s stock. Dell closed Tuesday at $15.98, down $2.01. Dell has frequently cited lackluster demand for technology for less than stellar financial results. In August, Dell warned that weakness in spending in the United States had carried over to Europe and Asia. It said that decline in spending contributed to a 17 percent drop in quarterly profit. The company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early September that it planned to shrink its worldwide network of factories. “We saw a very weak August,” Dell’s chief financial officer, Brian T. Gladden, said Tuesday at a Bank of America investors conference in San Francisco. Only about 20 percent of Dell’s revenue comes from consumers. Its reliance on business spending, and on the government, military and education sectors, is causing Dell to feel the impact of the slowing economy ahead of some major rivals. Small and medium-size businesses and the federal government are reining in technology purchases. “Corporate spending has been relatively balanced for us in the U.S. and the consumer market continues to be pretty strong,” Mr. Gladden said. Some analysts have questioned whether Dell’s problems are of its own making. In August, the company blamed “self-inflicted” factors, like price cutting, for part of its woes. Mr. Gladden deflected these critiques Tuesday and emphasized that there was “more broad-based slowing” in the economy. Dell warned of particular weakness in Britain and southern Europe. It also cited difficulty selling in China. “We saw weakness in China as part of the Olympic period and expected it to snap back,” Mr. Gladden said. “We have dug a bit of a hole there.” Hewlett-Packard and I.B.M. have proved more resilient than some of their competitors in recent months, and in recent statements they remain optimistic. Both companies have a broad range of products sold globally. Hewlett-Packard’s customers are balanced between consumer and business customers. But a number of analysts expect the two companies to face increasing pressure because of the recent strengthening of the dollar. H.P.’s chief financial officer, Cathie Lesjak, said at the Bank of America event that the technology company is “very confident” in the recent guidance it gave its investors. With uncertainty rife in the financial markets and more financial services companies facing difficulties, Forrester Research scrambled this week to revise its forecast for technology spending in the United States. Forrester is now forecasting that year-over-year growth in sales of computers, software and outsourcing services will slow significantly, while spending growth for communications equipment and technology services should actually increase at a faster rate in 2008. The research firm said it expects that softness in technology purchases will begin in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009 as companies pull back on capital spending. It is now predicting an increase in tech spending in 2009 of 6.1 percent, down from its previous forecast of 9.4 percent. Softness in the financial sector is of particular concern to the large hardware makers, as Wall Street firms tend to spend heavily on technology.

Dell’s latest addition to the tangle is the Inspiron Mini 9, a two-pound laptop that runs Windows XP or Linux. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Related All Computer Coverage The Mini 9 has a 9-inch display and 1.6-gigahertz Intel Atom processor, part of Intel’s new line of low-power processors for mobile devices. It can hold up to 1 gigabyte of memory and comes with up to 16 gigabytes of solid-state storage. Interestingly, Dell is not offering a traditional hard drive at all; instead it uses solid-state memory to store the operating system, programs and data. A $350 version of the laptop comes with 4 gigabytes of storage and runs Ubuntu, a popular version of the open-source operating system Linux. For $400 you gain Windows XP and 8 gigabytes of storage. The laptop is available at Dell.com. The laptop has Wi-Fi but hackers have already opened the case and found the potential for built-in 3G wireless compatibility, although it may not be activated in the United States. It also has a larger keyboard than most other netbooks, a boon for users with even average-size fingers.
