The suits stem from subpoenas the finance agency issued to banks a year ago. If the case is not filed Friday, they said, it will come Tuesday, shortly before a deadline expires for the housing agency to file claims. The suits will argue the banks, which assembled the mortgages and marketed them as securities to investors, failed to perform the due diligence required under securities law and missed evidence that borrowers’ incomes were inflated or falsified. When many borrowers were unable to pay their mortgages, the securities backed by the mortgages quickly lost value. Fannie and Freddie lost more than $30 billion, in part as a result of the deals, losses that were borne mostly by taxpayers. In July, the agency filed suit against UBS, another major mortgage securitizer, seeking to recover at least $900 million, and the individuals with knowledge of the case said the new litigation would be similar in scope. Private holders of mortgage securities are already trying to force the big banks to buy back tens of billions in soured mortgage-backed bonds, but this federal effort is a new chapter in a huge legal fight that has alarmed investors in bank shares. In this case, rather than demanding that the banks buy back the original loans, the finance agency is seeking reimbursement for losses on the securities held by Fannie and Freddie. The impending litigation underscores how almost exactly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the beginning of a financial crisis caused in large part by subprime lending, the legal fallout is mounting. Besides the angry investors, 50 state attorneys general are in the final stages of negotiating a settlement to address abuses by the largest mortgage servicers, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup. The attorneys general, as well as federal officials, are pressing the banks to pay at least $20 billion in that case, with much of the money earmarked to reduce mortgages of homeowners facing foreclosure. And last month, the insurance giant American International Group filed a $10 billion suit against Bank of America, accusing the bank and its Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch units of misrepresenting the quality of mortgages that backed the securities A.I.G. bought. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan all declined to comment. Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said, “We can’t comment on a suit that we haven’t seen and hasn’t been filed yet.” But privately, financial service industry executives argue that the losses on the mortgage-backed securities were caused by a broader downturn in the economy and the housing market, not by how the mortgages were originated or packaged into securities. In addition, they contend that investors like A.I.G. as well as Fannie and Freddie were sophisticated and knew the securities were not without risk. Investors fear that if banks are forced to pay out billions of dollars for mortgages that later defaulted, it could sap earnings for years and contribute to further losses across the financial services industry, which has only recently regained its footing. Bank officials also counter that further legal attacks on them will only delay the recovery in the housing market, which remains moribund, hurting the broader economy. Other experts warned that a series of adverse settlements costing the banks billions raises other risks, even if suits have legal merit. The housing finance agency was created in 2008 and assigned to oversee the hemorrhaging government-backed mortgage companies, a process known as conservatorship. “While I believe that F.H.F.A. is acting responsibly in its role as conservator, I am afraid that we risk pushing these guys off of a cliff and we’re going to have to bail out the banks again,” said Tim Rood, who worked at Fannie Mae until 2006 and is now a partner at the Collingwood Group, which advises banks and servicers on housing-related issues. 1 2 Next Page »The federal agency that oversees the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is set to file suits against more than a dozen big banks, accusing them of misrepresenting the quality of mortgage securities they assembled and sold at the height of the housing bubble, and seeking billions of dollars in compensation.</text></article>

In late trading, shares of Goldman tumbled nearly 5 percent, knocking $2.7 billion off the firm's market value, after a report that the firm's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, had hired a prominent criminal defense lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten. Goldman, when confirming the hiring, portrayed it as routine, given the several government investigations faced by the firm. But the sharp reaction in the stock price showed the fragile nerves of investors, who are worried that potential legal liability could damage the firm and its earnings power. A spokesman for Goldman said executives at the firm were expected to be interviewed by the Justice Department. The agency is conducting an inquiry that stems from a 650-page report produced earlier this year by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. That report said that Goldman had misled clients about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities. ''As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection with the Justice Department's inquiry into certain matters raised in the P.S.I. report hired counsel at the outset,'' Goldman Sachs said in a statement. While investors apparently feared the worst on Monday, a person close to the matter said that Mr. Blankfein had not been subpoenaed and that no Goldman executive had received an individual subpoena. Goldman is cooperating with the Justice Department investigation. Still, Monday's stock fall underscored just how vulnerable Goldman's stock would continue to be until the Justice Department and other authorities finished their investigations. ''Until Goldman resolves its legal issues, the company and the stock are vulnerable to all sorts of perceptions, real or perceived,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities. With about 20 minutes left in the trading day, Reuters, citing an unidentified government source, reported that Mr. Blankfein had hired Mr. Weingarten. Mr. Weingarten has defended Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, and Mike Espy, a former agriculture secretary. Goldman's stock price quickly tumbled, falling to its lowest level since March 2009. Its shares closed at $106.51. The stock move also reflected the support Goldman shareholders had for Mr. Blankfein despite the problems the firm's problems under his stewardship. At Goldman's stakeholder meeting in May, shareholders voted 97 percent in favor of his leadership. Any suggestion that Mr. Blankfein's legal woes were mounting, or that he might leave the firm, would be seen as a negative for the stock. Goldman investors have been on a roller-coaster ride since April 2010, when the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of duping clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly created by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market's collapse. Since then, it has been dogged by investigations and speculation about investigations, all of which have taken its toll on stock. Goldman shares were trading near $180 a share before the S.E.C. filed its lawsuit. Goldman settled that suit a few months later, but its troubles were far from over. This year came the Senate report, which led to a Justice Department inquiry. And in June, Goldman received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is also investigating Goldman's role in the financial crisis. Mr. Blankfein's decision to hire his own lawyer is not unusual. Legal experts say that it is now common for a company's chief executive to retain separate counsel from the corporation. It has become rare for a lawyer or law firm to represent both a company and its executives in a government investigation. Mr. Weingarten, 61, is considered a skilled trial lawyer, having won acquittals for Mr. Espy, the former agriculture secretary, and Mark A. Belnick, the former general counsel at Tyco. He has also suffered his share of courtroom defeats. Mr. Ebbers, the head of WorldCom, was found guilty and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. On Monday, Mr. Weingarten was in the Federal District Court in Manhattan with his client Anthony Cuti, the former chief executive of Duane Reade, the drugstore chain. A judge sentenced Mr. Cuti to three years in prison for a scheme to falsely inflate the income and reduce the expense that the company reported. A jury convicted Mr. Cuti in June 2010. Mr. Weingarten did not respond to request for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for his law firm, Steptoe &amp; Johnson, declined to comment. Steptoe is not the firm most closely associated with Goldman. The bank's primary outside law firm is Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, a prominent and old-line New York law firm. Sullivan represented the firm in its $550 million settlement with the S.E.C. Also, when Mr. Blankfein testified as a witness earlier this year in the insider trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, the former hedge fund manager, lawyers from Sullivan coached him on his testimony and accompanied him to court. A native of Newark, Mr. Weingarten is a graduate of Cornell and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State. Before becoming a criminal defense lawyer, he spent several years as a deputy district attorney in Pennsylvania and then joined the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section. While at the Justice Department, he spent years bringing cases against corrupt politicians and worked with another young prosecutor, Eric H. Holder. Mr. Holder, now the attorney general of the United States, remains one of Mr. Weingarten's closest friends. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

There was just one slight twist in the legal proceedings. The S.E.C. lawyer was not the prosecutor taking the deposition. He was the witness. This summer, Adam Glass - who joined the agency two years ago and is now co-chief counsel in charge of helping write the rules for the complex financial instruments known as derivatives - testified in a deposition about Goldman's Abacus, a mortgage investment that the government argues was designed to fail. It turns out that Mr. Glass has a unique perspective on Wall Street exotica. Before working on the financial crisis cleanup, he helped create the opaque securities that contributed to the mess. For many years, Mr. Glass served as the outside counsel to Paulson &amp; Company, the giant New York hedge fund firm run by John Paulson, who made billions betting against the housing market. And yes, Mr. Glass, in that role, signed off on Abacus, which was created specifically for the hedge fund to short subprime mortgages. Mr. Paulson handpicked some of the underlying investments in the derivative. The government, in its complaint, claimed that Goldman had ''misstated and omitted key facts regarding'' Abacus, including disclosing Mr. Paulson's role in its creation. The firm paid $550 million to settle the case, without admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Paulson was never accused of any wrongdoing. Mr. Glass's recent deposition was for a separate S.E.C. case against Fabrice Tourre, the young Goldman trader who had developed and marketed Abacus to investors. Mr. Tourre, 31, has denied the accusations. The revelation of Mr. Glass's involvement in the Abacus deal could undermine the S.E.C.'s case - or at least prove to be a distracting embarrassment. Perhaps more important, his role once again raises questions about the revolving door between Washington and Wall Street at a time when public distrust about the agency and its lack of enforcement action against the culprits of the crisis is running high. ''There are a lot of talented people out there you could hire who weren't necessarily part of the problem,'' said Mary Kreiner Ramirez, a professor at Washburn University School of Law. ''If he was involved in Abacus, how is he supposed to police it?'' It is a common question as the government increasingly looks to fill its ranks with regulatory officials proficient in the language of Wall Street. Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement, was previously the general counsel of Deutsche Bank. The agency tapped Eileen Rominger, the former global chief investment officer at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, as its director of investment management. ''The revolving door is such a dominant fact about the S.E.C.'s culture,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia Law School professor. ''You get people who go to Washington for one to three years and then go back to Wall Street.'' The pattern has been well documented. According to the Project on Government Oversight, 219 former S.E.C. staff members filed 789 ''postemployment statements indicating their intent to represent an outside client before the commission'' from 2006 to 2010. In other words, the one-time government officials are representing Wall Street clients with matters before the agency. While clearly there are questions about whether the public wants someone in government who just came from industry, the opposite argument can be made, too: It may be better to have the fox in the henhouse. President Franklin D. Roosevelt ''justified appointing Joe Kennedy as chairman of the S.E.C. with the line: 'You need to set a thief to catch a thief,' '' said Professor Coffee. ''That is the case for bringing in an industry expert.'' After all, the best way for the government to stay ahead of financial innovations - or at least not fall too far behind - is to employ people who know them best. After the government's bailout of A.I.G., some said the insurer should keep paying bonuses to employees, as they were among the few who understood how to unwind some of the company's complex trades.</text></article>

For the past several weeks, I have been trying to understand if Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, could have perjured himself - as Senator Carl Levin has suggested - when he testified last year in front of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and declared, ''We didn't have a massive short against the housing market.'' Based on the subcommittee's report, which was referred to the Justice Department, I wrote a column raising questions about Mr. Blankfein's comments. At the time, his testimony seemed ridiculous in the face of evidence that Mr. Levin presented, which showed that the firm had regularly made large bets against the subprime market. But upon further reporting - talking with executives at Goldman, who pointed me to other documents, and with officials in Washington, and then poring through the report, following the footnotes to the original sources and then cross-referencing them against other public records - I have come to a different and perhaps unsatisfying conclusion for those readers looking for a big scalp: Mr. Blankfein wasn't lying. That's not to suggest Goldman always behaved well. There are other assertions in the subcommittee's report that detail some pretty egregious activity by certain executives. But after comparing the report with publicly available filings and documents, there are enough questions about the accuracy of certain parts of the Senate report to raise some red flags. Take this example: The report unequivocally states that in 2007, Goldman ''reported net revenues of $11.6 billion, of which $3.7 billion was generated by the structured products group in the mortgage department, primarily as a result of its subprime investment activities.'' The sentence was meant to show that Goldman's shorting of the housing market had provided a large percentage of the firm's revenue that year. The sentence in the report even included a handy citation for the information. But in 2007, Goldman Sachs reported net revenue of $45.98 billion, not $11.6 billion. That's a big difference. When I spoke to Robert L. Roach, a counsel and chief investigator for the Senate subcommittee who helped draft the report, he said, ''We made a mistake.'' He said it was a ''typo'' and insisted that ''we weren't trying to cook anything.'' The figure was Goldman's net earnings, not its net revenue. He pointed out that later in the report - 93 pages later in a different context - the report accurately described Goldman's net revenue as $45.98 billion. Mr. Roach protested that Goldman had never brought the mistake to his attention in the two months since the report was published. There has clearly been much antagonism between Goldman and the various bodies investigating the firm, even as Goldman says it is cooperating. Staff members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission complained when Goldman dumped hundreds of thousands of documents on it; Goldman said privately that the commission was engaging in political theater. Yet there are other sections in the Senate report that appear to go beyond sloppiness. The report says that Goldman's structured products group made $3.7 billion, mostly by going short in 2007. That is correct. But the report omitted the total net revenue for the mortgage department, which included structured products. According to a document Goldman Sachs provided to the subcommittee and made public on its Web site a year ago, Goldman had ''less than $500 million of net revenue from residential mortgage-related products - approximately 1 percent of the firm's overall net revenues.'' In other words, while one part of the department had gone short, another part had gone long. So when Mr. Blankfein contended that the firm was ''not consistently or significantly net 'short the market' in residential mortgage-related products in 2007 and 2008'' the numbers - if you believe them - are on his side. Mr. Roach said he was unaware of where the figure of less than $500 million came from, although in the document that Goldman provided the subcommittee, a series of bar charts broke down its exposure for every quarter of 2007 and 2008. Mr. Roach pointed to a different document that showed the firm had made $1.13 billion.</text></article>

The Wall Street investment bank has received a subpoena from the office of the Manhattan district attorney, which is investigating Goldman's role in the financial crisis, said one person familiar with the subpoena. It comes amid increased enforcement scrutiny of the company, which has faced blistering criticism that it shorted - or bet against - the mortgage market before it collapsed and that it knowingly sold bundles of bad mortgages to its clients. Goldman denies these accusations. The inquiry stems from a 650-page Senate report from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations that indicated Goldman had misled clients and Congress about its practices related to mortgage-linked securities. Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who led the Congressional inquiry, had sent his findings to the Justice Department to figure out whether executives broke the law. The agency said it was reviewing the report. The subpoena means several government agencies may be running parallel, and possibly competing, investigations. The subpoena arrived Friday and is limited to ground covered in the Senate report, said the person familiar with it, who was not authorized to speak on the record. Subpoenas are requests for information and do not necessarily mean charges against Goldman or individuals at the company are inevitable. Still, the development of a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., did not seem to surprise investors. ''This news is not unexpected,'' Christopher Maimone, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research, wrote in a note to clients, explaining that Senator Levin's referral had made continued investigations a near certainty. Still, shares of Goldman fell $1.79, or 1.3 percent, to close at $134.38, though earlier in the day, before investors digested the news, its shares fell as much as 3.5 percent. Goldman shares traded above $170 at the beginning of the year. Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who has run the company since 2006, has privately told people recently that he has no plans to leave the company and wants to see it through this difficult period. Still, the recent subpoenas are sure to resurrect calls for a change at the top. ''You would have to think that the more these types of headlines persist, the greater pressure there will be for change,'' said William Tanona, an analyst at the investment bank UBS. He has previously worked at Goldman Sachs. Whatever the outcome of the investigations, investors do not expect Goldman itself to be indicted. No firm has ever survived such a blow. E. F. Hutton &amp; Company and Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed after being indicted in the 1980s before the cases even went to trial. Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said in a note to investors on Tuesday that he believed that the government might seek to reach a settlement with Goldman. ''In a worst case environment, we would expect a 'too big to fail' bank such as Goldman to be offered a deferred-prosecution agreement, pay a significant fine and submit to a federal monitor in lieu of a criminal charge,'' he wrote. The subpoena came almost two weeks after lawyers for Goldman Sachs met with the office of the attorney general of New York for an ''exploratory'' meeting about the Senate report, the people said. In a statement, Goldman Sachs said: ''We don't comment on specific regulatory or legal issues, but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate fully.'' Goldman was one of the survivors of the financial crisis. But it has come under fire from the public and Washington since then. It was first attacked for its outsize pay packages, which came at a time when most of America was still reeling from the crisis. Then, in April 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil fraud suit against the company. Goldman was accused of creating a mortgage product that was intended to fail. The company settled with the S.E.C., agreeing to pay $550 million without admitting or denying guilt. It was one of the darkest chapters in the company's 142-year history, and it catapulted Goldman into the public spotlight, a place the secretive company was unaccustomed to. Rolling Stone magazine, hardly a first read on Wall Street, began writing regularly about the firm, calling it a ''vampire squid.''

Case Stands Out Because It Stands Alone<date>Published: June 1, 2011</date><text>At the height of the housing boom, the 26th floor of Goldman Sachs's former headquarters on Broad Street in Lower Manhattan was the nerve center of Goldman's fast-growing mortgage trading business. Hundreds of employees worked closely in teams, devising mortgage-based securities -- billions of dollars' worth -- that were examined by lawyers, approved by management, then sold to investors like hedge funds, commercial banks and insurance companies. At one trading desk sat Fabrice Tourre, a midlevel 28-year-old Frenchman who was little known not just outside Goldman but even inside the firm. That changed three years later, in 2010, when he achieved the dubious distinction of becoming the only individual at Goldman and across Wall Street sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for helping to sell a mortgage-securities investment, in one of the hundreds of mortgage deals created during the bubble years. How Mr. Tourre alone came to be the face of mortgage-securities fraud has raised questions among former prosecutors and Congressional officials about how aggressive and thorough the government's investigations have been into Wall Street's role in the mortgage crisis. Across the industry, ''it's impossible that only one person was involved with fraudulent activities in connection to the sales of these mortgage securities,'' said G. Oliver Koppell, a New York attorney general in the 1990s and now a New York City councilman. In the fall of 2009, when Mr. Tourre learned that he had become a target of investigators for helping to sell a mortgage security called Abacus, he protested that he had not acted alone. That fall, his lawyers drafted private responses to the S.E.C., maintaining that Mr. Tourre was part of a ''collaborative effort'' at Goldman, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The lawyer added that the commission's view of his role ''would have Mr. Tourre engaged in a grand deception of practically everyone'' involved in the mortgage deal. Indeed, numerous other colleagues also worked on that mortgage security. And that deal was just one of nearly two dozen similar deals totaling $10.9 billion that Goldman devised from 2004 to 2007 -- which in turn were similar to more than $100 billion of such securities deals created by other Wall Street firms during that period. While Goldman paid $550 million last year to settle accusations that it had misled investors who bought the Abacus mortgage security, no other individuals at the bank have been named. Now, however, as criticism has grown about the lack of cases brought by regulators, the scope of the inquiries appears to be widening. The United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., has said publicly that his lawyers were reviewing possible charges against other Goldman officials in the wake of a Senate investigation that produced reams of documentsdetailing other questionable decisions that were made in the firm's mortgage unit. The Senate inquiry was one of several in the past three years. These investigations by Congressional leaders and bankruptcy trustees -- into the likes of Washington Mutual, Lehman Brothers and the ratings agencies -- were undertaken largely to understand what had gone wrong in the crisis, rather than for law enforcement. Yet they uncovered evidence that could be a road map for federal officials as they decide whether to bring civil and criminal cases. One person who already has come under investigation is Jonathan M. Egol. A senior trader at Goldman who worked closely with Mr. Tourre, he had a negative view on the housing market early on, and took a lead role in creating mortgage securities like Abacus that enabled Goldman and certain clients to place bets that proved profitable when the housing market collapsed. Last year the S.E.C. examined Mr. Egol's role in the Abacus deal in its lawsuit, according to a report by the commission's inspector general. But Mr. Egol, now a managing director at the bank, was not named in the case, in part because he was more discreet in his e-mails than Mr. Tourre was, so there was less evidence against him, according to a person with knowledge of the S.E.C.'s case.</text></article>

Gretchen Morgenson reported in The Times on Tuesday that Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, wants to discuss mortgage operations during the housing bubble with executives of Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. He has also requested documents and information from the banks, examined material given to his predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, and studied issues raised in lawsuits against the banks. Mr. Schneiderman would not comment on the investigation. What is needed is a broad inquiry into how banks inflated the housing bubble, profiting as it expanded and getting bailed out when it burst -- leaving investors and homeowners devastated. Any serious investigation must take a close look at ''securitization'' -- the pooling of thousands of home loans into securities that were sold to investors the world over. Three years after it all imploded -- and even after Congress vowed to get answers and names -- Americans still don't have answers to vitally important questions. Topping the list: Did the big banks know (if not, why not?) that billions in loans and related securities were destined to fail? Did they intentionally mislead investors and insurers or were they just incompetent? An investigation must also figure out the extent of wrongdoing in Wall Street practices that fed the securitization pipeline. By extending credit to mortgage lenders, Wall Street allowed them to make loans far longer than they otherwise could have. Did Wall Street purposely inflate the bubble when it enabled loans to uncreditworthy borrowers for unreasonably priced homes? All indications are that last year's robo-signing scandal, in which banks were found to have filed false court documents in foreclosure cases, was just the tip of an iceberg. A growing body of Congressional testimony, academic research, court cases and other evidence suggests pervasive defects, and potentially vast lawbreaking, in the securitization and foreclosure process. It has also been suggested that federal and state officials have ignored or played down allegations of widespread illegality, a charge that is all too easy to believe. A recent federal investigation into banks' foreclosure abuses ended with a wrist slap. Talks between state attorneys general and banks over those abuses appear hamstrung, in part, by the apparent failure of state officials to do a thorough investigation on which to base demands for meaningful reforms and stiff penalties. It is critical that someone stand up and say ''no'' to allegations that go unexamined, to wrongdoing without redress. Mr. Schneiderman, it's up to you.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/business/17bank.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">N.Y. State Investigates Banks’ Role in Fiscal Crisis<date>Published: May 16, 2011</date><text>The New York attorney general has requested information and documents in recent weeks from three major Wall Street banks about their mortgage securities operations during the credit boom, indicating the existence of a new investigation into practices that contributed to billions in mortgage losses.Officials in Eric T. Schneiderman’s office have also requested meetings with representatives from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. The inquiry appears to be quite broad, with the attorney general’s requests for information covering many aspects of the banks’ loan pooling operations. They bundled thousands of home loans into securities that were then sold to investors such as pension funds, mutual funds and insurance companies. It is unclear which parts of the byzantine securitization process Mr. Schneiderman is focusing on. His spokesman said the attorney general would not comment on the investigation, which is in its early stages. Several civil suits have been filed by federal and state regulators since the financial crisis erupted in 2008, some of which have generated settlements and fines, most prominently a $550 million deal between Goldman Sachs and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But even more questions have been raised in private lawsuits filed against the banks by investors and others who say they were victimized by questionable securitization practices. Some litigants have contended, for example, that the banks dumped loans they knew to be troubled into securities and then misled investors about the quality of those underlying mortgages when selling the investments. The possibility has also been raised that the banks did not disclose to mortgage insurers the risks in the instruments they were agreeing to insure against default. Another potential area of inquiry — the billions of dollars in credit extended by Wall Street to aggressive mortgage lenders that allowed them to continue making questionable loans far longer than they otherwise could have done. “Part of what prosecutors have the advantage of doing right now, here as elsewhere, is watching the civil suits play out as different parties fight over who bears the loss,” said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of law at Columbia. “That’s a very productive source of information.” Officials at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs declined to comment about the investigation; Morgan Stanley did not respond to a request for comment. During the mortgage boom, Wall Street firms bundled hundreds of billions of dollars in home loans into securities that they sold profitably to investors. After the real estate bubble burst, the perception took hold that the securitization process as performed by the major investment banks contributed to the losses generated in the crisis. Critics contend that Wall Street’s securitization machine masked the existence of risky home loans and encouraged reckless lending because pooling the loans and selling them off allowed many participants to avoid responsibility for the losses that followed. The requests for information by Mr. Schneiderman’s office also seem to confirm that the New York attorney general is operating independently of peers from other states who are negotiating a broad settlement with large banks over foreclosure practices. By opening a new inquiry into bank practices, Mr. Schneiderman has indicated his unwillingness to accept one of the settlement’s terms proposed by financial institutions — that is, a broad agreement by regulators not to conduct additional investigations into the banks’ activities during the mortgage crisis. Mr. Schneiderman has said in recent weeks that signing such a release was unacceptable. It is unclear whether Mr. Schneiderman’s investigation will be pursued as a criminal or civil matter. In the last few months, the office’s staff has been expanding. In March, Marc B. Minor, former head of the securities division for the New Jersey attorney general, was named bureau chief of the investor protection unit in the New York attorney general’s office. Early in the financial crisis, Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York who preceded Mr. Schneiderman as attorney general, began investigating Wall Street’s role in the debacle. But those inquiries did not result in any cases filed against the major banks. Nevertheless, some material turned over to Mr. Cuomo’s investigators may turn out to be helpful to Mr. Schneiderman’s inquiry.The New York attorney general has requested information and documents in recent weeks from three major Wall Street banks about their mortgage securities operations during the credit boom, indicating the existence of a new investigation into practices that contributed to billions in mortgage losses.</text></article>

While the clubby culture remains, the tight-knit group has lost its viselike grip on the company, as the wishes of the insular partnership have given way to the demands of the outside shareholders. The roughly 480 partners currently own less than 10 percent of the company, down from approximately 60 percent at the initial public offering in 1999. Their power base may soon erode further. Senior Goldman executives are considering whether to cull partner-heavy divisions like investment banking, according to people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak on the record. The diminished influence of the partnership has forced Goldman, albeit begrudgingly, to shed some of its secretive corporate personality, especially in recent years as its opaque business model has come under scrutiny in Washington. Although a small cadre of executives still steers strategy and runs the day-to-day operations, the financial firm now must act more like other publicly traded companies, responding to criticism over pay, adjusting strategy to placate shareholders and dealing with outspoken activists at annual meetings - all of which was unheard of a decade ago. Girish Reddy, a Goldman partner who left in 2002, said the firm initially underestimated the public scrutiny that would come with an offering. ''Not only was the partnership ownership high, but Goldman didn't have a lot of products they offered to Main Street America,'' said Mr. Reddy, a founder of the hedge fund Prisma Capital Partners. ''They didn't have to be as transparent as others.'' At the time of the market debut, Goldman's public relations department had just a handful of people. Reporters used to call Ed Novotny, the firm's top spokesman at the time, Ed ''No Comment'' Novotny for his default response to most questions about the company. Today, the team has swelled to dozens of employees, and Goldman has tried to be more vocal, particularly when it believes the company has been maligned. After Foreign Policy magazine published an article last month with the headline ''How Goldman Sachs Created the Food Crisis,'' a top communications executive, Lucas van Praag, wrote a letter to the editor in the firm's defense. In regards to the partnership, a spokesman for Goldman, David Wells, said the group had not ''diminished in terms of its leadership of Goldman.'' He added that investment banking had always had a disproportionate amount of partners ''as it is more dependent upon senior relationships'' and that suggesting the division was partner-heavy ''ignores the deliberate structure and makeup of the business.'' Most financial companies shed the private partnerships after their I.P.O.'s, transferring the bulk of the ownership to shareholders. But Goldman, the last of the major Wall Street firms to go public, maintained a hybrid model, in part as an incentive for top employees. The original class - of which 39 remain today although one is no longer a partner - created the modern Goldman. The group has produced all of the firm's chief executives since the offering, most recently Lloyd C. Blankfein. The leading contenders and dark-horse candidates to succeed him have also been partners since the I.P.O., including Gary D. Cohn, the firm's president; Michael S. Sherwood and J. Michael Evans, both vice chairmen; David B. Heller, the co-head of equities; and Yoel Zaoui, a top investment banker. For the first time, though, the board could reach into a younger generation, tapping executives like Harvey M. Schwartz, Edward K. Eisler and Pablo J. Salame, also co-heads of equities - all of whom were not among the original partnership class. The former partners have become a powerful force on Wall Street and beyond. For example, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former chief executive at Goldman, and Kendrick R. Wilson III, a senior banker, took on major roles in federal agencies, prompting the moniker Government Sachs during the financial crisis.</text></article>

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, insisted at a Congressional hearing last year. Ever since, politicians, pundits and professors have been calling him a liar. Goldman Sachs, his critics contend, escaped relatively unscathed largely because the bank saw the apocalypse coming and moved to profit from it. This narrative might feel like well-trodden territory. But the sometimes mind-numbing 650-page report on the financial crisis published last week by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations offers a stark conclusion: Goldman Sachs executives did not tell the whole truth. Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, is so convinced that Mr. Blankfein and his colleagues ''misled'' Congress that he wants to refer the matter to the Justice Department to figure out whether Goldman executives broke the law. While prosecutors will have to determine the potential legal implications, the evidence amassed by the Congressional subcommittee increasingly shows that Goldman bet against the mortgage market -- and did so successfully. It wasn't just a ''hedge.'' Why then has Goldman tried to spin it into a different story? ''I cannot figure out why they keep denying it,'' said William D. Cohan, the author of the new book, ''Money and Power: How Goldman Sachs Came to Rule the World,'' and a columnist for NYTimes.com. His best explanation is that ''given the political dynamics that we're living in the moment, they'd rather be perceived as being as dumb as everybody else.'' Perhaps chest-beating about your genius at a time when the rest of Wall Street -- and the nation -- is doing so poorly might seem unbecoming. But it sure seems better than people publicly questioning your integrity. The findings of the Congressional report are straightforward and damning. The Senate subcommittee said it found the phrase ''net short'' some 3,400 times in documents from Goldman related to the mortgage market. For example, the company wrote in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission that ''during most of 2007, we maintained a net short subprime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market.'' In September 2007, Goldman told employees that ''we were overall net short the mortgage market and thus had very strong results.'' Now, compare that to a statement from the bank in 2010: ''Goldman Sachs did not take a large directional 'bet' against the U.S. housing market.'' Reading those quotes back-to-back is the equivalent of hearing someone declaring it is raining when it is a sunny day with clear blue skies. It just doesn't make sense. The confusion continues today. ''The testimony we gave was truthful and accurate and this is confirmed by the subcommittee's own report,'' Goldman said in a recent statement. ''We did not have a massive net short position because our short positions were largely offset by our long positions, and our financial results clearly demonstrate this point.'' To defend its stance, the bank notes that in 2007 it was short the mortgage market $3.8 billion and long $3.3 billion. In Goldman's mind, those positions were simply hedges - and the outcome could have gone either way. But whether through brilliant bets or dumb luck, Goldman Sachs made $500 million from that short. In this case, Goldman was not just offsetting its risk. It was profiting from those bets, and quite a lot. For Goldman to suggest otherwise -- as it has -- is almost silly. Having studied Goldman's statements closely, it appears the firm decided to take a Clintonian approach to parsing its words. Notice that Goldman and Mr. Blankfein always qualify their denials of the firm's short bets by saying they were not ''massive'' or ''large'' or ''consistent.'' Such descriptions may be accurate. What's large, or even massive, may be in the eye of the beholder. To Goldman, a $500 million net short position may seem tiny relative to the rest of the firm's positions. But $500 million is still a lot of money; to the rest of the world it might even seem ''large'' and ''massive.'' Goldman's other qualifier -- about its positions not being consistent -- is also true. There were times that Goldman was not net short and there times when the firm tried to reduce its short positions. But semantics should not be the issue. Goldman should be proud of its prescient call about housing. It was better for its shareholders, and frankly better for the taxpayers, that the firm was smart enough to short the mortgage market. After all, Goldman didn't require a big bailout like Citigroup or the American International Group. As Josh Birnbaum, a former star trader at Goldman who pushed that short position, told Mr. Cohan, ''The net result of the mortgage department in 2007 was a record year. Think about that statement: making a record amount in a year when everyone else was losing their shirts.'' So Goldman, take a bow. Don't hide behind the curtain. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Blankfein when he eventually steps aside as chief executive of Goldman Sachs?The speculation may be more than idle gossip for bored bankers. Two friends of Mr. Blankfein, 56, say he has told them since last summer that he is exhausted from leading the company through the financial crisis and that he would consider stepping down when he could do so gracefully, without the move appearing to be anything but voluntary. The choice of Goldman’s next chief could signal the firm’s direction and influence the broader thinking on Wall Street, where Goldman often sets the tone. For decades, Goldman’s leaders came from its investment banking unit, which provided business strategy and merger advice to blue-chip companies. Mr. Blankfein, in contrast, was a commodities trader, and his ascension furthered the company’s makeover as a trading powerhouse. To be sure, Mr. Blankfein may decide to stay a while, despite the chatter to the contrary. And as far as Goldman is concerned, Mr. Blankfein is not going anywhere. A spokesman for the firm, Lucas van Praag, declined to comment other than to note that Mr. Blankfein “says he has never felt so energetic and has no plans to retire.” Even with its reputation tarnished by a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit last year, Goldman remains the world’s most powerful investment bank, with its own mystique on Wall Street. It is a training ground for government officials and hedge fund managers alike, and its powerful alumni network extends its influence. While other eminent financial companies, like Merrill Lynch, were crushed by the collapse of housing prices and lost of tens of billions with a wager on subprime mortgage debt, Goldman actually spotted the threat early and made a bet against the housing market, racking up sizable gains. Even as its traditional archrival Morgan Stanley struggles with a stagnant stock price, Goldman shares are up more than 20 percent over the last two years. When Goldman reports earnings Tuesday, analysts expect a profit of about $443 million, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters, although the latest results will be depressed by the bank’s plans to repurchase Warren E. Buffett’s $5 billion investment. Like George Steinbrenner in his stewardship of the New York Yankees, whoever is at the top of Goldman cuts an outsize figure among peers. Two recent chiefs — Robert E. Rubin and Henry M. Paulson Jr. — went on to become secretary of the Treasury, and another, Jon S. Corzine, later was a senator from New Jersey, and then governor of the state. What is more, Mr. Blankfein, who assumed the top job in 2006, is one of only two chief executives of major banks who were at the helm before the financial crisis and remain in charge today. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is the other. The top candidates to succeed Mr. Blankfein, according to three people briefed on the situation, are all company veterans, and they illustrate Goldman’s global reach. One of them, Michael S. Sherwood, is British and oversees a broad swath of the firm’s international business from London. Another, J. Michael Evans, a Canadian and winner of an Olympic gold medal in rowing, is chairman of Goldman’s Asian business. (Mr. Sherwood and Mr. Evans are both vice chairmen of the firm.) The final contender, Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president and chief operating officer, is Mr. Blankfein’s top deputy in New York. No favorite seems clear, but that is not unusual at Goldman. Several former partners and analysts said they would be surprised to see an outsider selected. And whether or not Mr. Blankfein leaves soon — his urgency seems to have faded with the passing of the storm around Goldman, two people close to him said — he has been there long enough to justify focusing on a succession plan, analysts said. Roger Freeman, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said Mr. Blankfein might wait to see his firm through the final negotiations with Washington over new regulatory rules for the banking industry in the second half of 2011, before handing Goldman to a younger team in 2012. “This has been an exhausting period,” Mr. Freeman said. “It would not be a surprising time to see a change.” As the economy stumbled, Goldman’s success brought harsh public criticism, as lawmakers and even some clients complained that Goldman was no longer putting clients first. 1 2 Next Page »From the canyons of Wall Street to the City of London and beyond to Hong Kong, an intense guessing-game has begun: who will succeed Lloyd C.

As the insider trading case of Mr. Rajaratnam enters its sixth week, the trial has captivated Wall Street as a suspenseful, complex financial version of ''Law &amp; Order'' that could have a cliffhanger ending. But John Dowd, his lawyer, could have his work cut out for him persuading the jury. Sitting in the gallery on the 17th floor of the federal courthouse in Manhattan on Monday - seats away from Mr. Rajaratnam - it struck me just how much evidence they have to overcome. ''I heard yesterday from somebody who's on the board of Goldman Sachs that they are going to lose $2 per share,'' Mr. Rajaratnam said to an employee on a taped telephone conversation that was played for the jury. In another recorded call, he is heard telling a friend that he bought a certain stock because he was sure it would go up. Why was he so certain? ''We know because one of our guys is on the board,'' he explained. And in another tape-recorded call, Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund executive, told Mr. Rajaratnam very specifically about Akamai Technologies' coming earnings: ''They're going to guide down. I just got a call from my guy.'' When this case was first brought, Wall Street was aflutter with anxiety that the government was expanding the definition of insider trading. The trial was seen as a moment that would show how the government planned to police modern Wall Street as more and more information poured into the system. It was supposed to redefine the law around ''expert networks,'' those paid services that investors use to gain an edge, and ''channel checks,'' which investors use to ferret out information from suppliers and clients. But the case against Mr. Rajaratnam isn't about a new form of insider trading. It is whether what happened was old-fashioned insider trading - passing blatant, black-and-white tips that gave a trading advantage. Over and over, witnesses with inside information testified to breaking the law to provide Mr. Rajaratnam with details of coming announcements and transactions. Despite the Galleon Group's $6 billion under management, high-priced real estate and supposed analysts, witnesses have painted a picture of Mr. Rajaratnam's firm as one that disregarded insider trading laws as standard operating procedure. So far, the defense has hardly tried to refute the evidence; instead, it has relied on an effort to confuse the jury about what constitutes inside information. I attended court the day that Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer questioned Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, about information from a board meeting that prosecutors say was relayed to Mr. Rajaratnam by Rajat Gupta, a Goldman director at the time. The lawyer quizzed Mr. Blankfein about whether Goldman's board ever discussed issues that were in the public domain, as if to suggest that the line between inside information and public information was never a bright line. The lawyer trotted out an example: Goldman's board discussed Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy after the bankruptcy had been announced. Gotcha! Mr. Blankfein tried to explain that Goldman's board often discussed news that had been reported in the press, but that the board's internal conversations about that news was confidential and could be important, material information if shared with the public. Why the judge allowed such a line of interrogation was a question asked by spectators in the courtroom. On Monday, the defense was back with a new line of questioning. It sought to undermine the credibility of the prosecution's witness, who had pleaded guilty to insider trading at Galleon. When questioned by a lawyer before his crimes were exposed, the defense pointed out, the witness had said that he ''was not aware of any insider trading at Galleon.'' Almost no one, of course, would have admitted to that before having been charged. This case differs from the trials of L. Dennis Kozlowski, John Rigas and others that I have covered. In those trials, the outcome was not clear because much of the evidence was murkier. There were no tapes. Documents presented by the two sides seemed to contradict each other. Both Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Rigas were convicted and sentenced to jail terms, but before their guilty verdicts came, it wasn't certain that the government's ''proof'' would be enough. Why Mr. Rajaratnam decided to fight the case, with so many witnesses in taped conversation with him, is a mystery. I'm left thinking he must have decided that he had nothing to lose and that if his lawyers could persuade just one juror, it would be worth going to trial. But I'm still glad I'm not his lawyer.

Blankfein, testified on Wednesday in the insider-trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, who before his arrest in 2009 was among the most powerful hedge fund managers on Wall Street. It was a unusual role for the Goldman chief executive, who has had audiences with presidents, foreign leaders and chieftains of the world's largest companies. But on Wednesday, he was addressing a jury of New Yorkers - including teachers, transit workers and the unemployed - all of whom said they had never heard of Mr. Blankfein during the jury selection process. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed Mr. Blankfein to testify in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, the co-founder of the Galleon Group who is facing up to 25 years in prison on charges that he earned $45 million trading on illegal stock tips. Among those the government says conspired with Mr. Rajaratnam was Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman director who has been accused of giving Mr. Rajaratnam highly sensitive information about the bank's board meetings during the financial crisis. In his testimony, Mr. Blankfein said that board members including Mr. Gupta had been privy to such information, which was not meant to be discussed with anyone outside Goldman. Details of board meetings, if leaked before public announcements, have the potential to move a company's stock price, and thus can be valuable to outside investors. Azam Ahmed and Guilbert Gates/The New York Times Click on the above graphic to get a visual overview of the Galleon information network It is extremely rare for a chief executive of a major Wall Street firm to testify in a criminal trial. The nearest precedent is in 1990, during the insider trading scandals of that era, when Frederick H. Joseph, the former chief executive of Drexel Burnham Lambert, testified in a presentencing hearing for Michael R. Milken, the financier who served prison time for securities violations. Mr. Blankfein, a former tax lawyer, appeared at ease on the witness stand, smiling periodically throughout his testimony. Judge Richard J. Holwell's courtroom, just a mile away from Goldman's headquarters in Manhattan, proved to be a much friendlier location than where Mr. Blankfein last testified under oath. Last April, he sat before a panel of senators on Capitol Hill who vilified him and accused Goldman of unfairly profiting at the expense of its customers. Mr. Blankfein defended the bank to less than rave reviews. The prosecution proceeded with caution in its questioning, apparently so that the jury would not view him as a wealthy banking executive who had played a role in the financial crisis. On Tuesday, prosecutors had expressed concern that testimony about the crisis could unfairly prejudice the jury against him. Mr. Blankfein, 56, was asked where he grew up (Brooklyn) and what high school he had attended (Thomas Jefferson). The prosecutor, Andrew Michaelson, then asked Mr. Blankfein if he attended college. ''Yes,'' he replied. Left unmentioned were the executive's undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. The government and Mr. Blankfein also avoided mentioning the phrase ''financial crisis.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein described September 2008 as ''a volatile period in the market,'' saying that it was ''a dangerous time'' that ''made us nervous.'' There was also ''riskiness'' and a ''general insecurity,'' he said. Dressed in a dark suit and royal blue tie, Mr. Blankfein revealed several details about his role as the chief executive of the world's largest investment bank. He checks the bank's profit and loss statement every day, he said, but typically ignores the daily e-mail on the statement, and instead prefers to listen to it on a daily voice mail. In addition to the Goldman board's regularly scheduled board meetings, Mr. Blankfein says he makes ''just-checking-in calls'' to outside directors. His relaxed countenance on the witness stand belied the fact that he was forced to relive the last months of 2008, the most challenging time in Goldman's 142-year-history. It was during that period that the government says the former director, Mr. Gupta, told Mr. Rajaratnam about Goldman board meetings. During a meeting in October 2008, Mr. Blankfein told the board that the bank's performance was exceptionally weak and was on track to post its first quarterly loss as a public company. The prosecutor asked Mr. Blankfein what was happening then. ''We were losing money,'' he said. ''What was the significance of that?'' the prosecutor asked. ''We generally make money,'' Mr. Blankfein said, smirking.</text></article>

Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director accused by the government of passing insider information about the Wall Street firm, had tried to resign from the Goldman board in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis, only weeks before he is said to have provided the tips to the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. According to a new audiotape recording released by federal prosecutors late Friday, Mr. Gupta sought to leave the Goldman board to take a job as a senior adviser at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm led by Henry R. Kravis, a friend of Mr. Gupta's. The recording also suggests that Mr. Gupta may have been having personal troubles at the time he is accused of passing the tips. The tape offers an unusual window into Mr. Gupta's world during the time that the government says he tipped off Mr. Rajaratnam. The case is being zealously tracked by corporate America's top echelon because of Mr. Gupta's deep connections at the highest levels: he ran McKinsey &amp; Company, the prestigious consulting firm, for a decade and served on several prominent boards, including those of Procter &amp; Gamble and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines. On Sept. 9, 2008, Mr. Gupta submitted a formal resignation letter to Goldman, a person briefed on the recording said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But the firm's executives, including its chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, persuaded him to stay on the board because they thought that it would send the markets a bad message to have a director resign as a financial crisis was exploding. Two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends, Mr. Gupta told Mr. Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman before it was publicly announced the next day. The S.E.C. also says Mr. Gupta swapped confidential Goldman information with Mr. Rajaratnam two other times during 2008. In each case, Mr. Rajaratnam traded illegally on the tips, the S.E.C. says. A lawyer for Mr. Gupta has denied the charges. Mr. Gupta eventually did not stand for re-election from Goldman's board and stepped down when his term ended in May 2010. The news of Mr. Gupta's resignation letter to Goldman's board in 2008 was hinted at in the audiotape of a telephone conversation on Aug. 15, 2008, between Mr. Rajaratnam and Anil Kumar, both friends of Mr. Gupta's and confirmed by people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Kumar, a former executive at McKinsey, has pleaded guilty to insider trading and testified last week as a government witness in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. On the nine-minute call released by prosecutors, the two men discuss Mr. Gupta's family, Goldman, K.K.R. and his role as chairman of New Silk Route Partners, a private equity firm, which in some cases competes with Goldman for deals. ''Goldman is one board right,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says on the recording. ''And he's, you know, he's essentially an observer status, right? He's not in there, you know, rolling up his sleeves.'' Later he added: ''And the issue is the perceived conflict of interest.'' The two also suggest that one reason for Mr. Gupta's decision to leave the Goldman board in 2010 was a post he had taken at K.K.R. in 2008. ''But is it really that he was so greedy for the $12 million that K.K.R. has offered him?'' Mr. Kumar asks on the recording. Mr. Rajaratnam said that ''he ran the numbers with me, right, it was about $5 million a year with upside.'' A K.K.R. spokesman said that Mr. Gupta worked for the firm as a senior adviser and the compensation numbers discussed by Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar were inaccurate. Mr. Gupta stepped down as a K.K.R. adviser this month after the S.E.C.'s action against him. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the recording. Later in the conversation, Mr. Rajaratnam further speculates on why Mr. Gupta took the position at K.K.R. and decided to leave Goldman. ''My analysis of the situation is he's enamored with Kravis, and I think he wants to be in that circle,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says. ''That's a billionaire circle, right? Goldman is like the hundreds of millions circle, right?'' He added: ''And I think here he sees the opportunity to make $100 million over the next five years or 10 years without doing a lot of work.'' Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar also seem worried about their friend. ''At some point, what I worry about is that there can be this massive implosion in him,'' Mr. Kumar said. ''He didn't seem comfortable,'' Mr. Rajaratnam said. ''He seemed like he was tormented, right?'' The second week of Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal insider trading trial begins on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The first two minutes of the nine-minute recording were presented on Friday as evidence of insider trading in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial.

Case<date>Published: March 8, 2011</date><text>The fact pattern looks bad, very bad. Seconds after Rajat K. Gupta, then a director of Goldman Sachs, finished up a board call during which he learned that Warren E. Buffett had agreed to invest $5 billion in the firm, he picked up the phone and called his friend Raj Rajaratnam, regulators contend. Minutes later, Mr. Rajaratnam placed bets on shares of Goldman Sachs that netted his firm, the Galleon Group, $900,000. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Mr. Gupta of insider trading last week, says this happened not once, but repeatedly. He did the same thing at Procter &amp; Gamble, where he was also a director, the S.E.C. claims. Exactly what was said on these phone calls remains unknown. But if the S.E.C. proves its case, then Mr. Gupta, a respected management guru who once ran McKinsey &amp; Company and advised the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was routinely ''disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets.'' Yet there is something curious about the accusations against Mr. Gupta, which came just days before Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal trial, which is set to begin on Tuesday. Given the seriousness of the claims - insider trading by an executive who had reached the upper echelons of corporate America - why not bring criminal charges against Mr. Gupta? Well, that's where the facts of the case get a little mushy, and they are starting to raise some questions among lawyers about the S.E.C.'s motivations. ''This is very unusual. It's a red flag,'' Kip Weissman, a partner at Luse Gorman Pomerenk &amp; Schick in Washington and a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer, said of the case. Not only has the Justice Department not brought a criminal case, at least not yet, but the S.E.C. decided to bring its case in front of an administrative law judge instead of in a Federal District Court, where a defendant has full discovery rights. The S.E.C. is using a new provision in the Dodd-Frank Act to bring the case this way. ''It's a little easier from an evidentiary perspective,'' Mr. Weissman said, for the S.E.C. to bring the case in front of an administrative judge. ''The evidentiary standard is lower,'' he explained. ''It's certainly noteworthy that the S.E.C. brought the case in this forum.'' Indeed, statistically, it is notable: of the 26 Galleon-related cases the S.E.C. has brought, all have been brought in federal court. None have been brought in front of an administrative judge. As Mr. Weissman asked, somewhat rhetorically, ''Why?'' The S.E.C.'s laundry list of allegations against Mr. Gupta raises some important questions: Since the government had tapped Mr. Rajaratnam's phones, were any of the conversations with Mr. Gupta that were cited by the S.E.C. recorded? It appears not. In one instance, the S.E.C. said ''telephone records and calendar entries'' indicated only that ''Gupta and Rajaratnam very likely had a telephone conversation.'' Since when has ''very likely'' been considered enough to make a civil allegation? Stranger still, nowhere in the S.E.C.'s filing does it contend that Mr. Gupta received any form of compensation for passing along insider trading tips to Mr. Rajaratnam. If that's right, why would Mr. Gupta pass the information? (The S.E.C. does not have to show that Mr. Gupta benefited financially to prove its case.) None of this is to suggest that the circumstantial evidence isn't powerful. But it does raise red flags among legal experts trying to handicap exactly what the government has up its sleeve. The running narrative among defense lawyers is this: The S.E.C. brought its case in front of an administrative judge to discredit Mr. Gupta to help the criminal case against Mr. Rajaratnam. But you have to imagine that if the evidence was truly overwhelming against him, Mr. Gupta might have sought to become a government witness to save himself. (People close to the case suggest that such a settlement offer had been on the table.) Having said all that, there is something mystifying in the statement that Gary Naftalis, Mr. Gupta's lawyer, made the day he was sued. ''Mr. Gupta has done nothing wrong,'' Mr. Naftalis said. ''There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits as part of any quid pro quo.'' Read those words again. He didn't say Mr. Gupta didn't pass on material nonpublic information or that he didn't breach his fiduciary duty. All he said was that his client wasn't getting paid to do so. Maybe Mr. Naftalis was going only for a short sound bite, but it is odd. In October, Alan Lafley, the former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, described Mr. Gupta thusly. ''I think of him like Thomas Aquinas,'' the philosopher and priest. The S.E.C. allegations may make him seem less like a saint, but not much like a sinner - at least not yet. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, was accused of insider trading by the S.E.C. last week.

Many economists think he should be the next person to run it.But among government leaders in Berlin and Paris, where many of Europe’s most important decisions are made, Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, generates a palpable lack of enthusiasm. A longtime central banker with sterling qualifications, Mr. Draghi has been put forward as a front-runner to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet after he steps down as president of the central bank in October. But at a pivotal moment for the euro monetary union, France and Germany want to make sure that the bank’s next leader will have as steady a hand at the helm as any German would. Germany is also reluctant to surrender its de facto right to name the next president. French officials are among those expressing reservations about Mr. Draghi because he was an executive at Goldman Sachs from 2002 to 2005. The investment bank was the lead manager for a 2001 derivatives transaction that allowed Greece to dress up its books in a way that brought it into the euro club. As he tries to win more support, Mr. Draghi is unequivocal about where his priority lies: fighting inflation. Monetary policy at the European Central Bank should “first and foremost be geared toward price stability,” Mr. Draghi emphasized in an interview on Thursday. His supporters say that Mr. Draghi seems to be the only one of the candidates mentioned so far who would not face a steep learning curve — a crucial consideration when euro zone countries are besieged by market speculators and Europe could easily fall back into another financial crisis like the one that hit the Continent last year. As an influential member of the European Central Bank’s governing council and chairman of a panel that is rewriting the rules for global banks, Mr. Draghi is a familiar face at meetings of the Group of 20 leading economies and other international forums. He would have immediate credibility in dealings with his counterparts at the Federal Reserve or the Bank of China. “Mario Draghi is the most qualified candidate,” said Nouriel Roubini, the economist, expressing a commonly held view in the profession. Mr. Draghi was favored by 29 of 45 economists polled by Reuters this month, compared with just six votes for the No. 2 candidate, Erkki Liikanen, the governor of the Bank of Finland. Behind the scenes, Mr. Draghi’s supporters have already begun a quiet but determined campaign to make him the default choice. Romano Prodi, a former prime minister of Italy, described Mr. Draghi as highly discreet. He noted that he was more comfortable in the world of central banking than in the limelight. “As a person, he is reserved,” Mr. Prodi said. “I’m not joking when I tell you he was born a central banker.” But politics can often trump experience in Europe, which has a history of choosing second-tier candidates, notably Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, who remains little known among the general public. Baroque political maneuvering is nothing new to Mr. Draghi, who is seen in Italy as rising above any particular interests or political agendas — a consensus-builder who in his understated way has deftly navigated the minefield of Italian power politics. “Even though he’s a technocrat who has never been involved in politics, he often acts like a politician,” said Massimo Giannini, the business editor of the Rome daily La Repubblica. “He’s seen as a kind of Cardinal Richelieu who knows how to understand certain political dynamics and work inside them in a very intelligent way.” During an hourlong interview on Thursday in his office in Rome, Mr. Draghi, sitting beneath a tapestry depicting Alexander the Great, displayed a reluctance to ruffle political feathers and a highly institutional approach toward public office. Comfortable with power, he nonetheless refused to speak about himself, instead focusing relentlessly on views that underscored his credentials as an inflation-fighter. Time and again, Mr. Draghi emphasized that the most important thing for the European Central Bank was to hold down prices even before they started to creep upward. His statements were consistent with warnings by other members of the central bank’s governing council in recent months that rising costs for oil and other commodities are putting pressure on prices. The risk has risen as popular uprisings in Libya and other countries in the Middle East have pushed oil prices sharply higher. But as a result of the lukewarm attitudes toward Mr. Draghi, analysts say that the contest for the post remains wide open. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is loath to squander political capital at home by backing an Italian for the job. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France may see a chance to sideline a rival by supporting Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, for the post. But as they hunt for a candidate who offers them more of a political payoff, the leaders face a problem. Can they entrust the euro to a compromise choice? Central banks around the world are trying to gauge whether the current oil price spike will have “a permanent effect on inflation, or if it’s just a one-off shock,” Mr. Draghi said. Noting that the European Central Bank has not changed interest rates “for a very, very long time,” he said the central bank would have to “guarantee that inflation expectations remain well anchored.” 1 2 Next Page » Liz Alderman reported from Rome and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

Big banks responded by shifting more compensation into stock, a move intended to align employees' interests more closely with those of investors and discourage excessive risk-taking. But it turns out that executives have a way to get around those best-laid plans. Using complex investment transactions, they can limit the downside on their holdings, or even profit, as other shareholders are suffering. More than a quarter of Goldman Sachs's partners, a highly influential group of around 475 top executives, used these hedging strategies from July 2007 through November 2010, according to a New York Times analysis of regulatory filings. The arrangements were intended to protect their personal portfolios when the firm's stock was highly volatile, especially at the height of the crisis.In some cases, executives saved millions of dollars by using these tactics. One prominent Goldman investment banker avoided more than $7 million in losses over a four-month period. Such transactions are at the center of a debate over whether Wall Street executives should be allowed to hedge their stock holdings. The concern with hedging is that executives can easily break the ties between compensation and company performance. Employees who hedge their holdings are less concerned about a falling share price. That's why the government barred top executives at banks that received multiple bailouts from using the strategies until they paid back the funds.''Many of these hedging activities can create situations when the executives' interests run counter to the company,'' said Patrick McGurn, a governance adviser at RiskMetrics, which advises investors. ''I think a lot of people feel this doesn't have a place in a compensation structure.'' More broadly, critics say, the practice of hedging represents another end run around financial reform. For example, new rules that cracked down on debit card fees have led several big banks to eliminate free checking. Firms also plan to make up missing revenue by adapting their businesses to the tougher new regulations on derivatives and trading with the banks' own capital. ''Wall Street is saying it is reforming itself by granting stock to executives and exposing them to the long-term risk of that investment,'' said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Hedging the risk can substantially undo that reform.'' Most public companies, including Wall Street firms, have policies that ban the practice for only their most senior executives, though the number of executives affected varies by company. At The New York Times, executive officers and other employees who have access to material nonpublic information about the company may not engage in hedging without written approval - a group that includes more than 100 people, as well as anyone they supervise. Shareholders can figure out the investment practices of the highest-ranking officers of a public company, who are required by law to report. Even those disclosures are buried deep in the footnotes of regulatory filings. Whether lower-level executives are hedging is nearly impossible to determine. But the unusual structure of the Goldman partnership requires the company to disclose the investment activities of partners in filings. The documents provide a window into what a broad range of senior executives were doing with their own shares. Hedging - a commonly used tactic for years, especially during times of weakness or volatility - makes sense for executives at public companies who have amassed a large concentration of stock. They allow employees to limit losses, raise cash, or diversify their portfolios without selling the underlying holdings. Any individual investor can use hedging tactics for the same reasons, but few do because the transactions are complicated and make more sense for those who own a large amount of stock.</text></article>
    <article index="19" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/business/03views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Nomura Evolves, Just Not So Fast<date>Published: February 2, 2011</date><text>Nomura, the Japanese firm, is evolving into a global investment bank even if it does not yet look like one. It reported a strong increase in investment banking fees for the final quarter of 2010, and its traders have begun to prove their worth. The gap with the big league is closing — slowly.Since Nomura bought the Asian and European businesses of Lehman Brothers in October 2008, it has been chasing the shadow of Lehman’s pre-bust greatness. One challenge was to rebuild the American trading business from scratch. The other was to muscle its way into the big merger and initial public offering deals. On the first front, results are starting to show. While Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported sequential declines in the region of 30 percent in their quarterly trading revenue, Nomura managed to keep its own flat. As it should: the brokerage firm doubled its headcount in the United States over 18 months, pushing up its compensation ratio to an indulgent 48 percent of revenue. The second goal remains far away. Equity underwriting revenue more than doubled over the last quarter of 2010, and Nomura won some neat mandates, like helping Abu Dhabi hedge its stake in Barclays. But Kenichi Watanabe, Nomura’s chief executive, has promised big deals, not just quirky ones. Nomura had just two of the quarter’s 10 largest worldwide equity issues, and none of the top debt or mergers and acquisitions mandates. Things are moving in the right direction. Nomura’s deal-making fees grew 37 percent during the quarter, faster than JPMorgan Chase’s and Citigroup’s. But even that achievement paled in comparison to the previous year, when Japan’s large financial firms were pumping out new shares to bolster balance sheets. Therein lies Nomura’s biggest frustration: Japan still sets the pace, and the share price. The bank’s domestic business still accounts for 57 percent of revenue. Its stock tracked its Japanese peers on the way down for most of 2010, but lagged them on the way back up. The shares have lagged the DJ Financials Index by 25 percent in the past year. The thing about evolution is that it takes a generation. Upside to Disclosure When Goldman Sachs released the findings of its business standards committee and some new numbers on Jan. 11, investors focused on the bank’s heightened disclosure of its proprietary trading activity and profit. But regulators entrusted with a bigger responsibility, the safety of the financial system, are more excited about what Goldman has yet to reveal. In its new disclosure, and again in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 19, Goldman added a fourth business segment, known as Investing and Lending, to its income statement, enabling analysts to see a bit more of the firm’s money-making machine. Yet Goldman’s business standards manifesto also promised expanded balance sheet disclosures. These are expected this month in the annual report. It is in the balance sheet details that the devils of the financial system lurk. That is what has senior officials at the Federal Reserve on the edge of their seats. Under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, the officials are charged with protecting against further crises. By contrast, some of Goldman’s Wall Street rivals are apprehensive. Goldman promised to modify and simplify the reporting of items like excess liquidity. More important, the firm said it would “enhance disclosure with respect to liquidity stress tests by including details on both scenario assumptions and modeling parameters” for the assets on its $911 billion balance sheet. It is not entirely clear how far this means Goldman will go. It surely is not as big a step as voluntarily reporting a version of the industrywide stress tests conducted by the Fed in 2009, which helped draw a line under the darkest phase of the crisis. But it does sound a lot closer than Goldman or its peers have gone before. Goldman is characteristically starting from a position of strength. With its ratio of Tier 1 capital to assets at a robust 16 percent, the extra bit of leg it plans to show will probably look more appealing than anyone else’s. That means the new information could help Goldman’s shares take on an even brighter sheen relative to peers, as well as force them to consider similar extra disclosure. For regulators who believe in transparency, that would be a virtuous outcome.

Why is that? Let’s think about it in the following way: We can only deal with the pool of young women who make themselves available and express interest in investment banking.I assume there’s no shortage of candidates. But it’s not necessarily 50-50. When we go to various M.B.A. programs, for example, and I’m just giving you an illustrative number, if 30 percent of the class is women, then we would probably end up hiring about 30 percent women. But if women make up 30 percent of M.B.A. programs, as has been reported, why do they represent only 12 percent of the current partners at Goldman Sachs? I don’t think that we are proud of it, and I think we do have aspirations of improving the numbers. Do you have a Facebook page? No, I don’t. I don’t think we should talk about this. No one here is supposed to be talking about Facebook. You’re referring to the fact that Goldman Sachs just withdrew its offer to American clients to sell shares of Facebook, which could violate all kinds of rules. I can’t comment. Do you think it’s ethically justifiable that certain bankers earn $50 million or $60 million a year at a time when unemployment is nearly 10 percent and income inequality is widening in this country? The income inequality that you refer to is apparent in many different places. You see it in athletics; you see it in entertainment; you see it in your industry as well. You take a look at the compensation of C.E.O.’s of major corporations, recognizing that those corporations have become much larger —they do business in many different parts around the world — and it’s very difficult to know how to properly benchmark the compensation. You could say that entertainers at least provide entertainment, as opposed to a C.E.O. What is a C.E.O. contributing to society? What about the C.E.O. of the New York Times Company? What about her? She’s contributing a newspaper to society, which presumably keeps the American public better informed. It has been widely observed that the financial-services industry is not creating a product in the tangible sense. It’s unfortunate that — I think that there is not a good understanding as to the role of financial intermediaries. For example, without banks it’s hard to see how businesses would get the money they need to grow and to hire new workers. Let’s not lose track of the fact that most people need to borrow in order to buy a home, and if you don’t have banks, that’s not going to happen. In 2008, David Kostin replaced you as Goldman’s chief forecaster. Did you see that as a demotion? Certainly not. It was a generational thing. I hired David several years earlier, and the idea was that David would move into the position. At the same time my work has gravitated toward other issues. I’ve been focusing not on day-to-day market issues but rather on issues that affect the economy and markets medium- to long-term. Things like climate and the environment, but also demographics and the role of education. Do you feel any responsibility for the economic meltdown of 2008, which you failed to foresee? That’s an odd question to be asking me. Because? I did not think that was part of what we were going to be talking about. We’re talking about your life; there was a big meltdown in 2008. I’m wondering, how do you deal with that emotionally? I would say that the causes of the meltdown were multiple, and it is a mistake to point a finger at any one entity. And that these problems took place not just in the United States. This was a very unfortunate confluence, bad decisions made by many different entities. INTERVIEW HAS BEEN CONDENSED AND EDITED.As a partner at Goldman Sachs and one of the best-known market analysts in this country, you’re surely aware that women continue to be thinly represented among the senior ranks on Wall Street.

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, had a rough 2010. But at least he got a raise: his bonus increased by $3.6 million, according to a regulatory filing. The firm's board granted restricted stock valued at $12.6 million to Mr. Blankfein and other senior executives, including Gary D. Cohn, the firm's president. The board also approved a new annual base salary of $2 million for its chief executive, up from $600,000. Mr. Cohn and others will see their base salaries increase to $1.85 million, according to the filing on Friday. With his previous salary of $600,000, Mr. Blankfein's 2010 compensation comes to $13.2 million. Senior executives often receive part of their compensation in cash, but Goldman did not release details on this component of Mr. Blankfein's compensation. In 2009, amid a widespread public outcry over sky-high pay on Wall Street, Mr. Blankfein and other senior Goldman executives received compensation packages valued at $9 million each. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, Mr. Blankfein made $68.5 million. The lowered bonuses in 2009 were not the only compensation change to come out of the financial crisis. Most financial firms also increased the base salaries of employees, a move regulators hoped would cut down on excessive risk-taking. While Mr. Blankfein's base was only recently increased, Goldman had earlier raised base salaries for other employees. The base pay for Goldman managing directors was recently increased to $500,000, from $300,000. Still, not everyone at Goldman got a raise in 2010. Last year the firm set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it earmarked for compensation in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Goldman had a challenging 2010. Its stock performance was relatively flat, and it reported earnings of $8.35 billion, down 37 percent from 2009. But the firm did better than many of its rivals, which were still rebuilding from the financial crisis. Goldman's reputation, nonetheless, took a severe blow last April, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against the firm, saying that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly designed by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market's collapse. The day the charges were announced, Mr. Blankfein has said, was ''one of the worst days in my professional life.'' The firm paid $550 million to settle the charges. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Mr. Blankfein isn't the only Wall Street chief to get a raise for his work in 2010. JPMorgan Chase has not yet announced the pay of its chief executive, but Jamie Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009. This month, Morgan Stanley's board awarded its chief executive, James Gorman, stock and options valued at $7.4 million. But this represented only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Mr. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009, when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning $1 a year while he tried put the bank back on track, was recently awarded a $1.75 million salary. At Goldman, David A. Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer, and the vice chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg also received stock valued at $12.6 million, regulatory filings show. Their base salaries also rose to $1.85 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd C.

Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning a mere $1 in salary while he tried put the bank back on track, has been awarded a $1.75 million salary, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The lifting of Mr. Pandit's symbolic hair shirt came as Morgan Stanley disclosed much, though not all, of the compensation for its leader. James P. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009 when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Other Wall Street banks - including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - are still to report what their leaders will be paid. JPMorgan Chase disclosed compensation for some of its senior mangers, but has not yet approved the pay package for its chief executive and chairman, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009, which made him among the highest-paid Wall Street executives. No decision has been made. But JPMorgan had a banner 2010 - it was the most profitable year in the company's history - and four of Mr. Dimon's top lieutenants have already been awarded stock worth more than $10 million each. Two years since emerging from the financial crisis, Wall Street profits - and big paychecks - appear to be back. But the public uproar that erupted over outsize bonuses that banks awarded, even after accepting a government bailouts, has not yet been tamed. Banks are still trying to balance the need to attract star executives and traders with regulators' demands to ensure that their pay programs do not create excessive risk. Gone is some of the sensitivity to lawmakers and the broader public, who were angry at seeing such lavish paydays as they were losing their homes and jobs. As bonus checks were doled out at several big banks earlier this week, it is clear that 2010 is shaping up to be a very good year - although perhaps not as good as a year earlier. Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant, said that he expected pay to fall about 10 to 15 percent for 2010, and perhaps more than twice that amount in many trading businesses where the results were much weaker. Amid greater scrutiny from the public and federal regulators since the financial crisis, the banks have awarded a greater portion of compensation in the form of stock - some even higher than 50 percent - and emphasized the use of deferred pay and policies to claw back ill-gotten bonuses. Over all, what is remarkable is the wide variation in pay packages among the banking giants. At the industry's strongest banks, employee compensation, on average, fell markedly from a year ago. At Goldman Sachs, workers earned, on average, about $398,000 in 2010, down 11 percent from a year ago. At JPMorgan's investment bank, employee pay was, on average, about $370,000 - about 2.4 percent lower than in 2009 and in line with the overall firm's decline in compensation. Wall Street's star bankers and traders, regardless of where they work, will still reap paychecks worth millions of dollars. Meanwhile, several of the weaker players ratcheted their compensation packages upward. At Morgan Stanley, for example, workers' paychecks rose about 8 percent, on average, to about $257,000. Citigroup and Bank of America, whose average paychecks are substantially lower because they employ tens of thousands consumer bankers who draw smaller salaries and bonuses, reported increases of about 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Some pay analysts suspect that this divergence may stem, at least in part, from the need of these more troubled firms to offer bigger paydays to attract and retain top talent. Those occupying offices in the corporate suite continued to score big paydays. Citigroup's board had signaled a pay increase for Mr. Pandit last fall when they granted stock awards to several of his top lieutenants and announced that they planned to restore his compensation so that it would be in line with other Wall Street chiefs. Mr. Pandit had vowed at a Congressional hearing in February 2009 that he would accept only $1 until the bank returned to profitability. On Tuesday, Citigroup posted an annual profit in 2010, the first time it had done so since the financial crisis struck. Richard D. Parsons, Citigroup's chairman, said that the board was ''very pleased with the progress the company has made under Vikram's leadership'' and that he merited the raise for the coming year. Citigroup's board could also choose to award him additional stock and options when it reviews his 2011 compensation later this year. Of course, Mr. Pandit still holds about $79.7 million in cash from the sale of his investment fund, Old Lane Partners, to Citigroup in April 2007. At JPMorgan Chase, Jes Staley, the head of its investment bank, was awarded more than $14.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. His total compensation may be even higher when his salary and bonus are disclosed. Ina R. Drew, the bank's chief investment officer, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of its asset management division, each received stock and options worth more than $11 million. That poises them to be among the highest-paid women on Wall Street. On Friday, Morgan Stanley's board awarded Mr. Gorman stock and options valued at $7.4 million, according to Equilar. But this represents only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Morgan Stanley also released details of more than $32 million in stock awards for 10 other top executives. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The decision to hire Goldman Sachs came after several suitors, including the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, approached Warner Music's management in recent months about buying the company, according to an executive briefed on the matter who spoke only anonymously. Instead of negotiating solely with K.K.R., the company's management decided to begin a formal sale process by hiring Goldman, which has recently begun making pitches to financial investors and media companies about buying Warner. One possible outcome of the auction is for Warner to sell not the entire company but only Warner/Chappell, its prized publishing arm, said a person with direct knowledge of the process. Meanwhile, a separate set of bankers within Goldman has been working on a potential acquisition of EMI by Warner. Goldman has reached out to Citigroup, which owns a large amount of EMI's debt and could soon control the company if it fails to meet its payments, according to executives involved in the process, who would speak of the confidential negotiations only anonymously. The unusual two-track process of Warner seeking to buy while also exploring selling out to new investors underscores the desire of Warner's private equity owners to either make a big strategic move and double down on the music business by buying EMI, or cash out. They acquired the company from Time Warner more than seven years ago - a long time frame for private equity investors, who normally prefer to own a company for three to five years before selling. Late last year, Citigroup won a lawsuit against EMI's private equity owners, Terra Firma, which had filed a suit that said Citigroup had defrauded Terra Firma during the auction of EMI in August of 2007. That deal, for $6.8 billion, came at the height of the credit boom - and just before credit markets began to freeze - and has been an ill-fated move for Terra Firma and its founder, Guy Hands. K.K.R's interest in Warner is related to expanding a joint venture it owns with Bertelsmann to license music rights. K.K.R. had been in talks with Warner Music about engineering a joint bid for EMI, but those discussions then turned toward K.K.R. buying Warner outright, according to one of the executives involved in the process. Warner Music, whose artist roster includes Kid Rock, Green Day and Bruno Mars, is the only pure music company that is publicly traded. Others, such as Universal Music and Sony Music, are part of much larger conglomerates. A group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., a group that also included Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Providence Equity Partners, bought Warner Music from Time Warner in March of 2004 for $2.6 billion in cash. The company went public in 2005, and although the investors still control the company - only a small percentage of Warner's stock is in public hands - the investors have already profited through hefty dividend payouts. A Warner Music spokesman and a Goldman spokesman declined comment. In a letter to shareholders sent last week, Mr. Bronfman wrote, ''clearly many obstacles lie ahead, but our confidence in the company's future prospects is based on our consistent track record and our proven ability to outperform the rest of the industry.'' Indeed, as the overall music industry has shrunk remarkably over the last few years, Warner has shrunk less - and has actually improved its profit margins through cost-cutting. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which measures music sales globally, sales of music declined nearly 23 percent between 2005 and 2009. Over that time, Warner's revenue declined much less - around 9 percent. With the rise of the file-sharing Web site Napster in the late 1990s, the music industry was the first slice of the media business to see its economics disrupted by the digital age, and by the time Mr. Bronfman and his group bought Warner, that trend was clear. The decline of newspapers followed the diminishment of the music industry, and more recently the economics of television and film have also come under pressure from the Internet. But unlike, say, newspapers and magazines, the music industry has embraced a durable model to get paid for selling music online through services such as Apple's iTunes Store - even if revenue has declined and piracy remains rampant.

But lately it seems the lackluster economy has gotten the better of the firm. The Wall Street bank, which reported a 53 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, experienced a noticeable slowdown in most of its important divisions, citing increased competition and depressed client activity amid economic uncertainty. David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, described the environment as ''dead'' and ''challenging''- reminiscent of the firm's comments in the previous period. But economic factors are not just to blame, analysts say. Goldman may be facing fundamental and long-lasting issues with its business model. Clients are shying away from the high-margin products that ran into trouble during the financial crisis, and coming regulation will only crimp profits further. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which reported earnings in the last week, noted similar problems in certain divisions. In a nod to just how difficult the environment has become, Goldman's return on equity, a measure of profitability, fell to 11.5 percent in 2010, down from 22.5 percent in the previous year and 32.8 percent in 2006. ''I think for the time being this is the new reality,' said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''It is not doom and gloom out there in economy. What is missing are things like the structured products and derivatives that were helping their earnings.'' Shares of Goldman fell $8.19, or 4.7 percent, to $166.49 on Wednesday. Of course, Goldman is hardly on the ropes. Despite the weakness, the firm still posted a healthy quarterly profit of $2.39 billion, distilled on revenue of $8.64 billion. For the year, revenue fell 13 percent, to about $39 billion. Annual earnings were $8.35 billion, 38 percent lower than in 2009. But the underwhelming results are a stark reminder of the challenging markets and weak economy. Clients of Goldman, big-name companies that pay it to organize mergers, bond offerings and more, have been sitting on the sidelines. Profitable areas like mortgage-backed securities have shrunk sharply. And competition has increased from companies like Morgan Stanley, which has regained some of its former strength. The firm is also still beholden to Warren E. Buffett. For months, Goldman has wanted to pay back a $5 billion investment from Mr. Buffett made at the height of the financial crisis. But the firm first needs the government's approval. Mr. Viniar declined to comment on the stake, saying only that ''Goldman is exploring all its options.'' At Goldman, almost every business is feeling the pain. Revenue in its powerful fixed-income, currency and commodities unit fell 48 percent, to $1.64 billion, from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue, which includes equity and debt underwriting, fell 10 percent, to $1.64 billion. The division, which often accounts for a third of Goldman's total sales, made up just 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Investment management was one of the few bright spots in the quarter, as revenue rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion. Compensation did not decrease as much as profit. In 2010, Goldman set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it set aside in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009, when the firm came under intense scrutiny for handing out big bonuses after accepting government aid. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Despite weaker-than-usual results, Mr. Viniar was optimistic about Goldman's fortunes, pointing to improvements in the unemployment rate and other economic indicators. The firm plans to add employees in the coming months, mostly overseas. Last year, Goldman increased its employee base by 10 percent, to 35,700 employees. ''I would feel worse if the economic data was really bad,'' he said. ''And it's not.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. The New Year is a time for reflection, so it was heartening to see Goldman Sachs come out with 63 pages of resolutions. The investment bank published its ''Report of the Business Standards Committee'' last week, a document in which it reiterated its principles and announced the formation of many new committees. Goldman will be an open book, the firm pledged, disclosing more clearly how much business the firm does for itself (not as much as all those detractors think) and how much it works for its clients (every waking moment). Goldman suffered a brutal year, paying a $550 million fine to settle federal claims of civil securities fraud and being vilified at a Senate hearing. Even the $15.38 billion the firm has set aside for compensation in 2010 wasn't enough to salve the pain. Goldman would like our love, too. And so the powerful investment bank has embarked on a journey of self-improvement, a great American ritual from Ben Franklin to Elizabeth Gilbert. Goldman's report should have been titled ''Eat, Pay, Trade.'' In a video that accompanies the report, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive, said the firm conducted a ''thorough self-assessment,'' followed by a ''recommitment to core values and principles.'' It's language that ''reads straight out of a Tony Robbins retreat manual, not your usual business document,'' said Christine B. Whelan, a University of Pittsburgh sociologist who has studied the self-help industry. Of course, releasing the report is a public relations stunt. Some of it was welcome, like the increased financial disclosure. Some may fall by the wayside, like most New Year's resolutions. Some seems as disingenuous as any piece of professional flackery. Goldman's effort fits neatly into what the historian (and former New York councilwoman) Eva S. Moskowitz has called the therapeutic gospel, a doctrine so ingrained in American society that few of us consciously recognize it. The gospel consists of three tenets: happiness is the supreme goal, problems stem from psychological causes, and those psychological problems are treatable. The therapeutic gospel is all about me and my problems. Goldman thinks its problems stem, if not from psychological issues, then from attitudinal ones. Significant management and operational changes are starkly missing from Goldman's leaf-turning exercise. Instead, Goldman has decided that its troubles emanate from not having treated clients nicely. Or, more likely, Goldman thinks its problem is that the world thinks Goldman didn't treat its clients nicely. But that wasn't the problem with Goldman Sachs in the fall of 2008. Creating collateralized debt obligations and betting against their clients was unseemly, but it wasn't the cause of the global financial crisis. Goldman's leverage - and the leverage at other major financial institutions - was the real issue. Goldman's business model was broken because it made a classic banking mistake: it lent long and borrowed short. All banks are susceptible to runs. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers had theirs, deservedly. By the fall of 2008, it was Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs's turn. Goldman took taxpayer dollars and was granted access to cheap Federal Reserve money. Goldman insists that it would have survived the crisis anyway. We'll never know whether it would have, because the fact is that Goldman received assistance. Goldman, like all the other major investment and commercial banks, had become too big and intertwined, making the financial system too fragile. In other words, the flaws in the financial system were structural, more like the problem of poverty, and not based on character. As such, they require solutions beyond pledges of better behavior. Unfortunately, despite a hulking financial reform law, the American financial system still has largely the same structural issues that it had before the crisis. Neither Goldman nor the government shows any inclination to face these issues. What about investors? The covenant that equity investors have struck with investment banks goes something like this: Deliver high returns and we will allow employees to take about half of the revenue for themselves as compensation. It was always a bad bargain, made worse by the financial crisis. Lehman investors were wiped out. Bear Stearns investors took huge hits. (Whether investors have learned from that experience, or whether they have learned to expect bailouts, is debatable.) Despite Goldman's reputation in some corners as Evil Genius, its shares are actually suffering in the marketplace because investors worry about its volatile and unpredictable results from quarter to quarter. These concerns were validated when Goldman reported on Wednesday that trading and securities services profit took a big hit in the fourth quarter, dropping 31 percent. The stock slid 3 percent by midafternoon in response. Investors prefer annuities to swing-for-the-fences profits. Compared with pure asset managers and investment banks that specialize in either advisory work or making markets, Goldman stock trades at a discount these days. Goldman's price-to-earnings ratio stands at less than 10, while Lazard (a pure advisory firm), Jefferies (a market maker) and BlackRock (an asset manager) trade at significantly higher multiples. Investors often prefer to look at a price-to-book ratio to value financial firms; even on that measure, Goldman is far below its peak valuation. Could there be an argument that Goldman should break up into three smaller, more focused companies? It would be better for the financial system, and just might lead to the self-improvement that Goldman is searching for.

They are now poised to reap a windfall that was sown in the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008. Nearly 36 million stock options were granted to employees in December 2008 - 10 times the amount issued the previous year - when the stock was trading at $78.78. Since those uncertain days, Goldman's business has roared back and its share price has more than doubled, closing on Tuesday at nearly $175. The options grant is among the many details that emerge from a study of regulatory filings and internal partnership documents by The New York Times and Footnoted.com, a division of Morningstar that scrutinizes corporate disclosures. These filings provide a much fuller picture of both Goldman's compensation and its elite partnership of 475 people who run the firm. At the center of Goldman's lucrative compensation program is the partnership. Unlike other Wall Street firms, Goldman retained a partnership system when it became a publicly traded company in 1999. Goldman's partners are its highest executives and its biggest stars. Yet while Goldman is required to report compensation for its top officers, it releases very little information about this broader group, remaining tightlipped about even basic information like who is currently a partner. The documents illustrate just how much wealth the partnership owns and has cashed out over the years. Goldman has almost 860 current and former partners, the documents show. In the last 12 years, they have cashed out more than $20 billion in Goldman shares and currently hold more than $10 billion in Goldman stock. All Wall Street firms dole out stock to reward their employees. But the reporting of who gets what and who sells is limited to the firm's top officers. The Goldman filings provide a window into how broad and how lucrative stock-based compensation can be. The 2008 stock option grant came at a time when the firm's financial performance took a hit and its top executives were not paid bonuses. The grant, much of it awarded to partners, gave options that could be exercised in one-third installments in January 2010, January 2011 and January 2012. The shares cannot be sold or transferred until January 2014. The award has already helped increase the partners' stake in Goldman to 11.2 percent, from 8.7 percent. And as additional options vest, the partners' control of the firm will most likely increase. Goldman declined to comment. In addition to the cumulative stock sales and stock ownership, the filings show an inner circle that is chiefly male - 87 percent of the current partners are men - and shed light on how much each partner has cashed out over the years. The analysis, which examined nearly 5,000 pages of regulatory filings, was a joint effort by The Times and the Footnoted.com senior reporter Theo Francis. With Goldman set to report earnings on Wednesday, the newest class of inductees will get their first glimpse into the privileges of partnership, as the firm begins to notify its more than 35,000 employees about their year-end bonuses. Goldman is on track to pay out $17.5 billion in compensation for last year. While that is down from the record $20.19 billion in 2007, it's up more than a billion from 2009. The documents also show what shares partners sold before they became officers and were required to make disclosures. Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, for example, has cashed in a total of $93.8 million in shares since 1999, a number that captures both known stock sales since he became an officer at Goldman, and sales not individually reported since before he was required to disclose such transactions. In the eight years since becoming a senior executive in 2002, Mr. Blankfein has sold $42.5 million, roughly 45 percent of the total over the years. As of August, Mr. Blankfein and his family owned 2.03 million shares worth about $355 million if they had been cashed out on Jan. 14.</text></article>

The four banks that landed the coveted roles are Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, these people said. Selecting the four underwriters of the planned stock sale - which could exceed the size of General Motors' $23.1 billion initial public offering in November - is the next major step in the government's effort to reduce its holdings in A.I.G. The Treasury Department owns about 92.1 percent of the insurer after finishing a complex recapitalization plan on Friday that paid off A.I.G.'s debts to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Representatives of A.I.G., Treasury and the banks declined to comment. A.I.G. and Treasury officials picked the underwriters over the weekend. Last Thursday, they heard about 10 proposals from top representatives of major banks, people briefed on the matter previously said. In sessions of about 45 minutes, the bankers answered questions about the size, timing and other technical aspects of the offering, these people said. Among those making proposals at last week's meetings were Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, and Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, these people said. The size of A.I.G.'s offering will depend on market conditions and investors' appetite for the huge number of shares, the people briefed on Tuesday cautioned. These people were granted anonymity to talk freely about confidential details of the offering. The Treasury has expressed a desire to hold two stock sales this year, perhaps lowering its stake to 33 percent. The first stock sale, which would probably be held in mid-May, would include both shares owned by the government and newly issued A.I.G. stock. The investment banks are not expected to collect a large fee on the offering, at least compared with other stock sales. The government is expected to pay no more than 0.5 percent of the total deal, far below the normal rate, according to one of the people with knowledge of deal. But the sheer size of the transaction is still likely to yield a big payout. One notable investment bank among the chosen underwriters is Goldman, which has had a rocky history with A.I.G. The bank's demands for collateral on the complex credit-default swap deals it struck with the insurer in 2008 helped weaken A.I.G.'s financial position. For that reason, some bankers and analysts had speculated that the bank might not be a top contender for a leading role in the stock sale. A surprising exclusion is Morgan Stanley, which has had a close relationship with the government throughout the financial crisis. The firm served as an adviser to the Fed on A.I.G. matters over the past few years. Along with JPMorgan, it also was a lead underwriter for the G.M. public offering. Shares in A.I.G. closed on Tuesday at $53.17, down about 1.5 percent. The company's stock price is expected to fall over the next several days as warrants are distributed to nongovernment shareholders.

The decision is a considered a serious embarrassment for Goldman, which had marketed the investment to its wealthiest clients, including corporate magnates and directors of the nation's largest companies. The offering was supposed to have been a triumph for the firm, which is trying to move past run-ins with regulators, including a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer over a complex mortgage investment. But the Facebook plan is now likely to raise new questions about whether Goldman tried to push regulatory boundaries once again. Goldman made its decision after the investment plan drew scrutiny. The S.E.C. had opened an inquiry into the structure of the offering and whether it violated the law because of widespread news coverage. Federal and state regulations prohibit what is known as ''general solicitation and advertising'' in private offerings. Firms like Goldman seeking to raise money cannot take action that resembles public promotion of the offering, like buying ads or communicating with news outlets. In a statement on Monday, the firm said: ''In light of this intense media coverage, Goldman Sachs has decided to proceed only with the offer to investors outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S. private placement under U.S. law.'' A report by The New York Times, published late on Jan. 2, that Goldman had invested $450 million in Facebook and would create a special-purpose investment vehicle for clients, citing people involved in the deal, appeared to prompt the regulatory scrutiny. ''The transaction generated intense media attention following the publication of an article on the evening of January 2, 2011, shortly after the launch of the transaction,'' the firm said in its statement Monday. Goldman had not been planning to initiate the offering that night, but it sped up the process after The Times called the firm seeking comment, according to an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. That night, a Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Late that night, before the report was published, executives in Goldman's private wealth-management unit e-mailed their clients about the offering, people who received the e-mail said. Goldman added in its statement on Monday that the decision was made on its own and ''was not required or requested by any other party.'' Foreign investors will still be able to participate in the Goldman offering because they are not subject to the S.E.C. rules on solicitation in private offerings. However, all partners of Goldman, whether based in the United States or abroad, will not be allowed to invest, according to people briefed on the matter. It is unclear how much money Goldman will raise for Facebook. In a private memorandum to clients when it made the offering, it said it planned to raise as much as $1.5 billion. The minimum investment is $2 million. The overall deal pegged Facebook's value at $50 billion. While the offering was oversubscribed - perhaps by as much as three times - with American clients now ineligible to participate, it is not clear whether Goldman or Facebook will lower the size of the offering. A majority of Goldman's high-net-worth clients are based in the United States, and these investors may be upset over being denied a potentially lucrative opportunity afforded to investors in Europe and Asia. For Goldman executives who manage money for wealthy families, so-called special investments have long been a major selling point in luring clients to the firm. The argument to prospective clients is that by placing their money with Goldman, they have access to the same investment opportunities as the firm, long considered one of the world's smartest investors.</text></article>

It's not on the credit-default swaps of A.I.G. or any other investment, however. The Wall Street firm is bringing its favorite barber in-house. Salvatore Anzalone has been trimming the tresses of Goldman employees for nearly two decades, including those of the last two Goldman chief executives - Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current head of the bank. He first attracted a Goldman following at Salvatore's Barber Shop, in the basement of the building in Lower Manhattan that until recently housed the firm's huge trading floor. Last year, Goldman's employees moved out of its offices into new state-of-the-art headquarters in Battery Park City, a little more than a mile away from its old home. Mr. Anzalone followed his loyal clients, opening a location in July in a Goldman-owned hotel adjacent to the firm. But the hotel, an Embassy Suites, closed last week for renovations, forcing Mr. Anzalone to shutter his shop. Faced with the prospect of going without Mr. Anzalone's old-school haircuts, which include straight-razor neck shaves and witch hazel-dabbed towels, Goldman came to Mr. Anzalone with an offer: he could save his shop by moving it into Goldman's headquarters until the hotel makeover was completed. So next week, he is moving to a new outpost inside the Goldman building. The firm is setting up a small barber shop on the mezzanine level, with two chairs. Mr. Anzalone is not the first haircutter to become close to a financial heavyweight. Warren E. Buffett's relationship with his barber, Stan Docekal, has led Buffett devotees to visit Mr. Docekal's shop in Omaha in search of investment tips. John J. Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, was said to be so attached to his longtime barber, Salvatore Macri, that when Mr. Mack left Morgan Stanley in 2001 to run Credit Suisse, he began shuttling Mr. Macri downtown to his new offices for discreet trims. On Thursday, Mr. Anzalone, a native Sicilian with a high-pitched laugh and a habit of gesticulating with his free hand, was trimming sideburns in a rolled-up dress shirt and a yellow tie speckled with bits of hair. It was his last week at his soon-to-be-closed location, which charges $28 for a basic haircut. (No word on whether Mr. Paulson and Mr. Blankfein, both folliclely challenged, received discounts.) Mr. Anzalone seems to have learned from his customers at Goldman, whose business principles demand discretion in its dealings with clients. When a reporter said he was writing an article, Mr. Anzalone declined to discuss his Goldman clients and his move to the firm's building. Known as ''Sal,'' Mr. Anzalone began his career in 1974 at Nino's, a popular barber shop near Wall Street. In 1994, he struck out on his own and opened Salvatore's. The threat to Mr. Anzalone's new shop emerged last year, when Goldman announced it would renovate the Embassy Suites hotel, which it had bought in 2006 with plans to turn it into a hotel for the bank's executives visiting New York. Goldman has closed the Embassy Suites for a yearlong refurbishment in part to assuage its executives who had grumbled about the accommodations. In the meantime, Mr. Anzalone has moved around the corner and into Goldman's new 43-story steel-and-glass tower, which already includes such comforts as a 54,000-square-foot gym. And like much of what the firm does, the deal with Mr. Anzalone has in at least one respect an air of exclusivity. Only customers from Goldman are allowed. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Blankfein when he eventually steps aside as chief executive of Goldman Sachs?The speculation may be more than idle gossip for bored bankers. Two friends of Mr. Blankfein, 56, say he has told them since last summer that he is exhausted from leading the company through the financial crisis and that he would consider stepping down when he could do so gracefully, without the move appearing to be anything but voluntary. The choice of Goldman’s next chief could signal the firm’s direction and influence the broader thinking on Wall Street, where Goldman often sets the tone. For decades, Goldman’s leaders came from its investment banking unit, which provided business strategy and merger advice to blue-chip companies. Mr. Blankfein, in contrast, was a commodities trader, and his ascension furthered the company’s makeover as a trading powerhouse. To be sure, Mr. Blankfein may decide to stay a while, despite the chatter to the contrary. And as far as Goldman is concerned, Mr. Blankfein is not going anywhere. A spokesman for the firm, Lucas van Praag, declined to comment other than to note that Mr. Blankfein “says he has never felt so energetic and has no plans to retire.” Even with its reputation tarnished by a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit last year, Goldman remains the world’s most powerful investment bank, with its own mystique on Wall Street. It is a training ground for government officials and hedge fund managers alike, and its powerful alumni network extends its influence. While other eminent financial companies, like Merrill Lynch, were crushed by the collapse of housing prices and lost of tens of billions with a wager on subprime mortgage debt, Goldman actually spotted the threat early and made a bet against the housing market, racking up sizable gains. Even as its traditional archrival Morgan Stanley struggles with a stagnant stock price, Goldman shares are up more than 20 percent over the last two years. When Goldman reports earnings Tuesday, analysts expect a profit of about $443 million, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters, although the latest results will be depressed by the bank’s plans to repurchase Warren E. Buffett’s $5 billion investment. Like George Steinbrenner in his stewardship of the New York Yankees, whoever is at the top of Goldman cuts an outsize figure among peers. Two recent chiefs — Robert E. Rubin and Henry M. Paulson Jr. — went on to become secretary of the Treasury, and another, Jon S. Corzine, later was a senator from New Jersey, and then governor of the state. What is more, Mr. Blankfein, who assumed the top job in 2006, is one of only two chief executives of major banks who were at the helm before the financial crisis and remain in charge today. Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is the other. The top candidates to succeed Mr. Blankfein, according to three people briefed on the situation, are all company veterans, and they illustrate Goldman’s global reach. One of them, Michael S. Sherwood, is British and oversees a broad swath of the firm’s international business from London. Another, J. Michael Evans, a Canadian and winner of an Olympic gold medal in rowing, is chairman of Goldman’s Asian business. (Mr. Sherwood and Mr. Evans are both vice chairmen of the firm.) The final contender, Gary D. Cohn, Goldman’s president and chief operating officer, is Mr. Blankfein’s top deputy in New York. No favorite seems clear, but that is not unusual at Goldman. Several former partners and analysts said they would be surprised to see an outsider selected. And whether or not Mr. Blankfein leaves soon — his urgency seems to have faded with the passing of the storm around Goldman, two people close to him said — he has been there long enough to justify focusing on a succession plan, analysts said. Roger Freeman, a financial analyst at Barclays Capital, said Mr. Blankfein might wait to see his firm through the final negotiations with Washington over new regulatory rules for the banking industry in the second half of 2011, before handing Goldman to a younger team in 2012. “This has been an exhausting period,” Mr. Freeman said. “It would not be a surprising time to see a change.” As the economy stumbled, Goldman’s success brought harsh public criticism, as lawmakers and even some clients complained that Goldman was no longer putting clients first. 1 2 Next Page »From the canyons of Wall Street to the City of London and beyond to Hong Kong, an intense guessing-game has begun: who will succeed Lloyd C.

As the insider trading case of Mr. Rajaratnam enters its sixth week, the trial has captivated Wall Street as a suspenseful, complex financial version of ''Law &amp; Order'' that could have a cliffhanger ending. But John Dowd, his lawyer, could have his work cut out for him persuading the jury. Sitting in the gallery on the 17th floor of the federal courthouse in Manhattan on Monday - seats away from Mr. Rajaratnam - it struck me just how much evidence they have to overcome. ''I heard yesterday from somebody who's on the board of Goldman Sachs that they are going to lose $2 per share,'' Mr. Rajaratnam said to an employee on a taped telephone conversation that was played for the jury. In another recorded call, he is heard telling a friend that he bought a certain stock because he was sure it would go up. Why was he so certain? ''We know because one of our guys is on the board,'' he explained. And in another tape-recorded call, Danielle Chiesi, a hedge fund executive, told Mr. Rajaratnam very specifically about Akamai Technologies' coming earnings: ''They're going to guide down. I just got a call from my guy.'' When this case was first brought, Wall Street was aflutter with anxiety that the government was expanding the definition of insider trading. The trial was seen as a moment that would show how the government planned to police modern Wall Street as more and more information poured into the system. It was supposed to redefine the law around ''expert networks,'' those paid services that investors use to gain an edge, and ''channel checks,'' which investors use to ferret out information from suppliers and clients. But the case against Mr. Rajaratnam isn't about a new form of insider trading. It is whether what happened was old-fashioned insider trading - passing blatant, black-and-white tips that gave a trading advantage. Over and over, witnesses with inside information testified to breaking the law to provide Mr. Rajaratnam with details of coming announcements and transactions. Despite the Galleon Group's $6 billion under management, high-priced real estate and supposed analysts, witnesses have painted a picture of Mr. Rajaratnam's firm as one that disregarded insider trading laws as standard operating procedure. So far, the defense has hardly tried to refute the evidence; instead, it has relied on an effort to confuse the jury about what constitutes inside information. I attended court the day that Mr. Rajaratnam's lawyer questioned Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs's chief executive, about information from a board meeting that prosecutors say was relayed to Mr. Rajaratnam by Rajat Gupta, a Goldman director at the time. The lawyer quizzed Mr. Blankfein about whether Goldman's board ever discussed issues that were in the public domain, as if to suggest that the line between inside information and public information was never a bright line. The lawyer trotted out an example: Goldman's board discussed Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy after the bankruptcy had been announced. Gotcha! Mr. Blankfein tried to explain that Goldman's board often discussed news that had been reported in the press, but that the board's internal conversations about that news was confidential and could be important, material information if shared with the public. Why the judge allowed such a line of interrogation was a question asked by spectators in the courtroom. On Monday, the defense was back with a new line of questioning. It sought to undermine the credibility of the prosecution's witness, who had pleaded guilty to insider trading at Galleon. When questioned by a lawyer before his crimes were exposed, the defense pointed out, the witness had said that he ''was not aware of any insider trading at Galleon.'' Almost no one, of course, would have admitted to that before having been charged. This case differs from the trials of L. Dennis Kozlowski, John Rigas and others that I have covered. In those trials, the outcome was not clear because much of the evidence was murkier. There were no tapes. Documents presented by the two sides seemed to contradict each other. Both Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Rigas were convicted and sentenced to jail terms, but before their guilty verdicts came, it wasn't certain that the government's ''proof'' would be enough. Why Mr. Rajaratnam decided to fight the case, with so many witnesses in taped conversation with him, is a mystery. I'm left thinking he must have decided that he had nothing to lose and that if his lawyers could persuade just one juror, it would be worth going to trial. But I'm still glad I'm not his lawyer. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief, has testified at the trial.

Blankfein, testified on Wednesday in the insider-trading trial of Raj Rajaratnam, who before his arrest in 2009 was among the most powerful hedge fund managers on Wall Street. It was a unusual role for the Goldman chief executive, who has had audiences with presidents, foreign leaders and chieftains of the world's largest companies. But on Wednesday, he was addressing a jury of New Yorkers - including teachers, transit workers and the unemployed - all of whom said they had never heard of Mr. Blankfein during the jury selection process. Federal prosecutors subpoenaed Mr. Blankfein to testify in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, the co-founder of the Galleon Group who is facing up to 25 years in prison on charges that he earned $45 million trading on illegal stock tips. Among those the government says conspired with Mr. Rajaratnam was Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman director who has been accused of giving Mr. Rajaratnam highly sensitive information about the bank's board meetings during the financial crisis. In his testimony, Mr. Blankfein said that board members including Mr. Gupta had been privy to such information, which was not meant to be discussed with anyone outside Goldman. Details of board meetings, if leaked before public announcements, have the potential to move a company's stock price, and thus can be valuable to outside investors. Azam Ahmed and Guilbert Gates/The New York Times Click on the above graphic to get a visual overview of the Galleon information network It is extremely rare for a chief executive of a major Wall Street firm to testify in a criminal trial. The nearest precedent is in 1990, during the insider trading scandals of that era, when Frederick H. Joseph, the former chief executive of Drexel Burnham Lambert, testified in a presentencing hearing for Michael R. Milken, the financier who served prison time for securities violations. Mr. Blankfein, a former tax lawyer, appeared at ease on the witness stand, smiling periodically throughout his testimony. Judge Richard J. Holwell's courtroom, just a mile away from Goldman's headquarters in Manhattan, proved to be a much friendlier location than where Mr. Blankfein last testified under oath. Last April, he sat before a panel of senators on Capitol Hill who vilified him and accused Goldman of unfairly profiting at the expense of its customers. Mr. Blankfein defended the bank to less than rave reviews. The prosecution proceeded with caution in its questioning, apparently so that the jury would not view him as a wealthy banking executive who had played a role in the financial crisis. On Tuesday, prosecutors had expressed concern that testimony about the crisis could unfairly prejudice the jury against him. Mr. Blankfein, 56, was asked where he grew up (Brooklyn) and what high school he had attended (Thomas Jefferson). The prosecutor, Andrew Michaelson, then asked Mr. Blankfein if he attended college. ''Yes,'' he replied. Left unmentioned were the executive's undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard. The government and Mr. Blankfein also avoided mentioning the phrase ''financial crisis.'' On Wednesday, Mr. Blankfein described September 2008 as ''a volatile period in the market,'' saying that it was ''a dangerous time'' that ''made us nervous.'' There was also ''riskiness'' and a ''general insecurity,'' he said. Dressed in a dark suit and royal blue tie, Mr. Blankfein revealed several details about his role as the chief executive of the world's largest investment bank. He checks the bank's profit and loss statement every day, he said, but typically ignores the daily e-mail on the statement, and instead prefers to listen to it on a daily voice mail. In addition to the Goldman board's regularly scheduled board meetings, Mr. Blankfein says he makes ''just-checking-in calls'' to outside directors. His relaxed countenance on the witness stand belied the fact that he was forced to relive the last months of 2008, the most challenging time in Goldman's 142-year-history. It was during that period that the government says the former director, Mr. Gupta, told Mr. Rajaratnam about Goldman board meetings. During a meeting in October 2008, Mr. Blankfein told the board that the bank's performance was exceptionally weak and was on track to post its first quarterly loss as a public company. The prosecutor asked Mr. Blankfein what was happening then. ''We were losing money,'' he said. ''What was the significance of that?'' the prosecutor asked. ''We generally make money,'' Mr. Blankfein said, smirking.</text></article>

Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs director accused by the government of passing insider information about the Wall Street firm, had tried to resign from the Goldman board in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis, only weeks before he is said to have provided the tips to the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. According to a new audiotape recording released by federal prosecutors late Friday, Mr. Gupta sought to leave the Goldman board to take a job as a senior adviser at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm led by Henry R. Kravis, a friend of Mr. Gupta's. The recording also suggests that Mr. Gupta may have been having personal troubles at the time he is accused of passing the tips. The tape offers an unusual window into Mr. Gupta's world during the time that the government says he tipped off Mr. Rajaratnam. The case is being zealously tracked by corporate America's top echelon because of Mr. Gupta's deep connections at the highest levels: he ran McKinsey &amp; Company, the prestigious consulting firm, for a decade and served on several prominent boards, including those of Procter &amp; Gamble and AMR, the parent company of American Airlines. On Sept. 9, 2008, Mr. Gupta submitted a formal resignation letter to Goldman, a person briefed on the recording said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But the firm's executives, including its chief, Lloyd C. Blankfein, persuaded him to stay on the board because they thought that it would send the markets a bad message to have a director resign as a financial crisis was exploding. Two weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission contends, Mr. Gupta told Mr. Rajaratnam about Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman before it was publicly announced the next day. The S.E.C. also says Mr. Gupta swapped confidential Goldman information with Mr. Rajaratnam two other times during 2008. In each case, Mr. Rajaratnam traded illegally on the tips, the S.E.C. says. A lawyer for Mr. Gupta has denied the charges. Mr. Gupta eventually did not stand for re-election from Goldman's board and stepped down when his term ended in May 2010. The news of Mr. Gupta's resignation letter to Goldman's board in 2008 was hinted at in the audiotape of a telephone conversation on Aug. 15, 2008, between Mr. Rajaratnam and Anil Kumar, both friends of Mr. Gupta's and confirmed by people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Kumar, a former executive at McKinsey, has pleaded guilty to insider trading and testified last week as a government witness in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial. On the nine-minute call released by prosecutors, the two men discuss Mr. Gupta's family, Goldman, K.K.R. and his role as chairman of New Silk Route Partners, a private equity firm, which in some cases competes with Goldman for deals. ''Goldman is one board right,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says on the recording. ''And he's, you know, he's essentially an observer status, right? He's not in there, you know, rolling up his sleeves.'' Later he added: ''And the issue is the perceived conflict of interest.'' The two also suggest that one reason for Mr. Gupta's decision to leave the Goldman board in 2010 was a post he had taken at K.K.R. in 2008. ''But is it really that he was so greedy for the $12 million that K.K.R. has offered him?'' Mr. Kumar asks on the recording. Mr. Rajaratnam said that ''he ran the numbers with me, right, it was about $5 million a year with upside.'' A K.K.R. spokesman said that Mr. Gupta worked for the firm as a senior adviser and the compensation numbers discussed by Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar were inaccurate. Mr. Gupta stepped down as a K.K.R. adviser this month after the S.E.C.'s action against him. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the recording. Later in the conversation, Mr. Rajaratnam further speculates on why Mr. Gupta took the position at K.K.R. and decided to leave Goldman. ''My analysis of the situation is he's enamored with Kravis, and I think he wants to be in that circle,'' Mr. Rajaratnam says. ''That's a billionaire circle, right? Goldman is like the hundreds of millions circle, right?'' He added: ''And I think here he sees the opportunity to make $100 million over the next five years or 10 years without doing a lot of work.'' Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Kumar also seem worried about their friend. ''At some point, what I worry about is that there can be this massive implosion in him,'' Mr. Kumar said. ''He didn't seem comfortable,'' Mr. Rajaratnam said. ''He seemed like he was tormented, right?'' The second week of Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal insider trading trial begins on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The first two minutes of the nine-minute recording were presented on Friday as evidence of insider trading in Mr. Rajaratnam's trial.

Case<date>Published: March 8, 2011</date><text>The fact pattern looks bad, very bad. Seconds after Rajat K. Gupta, then a director of Goldman Sachs, finished up a board call during which he learned that Warren E. Buffett had agreed to invest $5 billion in the firm, he picked up the phone and called his friend Raj Rajaratnam, regulators contend. Minutes later, Mr. Rajaratnam placed bets on shares of Goldman Sachs that netted his firm, the Galleon Group, $900,000. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused Mr. Gupta of insider trading last week, says this happened not once, but repeatedly. He did the same thing at Procter &amp; Gamble, where he was also a director, the S.E.C. claims. Exactly what was said on these phone calls remains unknown. But if the S.E.C. proves its case, then Mr. Gupta, a respected management guru who once ran McKinsey &amp; Company and advised the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, was routinely ''disclosing their most sensitive and valuable secrets.'' Yet there is something curious about the accusations against Mr. Gupta, which came just days before Mr. Rajaratnam's criminal trial, which is set to begin on Tuesday. Given the seriousness of the claims - insider trading by an executive who had reached the upper echelons of corporate America - why not bring criminal charges against Mr. Gupta? Well, that's where the facts of the case get a little mushy, and they are starting to raise some questions among lawyers about the S.E.C.'s motivations. ''This is very unusual. It's a red flag,'' Kip Weissman, a partner at Luse Gorman Pomerenk &amp; Schick in Washington and a former S.E.C. enforcement lawyer, said of the case. Not only has the Justice Department not brought a criminal case, at least not yet, but the S.E.C. decided to bring its case in front of an administrative law judge instead of in a Federal District Court, where a defendant has full discovery rights. The S.E.C. is using a new provision in the Dodd-Frank Act to bring the case this way. ''It's a little easier from an evidentiary perspective,'' Mr. Weissman said, for the S.E.C. to bring the case in front of an administrative judge. ''The evidentiary standard is lower,'' he explained. ''It's certainly noteworthy that the S.E.C. brought the case in this forum.'' Indeed, statistically, it is notable: of the 26 Galleon-related cases the S.E.C. has brought, all have been brought in federal court. None have been brought in front of an administrative judge. As Mr. Weissman asked, somewhat rhetorically, ''Why?'' The S.E.C.'s laundry list of allegations against Mr. Gupta raises some important questions: Since the government had tapped Mr. Rajaratnam's phones, were any of the conversations with Mr. Gupta that were cited by the S.E.C. recorded? It appears not. In one instance, the S.E.C. said ''telephone records and calendar entries'' indicated only that ''Gupta and Rajaratnam very likely had a telephone conversation.'' Since when has ''very likely'' been considered enough to make a civil allegation? Stranger still, nowhere in the S.E.C.'s filing does it contend that Mr. Gupta received any form of compensation for passing along insider trading tips to Mr. Rajaratnam. If that's right, why would Mr. Gupta pass the information? (The S.E.C. does not have to show that Mr. Gupta benefited financially to prove its case.) None of this is to suggest that the circumstantial evidence isn't powerful. But it does raise red flags among legal experts trying to handicap exactly what the government has up its sleeve. The running narrative among defense lawyers is this: The S.E.C. brought its case in front of an administrative judge to discredit Mr. Gupta to help the criminal case against Mr. Rajaratnam. But you have to imagine that if the evidence was truly overwhelming against him, Mr. Gupta might have sought to become a government witness to save himself. (People close to the case suggest that such a settlement offer had been on the table.) Having said all that, there is something mystifying in the statement that Gary Naftalis, Mr. Gupta's lawyer, made the day he was sued. ''Mr. Gupta has done nothing wrong,'' Mr. Naftalis said. ''There is no allegation that Mr. Gupta traded in any of these securities or shared in any profits as part of any quid pro quo.'' Read those words again. He didn't say Mr. Gupta didn't pass on material nonpublic information or that he didn't breach his fiduciary duty. All he said was that his client wasn't getting paid to do so. Maybe Mr. Naftalis was going only for a short sound bite, but it is odd. In October, Alan Lafley, the former chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, described Mr. Gupta thusly. ''I think of him like Thomas Aquinas,'' the philosopher and priest. The S.E.C. allegations may make him seem less like a saint, but not much like a sinner - at least not yet. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Rajat K. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, was accused of insider trading by the S.E.C. last week.

Many economists think he should be the next person to run it.But among government leaders in Berlin and Paris, where many of Europe’s most important decisions are made, Mario Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, generates a palpable lack of enthusiasm. A longtime central banker with sterling qualifications, Mr. Draghi has been put forward as a front-runner to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet after he steps down as president of the central bank in October. But at a pivotal moment for the euro monetary union, France and Germany want to make sure that the bank’s next leader will have as steady a hand at the helm as any German would. Germany is also reluctant to surrender its de facto right to name the next president. French officials are among those expressing reservations about Mr. Draghi because he was an executive at Goldman Sachs from 2002 to 2005. The investment bank was the lead manager for a 2001 derivatives transaction that allowed Greece to dress up its books in a way that brought it into the euro club. As he tries to win more support, Mr. Draghi is unequivocal about where his priority lies: fighting inflation. Monetary policy at the European Central Bank should “first and foremost be geared toward price stability,” Mr. Draghi emphasized in an interview on Thursday. His supporters say that Mr. Draghi seems to be the only one of the candidates mentioned so far who would not face a steep learning curve — a crucial consideration when euro zone countries are besieged by market speculators and Europe could easily fall back into another financial crisis like the one that hit the Continent last year. As an influential member of the European Central Bank’s governing council and chairman of a panel that is rewriting the rules for global banks, Mr. Draghi is a familiar face at meetings of the Group of 20 leading economies and other international forums. He would have immediate credibility in dealings with his counterparts at the Federal Reserve or the Bank of China. “Mario Draghi is the most qualified candidate,” said Nouriel Roubini, the economist, expressing a commonly held view in the profession. Mr. Draghi was favored by 29 of 45 economists polled by Reuters this month, compared with just six votes for the No. 2 candidate, Erkki Liikanen, the governor of the Bank of Finland. Behind the scenes, Mr. Draghi’s supporters have already begun a quiet but determined campaign to make him the default choice. Romano Prodi, a former prime minister of Italy, described Mr. Draghi as highly discreet. He noted that he was more comfortable in the world of central banking than in the limelight. “As a person, he is reserved,” Mr. Prodi said. “I’m not joking when I tell you he was born a central banker.” But politics can often trump experience in Europe, which has a history of choosing second-tier candidates, notably Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, who remains little known among the general public. Baroque political maneuvering is nothing new to Mr. Draghi, who is seen in Italy as rising above any particular interests or political agendas — a consensus-builder who in his understated way has deftly navigated the minefield of Italian power politics. “Even though he’s a technocrat who has never been involved in politics, he often acts like a politician,” said Massimo Giannini, the business editor of the Rome daily La Repubblica. “He’s seen as a kind of Cardinal Richelieu who knows how to understand certain political dynamics and work inside them in a very intelligent way.” During an hourlong interview on Thursday in his office in Rome, Mr. Draghi, sitting beneath a tapestry depicting Alexander the Great, displayed a reluctance to ruffle political feathers and a highly institutional approach toward public office. Comfortable with power, he nonetheless refused to speak about himself, instead focusing relentlessly on views that underscored his credentials as an inflation-fighter. Time and again, Mr. Draghi emphasized that the most important thing for the European Central Bank was to hold down prices even before they started to creep upward. His statements were consistent with warnings by other members of the central bank’s governing council in recent months that rising costs for oil and other commodities are putting pressure on prices. The risk has risen as popular uprisings in Libya and other countries in the Middle East have pushed oil prices sharply higher. But as a result of the lukewarm attitudes toward Mr. Draghi, analysts say that the contest for the post remains wide open. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is loath to squander political capital at home by backing an Italian for the job. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France may see a chance to sideline a rival by supporting Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, for the post. But as they hunt for a candidate who offers them more of a political payoff, the leaders face a problem. Can they entrust the euro to a compromise choice? Central banks around the world are trying to gauge whether the current oil price spike will have “a permanent effect on inflation, or if it’s just a one-off shock,” Mr. Draghi said. Noting that the European Central Bank has not changed interest rates “for a very, very long time,” he said the central bank would have to “guarantee that inflation expectations remain well anchored.” 1 2 Next Page » Liz Alderman reported from Rome and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

Big banks responded by shifting more compensation into stock, a move intended to align employees' interests more closely with those of investors and discourage excessive risk-taking. But it turns out that executives have a way to get around those best-laid plans. Using complex investment transactions, they can limit the downside on their holdings, or even profit, as other shareholders are suffering. More than a quarter of Goldman Sachs's partners, a highly influential group of around 475 top executives, used these hedging strategies from July 2007 through November 2010, according to a New York Times analysis of regulatory filings. The arrangements were intended to protect their personal portfolios when the firm's stock was highly volatile, especially at the height of the crisis.In some cases, executives saved millions of dollars by using these tactics. One prominent Goldman investment banker avoided more than $7 million in losses over a four-month period. Such transactions are at the center of a debate over whether Wall Street executives should be allowed to hedge their stock holdings. The concern with hedging is that executives can easily break the ties between compensation and company performance. Employees who hedge their holdings are less concerned about a falling share price. That's why the government barred top executives at banks that received multiple bailouts from using the strategies until they paid back the funds.''Many of these hedging activities can create situations when the executives' interests run counter to the company,'' said Patrick McGurn, a governance adviser at RiskMetrics, which advises investors. ''I think a lot of people feel this doesn't have a place in a compensation structure.'' More broadly, critics say, the practice of hedging represents another end run around financial reform. For example, new rules that cracked down on debit card fees have led several big banks to eliminate free checking. Firms also plan to make up missing revenue by adapting their businesses to the tougher new regulations on derivatives and trading with the banks' own capital. ''Wall Street is saying it is reforming itself by granting stock to executives and exposing them to the long-term risk of that investment,'' said Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange Commission. ''Hedging the risk can substantially undo that reform.'' Most public companies, including Wall Street firms, have policies that ban the practice for only their most senior executives, though the number of executives affected varies by company. At The New York Times, executive officers and other employees who have access to material nonpublic information about the company may not engage in hedging without written approval - a group that includes more than 100 people, as well as anyone they supervise. Shareholders can figure out the investment practices of the highest-ranking officers of a public company, who are required by law to report. Even those disclosures are buried deep in the footnotes of regulatory filings. Whether lower-level executives are hedging is nearly impossible to determine. But the unusual structure of the Goldman partnership requires the company to disclose the investment activities of partners in filings. The documents provide a window into what a broad range of senior executives were doing with their own shares. Hedging - a commonly used tactic for years, especially during times of weakness or volatility - makes sense for executives at public companies who have amassed a large concentration of stock. They allow employees to limit losses, raise cash, or diversify their portfolios without selling the underlying holdings. Any individual investor can use hedging tactics for the same reasons, but few do because the transactions are complicated and make more sense for those who own a large amount of stock.</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/business/03views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Nomura Evolves, Just Not So Fast<date>Published: February 2, 2011</date><text>Nomura, the Japanese firm, is evolving into a global investment bank even if it does not yet look like one. It reported a strong increase in investment banking fees for the final quarter of 2010, and its traders have begun to prove their worth. The gap with the big league is closing — slowly.Since Nomura bought the Asian and European businesses of Lehman Brothers in October 2008, it has been chasing the shadow of Lehman’s pre-bust greatness. One challenge was to rebuild the American trading business from scratch. The other was to muscle its way into the big merger and initial public offering deals. On the first front, results are starting to show. While Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reported sequential declines in the region of 30 percent in their quarterly trading revenue, Nomura managed to keep its own flat. As it should: the brokerage firm doubled its headcount in the United States over 18 months, pushing up its compensation ratio to an indulgent 48 percent of revenue. The second goal remains far away. Equity underwriting revenue more than doubled over the last quarter of 2010, and Nomura won some neat mandates, like helping Abu Dhabi hedge its stake in Barclays. But Kenichi Watanabe, Nomura’s chief executive, has promised big deals, not just quirky ones. Nomura had just two of the quarter’s 10 largest worldwide equity issues, and none of the top debt or mergers and acquisitions mandates. Things are moving in the right direction. Nomura’s deal-making fees grew 37 percent during the quarter, faster than JPMorgan Chase’s and Citigroup’s. But even that achievement paled in comparison to the previous year, when Japan’s large financial firms were pumping out new shares to bolster balance sheets. Therein lies Nomura’s biggest frustration: Japan still sets the pace, and the share price. The bank’s domestic business still accounts for 57 percent of revenue. Its stock tracked its Japanese peers on the way down for most of 2010, but lagged them on the way back up. The shares have lagged the DJ Financials Index by 25 percent in the past year. The thing about evolution is that it takes a generation. Upside to Disclosure When Goldman Sachs released the findings of its business standards committee and some new numbers on Jan. 11, investors focused on the bank’s heightened disclosure of its proprietary trading activity and profit. But regulators entrusted with a bigger responsibility, the safety of the financial system, are more excited about what Goldman has yet to reveal. In its new disclosure, and again in its fourth-quarter earnings report on Jan. 19, Goldman added a fourth business segment, known as Investing and Lending, to its income statement, enabling analysts to see a bit more of the firm’s money-making machine. Yet Goldman’s business standards manifesto also promised expanded balance sheet disclosures. These are expected this month in the annual report. It is in the balance sheet details that the devils of the financial system lurk. That is what has senior officials at the Federal Reserve on the edge of their seats. Under last year’s Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, the officials are charged with protecting against further crises. By contrast, some of Goldman’s Wall Street rivals are apprehensive. Goldman promised to modify and simplify the reporting of items like excess liquidity. More important, the firm said it would “enhance disclosure with respect to liquidity stress tests by including details on both scenario assumptions and modeling parameters” for the assets on its $911 billion balance sheet. It is not entirely clear how far this means Goldman will go. It surely is not as big a step as voluntarily reporting a version of the industrywide stress tests conducted by the Fed in 2009, which helped draw a line under the darkest phase of the crisis. But it does sound a lot closer than Goldman or its peers have gone before. Goldman is characteristically starting from a position of strength. With its ratio of Tier 1 capital to assets at a robust 16 percent, the extra bit of leg it plans to show will probably look more appealing than anyone else’s. That means the new information could help Goldman’s shares take on an even brighter sheen relative to peers, as well as force them to consider similar extra disclosure. For regulators who believe in transparency, that would be a virtuous outcome. JOHN FOLEY and ROB COXNomura, the Japanese firm, is evolving into a global investment bank even if it does not yet look like one. It reported a strong increase in investment banking fees for the final quarter of 2010, and its traders have begun to prove their worth.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30FOB-Q4-t.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Questions for Abby Joseph Cohen<date>Published: January 28, 2011</date><text>As a partner at Goldman Sachs and one of the best-known market analysts in this country, you’re surely aware that women continue to be thinly represented among the senior ranks on Wall Street. Why is that? Let’s think about it in the following way: We can only deal with the pool of young women who make themselves available and express interest in investment banking.I assume there’s no shortage of candidates. But it’s not necessarily 50-50. When we go to various M.B.A. programs, for example, and I’m just giving you an illustrative number, if 30 percent of the class is women, then we would probably end up hiring about 30 percent women. But if women make up 30 percent of M.B.A. programs, as has been reported, why do they represent only 12 percent of the current partners at Goldman Sachs? I don’t think that we are proud of it, and I think we do have aspirations of improving the numbers. Do you have a Facebook page? No, I don’t. I don’t think we should talk about this. No one here is supposed to be talking about Facebook. You’re referring to the fact that Goldman Sachs just withdrew its offer to American clients to sell shares of Facebook, which could violate all kinds of rules. I can’t comment. Do you think it’s ethically justifiable that certain bankers earn $50 million or $60 million a year at a time when unemployment is nearly 10 percent and income inequality is widening in this country? The income inequality that you refer to is apparent in many different places. You see it in athletics; you see it in entertainment; you see it in your industry as well. You take a look at the compensation of C.E.O.’s of major corporations, recognizing that those corporations have become much larger —they do business in many different parts around the world — and it’s very difficult to know how to properly benchmark the compensation. You could say that entertainers at least provide entertainment, as opposed to a C.E.O. What is a C.E.O. contributing to society? What about the C.E.O. of the New York Times Company? What about her? She’s contributing a newspaper to society, which presumably keeps the American public better informed. It has been widely observed that the financial-services industry is not creating a product in the tangible sense. It’s unfortunate that — I think that there is not a good understanding as to the role of financial intermediaries. For example, without banks it’s hard to see how businesses would get the money they need to grow and to hire new workers. Let’s not lose track of the fact that most people need to borrow in order to buy a home, and if you don’t have banks, that’s not going to happen. In 2008, David Kostin replaced you as Goldman’s chief forecaster. Did you see that as a demotion? Certainly not. It was a generational thing. I hired David several years earlier, and the idea was that David would move into the position. At the same time my work has gravitated toward other issues. I’ve been focusing not on day-to-day market issues but rather on issues that affect the economy and markets medium- to long-term. Things like climate and the environment, but also demographics and the role of education. Do you feel any responsibility for the economic meltdown of 2008, which you failed to foresee? That’s an odd question to be asking me. Because? I did not think that was part of what we were going to be talking about. We’re talking about your life; there was a big meltdown in 2008. I’m wondering, how do you deal with that emotionally? I would say that the causes of the meltdown were multiple, and it is a mistake to point a finger at any one entity. And that these problems took place not just in the United States. This was a very unfortunate confluence, bad decisions made by many different entities. INTERVIEW HAS BEEN CONDENSED AND EDITED.As a partner at Goldman Sachs and one of the best-known market analysts in this country, you’re surely aware that women continue to be thinly represented among the senior ranks on Wall Street.

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, had a rough 2010. But at least he got a raise: his bonus increased by $3.6 million, according to a regulatory filing. The firm's board granted restricted stock valued at $12.6 million to Mr. Blankfein and other senior executives, including Gary D. Cohn, the firm's president. The board also approved a new annual base salary of $2 million for its chief executive, up from $600,000. Mr. Cohn and others will see their base salaries increase to $1.85 million, according to the filing on Friday. With his previous salary of $600,000, Mr. Blankfein's 2010 compensation comes to $13.2 million. Senior executives often receive part of their compensation in cash, but Goldman did not release details on this component of Mr. Blankfein's compensation. In 2009, amid a widespread public outcry over sky-high pay on Wall Street, Mr. Blankfein and other senior Goldman executives received compensation packages valued at $9 million each. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, Mr. Blankfein made $68.5 million. The lowered bonuses in 2009 were not the only compensation change to come out of the financial crisis. Most financial firms also increased the base salaries of employees, a move regulators hoped would cut down on excessive risk-taking. While Mr. Blankfein's base was only recently increased, Goldman had earlier raised base salaries for other employees. The base pay for Goldman managing directors was recently increased to $500,000, from $300,000. Still, not everyone at Goldman got a raise in 2010. Last year the firm set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it earmarked for compensation in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Goldman had a challenging 2010. Its stock performance was relatively flat, and it reported earnings of $8.35 billion, down 37 percent from 2009. But the firm did better than many of its rivals, which were still rebuilding from the financial crisis. Goldman's reputation, nonetheless, took a severe blow last April, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against the firm, saying that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly designed by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market's collapse. The day the charges were announced, Mr. Blankfein has said, was ''one of the worst days in my professional life.'' The firm paid $550 million to settle the charges. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Mr. Blankfein isn't the only Wall Street chief to get a raise for his work in 2010. JPMorgan Chase has not yet announced the pay of its chief executive, but Jamie Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009. This month, Morgan Stanley's board awarded its chief executive, James Gorman, stock and options valued at $7.4 million. But this represented only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Mr. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009, when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning $1 a year while he tried put the bank back on track, was recently awarded a $1.75 million salary. At Goldman, David A. Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer, and the vice chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg also received stock valued at $12.6 million, regulatory filings show. Their base salaries also rose to $1.85 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd C.

Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning a mere $1 in salary while he tried put the bank back on track, has been awarded a $1.75 million salary, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The lifting of Mr. Pandit's symbolic hair shirt came as Morgan Stanley disclosed much, though not all, of the compensation for its leader. James P. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009 when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Other Wall Street banks - including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - are still to report what their leaders will be paid. JPMorgan Chase disclosed compensation for some of its senior mangers, but has not yet approved the pay package for its chief executive and chairman, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009, which made him among the highest-paid Wall Street executives. No decision has been made. But JPMorgan had a banner 2010 - it was the most profitable year in the company's history - and four of Mr. Dimon's top lieutenants have already been awarded stock worth more than $10 million each. Two years since emerging from the financial crisis, Wall Street profits - and big paychecks - appear to be back. But the public uproar that erupted over outsize bonuses that banks awarded, even after accepting a government bailouts, has not yet been tamed. Banks are still trying to balance the need to attract star executives and traders with regulators' demands to ensure that their pay programs do not create excessive risk. Gone is some of the sensitivity to lawmakers and the broader public, who were angry at seeing such lavish paydays as they were losing their homes and jobs. As bonus checks were doled out at several big banks earlier this week, it is clear that 2010 is shaping up to be a very good year - although perhaps not as good as a year earlier. Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant, said that he expected pay to fall about 10 to 15 percent for 2010, and perhaps more than twice that amount in many trading businesses where the results were much weaker. Amid greater scrutiny from the public and federal regulators since the financial crisis, the banks have awarded a greater portion of compensation in the form of stock - some even higher than 50 percent - and emphasized the use of deferred pay and policies to claw back ill-gotten bonuses. Over all, what is remarkable is the wide variation in pay packages among the banking giants. At the industry's strongest banks, employee compensation, on average, fell markedly from a year ago. At Goldman Sachs, workers earned, on average, about $398,000 in 2010, down 11 percent from a year ago. At JPMorgan's investment bank, employee pay was, on average, about $370,000 - about 2.4 percent lower than in 2009 and in line with the overall firm's decline in compensation. Wall Street's star bankers and traders, regardless of where they work, will still reap paychecks worth millions of dollars. Meanwhile, several of the weaker players ratcheted their compensation packages upward. At Morgan Stanley, for example, workers' paychecks rose about 8 percent, on average, to about $257,000. Citigroup and Bank of America, whose average paychecks are substantially lower because they employ tens of thousands consumer bankers who draw smaller salaries and bonuses, reported increases of about 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Some pay analysts suspect that this divergence may stem, at least in part, from the need of these more troubled firms to offer bigger paydays to attract and retain top talent. Those occupying offices in the corporate suite continued to score big paydays. Citigroup's board had signaled a pay increase for Mr. Pandit last fall when they granted stock awards to several of his top lieutenants and announced that they planned to restore his compensation so that it would be in line with other Wall Street chiefs. Mr. Pandit had vowed at a Congressional hearing in February 2009 that he would accept only $1 until the bank returned to profitability. On Tuesday, Citigroup posted an annual profit in 2010, the first time it had done so since the financial crisis struck. Richard D. Parsons, Citigroup's chairman, said that the board was ''very pleased with the progress the company has made under Vikram's leadership'' and that he merited the raise for the coming year. Citigroup's board could also choose to award him additional stock and options when it reviews his 2011 compensation later this year. Of course, Mr. Pandit still holds about $79.7 million in cash from the sale of his investment fund, Old Lane Partners, to Citigroup in April 2007. At JPMorgan Chase, Jes Staley, the head of its investment bank, was awarded more than $14.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. His total compensation may be even higher when his salary and bonus are disclosed. Ina R. Drew, the bank's chief investment officer, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of its asset management division, each received stock and options worth more than $11 million. That poises them to be among the highest-paid women on Wall Street. On Friday, Morgan Stanley's board awarded Mr. Gorman stock and options valued at $7.4 million, according to Equilar. But this represents only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Morgan Stanley also released details of more than $32 million in stock awards for 10 other top executives. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The decision to hire Goldman Sachs came after several suitors, including the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, approached Warner Music's management in recent months about buying the company, according to an executive briefed on the matter who spoke only anonymously. Instead of negotiating solely with K.K.R., the company's management decided to begin a formal sale process by hiring Goldman, which has recently begun making pitches to financial investors and media companies about buying Warner. One possible outcome of the auction is for Warner to sell not the entire company but only Warner/Chappell, its prized publishing arm, said a person with direct knowledge of the process. Meanwhile, a separate set of bankers within Goldman has been working on a potential acquisition of EMI by Warner. Goldman has reached out to Citigroup, which owns a large amount of EMI's debt and could soon control the company if it fails to meet its payments, according to executives involved in the process, who would speak of the confidential negotiations only anonymously. The unusual two-track process of Warner seeking to buy while also exploring selling out to new investors underscores the desire of Warner's private equity owners to either make a big strategic move and double down on the music business by buying EMI, or cash out. They acquired the company from Time Warner more than seven years ago - a long time frame for private equity investors, who normally prefer to own a company for three to five years before selling. Late last year, Citigroup won a lawsuit against EMI's private equity owners, Terra Firma, which had filed a suit that said Citigroup had defrauded Terra Firma during the auction of EMI in August of 2007. That deal, for $6.8 billion, came at the height of the credit boom - and just before credit markets began to freeze - and has been an ill-fated move for Terra Firma and its founder, Guy Hands. K.K.R's interest in Warner is related to expanding a joint venture it owns with Bertelsmann to license music rights. K.K.R. had been in talks with Warner Music about engineering a joint bid for EMI, but those discussions then turned toward K.K.R. buying Warner outright, according to one of the executives involved in the process. Warner Music, whose artist roster includes Kid Rock, Green Day and Bruno Mars, is the only pure music company that is publicly traded. Others, such as Universal Music and Sony Music, are part of much larger conglomerates. A group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., a group that also included Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Providence Equity Partners, bought Warner Music from Time Warner in March of 2004 for $2.6 billion in cash. The company went public in 2005, and although the investors still control the company - only a small percentage of Warner's stock is in public hands - the investors have already profited through hefty dividend payouts. A Warner Music spokesman and a Goldman spokesman declined comment. In a letter to shareholders sent last week, Mr. Bronfman wrote, ''clearly many obstacles lie ahead, but our confidence in the company's future prospects is based on our consistent track record and our proven ability to outperform the rest of the industry.'' Indeed, as the overall music industry has shrunk remarkably over the last few years, Warner has shrunk less - and has actually improved its profit margins through cost-cutting. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which measures music sales globally, sales of music declined nearly 23 percent between 2005 and 2009. Over that time, Warner's revenue declined much less - around 9 percent. With the rise of the file-sharing Web site Napster in the late 1990s, the music industry was the first slice of the media business to see its economics disrupted by the digital age, and by the time Mr. Bronfman and his group bought Warner, that trend was clear. The decline of newspapers followed the diminishment of the music industry, and more recently the economics of television and film have also come under pressure from the Internet. But unlike, say, newspapers and magazines, the music industry has embraced a durable model to get paid for selling music online through services such as Apple's iTunes Store - even if revenue has declined and piracy remains rampant.

But lately it seems the lackluster economy has gotten the better of the firm. The Wall Street bank, which reported a 53 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, experienced a noticeable slowdown in most of its important divisions, citing increased competition and depressed client activity amid economic uncertainty. David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, described the environment as ''dead'' and ''challenging''- reminiscent of the firm's comments in the previous period. But economic factors are not just to blame, analysts say. Goldman may be facing fundamental and long-lasting issues with its business model. Clients are shying away from the high-margin products that ran into trouble during the financial crisis, and coming regulation will only crimp profits further. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which reported earnings in the last week, noted similar problems in certain divisions. In a nod to just how difficult the environment has become, Goldman's return on equity, a measure of profitability, fell to 11.5 percent in 2010, down from 22.5 percent in the previous year and 32.8 percent in 2006. ''I think for the time being this is the new reality,' said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''It is not doom and gloom out there in economy. What is missing are things like the structured products and derivatives that were helping their earnings.'' Shares of Goldman fell $8.19, or 4.7 percent, to $166.49 on Wednesday. Of course, Goldman is hardly on the ropes. Despite the weakness, the firm still posted a healthy quarterly profit of $2.39 billion, distilled on revenue of $8.64 billion. For the year, revenue fell 13 percent, to about $39 billion. Annual earnings were $8.35 billion, 38 percent lower than in 2009. But the underwhelming results are a stark reminder of the challenging markets and weak economy. Clients of Goldman, big-name companies that pay it to organize mergers, bond offerings and more, have been sitting on the sidelines. Profitable areas like mortgage-backed securities have shrunk sharply. And competition has increased from companies like Morgan Stanley, which has regained some of its former strength. The firm is also still beholden to Warren E. Buffett. For months, Goldman has wanted to pay back a $5 billion investment from Mr. Buffett made at the height of the financial crisis. But the firm first needs the government's approval. Mr. Viniar declined to comment on the stake, saying only that ''Goldman is exploring all its options.'' At Goldman, almost every business is feeling the pain. Revenue in its powerful fixed-income, currency and commodities unit fell 48 percent, to $1.64 billion, from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue, which includes equity and debt underwriting, fell 10 percent, to $1.64 billion. The division, which often accounts for a third of Goldman's total sales, made up just 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Investment management was one of the few bright spots in the quarter, as revenue rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion. Compensation did not decrease as much as profit. In 2010, Goldman set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it set aside in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009, when the firm came under intense scrutiny for handing out big bonuses after accepting government aid. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Despite weaker-than-usual results, Mr. Viniar was optimistic about Goldman's fortunes, pointing to improvements in the unemployment rate and other economic indicators. The firm plans to add employees in the coming months, mostly overseas. Last year, Goldman increased its employee base by 10 percent, to 35,700 employees. ''I would feel worse if the economic data was really bad,'' he said. ''And it's not.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. The New Year is a time for reflection, so it was heartening to see Goldman Sachs come out with 63 pages of resolutions. The investment bank published its ''Report of the Business Standards Committee'' last week, a document in which it reiterated its principles and announced the formation of many new committees. Goldman will be an open book, the firm pledged, disclosing more clearly how much business the firm does for itself (not as much as all those detractors think) and how much it works for its clients (every waking moment). Goldman suffered a brutal year, paying a $550 million fine to settle federal claims of civil securities fraud and being vilified at a Senate hearing. Even the $15.38 billion the firm has set aside for compensation in 2010 wasn't enough to salve the pain. Goldman would like our love, too. And so the powerful investment bank has embarked on a journey of self-improvement, a great American ritual from Ben Franklin to Elizabeth Gilbert. Goldman's report should have been titled ''Eat, Pay, Trade.'' In a video that accompanies the report, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive, said the firm conducted a ''thorough self-assessment,'' followed by a ''recommitment to core values and principles.'' It's language that ''reads straight out of a Tony Robbins retreat manual, not your usual business document,'' said Christine B. Whelan, a University of Pittsburgh sociologist who has studied the self-help industry. Of course, releasing the report is a public relations stunt. Some of it was welcome, like the increased financial disclosure. Some may fall by the wayside, like most New Year's resolutions. Some seems as disingenuous as any piece of professional flackery. Goldman's effort fits neatly into what the historian (and former New York councilwoman) Eva S. Moskowitz has called the therapeutic gospel, a doctrine so ingrained in American society that few of us consciously recognize it. The gospel consists of three tenets: happiness is the supreme goal, problems stem from psychological causes, and those psychological problems are treatable. The therapeutic gospel is all about me and my problems. Goldman thinks its problems stem, if not from psychological issues, then from attitudinal ones. Significant management and operational changes are starkly missing from Goldman's leaf-turning exercise. Instead, Goldman has decided that its troubles emanate from not having treated clients nicely. Or, more likely, Goldman thinks its problem is that the world thinks Goldman didn't treat its clients nicely. But that wasn't the problem with Goldman Sachs in the fall of 2008. Creating collateralized debt obligations and betting against their clients was unseemly, but it wasn't the cause of the global financial crisis. Goldman's leverage - and the leverage at other major financial institutions - was the real issue. Goldman's business model was broken because it made a classic banking mistake: it lent long and borrowed short. All banks are susceptible to runs. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers had theirs, deservedly. By the fall of 2008, it was Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs's turn. Goldman took taxpayer dollars and was granted access to cheap Federal Reserve money. Goldman insists that it would have survived the crisis anyway. We'll never know whether it would have, because the fact is that Goldman received assistance. Goldman, like all the other major investment and commercial banks, had become too big and intertwined, making the financial system too fragile. In other words, the flaws in the financial system were structural, more like the problem of poverty, and not based on character. As such, they require solutions beyond pledges of better behavior. Unfortunately, despite a hulking financial reform law, the American financial system still has largely the same structural issues that it had before the crisis. Neither Goldman nor the government shows any inclination to face these issues. What about investors? The covenant that equity investors have struck with investment banks goes something like this: Deliver high returns and we will allow employees to take about half of the revenue for themselves as compensation. It was always a bad bargain, made worse by the financial crisis. Lehman investors were wiped out. Bear Stearns investors took huge hits. (Whether investors have learned from that experience, or whether they have learned to expect bailouts, is debatable.) Despite Goldman's reputation in some corners as Evil Genius, its shares are actually suffering in the marketplace because investors worry about its volatile and unpredictable results from quarter to quarter. These concerns were validated when Goldman reported on Wednesday that trading and securities services profit took a big hit in the fourth quarter, dropping 31 percent. The stock slid 3 percent by midafternoon in response. Investors prefer annuities to swing-for-the-fences profits. Compared with pure asset managers and investment banks that specialize in either advisory work or making markets, Goldman stock trades at a discount these days. Goldman's price-to-earnings ratio stands at less than 10, while Lazard (a pure advisory firm), Jefferies (a market maker) and BlackRock (an asset manager) trade at significantly higher multiples. Investors often prefer to look at a price-to-book ratio to value financial firms; even on that measure, Goldman is far below its peak valuation. Could there be an argument that Goldman should break up into three smaller, more focused companies? It would be better for the financial system, and just might lead to the self-improvement that Goldman is searching for.

The offering would cap a quick turnaround for BankUnited and a nice win for the private equity investors who own the bank, including Wilbur Ross and John Kanas, the former head of North Fork Bank.

They are now poised to reap a windfall that was sown in the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008. Nearly 36 million stock options were granted to employees in December 2008 - 10 times the amount issued the previous year - when the stock was trading at $78.78. Since those uncertain days, Goldman's business has roared back and its share price has more than doubled, closing on Tuesday at nearly $175. The options grant is among the many details that emerge from a study of regulatory filings and internal partnership documents by The New York Times and Footnoted.com, a division of Morningstar that scrutinizes corporate disclosures. These filings provide a much fuller picture of both Goldman's compensation and its elite partnership of 475 people who run the firm. At the center of Goldman's lucrative compensation program is the partnership. Unlike other Wall Street firms, Goldman retained a partnership system when it became a publicly traded company in 1999. Goldman's partners are its highest executives and its biggest stars. Yet while Goldman is required to report compensation for its top officers, it releases very little information about this broader group, remaining tightlipped about even basic information like who is currently a partner. The documents illustrate just how much wealth the partnership owns and has cashed out over the years. Goldman has almost 860 current and former partners, the documents show. In the last 12 years, they have cashed out more than $20 billion in Goldman shares and currently hold more than $10 billion in Goldman stock. All Wall Street firms dole out stock to reward their employees. But the reporting of who gets what and who sells is limited to the firm's top officers. The Goldman filings provide a window into how broad and how lucrative stock-based compensation can be. The 2008 stock option grant came at a time when the firm's financial performance took a hit and its top executives were not paid bonuses. The grant, much of it awarded to partners, gave options that could be exercised in one-third installments in January 2010, January 2011 and January 2012. The shares cannot be sold or transferred until January 2014. The award has already helped increase the partners' stake in Goldman to 11.2 percent, from 8.7 percent. And as additional options vest, the partners' control of the firm will most likely increase. Goldman declined to comment. In addition to the cumulative stock sales and stock ownership, the filings show an inner circle that is chiefly male - 87 percent of the current partners are men - and shed light on how much each partner has cashed out over the years. The analysis, which examined nearly 5,000 pages of regulatory filings, was a joint effort by The Times and the Footnoted.com senior reporter Theo Francis. With Goldman set to report earnings on Wednesday, the newest class of inductees will get their first glimpse into the privileges of partnership, as the firm begins to notify its more than 35,000 employees about their year-end bonuses. Goldman is on track to pay out $17.5 billion in compensation for last year. While that is down from the record $20.19 billion in 2007, it's up more than a billion from 2009. The documents also show what shares partners sold before they became officers and were required to make disclosures. Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, for example, has cashed in a total of $93.8 million in shares since 1999, a number that captures both known stock sales since he became an officer at Goldman, and sales not individually reported since before he was required to disclose such transactions. In the eight years since becoming a senior executive in 2002, Mr. Blankfein has sold $42.5 million, roughly 45 percent of the total over the years. As of August, Mr. Blankfein and his family owned 2.03 million shares worth about $355 million if they had been cashed out on Jan. 14.</text></article>

The four banks that landed the coveted roles are Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, these people said. Selecting the four underwriters of the planned stock sale - which could exceed the size of General Motors' $23.1 billion initial public offering in November - is the next major step in the government's effort to reduce its holdings in A.I.G. The Treasury Department owns about 92.1 percent of the insurer after finishing a complex recapitalization plan on Friday that paid off A.I.G.'s debts to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Representatives of A.I.G., Treasury and the banks declined to comment. A.I.G. and Treasury officials picked the underwriters over the weekend. Last Thursday, they heard about 10 proposals from top representatives of major banks, people briefed on the matter previously said. In sessions of about 45 minutes, the bankers answered questions about the size, timing and other technical aspects of the offering, these people said. Among those making proposals at last week's meetings were Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, and Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, these people said. The size of A.I.G.'s offering will depend on market conditions and investors' appetite for the huge number of shares, the people briefed on Tuesday cautioned. These people were granted anonymity to talk freely about confidential details of the offering. The Treasury has expressed a desire to hold two stock sales this year, perhaps lowering its stake to 33 percent. The first stock sale, which would probably be held in mid-May, would include both shares owned by the government and newly issued A.I.G. stock. The investment banks are not expected to collect a large fee on the offering, at least compared with other stock sales. The government is expected to pay no more than 0.5 percent of the total deal, far below the normal rate, according to one of the people with knowledge of deal. But the sheer size of the transaction is still likely to yield a big payout. One notable investment bank among the chosen underwriters is Goldman, which has had a rocky history with A.I.G. The bank's demands for collateral on the complex credit-default swap deals it struck with the insurer in 2008 helped weaken A.I.G.'s financial position. For that reason, some bankers and analysts had speculated that the bank might not be a top contender for a leading role in the stock sale. A surprising exclusion is Morgan Stanley, which has had a close relationship with the government throughout the financial crisis. The firm served as an adviser to the Fed on A.I.G. matters over the past few years. Along with JPMorgan, it also was a lead underwriter for the G.M. public offering. Shares in A.I.G. closed on Tuesday at $53.17, down about 1.5 percent. The company's stock price is expected to fall over the next several days as warrants are distributed to nongovernment shareholders.

The decision is a considered a serious embarrassment for Goldman, which had marketed the investment to its wealthiest clients, including corporate magnates and directors of the nation's largest companies. The offering was supposed to have been a triumph for the firm, which is trying to move past run-ins with regulators, including a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer over a complex mortgage investment. But the Facebook plan is now likely to raise new questions about whether Goldman tried to push regulatory boundaries once again. Goldman made its decision after the investment plan drew scrutiny. The S.E.C. had opened an inquiry into the structure of the offering and whether it violated the law because of widespread news coverage. Federal and state regulations prohibit what is known as ''general solicitation and advertising'' in private offerings. Firms like Goldman seeking to raise money cannot take action that resembles public promotion of the offering, like buying ads or communicating with news outlets. In a statement on Monday, the firm said: ''In light of this intense media coverage, Goldman Sachs has decided to proceed only with the offer to investors outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S. private placement under U.S. law.'' A report by The New York Times, published late on Jan. 2, that Goldman had invested $450 million in Facebook and would create a special-purpose investment vehicle for clients, citing people involved in the deal, appeared to prompt the regulatory scrutiny. ''The transaction generated intense media attention following the publication of an article on the evening of January 2, 2011, shortly after the launch of the transaction,'' the firm said in its statement Monday. Goldman had not been planning to initiate the offering that night, but it sped up the process after The Times called the firm seeking comment, according to an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. That night, a Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Late that night, before the report was published, executives in Goldman's private wealth-management unit e-mailed their clients about the offering, people who received the e-mail said. Goldman added in its statement on Monday that the decision was made on its own and ''was not required or requested by any other party.'' Foreign investors will still be able to participate in the Goldman offering because they are not subject to the S.E.C. rules on solicitation in private offerings. However, all partners of Goldman, whether based in the United States or abroad, will not be allowed to invest, according to people briefed on the matter. It is unclear how much money Goldman will raise for Facebook. In a private memorandum to clients when it made the offering, it said it planned to raise as much as $1.5 billion. The minimum investment is $2 million. The overall deal pegged Facebook's value at $50 billion. While the offering was oversubscribed - perhaps by as much as three times - with American clients now ineligible to participate, it is not clear whether Goldman or Facebook will lower the size of the offering. A majority of Goldman's high-net-worth clients are based in the United States, and these investors may be upset over being denied a potentially lucrative opportunity afforded to investors in Europe and Asia. For Goldman executives who manage money for wealthy families, so-called special investments have long been a major selling point in luring clients to the firm. The argument to prospective clients is that by placing their money with Goldman, they have access to the same investment opportunities as the firm, long considered one of the world's smartest investors.</text></article>

It's not on the credit-default swaps of A.I.G. or any other investment, however. The Wall Street firm is bringing its favorite barber in-house. Salvatore Anzalone has been trimming the tresses of Goldman employees for nearly two decades, including those of the last two Goldman chief executives - Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current head of the bank. He first attracted a Goldman following at Salvatore's Barber Shop, in the basement of the building in Lower Manhattan that until recently housed the firm's huge trading floor. Last year, Goldman's employees moved out of its offices into new state-of-the-art headquarters in Battery Park City, a little more than a mile away from its old home. Mr. Anzalone followed his loyal clients, opening a location in July in a Goldman-owned hotel adjacent to the firm. But the hotel, an Embassy Suites, closed last week for renovations, forcing Mr. Anzalone to shutter his shop. Faced with the prospect of going without Mr. Anzalone's old-school haircuts, which include straight-razor neck shaves and witch hazel-dabbed towels, Goldman came to Mr. Anzalone with an offer: he could save his shop by moving it into Goldman's headquarters until the hotel makeover was completed. So next week, he is moving to a new outpost inside the Goldman building. The firm is setting up a small barber shop on the mezzanine level, with two chairs. Mr. Anzalone is not the first haircutter to become close to a financial heavyweight. Warren E. Buffett's relationship with his barber, Stan Docekal, has led Buffett devotees to visit Mr. Docekal's shop in Omaha in search of investment tips. John J. Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, was said to be so attached to his longtime barber, Salvatore Macri, that when Mr. Mack left Morgan Stanley in 2001 to run Credit Suisse, he began shuttling Mr. Macri downtown to his new offices for discreet trims. On Thursday, Mr. Anzalone, a native Sicilian with a high-pitched laugh and a habit of gesticulating with his free hand, was trimming sideburns in a rolled-up dress shirt and a yellow tie speckled with bits of hair. It was his last week at his soon-to-be-closed location, which charges $28 for a basic haircut. (No word on whether Mr. Paulson and Mr. Blankfein, both folliclely challenged, received discounts.) Mr. Anzalone seems to have learned from his customers at Goldman, whose business principles demand discretion in its dealings with clients. When a reporter said he was writing an article, Mr. Anzalone declined to discuss his Goldman clients and his move to the firm's building. Known as ''Sal,'' Mr. Anzalone began his career in 1974 at Nino's, a popular barber shop near Wall Street. In 1994, he struck out on his own and opened Salvatore's. The threat to Mr. Anzalone's new shop emerged last year, when Goldman announced it would renovate the Embassy Suites hotel, which it had bought in 2006 with plans to turn it into a hotel for the bank's executives visiting New York. Goldman has closed the Embassy Suites for a yearlong refurbishment in part to assuage its executives who had grumbled about the accommodations. In the meantime, Mr. Anzalone has moved around the corner and into Goldman's new 43-story steel-and-glass tower, which already includes such comforts as a 54,000-square-foot gym. And like much of what the firm does, the deal with Mr. Anzalone has in at least one respect an air of exclusivity. Only customers from Goldman are allowed. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

As a start, Goldman restated its financial results for the third quarter, giving better insight into how much revenue its hedge fund, real estate and private equity operations generated, among other things. This initial disclosure was short of details on Goldman's business, however. Some revenue appears to have simply been reallocated to different business lines. ''It remains to be seen how much detail we'll get,'' said Jim Sinegal, an analyst with Morningstar who covers the banking industry. ''It's still going to be difficult to figure out exactly what they're doing, but it's a step in the right direction,'' he said, noting that ''almost any additional disclosure would be an improvement.'' In a 63-page report on Tuesday, Goldman listed 39 ways to amend its business practices - changes largely aimed at bolstering internal controls and disclosure. Goldman is trying to rehabilitate its public image, which has taken a beating since the financial crisis and its aftermath. The greater detail is intended as a response to criticism that Goldman has put its own interests ahead of those of clients. Goldman clients have complained that ''in some circumstances the firm weighs its interests and short-term incentives too heavily,'' the report said. The report proposes to break down what Goldman sees as its responsibilities, depending on the role it is performing for a client. The bank also plans to offer investors additional insight into its trading revenue, which is among its more secretive practices and an area where the bank's interests do not always align with that of its clients. The bank said it planned to provide enhanced details of whether revenue was coming from trades made on behalf of a client, or only for itself. Yet Goldman is by no means transforming its business. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' And how the report will be received within Goldman is not yet clear. The proposed changes might take time to seep in at the bank, said Kimberly Scott, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who focuses on organizational change. ''All eyes are going to be on what Goldman's leaders and managers are doing and saying,'' said Ms. Scott, who has been a management consultant for more than 15 years. ''If there's any kind of mixed message at all, it will be an uphill battle.'' Goldman's new financial statements, based on Tuesday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, will expand to include a fourth business line. Goldman currently reports three business lines: investment banking, trading and principal investments, and asset management and securities services. In the future, investors will see investment banking, institutional client services, investing and lending, and investment management. The most noticeable and important change is the creation of a segment called investing and lending. The new category, among other things, sheds more light on the firm's hedge fund, private equity and real estate operations, analysts say. According to the S.E.C. filing, the group notched revenue of nearly $1.8 billion in the third quarter, or about 20 percent of overall revenue. Yet the new institutional client services segment, with nearly $4.7 billion of revenue, is clouded in mystery. About $2.7 billion of its revenue is part of the fixed-income, currency and commodities trading business, or F.I.C.C., Goldman's largest business and one about which it provides very little detail. Nonetheless, Goldman's report could ease some of the public scrutiny facing the bank, according to one public relations consultant. ''You absolutely have to demonstrate, especially to regulators and legislators, that you are taking action,'' said Eric Dezenhall, who runs a crisis management firm in Washington. Goldman on Tuesday took ''baby steps'' in the right direction, he said. ''Imagine what would happen if they didn't do it.''

But the Wall Street firm’s reorganization of how it reports earnings also serves its own purposes. It makes valuing the firm a bit easier by enabling a better sum-of-the-parts analysis than was previously possible.Let’s start with institutional client services, the segment that houses all Goldman’s trading and market-making for clients and accounts for about 60 percent of the firm’s revenue. Being newly scrubbed of any outright proprietary or prop trading means it’s reasonable to compare this with a firm like Knight Capital. Sure, Goldman’s business is larger, but it also probably takes more risk. On Knight’s valuation multiple of around 11.5 times estimated 2010 earnings Goldman’s unit is worth an eye-popping $59 billion. Now for investment management. The division is worth about $9.5 billion if ascribed BlackRock’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio of just under 19 times. Goldman’s investment bank group, meanwhile, is arguably comparable to the financial sector specialist Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, and on that firm’s valuation multiple Goldman’s market-leading franchise is worth about $21.5 billion. All in, that’s $90 billion, or $3.5 billion more than Goldman’s market value on Tuesday. On this back-of-the-envelope analysis, which annualizes Goldman’s pretax earnings for the first nine months of last year and assumes a flat 33 percent tax rate, that suggests shareholders are ascribing no value to the firm’s prop businesses, which are now collected under the investing and lending heading. That’s despite commanding the highest pretax margin of any business line at the firm — almost 50 percent. This valuation also ignores a collection of investments that Goldman reckons are currently worth about $15 billion. It’s reasonable for investors to be cautious of proprietary risk-taking. And client trading can cause losses, too. Being deemed worthless may be a blow to the unit’s ego. But it serves Goldman’s purpose well. Even if the new regulation known as the Volcker Rule were to kill off all its prop activities, the firm’s stock shouldn’t take a hit: it’s already trading at around fair value. That’s fodder for a bullish view of Goldman’s shares. The iPhone Winner Apple has again turned iPhone buzz into gold. Despite all the talk of possible bells and whistles, Verizon Wireless so far looks to be offering the smartphone on terms roughly similar to AT&amp;T’s. The only clear winners will be Apple’s masters of hype. Some AT&amp;T customers might want to switch to Verizon Wireless. But that could cost them. Only a third of AT&amp;T’s iPhone customers have contracts that expire this year, according to UBS. Others would have to pay up to $325 in termination fees and least $199 for a new iPhone from Verizon Wireless, because the two networks run on different standards. As for Verizon Wireless’s customers, they will now get a chance to carry an Apple device. But they will pay much the same as AT&amp;T users. And for Verizon Wireless itself, mass adoption of the iPhone wouldn’t come cheap. Like AT&amp;T, it will subsidize every iPhone to the tune of perhaps $400 upfront for customers with a two-year contract. Furthermore, the handset encourages heavy data use, which in turn demands investment in cell towers and other infrastructure. Add up the burden, and the operators may not even cover their cost of capital. AT&amp;T’s newer customers pay more for downloading more data, which can change this calculus. Yet Verizon Wireless may swallow the cost of sticking with all-you-can-eat plans, at least for a while, to win over customers. Apple is therefore the most obvious beneficiary. Verizon Wireless brings it more than 90 million possible new iPhone users — potentially at the expense of rival smartphone makers. And both AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless will now have to spend heavily to advertise the iPhone. Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, and his cohorts have already benefited from the chatter surrounding something that, for any other company, would be a routine product line extension. Investors, at least, may have caught on. With the much anticipated announcement now out in the open, Apple’s stock dipped just a fraction on Tuesday. But shares in both AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications, the wireless unit’s controlling shareholder, were down approaching 2 percent.

Regulation<date>Published: January 12, 2011</date><text>Harry Campbell Facebook's sale of private shares to Goldman Sachs's private clients is a Rorschach test. Commentators who think that there is too much regulation have asserted, not surprisingly, that Sarbanes-Oxley and increased United States regulation of public companies deterred Facebook from going ahead with an initial public offering this year. The truth is much more complex. Since Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted in 2002, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have actually liberalized the regulatory regime for companies when they go public, in some cases arguably too far. But the outcry in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley was that overregulation had shut down the I.P.O. market. The most prominent evidence cited was that foreign companies were no longer listing in the United States. According to Dealogic, three foreign companies listed on an American stock exchange in 2003 compared with 75 in 2000, the height of the Internet bubble. Sarbanes-Oxley probably did deter foreign companies from listing in the United States, if not for the actual regulation than for bad public relations. But the bad economy at the time was most likely the primary reason for the dearth of I.P.O's. Immense pressure was on the S.E.C. to lure back foreign offerings by liberalizing the regulatory regime applicable to domestic and foreign companies alike. The commission repeatedly acted to reduce the regulatory requirements on foreign companies. The S.E.C. revised its accounting rules to permit use of international accounting standards by foreign issuers and to freely permit these companies to leave the American markets if they thought United States regulation was too burdensome. The S.E.C. also responded more broadly to reduce regulation, particularly that imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley, on all public companies. Among other actions, the commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board made compliance significantly easier with respect to Section 404, the requirement that auditors must certify the validity of a company's internal controls. Section 404 is often cited as Sarbanes-Oxley's most significant burden. And in the Dodd-Frank act, Congress eliminated the requirement to comply with Section 404 for companies with a market value of less than $75 million and directed the S.E.C. to look at removing the restriction for companies with a market capitalization of up to $250 million. The Supreme Court also provided help, by making it significantly harder to sue public companies for securities fraud in several cases. The net result is that regulation for all public companies in the United States is in some cases lighter than before Sarbanes-Oxley. And despite the rhetoric, the evidence on which this liberalization was based was quite mixed. In one study, Robert Bartlett, a Berkeley law professor, found that the overwhelming majority of companies bought by private equity firms still voluntarily complied with the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley in order to issue debt to finance these acquisitions. In other words, investors liked the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, and companies willingly complied when they did not need to. Others argued that the decline of the I.P.O. market was largely unrelated to Sarbanes-Oxley. Grant Thornton, an accounting and consulting firm, has ably detailed in a report why there was a significant drop in small-issuer I.P.O.'s starting in 1997. Grant Thornton asserts that the reason is actually a result of changes in market structure. Decimalization - pricing stocks in cents rather than fractions - took profits out of trading that had previously given incentive to brokers to list small companies. New order-handling rules and the rise of online brokers similarly reduced incentives. The result is that in 1996, the number of I.P.O.'s raising less than $25 million was 309, which declined to nine by 2001, a year before Sarbanes-Oxley, and was only 13 in 2010, according to Dealogic. The flight of foreign companies could be attributed in large part to the development of mature markets elsewhere. Last year, according to Dealogic, Asia will for the first time lead the I.P.O. market with $147 billion worth of issuances, compared with $44.4 billion for the United States and $39.1 billion for all of Europe.</text></article>

The Deal Professor offers a guide to understanding the legal issues surrounding the deal. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS Nielsen Holdings, the television ratings and consumer measurement company, is tempering expectations ahead of its initial public offering. According to an amended version of its prospectus, filed on Monday, Nielsen expects to price its shares at $20 to $22. At the midpoint of that range, Nielsen will raise $1.5 billion -- a significant step down from its previous estimate late last year of $2 billion. Under the terms of the deal, underwriters also have the option to buy an additional 10.7 million shares. And if that option is fully exercised, Nielsen will increase its total fund-raising to about $1.7 billion. EVELYN M. RUSLI SPINOFF Morgan Stanley announced on Monday that it would part ways with its in-house quantitative trading unit by the end of 2012. The new firm will be called PDT Advisors, derived from its original name as the Process Driven Trading unit. The company, in which Morgan is expected to maintain a stake, will be headed by Peter Muller, above. BIG INVESTMENT Square, a mobile payments company, announced Monday that it had raised $27.5 million in a new round of financing led by Sequoia Capital. The deal, which includes several private and strategic investors-- like Khosla Ventures and Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's chief executive -- values the start-up at $240 million, according to a person close to the deal.

The Wall Street investment bank, which has been criticized for putting its own interests ahead of clients', plans to detail new rules around disclosure and financial reporting on Tuesday, as suggested by the study. The rules are aimed at bolstering internal controls, improving transparency and burnishing its reputation. But whether the report will result in any meaningful change or give investors a deep look inside Goldman's opaque trading operations remains an open question, according to one analyst. ''We have all worked at companies where you get these memos. A memo only goes so far,'' said a Credit Agricole Securities analyst, Michael Mayo. ''But it may help define some of the gray areas, and it could incrementally help perception and show clients they are trying to gain more control of the situation.'' The changes, set to be released in a 63-page internal report, are the findings of an internal review into the firm's business practices, broad parts of which were analyzed by The New York Times and appeared in DealBook. In the document, Goldman outlines several modifications to its operations, including enhancing its quarterly financial reports and clearly detailing its specific role in transactions. The firm also said it would strengthen standards in so-called structured products, the complicated investments that got a bad name during the financial crisis. But Goldman is not transforming its business, it is just making adjustments, which many expected when the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, announced the review at the company's annual meeting in May. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' The internal review was begun just a month after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Goldman, which claimed the bank omitted crucial facts about its role in developing a subprime mortgage security in which investors lost millions. The bank, which did not admit wrongdoing, settled with the S.E.C. in July and agreed to pay $550 million. But the agreement did not call for an independent monitor to oversee Goldman's business practices. Unprompted by the agency, the firm initiated the review in May. The committee that led the study consisted only of Goldman executives, including E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans, a rising star and possible successor to Mr. Blankfein. As part of the process, the committee conducted hundreds of interviews with staff members. It also hired two consulting firms, which reached out to Goldman clients. Some complained that the investment bank should be more forthcoming about its role in transactions. While much of the feedback from clients was ''flattering,'' Mr. Evans said, the firm was also told there was room for improvement, particularly in the areas of transparency and communication. The report includes 39 recommendations, approved by the board in December. On Monday, Mr. Blankfein briefed Goldman partners, including senior managers, in a closed-door, offsite meeting in Connecticut. ''We believe the recommendations of the committee will strengthen the firm's culture in an increasingly complex environment,'' the report concluded. ''In particular, our approach must be: not just 'can we' undertake a given business activity, but 'should we.' '' The committee in its report tries to address longstanding concerns that Goldman is rife with conflicts of interest. Clients have often complained that they do not know where the firm stands on a deal, whether it is simply as facilitator or an interested party with a stake in the potential profits. In response to such criticisim, the firm plans to articulate its responsibilities in a particular transaction, say as an underwriter, developing an initial public offering; a market maker, assisting in the buying and selling of a specific stock; or as an investor, taking a piece of the action. Such revelations should help Goldman avoid the issues raised by the S.E.C. in its civil fraud case. In its complaint, the agency contended that Goldman, in creating a mortgage investment known as Abacus 2007-AC1, did not disclose that a hedge fund helped pick the underlying securities. ''It is important to articulate clearly both to our people and to clients the specific roles we assume in each case,'' Goldman said in the report. Even so, the recommendations are not likely to affect deals like Goldman's recent move to sell $1.5 billion worth of Facebook shares to its wealthy clients. In its pitch, the firm failed to disclose that a powerful unit within Goldman passed on buying a $450 million stake in the social networking behemoth. The firm later took the investment on its own balance sheet, which it revealed publicly. When the firm announces its fourth-quarter profits next week, Goldman is also aiming to be more transparent about its results and risk management, according to people with knowledge of the changes who could not speak publicly on the matter. The bank, for example, is increasing the segments for which it reports revenue to four units from three, potentially giving investors a deeper look at its operations. Still, some changes are at the margin. As part of the committee's recommendations, the firm will move certain underwriting and origination activities to the investment banking group from the securities division - a move mainly designed to streamline workflow. The report also restates its 14 existing principles. ''Goldman Sachs has one reputation,'' the report said. ''It can be affected by any number of decisions and activities across the firm. Every employee has an equal obligation to raise issues or concerns, no matter how small, to protect the firm's reputation.''

The firm’s nearly $2 billion investment connection with Facebook is relatively small financially, but it’s big in franchise terms. After the lumps Goldman took last year, the deal showed the firm could still wrap its tentacles around an important client for mutual benefit.Goldman could still lose money on the deal for its shareholders, partners and clients. And questions remain as to whether its plan to invest $450 million of its own capital alongside $1.5 billion from others through a single investment entity violates the spirit of Securities Exchange Act disclosure rules. That means there’s still a chance the deal could backfire financially or in the realm of public opinion. But taking calculated risks is what separates Goldman from run-of-the-mill competitors. The Facebook effort also involved stitching its sometimes conflicting strands of business into a fabric that suited a priority customer. That’s a way both to fend off rivals and to mitigate risk in the deal. The Goldman coup surely started with an investment banking relationship with Facebook’s executives and its board, including the early venture capital supporters Peter Thiel and Jim Breyer. Other banks can do that, too, however. So something more was required: capital. Even without the backing of some of its in-house money managers, Goldman found the cash. Its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, carved out a slice of the balance sheet — a bold call given that many bank executives are paralyzed trying to figure out the impact of regulatory changes on proprietary investments. Moreover, Goldman’s Silicon Valley bankers enlisted the private wealth management division to bring in customers as investors. That doesn’t just generate fees, it allows Goldman to boast that it brings clients deals other banks can’t match. The firm’s powerful network of alumni also played a role. Digital Sky Technologies, a Facebook shareholder that’s investing at least $50 million more, counts former partners of the bank among its executives. There are other tentacles poised for the future, too. Goldman will probably take Facebook public eventually, for a juicy fee. And its private bank may make new customers of the social network’s founders and employees when that happens. The likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse should be wondering whether and how they can coordinate their various appendages on such A-list deals so successfully. Balancing Act Commodities markets should like economic growth. Yet despite positive data from Germany and the United States, prices are wobbling. The problem is that oil, food and metals prices have all thrived on a weak dollar, cheap money and inflows into real rather than financial assets. Recovery, a firmer dollar and higher interest rates are giving investors more to think about. There could be a lot of volatility ahead. This week’s lurches come at the end of a superstrong run. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodity index jumped 10 percent in December, taking its annual rise for 2010 to 15 percent. Commodities were ripe for a correction. But their fall may signal more than that. Dollar weakness and central bank money printing helped lift a broad range of commodities, as well as gold, last year. Hedge funds made hay with trades that shorted the dollar and went long on commodities. Steep price gains had a marked speculative element. Now, however, a dollar rally looks on. Yields on Treasuries have risen strongly since October, making dollar assets more appealing. The euro zone periphery crisis is another reason to switch out of the single currency and into the dollar. As the dollar rises, commodities, which are priced in dollars, tend to fall. But the influence of real levels of supply and demand must also be taken into account. Real demand for many commodities should be well supported if global growth is indeed firm. Yet stronger growth, too, has its negative side. Inflation is up in China, India and even the euro zone. Asia has already seen interest rate rises. The liquidity taps that provided investors with cheap money are closing. Stronger growth, but probably a stronger dollar, higher global inflation and interest rates, and perhaps less liquidity: that sums up the countervailing forces in commodity markets in 2011. The tide of money that surged into commodities last year may no longer flow so reliably.

In 1964, regulators started requiring companies with more than 499 shareholders to publicly report their financial results. It is a rule that has been debated from the outset - and the issues raised now are the same ones raised then. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining the frenzied buying and selling of Facebook shares and other private technology companies in the secondary market. To some, the structure of the Goldman deal merely looks like a way to circumvent the law. Through a special purpose vehicle, the firm could potentially pool money from thousands of wealthy clients and still be considered one investor because the entity would be managed by Goldman. Section 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 came about in the 1960s as over-the-counter trading in shares of privately held companies began to heat up and regulators worried that investors were not getting enough information. A special study from that period found that the ''disclosures voluntarily made by unlisted companies left a great deal to be desired,'' according to a speech by the S.E.C. commissioner at the time, Hugh F. Owens, given before the Practicing Law Institute in New York in 1964. ''Not only did the volume of information delivered to shareholders vary considerably, but the candor with which it was presented was highly variable,'' he said in the speech. ''They involve thousands of corporations and hundreds of thousands of investors. The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 effectively remove the distinction, which has existed as to a large number of the companies whose securities are traded over-the-counter.'' That is the same sort of issue facing regulators now, with shares in Facebook trading at a frenetic pace on the secondary market. The announcement that Goldman will use a special purpose vehicle to raise and invest $1.5 billion in the company - money collected from a variety of wealthy individuals - has only intensified the scrutiny. In practice, a large fund that represents hundreds or thousands of individuals can be considered a single record holder. ''So long as Goldman is the sole decision maker for all investors it's irrelevant,'' said Eleazer Klein, a partner at the law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel. Even so, questions remain about whether such a deal may stray from the spirit of the law while adhering to its letter. ''Whether something is done primarily to circumvent the rules is a philosophical question,'' Mr. Klein said. ''There is a natural tension between being allowed to structure something in a manner that complies with the law and at the same point circumvents the law.'' How did the government come up with the 500-shareholder limit, a threshold that over the years has been called both too high and too low? The government did not want to subject small companies with limited shareholders to the costs of regulation and compliance. At the same time, regulators did not want to allow large companies with a multitude of investors to reap the benefits of public financing without disclosure and registration. Ultimately, lawyers say the number was picked arbitrarily. Scientific or not, it all comes back to investor protection. One issue today is whether wealthy investors - like those who will participate in the Goldman deal - need the same protection as smaller investors. There are plenty of examples where the government has determined that they do not, as with hedge funds and private equity investments. ''We've lowered the bar for certain types of investors that we felt need less protection,'' said Christian Leuz, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''But maybe what we've learned in recent years after the financial crisis is that sophisticated doesn't always mean high net worth.'' Although the 500-investor threshold has long been the subject of debate, start-ups like Google raised it to a new level in the last decade. Many private technology companies reward and attract talent by offering stock options or shares in the company. Those employee-owned shares typically do not count toward the 500-investor limit. But once those shares are sold on a private exchange - often after employees leave the company - they are no longer exempt. Venture capital firms, too, divest shares in the secondary market. The development of this changing dynamic has only complicated the numbers game. ''Prior to that, it was pretty easy to maintain less than 500 shareholders,'' said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTOS: Hugh F.

Goldman Sachs Capital Partners - a group that manages and invests for pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other prominent clients - was given the initial opportunity to invest $450 million in Facebook, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Goldman gives the ''first look'' on many investment opportunities to the $20.3 billion fund. While most of the group's clients are big institutions, the investors also include current and former Goldman partners. But the unit's head, Richard A. Friedman, a longtime Goldman partner, decided the Facebook deal was not suitable for his clients, in part owing to the high valuation and to a mismatch with his investment criteria. The $450 million investment values the Web company at $50 billion. After Goldman's deal, some industry experts cautioned that Facebook's growth would need to accelerate rapidly over the next couple of years to justify such a steep price - a risk with many brand-name technology upstarts. Last year, Facebook recorded revenue of approximately $2 billion, with roughly $400 million in profit, according to people briefed on the company's results. That is up from $220 million in earnings on $770 million in sales in 2009. After Mr. Friedman passed, the Wall Street bank itself made the $450 million Facebook investment, taking the deal on its balance sheet. (About $75 million of that amount is coming from an internal hedge fund, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according to a person who reviewed the offering memorandum sent to investors.) The firm is trying to sell $1.5 billion more of shares in the company to wealthy clients - a deal that is expected to be oversubscribed when it closes this week, as early as Thursday, these people said. All Goldman partners will also be able to invest in this fund. Goldman, knowing the deal had the potential to draw regulatory attention, briefed the Securities and Exchange Commission before making the offer to wealthy individuals, according to people with knowledge of the conversation who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The agency is currently looking at trading in private technology companies like Facebook. The S.E.C. declined to comment. The decision by Mr. Friedman, who holds a seat on the firm's vaunted management committee, has raised concerns among some of Goldman's most sophisticated clients who have been pitched on Facebook in recent days. Several wealthy individuals approached about the offering said they had declined, in part, because of Mr. Friedman's rejection. The clients spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear that making a public comment would hurt their relationship with Goldman and their opportunity to have access to future investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Friedman did not return a call. People briefed on Mr. Friedman's decision said he was concerned about Facebook's $50 billion valuation and the terms of the deal. Goldman Sachs Capital Partners frequently likes to take large positions in companies with expectations of holding them for several years or even longer. A $450 million investment in Facebook would have represented less than 1 percent of the firm. One person briefed on the discussions with Mr. Friedman, however, said he would have ''thrown out'' his typical investment philosophy if he had believed a Facebook investment was an ''easy home run.'' Goldman's critics have long complained that the firm puts its own interests ahead of clients. In the Facebook deal, Goldman is investing $450 million, at an implied $50 billion valuation. However, Goldman clients are paying a 4 percent placement fee and a 0.5 percent expense reserve fee for their shares, as well as giving up 5 percent of gains. That means Facebook would need to be worth closer to $60 billion before they make any money. Beside those fees, Goldman is likely to earn additional money from ancillary business - with the biggest victory coming from an eventual initial public offering, perhaps as soon as 2012.</text></article>

On first blush, the answer would appear to be no. After all, in May 2009, the company was valued at $10 billion. Last August, Facebook was valued at $27 billion and now it's $50 billion - for a company with a reported $2 billion in revenue and negligible profits. If General Electric, with 2010 revenue of around $150 billion, traded at a similar multiple of revenue, it would be worth $3.75 trillion instead of $200 billion. Facebook is now considered to be worth more than Time Warner, DuPont and Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. Just last week, Facebook's shares were said to be trading on a private-market exchange at a valuation of $42.4 billion. Thanks to Goldman's imprimatur, Facebook's value increased 20 percent virtually overnight. Can Goldman really expect to squeeze more water from this stone? Sadly, yes. To understand why, we have to go to the heart of the many problems in the way the Wall Street cartel does business, despite the promised reforms of the Dodd-Frank law. With Goldman's investment in Facebook, we have a front-row seat to the process by which Wall Street creates and inflates financial bubbles. This bout of hysteria involves not only Facebook but other Internet companies including Twitter, the gaming site Zynga, the social buying site Groupon and LinkedIn, another social networking site. The valuation of these companies has soared in the past two years, leading some to worry that the American people bailed out Wall Street so that we could relive the Internet Bubble of 1999. Despite the high price of its investment, Goldman sees in Facebook a business bonanza, a nearly perfect nugget of investment-banking opportunities. First, Goldman's cost of capital is close to zero - as a bank holding company, it can borrow from the Federal Reserve at negligible interest rates - so any capital gain it makes on its venture in Facebook will be sheer profit. Second, Goldman has almost certainly locked up the role of lead manager of the inevitable Facebook initial public offering. Fees for underwriting public offerings are generally about 7 percent of the value of the stock sold. Facebook could easily sell $2 billion of stock or more, generating fees to Goldman and the other underwriters of at least $140 million. The other benefit for Goldman in leading the public offering - aside from major bragging rights - is that it can use its marketing, sales and distribution muscle to make sure the value of Facebook at the time of the offering exceeds the $50 billion valuation at which Goldman invested. Goldman has also won from Facebook the right to offer an additional $1.5 billion of the company's stock to its private-wealth clients. According to The Times, Goldman will be creating a ''special purpose vehicle'' to sell the stock to its wealthy clients and then will charge them a 4 percent initial fee plus 5 percent of any profits. While on paper it seems that these high rollers would be foolish to invest in Facebook at such a lofty valuation, they will still most certainly feel increased loyalty to Goldman for making such an exclusive opportunity available to them. On top of it all, there is the increased likelihood that Goldman will get to manage a good portion of the $12 billion fortune belonging to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, for yet more fees. If Goldman does take all these roles at once - investor, salesman, money manager, I.P.O. underwriter - it would certainly raise the ugly specter of conflicts of interest. But probably not to Goldman executives, who have always prided themselves on being able to ''manage'' through such situations. (In fairness, there's likely no investment-banking firm on the planet that would not eagerly take Goldman's place in this scheme, if offered the chance.) Even though Facebook is reported to have little need for Goldman's money, having Goldman validate Facebook's exponential increase in value gives Mr. Zuckerberg the ultimate Silicon Valley street cred, far more than he got from having Hollywood make a movie about him or from becoming the youngest billionaire on the planet. With all these winners, who will the losers be? The average investor, of course, who will get left holding the bag when, someday, Wall Street realizes the firm's financial performance doesn't live up to its hyped valuation.

No more. With its $500 million infusion from Goldman Sachs and other investors, Facebook is now flush with cash, and a market value of about $50 billion, giving it the financial muscle it needs to compete with better-heeled rivals like Google. And Facebook hopes for an even bigger advantage from the deal, the ability to delay an initial public offering. That would allow it to remain free of government regulation and from the volatility of Wall Street. It would also allow Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, to retain near absolute control over the company he co-founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004. This strategy was unthinkable in Silicon Valley just a few years ago, when hundreds of start-ups with scant revenue and no profits, like Pets.com and Webvan, raced to go public, and investors eagerly lined up to buy their shares. Lots of people would stand in line to buy shares in Facebook, but for now, only an exclusive few - wealthy clients of Goldman Sachs - will be able to. On Monday, Goldman e-mailed certain clients, offering them the chance to invest in the company. That offer is the latest sign of the emergence of active markets in the shares of closely held companies. Those markets are helping successful start-ups like Facebook develop the financial wherewithal to compete in the big leagues of business. They have also become an avenue for venture capitalists and start-up employees to cash in their stock, turning many overworked engineers into instant millionaires. And so a young mogul like Mr. Zuckerberg, the world's youngest billionaire at age 26, can enjoy many of the benefits of going public without having to tie the knot with Wall Street. Other hot technology companies like Twitter, Zynga and Groupon are also tapping secondary markets to keep stock market investors at bay. They are in no rush to go public and no longer need the bragging rights that a stock offering used to bestow. ''This is a topsy-turvy world,'' said Scott Dettmer, a founding partner of Gunderson Dettmer, a law firm that has advised venture capitalists, start-ups and entrepreneurs since the 1980s. He added that even a few years ago, ''there were all sorts of business reasons to go public, but for entrepreneurs it was also a badge of honor.'' Perhaps more than any company founder, Mr. Zuckerberg, who declined to comment for this article, has frequently expressed his disinterest in Wall Street, though Facebook is clearly not above taking its cash. He passed on opportunities to make a killing, for example, when, at age 22, he rejected billion-dollar offers for Facebook. ''Mark would absolutely prefer not have an I.P.O. until he absolutely has to,'' said David Kirkpatrick, the author of ''The Facebook Effect.'' ''He absolutely doesn't want to sacrifice control because he believes that his vision is necessary to keep powering the company forward.'' Mr. Zuckerberg's quest to keep Facebook private, though, will not last forever. Federal regulations require companies with 500 or more investors to disclose their financial results, eliminating one of the principal advantages of staying private. The Goldman Sachs investment, for a stake of less than 1 percent in the company, is formulated in part to skirt those rules. But it may help for only a limited amount of time. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating private company trades in secondary markets, and regulators may decide that what is good for Facebook is not necessarily good for the investing public. Still, the huge cash infusion is a coup both for Mr. Zuckerberg, who is said to own about a quarter of the company, and Facebook. The deal gives the company cash to hire employees or build data centers. It also puts Facebook, which makes most of its money through advertising, on a path to surpass Google, by some measures, as the most successful Internet company to come out of Silicon Valley. Facebook is on track to bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue this year.</text></article>

Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, had a rough 2010. But at least he got a raise: his bonus increased by $3.6 million, according to a regulatory filing. The firm's board granted restricted stock valued at $12.6 million to Mr. Blankfein and other senior executives, including Gary D. Cohn, the firm's president. The board also approved a new annual base salary of $2 million for its chief executive, up from $600,000. Mr. Cohn and others will see their base salaries increase to $1.85 million, according to the filing on Friday. With his previous salary of $600,000, Mr. Blankfein's 2010 compensation comes to $13.2 million. Senior executives often receive part of their compensation in cash, but Goldman did not release details on this component of Mr. Blankfein's compensation. In 2009, amid a widespread public outcry over sky-high pay on Wall Street, Mr. Blankfein and other senior Goldman executives received compensation packages valued at $9 million each. In 2007, the year before the financial crisis, Mr. Blankfein made $68.5 million. The lowered bonuses in 2009 were not the only compensation change to come out of the financial crisis. Most financial firms also increased the base salaries of employees, a move regulators hoped would cut down on excessive risk-taking. While Mr. Blankfein's base was only recently increased, Goldman had earlier raised base salaries for other employees. The base pay for Goldman managing directors was recently increased to $500,000, from $300,000. Still, not everyone at Goldman got a raise in 2010. Last year the firm set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it earmarked for compensation in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Goldman had a challenging 2010. Its stock performance was relatively flat, and it reported earnings of $8.35 billion, down 37 percent from 2009. But the firm did better than many of its rivals, which were still rebuilding from the financial crisis. Goldman's reputation, nonetheless, took a severe blow last April, when the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against the firm, saying that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities that were secretly designed by a hedge fund firm to cash in on the housing market's collapse. The day the charges were announced, Mr. Blankfein has said, was ''one of the worst days in my professional life.'' The firm paid $550 million to settle the charges. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Mr. Blankfein isn't the only Wall Street chief to get a raise for his work in 2010. JPMorgan Chase has not yet announced the pay of its chief executive, but Jamie Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009. This month, Morgan Stanley's board awarded its chief executive, James Gorman, stock and options valued at $7.4 million. But this represented only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Mr. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009, when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning $1 a year while he tried put the bank back on track, was recently awarded a $1.75 million salary. At Goldman, David A. Viniar, the firm's chief financial officer, and the vice chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg also received stock valued at $12.6 million, regulatory filings show. Their base salaries also rose to $1.85 million. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd C.

Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, after nearly two years of earning a mere $1 in salary while he tried put the bank back on track, has been awarded a $1.75 million salary, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The lifting of Mr. Pandit's symbolic hair shirt came as Morgan Stanley disclosed much, though not all, of the compensation for its leader. James P. Gorman, in his first year as chief executive of Morgan Stanley, will earn less than the $15 million he took home in 2009 when he was the firm's co-president, according to a person familiar with his compensation but not authorized to speak publicly about it. Other Wall Street banks - including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America - are still to report what their leaders will be paid. JPMorgan Chase disclosed compensation for some of its senior mangers, but has not yet approved the pay package for its chief executive and chairman, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon is expected to earn as much, if not more, than the $17.5 million he took home in 2009, which made him among the highest-paid Wall Street executives. No decision has been made. But JPMorgan had a banner 2010 - it was the most profitable year in the company's history - and four of Mr. Dimon's top lieutenants have already been awarded stock worth more than $10 million each. Two years since emerging from the financial crisis, Wall Street profits - and big paychecks - appear to be back. But the public uproar that erupted over outsize bonuses that banks awarded, even after accepting a government bailouts, has not yet been tamed. Banks are still trying to balance the need to attract star executives and traders with regulators' demands to ensure that their pay programs do not create excessive risk. Gone is some of the sensitivity to lawmakers and the broader public, who were angry at seeing such lavish paydays as they were losing their homes and jobs. As bonus checks were doled out at several big banks earlier this week, it is clear that 2010 is shaping up to be a very good year - although perhaps not as good as a year earlier. Alan Johnson, a longtime Wall Street compensation consultant, said that he expected pay to fall about 10 to 15 percent for 2010, and perhaps more than twice that amount in many trading businesses where the results were much weaker. Amid greater scrutiny from the public and federal regulators since the financial crisis, the banks have awarded a greater portion of compensation in the form of stock - some even higher than 50 percent - and emphasized the use of deferred pay and policies to claw back ill-gotten bonuses. Over all, what is remarkable is the wide variation in pay packages among the banking giants. At the industry's strongest banks, employee compensation, on average, fell markedly from a year ago. At Goldman Sachs, workers earned, on average, about $398,000 in 2010, down 11 percent from a year ago. At JPMorgan's investment bank, employee pay was, on average, about $370,000 - about 2.4 percent lower than in 2009 and in line with the overall firm's decline in compensation. Wall Street's star bankers and traders, regardless of where they work, will still reap paychecks worth millions of dollars. Meanwhile, several of the weaker players ratcheted their compensation packages upward. At Morgan Stanley, for example, workers' paychecks rose about 8 percent, on average, to about $257,000. Citigroup and Bank of America, whose average paychecks are substantially lower because they employ tens of thousands consumer bankers who draw smaller salaries and bonuses, reported increases of about 3 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Some pay analysts suspect that this divergence may stem, at least in part, from the need of these more troubled firms to offer bigger paydays to attract and retain top talent. Those occupying offices in the corporate suite continued to score big paydays. Citigroup's board had signaled a pay increase for Mr. Pandit last fall when they granted stock awards to several of his top lieutenants and announced that they planned to restore his compensation so that it would be in line with other Wall Street chiefs. Mr. Pandit had vowed at a Congressional hearing in February 2009 that he would accept only $1 until the bank returned to profitability. On Tuesday, Citigroup posted an annual profit in 2010, the first time it had done so since the financial crisis struck. Richard D. Parsons, Citigroup's chairman, said that the board was ''very pleased with the progress the company has made under Vikram's leadership'' and that he merited the raise for the coming year. Citigroup's board could also choose to award him additional stock and options when it reviews his 2011 compensation later this year. Of course, Mr. Pandit still holds about $79.7 million in cash from the sale of his investment fund, Old Lane Partners, to Citigroup in April 2007. At JPMorgan Chase, Jes Staley, the head of its investment bank, was awarded more than $14.5 million in stock and options, according to Equilar, a compensation research firm. His total compensation may be even higher when his salary and bonus are disclosed. Ina R. Drew, the bank's chief investment officer, and Mary Callahan Erdoes, the head of its asset management division, each received stock and options worth more than $11 million. That poises them to be among the highest-paid women on Wall Street. On Friday, Morgan Stanley's board awarded Mr. Gorman stock and options valued at $7.4 million, according to Equilar. But this represents only the equity portion of Mr. Gorman's pay package; the cash component will be announced later this year. Morgan Stanley also released details of more than $32 million in stock awards for 10 other top executives. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The decision to hire Goldman Sachs came after several suitors, including the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, approached Warner Music's management in recent months about buying the company, according to an executive briefed on the matter who spoke only anonymously. Instead of negotiating solely with K.K.R., the company's management decided to begin a formal sale process by hiring Goldman, which has recently begun making pitches to financial investors and media companies about buying Warner. One possible outcome of the auction is for Warner to sell not the entire company but only Warner/Chappell, its prized publishing arm, said a person with direct knowledge of the process. Meanwhile, a separate set of bankers within Goldman has been working on a potential acquisition of EMI by Warner. Goldman has reached out to Citigroup, which owns a large amount of EMI's debt and could soon control the company if it fails to meet its payments, according to executives involved in the process, who would speak of the confidential negotiations only anonymously. The unusual two-track process of Warner seeking to buy while also exploring selling out to new investors underscores the desire of Warner's private equity owners to either make a big strategic move and double down on the music business by buying EMI, or cash out. They acquired the company from Time Warner more than seven years ago - a long time frame for private equity investors, who normally prefer to own a company for three to five years before selling. Late last year, Citigroup won a lawsuit against EMI's private equity owners, Terra Firma, which had filed a suit that said Citigroup had defrauded Terra Firma during the auction of EMI in August of 2007. That deal, for $6.8 billion, came at the height of the credit boom - and just before credit markets began to freeze - and has been an ill-fated move for Terra Firma and its founder, Guy Hands. K.K.R's interest in Warner is related to expanding a joint venture it owns with Bertelsmann to license music rights. K.K.R. had been in talks with Warner Music about engineering a joint bid for EMI, but those discussions then turned toward K.K.R. buying Warner outright, according to one of the executives involved in the process. Warner Music, whose artist roster includes Kid Rock, Green Day and Bruno Mars, is the only pure music company that is publicly traded. Others, such as Universal Music and Sony Music, are part of much larger conglomerates. A group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr., a group that also included Bain Capital, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Providence Equity Partners, bought Warner Music from Time Warner in March of 2004 for $2.6 billion in cash. The company went public in 2005, and although the investors still control the company - only a small percentage of Warner's stock is in public hands - the investors have already profited through hefty dividend payouts. A Warner Music spokesman and a Goldman spokesman declined comment. In a letter to shareholders sent last week, Mr. Bronfman wrote, ''clearly many obstacles lie ahead, but our confidence in the company's future prospects is based on our consistent track record and our proven ability to outperform the rest of the industry.'' Indeed, as the overall music industry has shrunk remarkably over the last few years, Warner has shrunk less - and has actually improved its profit margins through cost-cutting. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which measures music sales globally, sales of music declined nearly 23 percent between 2005 and 2009. Over that time, Warner's revenue declined much less - around 9 percent. With the rise of the file-sharing Web site Napster in the late 1990s, the music industry was the first slice of the media business to see its economics disrupted by the digital age, and by the time Mr. Bronfman and his group bought Warner, that trend was clear. The decline of newspapers followed the diminishment of the music industry, and more recently the economics of television and film have also come under pressure from the Internet. But unlike, say, newspapers and magazines, the music industry has embraced a durable model to get paid for selling music online through services such as Apple's iTunes Store - even if revenue has declined and piracy remains rampant.

But lately it seems the lackluster economy has gotten the better of the firm. The Wall Street bank, which reported a 53 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, experienced a noticeable slowdown in most of its important divisions, citing increased competition and depressed client activity amid economic uncertainty. David A. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, described the environment as ''dead'' and ''challenging''- reminiscent of the firm's comments in the previous period. But economic factors are not just to blame, analysts say. Goldman may be facing fundamental and long-lasting issues with its business model. Clients are shying away from the high-margin products that ran into trouble during the financial crisis, and coming regulation will only crimp profits further. JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which reported earnings in the last week, noted similar problems in certain divisions. In a nod to just how difficult the environment has become, Goldman's return on equity, a measure of profitability, fell to 11.5 percent in 2010, down from 22.5 percent in the previous year and 32.8 percent in 2006. ''I think for the time being this is the new reality,' said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital. ''It is not doom and gloom out there in economy. What is missing are things like the structured products and derivatives that were helping their earnings.'' Shares of Goldman fell $8.19, or 4.7 percent, to $166.49 on Wednesday. Of course, Goldman is hardly on the ropes. Despite the weakness, the firm still posted a healthy quarterly profit of $2.39 billion, distilled on revenue of $8.64 billion. For the year, revenue fell 13 percent, to about $39 billion. Annual earnings were $8.35 billion, 38 percent lower than in 2009. But the underwhelming results are a stark reminder of the challenging markets and weak economy. Clients of Goldman, big-name companies that pay it to organize mergers, bond offerings and more, have been sitting on the sidelines. Profitable areas like mortgage-backed securities have shrunk sharply. And competition has increased from companies like Morgan Stanley, which has regained some of its former strength. The firm is also still beholden to Warren E. Buffett. For months, Goldman has wanted to pay back a $5 billion investment from Mr. Buffett made at the height of the financial crisis. But the firm first needs the government's approval. Mr. Viniar declined to comment on the stake, saying only that ''Goldman is exploring all its options.'' At Goldman, almost every business is feeling the pain. Revenue in its powerful fixed-income, currency and commodities unit fell 48 percent, to $1.64 billion, from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue, which includes equity and debt underwriting, fell 10 percent, to $1.64 billion. The division, which often accounts for a third of Goldman's total sales, made up just 18.9 percent in the fourth quarter. Investment management was one of the few bright spots in the quarter, as revenue rose 14 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion. Compensation did not decrease as much as profit. In 2010, Goldman set aside $15.38 billion for pay, down 5 percent from the $16.19 billion it set aside in 2009. The ratio of compensation to revenue was 39 percent. That is up from a record low of 35.8 percent in 2009, when the firm came under intense scrutiny for handing out big bonuses after accepting government aid. The current compensation pool amounts to pay of more than $430,000 a person. Despite weaker-than-usual results, Mr. Viniar was optimistic about Goldman's fortunes, pointing to improvements in the unemployment rate and other economic indicators. The firm plans to add employees in the coming months, mostly overseas. Last year, Goldman increased its employee base by 10 percent, to 35,700 employees. ''I would feel worse if the economic data was really bad,'' he said. ''And it's not.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. The New Year is a time for reflection, so it was heartening to see Goldman Sachs come out with 63 pages of resolutions. The investment bank published its ''Report of the Business Standards Committee'' last week, a document in which it reiterated its principles and announced the formation of many new committees. Goldman will be an open book, the firm pledged, disclosing more clearly how much business the firm does for itself (not as much as all those detractors think) and how much it works for its clients (every waking moment). Goldman suffered a brutal year, paying a $550 million fine to settle federal claims of civil securities fraud and being vilified at a Senate hearing. Even the $15.38 billion the firm has set aside for compensation in 2010 wasn't enough to salve the pain. Goldman would like our love, too. And so the powerful investment bank has embarked on a journey of self-improvement, a great American ritual from Ben Franklin to Elizabeth Gilbert. Goldman's report should have been titled ''Eat, Pay, Trade.'' In a video that accompanies the report, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chairman and chief executive, said the firm conducted a ''thorough self-assessment,'' followed by a ''recommitment to core values and principles.'' It's language that ''reads straight out of a Tony Robbins retreat manual, not your usual business document,'' said Christine B. Whelan, a University of Pittsburgh sociologist who has studied the self-help industry. Of course, releasing the report is a public relations stunt. Some of it was welcome, like the increased financial disclosure. Some may fall by the wayside, like most New Year's resolutions. Some seems as disingenuous as any piece of professional flackery. Goldman's effort fits neatly into what the historian (and former New York councilwoman) Eva S. Moskowitz has called the therapeutic gospel, a doctrine so ingrained in American society that few of us consciously recognize it. The gospel consists of three tenets: happiness is the supreme goal, problems stem from psychological causes, and those psychological problems are treatable. The therapeutic gospel is all about me and my problems. Goldman thinks its problems stem, if not from psychological issues, then from attitudinal ones. Significant management and operational changes are starkly missing from Goldman's leaf-turning exercise. Instead, Goldman has decided that its troubles emanate from not having treated clients nicely. Or, more likely, Goldman thinks its problem is that the world thinks Goldman didn't treat its clients nicely. But that wasn't the problem with Goldman Sachs in the fall of 2008. Creating collateralized debt obligations and betting against their clients was unseemly, but it wasn't the cause of the global financial crisis. Goldman's leverage - and the leverage at other major financial institutions - was the real issue. Goldman's business model was broken because it made a classic banking mistake: it lent long and borrowed short. All banks are susceptible to runs. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers had theirs, deservedly. By the fall of 2008, it was Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs's turn. Goldman took taxpayer dollars and was granted access to cheap Federal Reserve money. Goldman insists that it would have survived the crisis anyway. We'll never know whether it would have, because the fact is that Goldman received assistance. Goldman, like all the other major investment and commercial banks, had become too big and intertwined, making the financial system too fragile. In other words, the flaws in the financial system were structural, more like the problem of poverty, and not based on character. As such, they require solutions beyond pledges of better behavior. Unfortunately, despite a hulking financial reform law, the American financial system still has largely the same structural issues that it had before the crisis. Neither Goldman nor the government shows any inclination to face these issues. What about investors? The covenant that equity investors have struck with investment banks goes something like this: Deliver high returns and we will allow employees to take about half of the revenue for themselves as compensation. It was always a bad bargain, made worse by the financial crisis. Lehman investors were wiped out. Bear Stearns investors took huge hits. (Whether investors have learned from that experience, or whether they have learned to expect bailouts, is debatable.) Despite Goldman's reputation in some corners as Evil Genius, its shares are actually suffering in the marketplace because investors worry about its volatile and unpredictable results from quarter to quarter. These concerns were validated when Goldman reported on Wednesday that trading and securities services profit took a big hit in the fourth quarter, dropping 31 percent. The stock slid 3 percent by midafternoon in response. Investors prefer annuities to swing-for-the-fences profits. Compared with pure asset managers and investment banks that specialize in either advisory work or making markets, Goldman stock trades at a discount these days. Goldman's price-to-earnings ratio stands at less than 10, while Lazard (a pure advisory firm), Jefferies (a market maker) and BlackRock (an asset manager) trade at significantly higher multiples. Investors often prefer to look at a price-to-book ratio to value financial firms; even on that measure, Goldman is far below its peak valuation. Could there be an argument that Goldman should break up into three smaller, more focused companies? It would be better for the financial system, and just might lead to the self-improvement that Goldman is searching for.

GROWS BankUnited on Tuesday ramped up its plans for an initial public offering, saying it could raise $630 million -- more than double what the bank expected when it first filed for an I.P.O. last year. The offering would cap a quick turnaround for BankUnited and a nice win for the private equity investors who own the bank, including Wilbur Ross and John Kanas, the former head of North Fork Bank. The bank plans to sell four million shares of its common stock, while its investors will sell more than 22 million shares. The bank expects to price each share at $23 to $25.

They are now poised to reap a windfall that was sown in the dark days of the financial crisis in 2008. Nearly 36 million stock options were granted to employees in December 2008 - 10 times the amount issued the previous year - when the stock was trading at $78.78. Since those uncertain days, Goldman's business has roared back and its share price has more than doubled, closing on Tuesday at nearly $175. The options grant is among the many details that emerge from a study of regulatory filings and internal partnership documents by The New York Times and Footnoted.com, a division of Morningstar that scrutinizes corporate disclosures. These filings provide a much fuller picture of both Goldman's compensation and its elite partnership of 475 people who run the firm. At the center of Goldman's lucrative compensation program is the partnership. Unlike other Wall Street firms, Goldman retained a partnership system when it became a publicly traded company in 1999. Goldman's partners are its highest executives and its biggest stars. Yet while Goldman is required to report compensation for its top officers, it releases very little information about this broader group, remaining tightlipped about even basic information like who is currently a partner. The documents illustrate just how much wealth the partnership owns and has cashed out over the years. Goldman has almost 860 current and former partners, the documents show. In the last 12 years, they have cashed out more than $20 billion in Goldman shares and currently hold more than $10 billion in Goldman stock. All Wall Street firms dole out stock to reward their employees. But the reporting of who gets what and who sells is limited to the firm's top officers. The Goldman filings provide a window into how broad and how lucrative stock-based compensation can be. The 2008 stock option grant came at a time when the firm's financial performance took a hit and its top executives were not paid bonuses. The grant, much of it awarded to partners, gave options that could be exercised in one-third installments in January 2010, January 2011 and January 2012. The shares cannot be sold or transferred until January 2014. The award has already helped increase the partners' stake in Goldman to 11.2 percent, from 8.7 percent. And as additional options vest, the partners' control of the firm will most likely increase. Goldman declined to comment. In addition to the cumulative stock sales and stock ownership, the filings show an inner circle that is chiefly male - 87 percent of the current partners are men - and shed light on how much each partner has cashed out over the years. The analysis, which examined nearly 5,000 pages of regulatory filings, was a joint effort by The Times and the Footnoted.com senior reporter Theo Francis. With Goldman set to report earnings on Wednesday, the newest class of inductees will get their first glimpse into the privileges of partnership, as the firm begins to notify its more than 35,000 employees about their year-end bonuses. Goldman is on track to pay out $17.5 billion in compensation for last year. While that is down from the record $20.19 billion in 2007, it's up more than a billion from 2009. The documents also show what shares partners sold before they became officers and were required to make disclosures. Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, for example, has cashed in a total of $93.8 million in shares since 1999, a number that captures both known stock sales since he became an officer at Goldman, and sales not individually reported since before he was required to disclose such transactions. In the eight years since becoming a senior executive in 2002, Mr. Blankfein has sold $42.5 million, roughly 45 percent of the total over the years. As of August, Mr. Blankfein and his family owned 2.03 million shares worth about $355 million if they had been cashed out on Jan. 14.</text></article>

The four banks that landed the coveted roles are Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, these people said. Selecting the four underwriters of the planned stock sale - which could exceed the size of General Motors' $23.1 billion initial public offering in November - is the next major step in the government's effort to reduce its holdings in A.I.G. The Treasury Department owns about 92.1 percent of the insurer after finishing a complex recapitalization plan on Friday that paid off A.I.G.'s debts to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Representatives of A.I.G., Treasury and the banks declined to comment. A.I.G. and Treasury officials picked the underwriters over the weekend. Last Thursday, they heard about 10 proposals from top representatives of major banks, people briefed on the matter previously said. In sessions of about 45 minutes, the bankers answered questions about the size, timing and other technical aspects of the offering, these people said. Among those making proposals at last week's meetings were Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan, and Gary D. Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, these people said. The size of A.I.G.'s offering will depend on market conditions and investors' appetite for the huge number of shares, the people briefed on Tuesday cautioned. These people were granted anonymity to talk freely about confidential details of the offering. The Treasury has expressed a desire to hold two stock sales this year, perhaps lowering its stake to 33 percent. The first stock sale, which would probably be held in mid-May, would include both shares owned by the government and newly issued A.I.G. stock. The investment banks are not expected to collect a large fee on the offering, at least compared with other stock sales. The government is expected to pay no more than 0.5 percent of the total deal, far below the normal rate, according to one of the people with knowledge of deal. But the sheer size of the transaction is still likely to yield a big payout. One notable investment bank among the chosen underwriters is Goldman, which has had a rocky history with A.I.G. The bank's demands for collateral on the complex credit-default swap deals it struck with the insurer in 2008 helped weaken A.I.G.'s financial position. For that reason, some bankers and analysts had speculated that the bank might not be a top contender for a leading role in the stock sale. A surprising exclusion is Morgan Stanley, which has had a close relationship with the government throughout the financial crisis. The firm served as an adviser to the Fed on A.I.G. matters over the past few years. Along with JPMorgan, it also was a lead underwriter for the G.M. public offering. Shares in A.I.G. closed on Tuesday at $53.17, down about 1.5 percent. The company's stock price is expected to fall over the next several days as warrants are distributed to nongovernment shareholders.

The decision is a considered a serious embarrassment for Goldman, which had marketed the investment to its wealthiest clients, including corporate magnates and directors of the nation's largest companies. The offering was supposed to have been a triumph for the firm, which is trying to move past run-ins with regulators, including a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission last summer over a complex mortgage investment. But the Facebook plan is now likely to raise new questions about whether Goldman tried to push regulatory boundaries once again. Goldman made its decision after the investment plan drew scrutiny. The S.E.C. had opened an inquiry into the structure of the offering and whether it violated the law because of widespread news coverage. Federal and state regulations prohibit what is known as ''general solicitation and advertising'' in private offerings. Firms like Goldman seeking to raise money cannot take action that resembles public promotion of the offering, like buying ads or communicating with news outlets. In a statement on Monday, the firm said: ''In light of this intense media coverage, Goldman Sachs has decided to proceed only with the offer to investors outside the U.S. Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S. private placement under U.S. law.'' A report by The New York Times, published late on Jan. 2, that Goldman had invested $450 million in Facebook and would create a special-purpose investment vehicle for clients, citing people involved in the deal, appeared to prompt the regulatory scrutiny. ''The transaction generated intense media attention following the publication of an article on the evening of January 2, 2011, shortly after the launch of the transaction,'' the firm said in its statement Monday. Goldman had not been planning to initiate the offering that night, but it sped up the process after The Times called the firm seeking comment, according to an executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. That night, a Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Late that night, before the report was published, executives in Goldman's private wealth-management unit e-mailed their clients about the offering, people who received the e-mail said. Goldman added in its statement on Monday that the decision was made on its own and ''was not required or requested by any other party.'' Foreign investors will still be able to participate in the Goldman offering because they are not subject to the S.E.C. rules on solicitation in private offerings. However, all partners of Goldman, whether based in the United States or abroad, will not be allowed to invest, according to people briefed on the matter. It is unclear how much money Goldman will raise for Facebook. In a private memorandum to clients when it made the offering, it said it planned to raise as much as $1.5 billion. The minimum investment is $2 million. The overall deal pegged Facebook's value at $50 billion. While the offering was oversubscribed - perhaps by as much as three times - with American clients now ineligible to participate, it is not clear whether Goldman or Facebook will lower the size of the offering. A majority of Goldman's high-net-worth clients are based in the United States, and these investors may be upset over being denied a potentially lucrative opportunity afforded to investors in Europe and Asia. For Goldman executives who manage money for wealthy families, so-called special investments have long been a major selling point in luring clients to the firm. The argument to prospective clients is that by placing their money with Goldman, they have access to the same investment opportunities as the firm, long considered one of the world's smartest investors.</text></article>

It's not on the credit-default swaps of A.I.G. or any other investment, however. The Wall Street firm is bringing its favorite barber in-house. Salvatore Anzalone has been trimming the tresses of Goldman employees for nearly two decades, including those of the last two Goldman chief executives - Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the current head of the bank. He first attracted a Goldman following at Salvatore's Barber Shop, in the basement of the building in Lower Manhattan that until recently housed the firm's huge trading floor. Last year, Goldman's employees moved out of its offices into new state-of-the-art headquarters in Battery Park City, a little more than a mile away from its old home. Mr. Anzalone followed his loyal clients, opening a location in July in a Goldman-owned hotel adjacent to the firm. But the hotel, an Embassy Suites, closed last week for renovations, forcing Mr. Anzalone to shutter his shop. Faced with the prospect of going without Mr. Anzalone's old-school haircuts, which include straight-razor neck shaves and witch hazel-dabbed towels, Goldman came to Mr. Anzalone with an offer: he could save his shop by moving it into Goldman's headquarters until the hotel makeover was completed. So next week, he is moving to a new outpost inside the Goldman building. The firm is setting up a small barber shop on the mezzanine level, with two chairs. Mr. Anzalone is not the first haircutter to become close to a financial heavyweight. Warren E. Buffett's relationship with his barber, Stan Docekal, has led Buffett devotees to visit Mr. Docekal's shop in Omaha in search of investment tips. John J. Mack, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, was said to be so attached to his longtime barber, Salvatore Macri, that when Mr. Mack left Morgan Stanley in 2001 to run Credit Suisse, he began shuttling Mr. Macri downtown to his new offices for discreet trims. On Thursday, Mr. Anzalone, a native Sicilian with a high-pitched laugh and a habit of gesticulating with his free hand, was trimming sideburns in a rolled-up dress shirt and a yellow tie speckled with bits of hair. It was his last week at his soon-to-be-closed location, which charges $28 for a basic haircut. (No word on whether Mr. Paulson and Mr. Blankfein, both folliclely challenged, received discounts.) Mr. Anzalone seems to have learned from his customers at Goldman, whose business principles demand discretion in its dealings with clients. When a reporter said he was writing an article, Mr. Anzalone declined to discuss his Goldman clients and his move to the firm's building. Known as ''Sal,'' Mr. Anzalone began his career in 1974 at Nino's, a popular barber shop near Wall Street. In 1994, he struck out on his own and opened Salvatore's. The threat to Mr. Anzalone's new shop emerged last year, when Goldman announced it would renovate the Embassy Suites hotel, which it had bought in 2006 with plans to turn it into a hotel for the bank's executives visiting New York. Goldman has closed the Embassy Suites for a yearlong refurbishment in part to assuage its executives who had grumbled about the accommodations. In the meantime, Mr. Anzalone has moved around the corner and into Goldman's new 43-story steel-and-glass tower, which already includes such comforts as a 54,000-square-foot gym. And like much of what the firm does, the deal with Mr. Anzalone has in at least one respect an air of exclusivity. Only customers from Goldman are allowed.

As a start, Goldman restated its financial results for the third quarter, giving better insight into how much revenue its hedge fund, real estate and private equity operations generated, among other things. This initial disclosure was short of details on Goldman's business, however. Some revenue appears to have simply been reallocated to different business lines. ''It remains to be seen how much detail we'll get,'' said Jim Sinegal, an analyst with Morningstar who covers the banking industry. ''It's still going to be difficult to figure out exactly what they're doing, but it's a step in the right direction,'' he said, noting that ''almost any additional disclosure would be an improvement.'' In a 63-page report on Tuesday, Goldman listed 39 ways to amend its business practices - changes largely aimed at bolstering internal controls and disclosure. Goldman is trying to rehabilitate its public image, which has taken a beating since the financial crisis and its aftermath. The greater detail is intended as a response to criticism that Goldman has put its own interests ahead of those of clients. Goldman clients have complained that ''in some circumstances the firm weighs its interests and short-term incentives too heavily,'' the report said. The report proposes to break down what Goldman sees as its responsibilities, depending on the role it is performing for a client. The bank also plans to offer investors additional insight into its trading revenue, which is among its more secretive practices and an area where the bank's interests do not always align with that of its clients. The bank said it planned to provide enhanced details of whether revenue was coming from trades made on behalf of a client, or only for itself. Yet Goldman is by no means transforming its business. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' And how the report will be received within Goldman is not yet clear. The proposed changes might take time to seep in at the bank, said Kimberly Scott, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who focuses on organizational change. ''All eyes are going to be on what Goldman's leaders and managers are doing and saying,'' said Ms. Scott, who has been a management consultant for more than 15 years. ''If there's any kind of mixed message at all, it will be an uphill battle.'' Goldman's new financial statements, based on Tuesday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, will expand to include a fourth business line. Goldman currently reports three business lines: investment banking, trading and principal investments, and asset management and securities services. In the future, investors will see investment banking, institutional client services, investing and lending, and investment management. The most noticeable and important change is the creation of a segment called investing and lending. The new category, among other things, sheds more light on the firm's hedge fund, private equity and real estate operations, analysts say. According to the S.E.C. filing, the group notched revenue of nearly $1.8 billion in the third quarter, or about 20 percent of overall revenue. Yet the new institutional client services segment, with nearly $4.7 billion of revenue, is clouded in mystery. About $2.7 billion of its revenue is part of the fixed-income, currency and commodities trading business, or F.I.C.C., Goldman's largest business and one about which it provides very little detail. Nonetheless, Goldman's report could ease some of the public scrutiny facing the bank, according to one public relations consultant. ''You absolutely have to demonstrate, especially to regulators and legislators, that you are taking action,'' said Eric Dezenhall, who runs a crisis management firm in Washington. Goldman on Tuesday took ''baby steps'' in the right direction, he said. ''Imagine what would happen if they didn't do it.''

But the Wall Street firm’s reorganization of how it reports earnings also serves its own purposes. It makes valuing the firm a bit easier by enabling a better sum-of-the-parts analysis than was previously possible.Let’s start with institutional client services, the segment that houses all Goldman’s trading and market-making for clients and accounts for about 60 percent of the firm’s revenue. Being newly scrubbed of any outright proprietary or prop trading means it’s reasonable to compare this with a firm like Knight Capital. Sure, Goldman’s business is larger, but it also probably takes more risk. On Knight’s valuation multiple of around 11.5 times estimated 2010 earnings Goldman’s unit is worth an eye-popping $59 billion. Now for investment management. The division is worth about $9.5 billion if ascribed BlackRock’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio of just under 19 times. Goldman’s investment bank group, meanwhile, is arguably comparable to the financial sector specialist Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, and on that firm’s valuation multiple Goldman’s market-leading franchise is worth about $21.5 billion. All in, that’s $90 billion, or $3.5 billion more than Goldman’s market value on Tuesday. On this back-of-the-envelope analysis, which annualizes Goldman’s pretax earnings for the first nine months of last year and assumes a flat 33 percent tax rate, that suggests shareholders are ascribing no value to the firm’s prop businesses, which are now collected under the investing and lending heading. That’s despite commanding the highest pretax margin of any business line at the firm — almost 50 percent. This valuation also ignores a collection of investments that Goldman reckons are currently worth about $15 billion. It’s reasonable for investors to be cautious of proprietary risk-taking. And client trading can cause losses, too. Being deemed worthless may be a blow to the unit’s ego. But it serves Goldman’s purpose well. Even if the new regulation known as the Volcker Rule were to kill off all its prop activities, the firm’s stock shouldn’t take a hit: it’s already trading at around fair value. That’s fodder for a bullish view of Goldman’s shares. The iPhone Winner Apple has again turned iPhone buzz into gold. Despite all the talk of possible bells and whistles, Verizon Wireless so far looks to be offering the smartphone on terms roughly similar to AT&amp;T’s. The only clear winners will be Apple’s masters of hype. Some AT&amp;T customers might want to switch to Verizon Wireless. But that could cost them. Only a third of AT&amp;T’s iPhone customers have contracts that expire this year, according to UBS. Others would have to pay up to $325 in termination fees and least $199 for a new iPhone from Verizon Wireless, because the two networks run on different standards. As for Verizon Wireless’s customers, they will now get a chance to carry an Apple device. But they will pay much the same as AT&amp;T users. And for Verizon Wireless itself, mass adoption of the iPhone wouldn’t come cheap. Like AT&amp;T, it will subsidize every iPhone to the tune of perhaps $400 upfront for customers with a two-year contract. Furthermore, the handset encourages heavy data use, which in turn demands investment in cell towers and other infrastructure. Add up the burden, and the operators may not even cover their cost of capital. AT&amp;T’s newer customers pay more for downloading more data, which can change this calculus. Yet Verizon Wireless may swallow the cost of sticking with all-you-can-eat plans, at least for a while, to win over customers. Apple is therefore the most obvious beneficiary. Verizon Wireless brings it more than 90 million possible new iPhone users — potentially at the expense of rival smartphone makers. And both AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless will now have to spend heavily to advertise the iPhone. Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, and his cohorts have already benefited from the chatter surrounding something that, for any other company, would be a routine product line extension. Investors, at least, may have caught on. With the much anticipated announcement now out in the open, Apple’s stock dipped just a fraction on Tuesday. But shares in both AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications, the wireless unit’s controlling shareholder, were down approaching 2 percent.

Regulation<date>Published: January 12, 2011</date><text>Harry Campbell Facebook's sale of private shares to Goldman Sachs's private clients is a Rorschach test. Commentators who think that there is too much regulation have asserted, not surprisingly, that Sarbanes-Oxley and increased United States regulation of public companies deterred Facebook from going ahead with an initial public offering this year. The truth is much more complex. Since Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted in 2002, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have actually liberalized the regulatory regime for companies when they go public, in some cases arguably too far. But the outcry in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley was that overregulation had shut down the I.P.O. market. The most prominent evidence cited was that foreign companies were no longer listing in the United States. According to Dealogic, three foreign companies listed on an American stock exchange in 2003 compared with 75 in 2000, the height of the Internet bubble. Sarbanes-Oxley probably did deter foreign companies from listing in the United States, if not for the actual regulation than for bad public relations. But the bad economy at the time was most likely the primary reason for the dearth of I.P.O's. Immense pressure was on the S.E.C. to lure back foreign offerings by liberalizing the regulatory regime applicable to domestic and foreign companies alike. The commission repeatedly acted to reduce the regulatory requirements on foreign companies. The S.E.C. revised its accounting rules to permit use of international accounting standards by foreign issuers and to freely permit these companies to leave the American markets if they thought United States regulation was too burdensome. The S.E.C. also responded more broadly to reduce regulation, particularly that imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley, on all public companies. Among other actions, the commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board made compliance significantly easier with respect to Section 404, the requirement that auditors must certify the validity of a company's internal controls. Section 404 is often cited as Sarbanes-Oxley's most significant burden. And in the Dodd-Frank act, Congress eliminated the requirement to comply with Section 404 for companies with a market value of less than $75 million and directed the S.E.C. to look at removing the restriction for companies with a market capitalization of up to $250 million. The Supreme Court also provided help, by making it significantly harder to sue public companies for securities fraud in several cases. The net result is that regulation for all public companies in the United States is in some cases lighter than before Sarbanes-Oxley. And despite the rhetoric, the evidence on which this liberalization was based was quite mixed. In one study, Robert Bartlett, a Berkeley law professor, found that the overwhelming majority of companies bought by private equity firms still voluntarily complied with the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley in order to issue debt to finance these acquisitions. In other words, investors liked the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, and companies willingly complied when they did not need to. Others argued that the decline of the I.P.O. market was largely unrelated to Sarbanes-Oxley. Grant Thornton, an accounting and consulting firm, has ably detailed in a report why there was a significant drop in small-issuer I.P.O.'s starting in 1997. Grant Thornton asserts that the reason is actually a result of changes in market structure. Decimalization - pricing stocks in cents rather than fractions - took profits out of trading that had previously given incentive to brokers to list small companies. New order-handling rules and the rise of online brokers similarly reduced incentives. The result is that in 1996, the number of I.P.O.'s raising less than $25 million was 309, which declined to nine by 2001, a year before Sarbanes-Oxley, and was only 13 in 2010, according to Dealogic. The flight of foreign companies could be attributed in large part to the development of mature markets elsewhere. Last year, according to Dealogic, Asia will for the first time lead the I.P.O. market with $147 billion worth of issuances, compared with $44.4 billion for the United States and $39.1 billion for all of Europe.</text></article>

The Deal Professor offers a guide to understanding the legal issues surrounding the deal. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS Nielsen Holdings, the television ratings and consumer measurement company, is tempering expectations ahead of its initial public offering. According to an amended version of its prospectus, filed on Monday, Nielsen expects to price its shares at $20 to $22. At the midpoint of that range, Nielsen will raise $1.5 billion -- a significant step down from its previous estimate late last year of $2 billion. Under the terms of the deal, underwriters also have the option to buy an additional 10.7 million shares. And if that option is fully exercised, Nielsen will increase its total fund-raising to about $1.7 billion. EVELYN M. RUSLI SPINOFF Morgan Stanley announced on Monday that it would part ways with its in-house quantitative trading unit by the end of 2012. The new firm will be called PDT Advisors, derived from its original name as the Process Driven Trading unit. The company, in which Morgan is expected to maintain a stake, will be headed by Peter Muller, above. BIG INVESTMENT Square, a mobile payments company, announced Monday that it had raised $27.5 million in a new round of financing led by Sequoia Capital. The deal, which includes several private and strategic investors-- like Khosla Ventures and Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's chief executive -- values the start-up at $240 million, according to a person close to the deal.

The Wall Street investment bank, which has been criticized for putting its own interests ahead of clients', plans to detail new rules around disclosure and financial reporting on Tuesday, as suggested by the study. The rules are aimed at bolstering internal controls, improving transparency and burnishing its reputation. But whether the report will result in any meaningful change or give investors a deep look inside Goldman's opaque trading operations remains an open question, according to one analyst. ''We have all worked at companies where you get these memos. A memo only goes so far,'' said a Credit Agricole Securities analyst, Michael Mayo. ''But it may help define some of the gray areas, and it could incrementally help perception and show clients they are trying to gain more control of the situation.'' The changes, set to be released in a 63-page internal report, are the findings of an internal review into the firm's business practices, broad parts of which were analyzed by The New York Times and appeared in DealBook. In the document, Goldman outlines several modifications to its operations, including enhancing its quarterly financial reports and clearly detailing its specific role in transactions. The firm also said it would strengthen standards in so-called structured products, the complicated investments that got a bad name during the financial crisis. But Goldman is not transforming its business, it is just making adjustments, which many expected when the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, announced the review at the company's annual meeting in May. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' The internal review was begun just a month after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Goldman, which claimed the bank omitted crucial facts about its role in developing a subprime mortgage security in which investors lost millions. The bank, which did not admit wrongdoing, settled with the S.E.C. in July and agreed to pay $550 million. But the agreement did not call for an independent monitor to oversee Goldman's business practices. Unprompted by the agency, the firm initiated the review in May. The committee that led the study consisted only of Goldman executives, including E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans, a rising star and possible successor to Mr. Blankfein. As part of the process, the committee conducted hundreds of interviews with staff members. It also hired two consulting firms, which reached out to Goldman clients. Some complained that the investment bank should be more forthcoming about its role in transactions. While much of the feedback from clients was ''flattering,'' Mr. Evans said, the firm was also told there was room for improvement, particularly in the areas of transparency and communication. The report includes 39 recommendations, approved by the board in December. On Monday, Mr. Blankfein briefed Goldman partners, including senior managers, in a closed-door, offsite meeting in Connecticut. ''We believe the recommendations of the committee will strengthen the firm's culture in an increasingly complex environment,'' the report concluded. ''In particular, our approach must be: not just 'can we' undertake a given business activity, but 'should we.' '' The committee in its report tries to address longstanding concerns that Goldman is rife with conflicts of interest. Clients have often complained that they do not know where the firm stands on a deal, whether it is simply as facilitator or an interested party with a stake in the potential profits. In response to such criticisim, the firm plans to articulate its responsibilities in a particular transaction, say as an underwriter, developing an initial public offering; a market maker, assisting in the buying and selling of a specific stock; or as an investor, taking a piece of the action. Such revelations should help Goldman avoid the issues raised by the S.E.C. in its civil fraud case. In its complaint, the agency contended that Goldman, in creating a mortgage investment known as Abacus 2007-AC1, did not disclose that a hedge fund helped pick the underlying securities. ''It is important to articulate clearly both to our people and to clients the specific roles we assume in each case,'' Goldman said in the report. Even so, the recommendations are not likely to affect deals like Goldman's recent move to sell $1.5 billion worth of Facebook shares to its wealthy clients. In its pitch, the firm failed to disclose that a powerful unit within Goldman passed on buying a $450 million stake in the social networking behemoth. The firm later took the investment on its own balance sheet, which it revealed publicly. When the firm announces its fourth-quarter profits next week, Goldman is also aiming to be more transparent about its results and risk management, according to people with knowledge of the changes who could not speak publicly on the matter. The bank, for example, is increasing the segments for which it reports revenue to four units from three, potentially giving investors a deeper look at its operations. Still, some changes are at the margin. As part of the committee's recommendations, the firm will move certain underwriting and origination activities to the investment banking group from the securities division - a move mainly designed to streamline workflow. The report also restates its 14 existing principles. ''Goldman Sachs has one reputation,'' the report said. ''It can be affected by any number of decisions and activities across the firm. Every employee has an equal obligation to raise issues or concerns, no matter how small, to protect the firm's reputation.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd C.

The firm’s nearly $2 billion investment connection with Facebook is relatively small financially, but it’s big in franchise terms. After the lumps Goldman took last year, the deal showed the firm could still wrap its tentacles around an important client for mutual benefit.Goldman could still lose money on the deal for its shareholders, partners and clients. And questions remain as to whether its plan to invest $450 million of its own capital alongside $1.5 billion from others through a single investment entity violates the spirit of Securities Exchange Act disclosure rules. That means there’s still a chance the deal could backfire financially or in the realm of public opinion. But taking calculated risks is what separates Goldman from run-of-the-mill competitors. The Facebook effort also involved stitching its sometimes conflicting strands of business into a fabric that suited a priority customer. That’s a way both to fend off rivals and to mitigate risk in the deal. The Goldman coup surely started with an investment banking relationship with Facebook’s executives and its board, including the early venture capital supporters Peter Thiel and Jim Breyer. Other banks can do that, too, however. So something more was required: capital. Even without the backing of some of its in-house money managers, Goldman found the cash. Its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, carved out a slice of the balance sheet — a bold call given that many bank executives are paralyzed trying to figure out the impact of regulatory changes on proprietary investments. Moreover, Goldman’s Silicon Valley bankers enlisted the private wealth management division to bring in customers as investors. That doesn’t just generate fees, it allows Goldman to boast that it brings clients deals other banks can’t match. The firm’s powerful network of alumni also played a role. Digital Sky Technologies, a Facebook shareholder that’s investing at least $50 million more, counts former partners of the bank among its executives. There are other tentacles poised for the future, too. Goldman will probably take Facebook public eventually, for a juicy fee. And its private bank may make new customers of the social network’s founders and employees when that happens. The likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse should be wondering whether and how they can coordinate their various appendages on such A-list deals so successfully. Balancing Act Commodities markets should like economic growth. Yet despite positive data from Germany and the United States, prices are wobbling. The problem is that oil, food and metals prices have all thrived on a weak dollar, cheap money and inflows into real rather than financial assets. Recovery, a firmer dollar and higher interest rates are giving investors more to think about. There could be a lot of volatility ahead. This week’s lurches come at the end of a superstrong run. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodity index jumped 10 percent in December, taking its annual rise for 2010 to 15 percent. Commodities were ripe for a correction. But their fall may signal more than that. Dollar weakness and central bank money printing helped lift a broad range of commodities, as well as gold, last year. Hedge funds made hay with trades that shorted the dollar and went long on commodities. Steep price gains had a marked speculative element. Now, however, a dollar rally looks on. Yields on Treasuries have risen strongly since October, making dollar assets more appealing. The euro zone periphery crisis is another reason to switch out of the single currency and into the dollar. As the dollar rises, commodities, which are priced in dollars, tend to fall. But the influence of real levels of supply and demand must also be taken into account. Real demand for many commodities should be well supported if global growth is indeed firm. Yet stronger growth, too, has its negative side. Inflation is up in China, India and even the euro zone. Asia has already seen interest rate rises. The liquidity taps that provided investors with cheap money are closing. Stronger growth, but probably a stronger dollar, higher global inflation and interest rates, and perhaps less liquidity: that sums up the countervailing forces in commodity markets in 2011. The tide of money that surged into commodities last year may no longer flow so reliably.

In 1964, regulators started requiring companies with more than 499 shareholders to publicly report their financial results. It is a rule that has been debated from the outset - and the issues raised now are the same ones raised then. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining the frenzied buying and selling of Facebook shares and other private technology companies in the secondary market. To some, the structure of the Goldman deal merely looks like a way to circumvent the law. Through a special purpose vehicle, the firm could potentially pool money from thousands of wealthy clients and still be considered one investor because the entity would be managed by Goldman. Section 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 came about in the 1960s as over-the-counter trading in shares of privately held companies began to heat up and regulators worried that investors were not getting enough information. A special study from that period found that the ''disclosures voluntarily made by unlisted companies left a great deal to be desired,'' according to a speech by the S.E.C. commissioner at the time, Hugh F. Owens, given before the Practicing Law Institute in New York in 1964. ''Not only did the volume of information delivered to shareholders vary considerably, but the candor with which it was presented was highly variable,'' he said in the speech. ''They involve thousands of corporations and hundreds of thousands of investors. The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 effectively remove the distinction, which has existed as to a large number of the companies whose securities are traded over-the-counter.'' That is the same sort of issue facing regulators now, with shares in Facebook trading at a frenetic pace on the secondary market. The announcement that Goldman will use a special purpose vehicle to raise and invest $1.5 billion in the company - money collected from a variety of wealthy individuals - has only intensified the scrutiny. In practice, a large fund that represents hundreds or thousands of individuals can be considered a single record holder. ''So long as Goldman is the sole decision maker for all investors it's irrelevant,'' said Eleazer Klein, a partner at the law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel. Even so, questions remain about whether such a deal may stray from the spirit of the law while adhering to its letter. ''Whether something is done primarily to circumvent the rules is a philosophical question,'' Mr. Klein said. ''There is a natural tension between being allowed to structure something in a manner that complies with the law and at the same point circumvents the law.'' How did the government come up with the 500-shareholder limit, a threshold that over the years has been called both too high and too low? The government did not want to subject small companies with limited shareholders to the costs of regulation and compliance. At the same time, regulators did not want to allow large companies with a multitude of investors to reap the benefits of public financing without disclosure and registration. Ultimately, lawyers say the number was picked arbitrarily. Scientific or not, it all comes back to investor protection. One issue today is whether wealthy investors - like those who will participate in the Goldman deal - need the same protection as smaller investors. There are plenty of examples where the government has determined that they do not, as with hedge funds and private equity investments. ''We've lowered the bar for certain types of investors that we felt need less protection,'' said Christian Leuz, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''But maybe what we've learned in recent years after the financial crisis is that sophisticated doesn't always mean high net worth.'' Although the 500-investor threshold has long been the subject of debate, start-ups like Google raised it to a new level in the last decade. Many private technology companies reward and attract talent by offering stock options or shares in the company. Those employee-owned shares typically do not count toward the 500-investor limit. But once those shares are sold on a private exchange - often after employees leave the company - they are no longer exempt. Venture capital firms, too, divest shares in the secondary market. The development of this changing dynamic has only complicated the numbers game. ''Prior to that, it was pretty easy to maintain less than 500 shareholders,'' said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTOS: Hugh F.

Goldman Sachs Capital Partners - a group that manages and invests for pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other prominent clients - was given the initial opportunity to invest $450 million in Facebook, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Goldman gives the ''first look'' on many investment opportunities to the $20.3 billion fund. While most of the group's clients are big institutions, the investors also include current and former Goldman partners. But the unit's head, Richard A. Friedman, a longtime Goldman partner, decided the Facebook deal was not suitable for his clients, in part owing to the high valuation and to a mismatch with his investment criteria. The $450 million investment values the Web company at $50 billion. After Goldman's deal, some industry experts cautioned that Facebook's growth would need to accelerate rapidly over the next couple of years to justify such a steep price - a risk with many brand-name technology upstarts. Last year, Facebook recorded revenue of approximately $2 billion, with roughly $400 million in profit, according to people briefed on the company's results. That is up from $220 million in earnings on $770 million in sales in 2009. After Mr. Friedman passed, the Wall Street bank itself made the $450 million Facebook investment, taking the deal on its balance sheet. (About $75 million of that amount is coming from an internal hedge fund, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according to a person who reviewed the offering memorandum sent to investors.) The firm is trying to sell $1.5 billion more of shares in the company to wealthy clients - a deal that is expected to be oversubscribed when it closes this week, as early as Thursday, these people said. All Goldman partners will also be able to invest in this fund. Goldman, knowing the deal had the potential to draw regulatory attention, briefed the Securities and Exchange Commission before making the offer to wealthy individuals, according to people with knowledge of the conversation who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The agency is currently looking at trading in private technology companies like Facebook. The S.E.C. declined to comment. The decision by Mr. Friedman, who holds a seat on the firm's vaunted management committee, has raised concerns among some of Goldman's most sophisticated clients who have been pitched on Facebook in recent days. Several wealthy individuals approached about the offering said they had declined, in part, because of Mr. Friedman's rejection. The clients spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear that making a public comment would hurt their relationship with Goldman and their opportunity to have access to future investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Friedman did not return a call. People briefed on Mr. Friedman's decision said he was concerned about Facebook's $50 billion valuation and the terms of the deal. Goldman Sachs Capital Partners frequently likes to take large positions in companies with expectations of holding them for several years or even longer. A $450 million investment in Facebook would have represented less than 1 percent of the firm. One person briefed on the discussions with Mr. Friedman, however, said he would have ''thrown out'' his typical investment philosophy if he had believed a Facebook investment was an ''easy home run.'' Goldman's critics have long complained that the firm puts its own interests ahead of clients. In the Facebook deal, Goldman is investing $450 million, at an implied $50 billion valuation. However, Goldman clients are paying a 4 percent placement fee and a 0.5 percent expense reserve fee for their shares, as well as giving up 5 percent of gains. That means Facebook would need to be worth closer to $60 billion before they make any money. Beside those fees, Goldman is likely to earn additional money from ancillary business - with the biggest victory coming from an eventual initial public offering, perhaps as soon as 2012.</text></article>

On first blush, the answer would appear to be no. After all, in May 2009, the company was valued at $10 billion. Last August, Facebook was valued at $27 billion and now it's $50 billion - for a company with a reported $2 billion in revenue and negligible profits. If General Electric, with 2010 revenue of around $150 billion, traded at a similar multiple of revenue, it would be worth $3.75 trillion instead of $200 billion. Facebook is now considered to be worth more than Time Warner, DuPont and Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. Just last week, Facebook's shares were said to be trading on a private-market exchange at a valuation of $42.4 billion. Thanks to Goldman's imprimatur, Facebook's value increased 20 percent virtually overnight. Can Goldman really expect to squeeze more water from this stone? Sadly, yes. To understand why, we have to go to the heart of the many problems in the way the Wall Street cartel does business, despite the promised reforms of the Dodd-Frank law. With Goldman's investment in Facebook, we have a front-row seat to the process by which Wall Street creates and inflates financial bubbles. This bout of hysteria involves not only Facebook but other Internet companies including Twitter, the gaming site Zynga, the social buying site Groupon and LinkedIn, another social networking site. The valuation of these companies has soared in the past two years, leading some to worry that the American people bailed out Wall Street so that we could relive the Internet Bubble of 1999. Despite the high price of its investment, Goldman sees in Facebook a business bonanza, a nearly perfect nugget of investment-banking opportunities. First, Goldman's cost of capital is close to zero - as a bank holding company, it can borrow from the Federal Reserve at negligible interest rates - so any capital gain it makes on its venture in Facebook will be sheer profit. Second, Goldman has almost certainly locked up the role of lead manager of the inevitable Facebook initial public offering. Fees for underwriting public offerings are generally about 7 percent of the value of the stock sold. Facebook could easily sell $2 billion of stock or more, generating fees to Goldman and the other underwriters of at least $140 million. The other benefit for Goldman in leading the public offering - aside from major bragging rights - is that it can use its marketing, sales and distribution muscle to make sure the value of Facebook at the time of the offering exceeds the $50 billion valuation at which Goldman invested. Goldman has also won from Facebook the right to offer an additional $1.5 billion of the company's stock to its private-wealth clients. According to The Times, Goldman will be creating a ''special purpose vehicle'' to sell the stock to its wealthy clients and then will charge them a 4 percent initial fee plus 5 percent of any profits. While on paper it seems that these high rollers would be foolish to invest in Facebook at such a lofty valuation, they will still most certainly feel increased loyalty to Goldman for making such an exclusive opportunity available to them. On top of it all, there is the increased likelihood that Goldman will get to manage a good portion of the $12 billion fortune belonging to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, for yet more fees. If Goldman does take all these roles at once - investor, salesman, money manager, I.P.O. underwriter - it would certainly raise the ugly specter of conflicts of interest. But probably not to Goldman executives, who have always prided themselves on being able to ''manage'' through such situations. (In fairness, there's likely no investment-banking firm on the planet that would not eagerly take Goldman's place in this scheme, if offered the chance.) Even though Facebook is reported to have little need for Goldman's money, having Goldman validate Facebook's exponential increase in value gives Mr. Zuckerberg the ultimate Silicon Valley street cred, far more than he got from having Hollywood make a movie about him or from becoming the youngest billionaire on the planet. With all these winners, who will the losers be? The average investor, of course, who will get left holding the bag when, someday, Wall Street realizes the firm's financial performance doesn't live up to its hyped valuation. This column appeared in print on January 5, 2011. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>
    <article index="20" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E1D81538F937A35752C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Facebook Deal Offers Freedom From Scrutiny<date>Published: January 4, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO - In Silicon Valley, going public used to be the ultimate rite of passage for a start-up - a sign it had arrived. No more. With its $500 million infusion from Goldman Sachs and other investors, Facebook is now flush with cash, and a market value of about $50 billion, giving it the financial muscle it needs to compete with better-heeled rivals like Google. And Facebook hopes for an even bigger advantage from the deal, the ability to delay an initial public offering. That would allow it to remain free of government regulation and from the volatility of Wall Street. It would also allow Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, to retain near absolute control over the company he co-founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004. This strategy was unthinkable in Silicon Valley just a few years ago, when hundreds of start-ups with scant revenue and no profits, like Pets.com and Webvan, raced to go public, and investors eagerly lined up to buy their shares. Lots of people would stand in line to buy shares in Facebook, but for now, only an exclusive few - wealthy clients of Goldman Sachs - will be able to. On Monday, Goldman e-mailed certain clients, offering them the chance to invest in the company. That offer is the latest sign of the emergence of active markets in the shares of closely held companies. Those markets are helping successful start-ups like Facebook develop the financial wherewithal to compete in the big leagues of business. They have also become an avenue for venture capitalists and start-up employees to cash in their stock, turning many overworked engineers into instant millionaires. And so a young mogul like Mr. Zuckerberg, the world's youngest billionaire at age 26, can enjoy many of the benefits of going public without having to tie the knot with Wall Street. Other hot technology companies like Twitter, Zynga and Groupon are also tapping secondary markets to keep stock market investors at bay. They are in no rush to go public and no longer need the bragging rights that a stock offering used to bestow. ''This is a topsy-turvy world,'' said Scott Dettmer, a founding partner of Gunderson Dettmer, a law firm that has advised venture capitalists, start-ups and entrepreneurs since the 1980s. He added that even a few years ago, ''there were all sorts of business reasons to go public, but for entrepreneurs it was also a badge of honor.'' Perhaps more than any company founder, Mr. Zuckerberg, who declined to comment for this article, has frequently expressed his disinterest in Wall Street, though Facebook is clearly not above taking its cash. He passed on opportunities to make a killing, for example, when, at age 22, he rejected billion-dollar offers for Facebook. ''Mark would absolutely prefer not have an I.P.O. until he absolutely has to,'' said David Kirkpatrick, the author of ''The Facebook Effect.'' ''He absolutely doesn't want to sacrifice control because he believes that his vision is necessary to keep powering the company forward.'' Mr. Zuckerberg's quest to keep Facebook private, though, will not last forever. Federal regulations require companies with 500 or more investors to disclose their financial results, eliminating one of the principal advantages of staying private. The Goldman Sachs investment, for a stake of less than 1 percent in the company, is formulated in part to skirt those rules. But it may help for only a limited amount of time. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating private company trades in secondary markets, and regulators may decide that what is good for Facebook is not necessarily good for the investing public. Still, the huge cash infusion is a coup both for Mr. Zuckerberg, who is said to own about a quarter of the company, and Facebook. The deal gives the company cash to hire employees or build data centers. It also puts Facebook, which makes most of its money through advertising, on a path to surpass Google, by some measures, as the most successful Internet company to come out of Silicon Valley. Facebook is on track to bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue this year.</text></article>

In investing $450 million in the social networking giant, Goldman has established itself as the leading candidate to win the lucrative and prestigious assignment of Facebook's initial public offering, whenever that day comes. It also positions itself to reap millions of dollars in banking fees. Goldman has already begun the process of wooing its wealthy clients to invest alongside it in Facebook, forming an investment vehicle that seeks to raise as much $1.5 billion for the Internet company. But Goldman's bold move is also likely to focus the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which last month began an inquiry into the surge in trading shares of privately held Internet companies. While the investment by Goldman is being hailed as a huge coup on Wall Street, the deal - in particular the investment pool being formed for its clients - could become a lightning rod for regulators and policy makers as they examine the growing shadow market in Facebook shares. For Goldman, the investment in Facebook is in many ways a return to the firm's roots. Long before Facebook became a social and cultural phenomenon, Goldman was ''friending'' America's hottest companies and their chief executives, from Sears Roebuck in the 1900s to Ford in the 1950s to eBay in the 1990s. By collecting so many important friends, and obsessively tending to those relationships, Goldman generates big fees. In addition to the potential banking fees generated by an initial public offering of Facebook, there is the billions of dollars of unlocked paper wealth realized by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's 26-year-old chief, and his fellow executives. Goldman, as a lead Facebook investor, will most likely have a leg up in winning the assignment to manage that money, too. The firm's Facebook investment came together over the last month, according to a person involved in the deal who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. After the spike in trading in Facebook over the last several months - in a November auction, Facebook shares traded at a $56 billion valuation - Mr. Zuckerberg expressed an interest in raising money to legitimize the $50 billion valuation. Mr. Zuckerberg felt that gaining the imprimatur of a major investor at such lofty levels would validate Facebook in the eyes of its Silicon Valley competitors with whom it is negotiating deals, this person said. Helping play matchmaker was Yuri Milner, chief executive of DST Global, a Russian firm that invested $50 million alongside Goldman. Goldman has a close relationship with DST and Mr. Milner, a Russian businessman who has emerged as a leading venture capital investor in Internet companies. Mail.ru, the publicly traded sibling of DST Global, has an existing stake in Facebook, as well large positions in Groupon and Zynga, two other popular Web-based businesses. Goldman was a lead underwriter of Mail.ru's successful $1 billion initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in November. The Facebook investment, made from Goldman's balance sheet, also sheds light on the firm's private equity strategy in the wake of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. Although the Facebook investment represents a negligible percentage of Goldman's roughly $900 billion balance sheet, it is symbolically significant because it had been unclear whether the firm would, after the financial crisis, be using its balance sheet to make these types of illiquid, risky investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The closest analogue to Goldman's Facebook investment may be the firm's longtime alliance with the New York fashion designer Ralph Lauren. In 1994, Mr. Lauren was looking for money to expand his business, and Goldman invested a minority stake and took a seat on the company's board. Goldman underwrote Ralph Lauren's initial public offering in 1997. Today, Mr. Lauren's company remains a loyal client of the firm. And when Mr. Lauren sold $1 billion of stock last year to cash out one-quarter of his stake in his company, Goldman handled the trade. Perhaps even more intriguing than Goldman's direct stake in Facebook is the ''special purpose vehicle'' that it is creating to allow its wealthy clients to invest in Facebook alongside the firm.</text></article>

The deal makes Facebook now worth more than companies like eBay, Yahoo and Time Warner. The stake by Goldman Sachs, considered one of Wall Street's savviest investors, signals the increasing might of Facebook, which has already been bearing down on giants like Google. The new money will give Facebook more firepower to steal away valuable employees, develop new products and possibly pursue acquisitions - all without being a publicly traded company. The investment may also allow earlier shareholders, including Facebook employees, to cash out at least some of their stakes. The new investment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commissionhas begun an inquiry into the increasingly hot private market for shares in Internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, the gaming site Zynga and LinkedIn, an online professional networking site. Some experts suggest the inquiry is focused on whether certain companies are improperly using the private market to get around public disclosure requirements. The new money could add pressure on Facebook to go public even as its executives have resisted. The popularity of shares of Microsoft and Google in the private market ultimately pressured them to pursue initial public offerings. So far, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has brushed aside the possibility of an initial public offering or a sale of the company. At an industry conference in November, he said on the topic, ''Don't hold your breath.'' However, people involved in the fund-raising effort suggest that Facebook's board has indicated an intention to consider a public offering in 2012. There has been an explosion in user interest in social media sites. The social buying site Groupon, which recently rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from Google, is in the process of raising as much as $950 million from major institutional investors, at a valuation near $5 billion, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. ''When you think back to the early days of Google, they were kind of ignored by Wall Street investors, until it was time to go public,'' said Chris Sacca, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who is a former Google employee and an investor in Twitter. ''This time, the Street is smartening up. They realize there are true growth businesses out here. Facebook has become a real business, and investors are coming out here and saying, 'We want a piece of it.''' The Facebook investment deal is likely to stir up a debate about what the company would be worth in the public market. Though it does not disclose its financial performance, analysts estimate the company is profitable and could bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue annually. Under the terms of the deal, Goldman has invested $450 million, and Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm that has already sunk about half a billion dollars into Facebook, invested $50 million, people involved in the talks said. Goldman has the right to sell part of its stake, up to $75 million, to the Russian firm, these people said. For Digital Sky Technologies, the deal means its original investment in Facebook, at a valuation of $10 billion, has gone up fivefold. Representatives for Facebook, Goldman and Digital Sky Technologies all declined to comment. Goldman's involvement means it may be in a strong position to take Facebook public when it decides to do so in what is likely to be a lucrative and prominent deal. As part of the deal, Goldman is expected to raise as much as $1.5 billion from investors for Facebook at the $50 billion valuation, people involved in the discussions said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the transaction was not supposed to be made public until the fund-raising had been completed.</text></article>

Feinberg, President Obama's former pay czar, received a lukewarm reception from Wall Street earlier this year, when he suggested that firms adopt a so-called brake provision that would allow employee compensation agreements at big banks to be broken if the government were forced to step and bail them out. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had adopted just such a brake proposal. The filing says that, if the government is forced to bail Goldman out, most of the firm's outstanding compensation awards ''shall immediately terminate.'' The move was applauded by some pay experts as a good corporate governance practice. ''Not many firms as far as I know have done this,'' said Robert J. Jackson Jr., an associate professor at Columbia Law School. ''This is another sign of Goldman's leadership on reforming pay structures, and it will be interesting to see whether other firms follow Goldman's lead.'' Mr. Jackson previously served as deputy special master for TARP executive compensation in the Treasury Department. The brake proposal followed a broad outcry over the American International Group's payout of millions of dollars in bonuses in 2009 even though the government had pumped billions of dollars into the company to rescue it the previous year. Still, there is no danger that Goldman's adoption of the provision will derail its bonuses for 2010. Goldman is thriving. It earned $5.97 billion during the first nine months of the year and put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

It is unlikely to be any different when the findings of Goldman’s Business Standards Committee become public early next year. But on one important point Goldman lags some big competitors — the separation of the chief executive and chairman jobs. Now it has a chance to catch up.Since May, the bank has been conducting the financial industry version of group psychoanalysis. The standards group headed by the veteran partners Gerald Corrigan and Michael Evans is scrubbing the bank’s business practices to “reinforce the firm’s client focus” and improve transparency. The firm is examining, among other things, how it manages conflicts between its own activities and those of customers, how it discloses what it does, what responsibilities it has to clients and, critically, how to inculcate a sense of professional ethics in its employees. The results are highly anticipated by more than Goldman’s 35,400 employees. Every firm on Wall Street will pore over them. The firm’s public image may have been tarnished by reams of bad press and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit — since settled — contending that the firm shortchanged some of its customers. But the bank is still considered the gold standard among its peers. So if Goldman decides, say, to exit a business because it feels it creates conflicts of interest with clients, other banks will feel pressure to do the same — or risk expending considerable energy explaining to clients why they are different. What is not obviously on the business standards agenda, though, is Goldman’s own governance. While governance is ultimately a board decision, its absence seems odd given the intensity of the soul-searching going at the firm. Goldman’s financial performance has not suffered in any obvious way from having Lloyd C. Blankfein hold both the chief executive and chairman roles. But Goldman, and specifically Mr. Blankfein, have taken quite a beating in the public arena of late. Though some of the opprobrium was undeserved, the experience should have underlined the merits of separating duties at the top of the firm. The skills that brought Mr. Blankfein the top job at a competitive securities firm that consciously avoids the retail end of the market are not necessarily the same ones that are effective in the unwanted glare of political and Main Street scrutiny. Having a seasoned chairman would have given the firm someone to navigate the shifting political and regulatory tides while Mr. Blankfein focused on the firm’s operations and employees and, most important, on its big corporate and institutional customers. Executives at banks that did separate the top two jobs — a list that includes Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — say the move paid off at the height of the recent crisis and in efforts to shape the regulatory reform bill passed by Congress. Of course, a division of responsibilities is not a substitute for strong leadership. A chairman who does a poor job of working with politicians or the media won’t be able to offer a chief executive much cover. And it is critical that the chairman and the chief executive have a consistent vision for the company, a good working relationship and complementary skills. That’s not always the case, as the British energy giant BP amply illustrated during the months it spent trying to stanch the flow of oil — and the attendant negative press coverage — from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well. Carl-Henric Svanberg earned the sobriquet of “invisible chairman” for his low profile during the fiasco. And when Mr. Svanberg did speak publicly, he did little to help the gaffe-prone chief executive, Tony Hayward, who referred to the oil leak’s victims in the gulf as “the small people.” Mr. Blankfein is no Mr. Hayward. He has the confidence of shareholders, his board and his staff, and he survived antagonistic political hearings in much better shape than Mr. Hayward, if not completely unscathed. Having steered Goldman through the financial crisis and the annus horribilis the bank’s image endured in 2010, his job looks secure. But that makes the timing right for a change in governance. The Business Standards Committee itself offers one possible candidate to step in alongside Mr. Blankfein in the form of Mr. Corrigan, a former president of the New York Federal Reserve. By proposing to add a chairman now, Goldman would avoid the common stigma of separating the two top jobs at a time of weakness. Doing so from a position of strength would set another example for its rivals. ROB COX</text></article>

The men share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable -- and controversial -- fields in finance. They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential. Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk. In theory, this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrillion-dollar market. In practice, it also defends the dominance of the big banks. The banks in this group, which is affiliated with a new derivatives clearinghouse, have fought to block other banks from entering the market, and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available. Banks' influence over this market, and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises, has costly implications for businesses large and small, like Dan Singer's home heating-oil company in Westchester County, north of New York City. This fall, many of Mr. Singer's customers purchased fixed-rate plans to lock in winter heating oil at around $3 a gallon. While that price was above the prevailing $2.80 a gallon then, the contracts will protect homeowners if bitterly cold weather pushes the price higher. But Mr. Singer wonders if his company, Robison Oil, should be getting a better deal. He uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans. But he has no idea how much lower his prices -- and his customers' prices -- could be, he says, because banks don't disclose fees associated with the derivatives. ''At the end of the day, I don't know if I got a fair price, or what they're charging me,'' Mr. Singer said. Derivatives shift risk from one party to another, and they offer many benefits, like enabling Mr. Singer to sell his fixed plans without having to bear all the risk that oil prices could suddenly rise. Derivatives are also big business on Wall Street. Banks collect many billions of dollars annually in undisclosed fees associated with these instruments -- an amount that almost certainly would be lower if there were more competition and transparent prices. Just how much derivatives trading costs ordinary Americans is uncertain. The size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments. States and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs. Airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices. Food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef. The marketplace as it functions now ''adds up to higher costs to all Americans,'' said Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said. But big banks influence the rules governing derivatives through a variety of industry groups. The banks' latest point of influence are clearinghouses like ICE Trust, which holds the monthly meetings with the nine bankers in New York. Under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, many derivatives will be traded via such clearinghouses. Mr. Gensler wants to lessen banks' control over these new institutions. But Republican lawmakers, many of whom received large campaign contributions from bankers who want to influence how the derivatives rules are written, say they plan to push back against much of the coming reform. On Thursday, the commission canceled a vote over a proposal to make prices more transparent, raising speculation that Mr. Gensler did not have enough support from his fellow commissioners. The Department of Justice is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating ''the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,'' according to a department spokeswoman.</text></article>

Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform. He was convicted on two counts - theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property - and faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a business that had been little known outside Wall Street - high-frequency trading, which uses complex computer algorithms to make lightning-fast trades to exploit tiny discrepancies in price. Such trading has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street firms and hedge funds, and those companies fiercely protect the code underpinning their trading strategies. During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman's proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the firm's high-frequency trading business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman's total revenue of $45 billion. The verdict is a victory for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the case and has recently raised its profile with its aggressive pursuit of corporate crime. It is also a victory for the Justice Department more broadly, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority. ''As today's guilty verdict demonstrates, we will use the full force of the federal law to prosecute those who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers, whether those firms are on Wall Street or Main Street,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. Until 18 months ago, Mr. Aleynikov was living the American dream. He came to the United States from Russia in 1990 with expertise in computer programming. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers. He was recruited away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a fledgling firm founded by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple his Goldman salary. During his last three days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end around the company's security systems. After discovering that he had stolen code, Goldman reported him to federal authorities. On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International airport and arrested him. There was no dispute that Mr. Aleynikov had violated Goldman's confidentiality agreements when he uploaded portions of the bank's trading code to a server in Germany. The case, then, boiled down to this: Did Mr. Aleynikov intend to steal Goldman's proprietary source code to benefit his new employer? Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, mounted a defense that tried to draw the distinction that while his client foolishly breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, he did not commit a crime. Mr. Aleynikov acknowledged uploading code but told the F.B.I. that he never intended to steal Goldman's proprietary information. Instead, he merely wanted to take some publicly available open-source code with him on the way out the door. Mr. Marino portrayed his client as a humble and hard-working Russian who came to the United States with $300 in his pocket. Mr. Aleynikov, who is separated from his wife, lives in New Jersey and has three young children. Mr. Marino ridiculed the notion that Mr. Aleynikov was taking Goldman's ''secret sauce algorithms'' and somehow hurting the banking giant. ''There's not a law in the land that makes it a crime to use of collect or download open-source code,'' said Mr. Marino during the trial. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime.'' Federal prosecutors depicted Mr. Aleynikov as a brazen crook who was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever'' in filching thousands of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code from Goldman. He sought to use that code, prosecutors argued, as the building blocks to create a hedge fund trading platform at Teza. The government's strategy was to play to the jury's basic sense of right and wrong. ''This is a case about theft and greed,'' said Joseph Facciponti, the lead prosecutor, in his opening statement. The government made much of Mr. Aleynikov's deleting and encrypting various files after he took them from Goldman's servers. ''Like a good thief, he covered his tracks, brushing aside his digital footprint,'' Rebecca Rohr, a prosecutor, said in her closing remarks. After receiving the case Thursday afternoon, the jury deliberated for three hours Friday morning. Mr. Aleynikov sat stoically as Judge Cote read the verdict. A family friend comforted Mr. Aleynikov's mother, who had watched the trial each day from the spectators' gallery. Both Mr Aleynikov and Mr. Marino, his lawyer, declined to comment. All 12 of the jurors declined to speak about the case. Before dismissing the panel, Judge Cote warned them that if they were going to speak about the case, they must not discuss anything related to Goldman's code. Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set for March 18. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Prosecutors argued that Sergey Aleynikov stole source code from Goldman to help his new firm.

    <article index="29" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/business/06bonus.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Bush Tax Cuts Weigh on Wall Street’s Bonus Season<date>Published: December 5, 2010</date><text>Congress is debating tax rates, and that has Wall Street nervously eyeing the calendar.Worried that lawmakers will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans beginning next year, financial firms are discussing whether to move up their bonus payouts from next year to this month. At stake is a portion of the hefty annual payouts that are a familiar part of the compensation culture on Wall Street, as well as a juicy target of popular anger. If Congress does not extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest income levels, a typical worker who earns a $1 million bonus would pay $40,000 to $50,000 more in taxes next year than this year, depending on base salary. Goldman Sachs is one of the companies discussing how to time bonus season, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions. Pay consultants who work with major Wall Street companies say that just about every other large bank has also considered such a move in recent weeks. With tax politics in Washington unpredictable, bank executives have spent months sketching out several options for their bonus plans, including the possibility of an earlier payout. Lawmakers have been trading accusations across a partisan divide, but after this weekend, it appears likely that a compromise will extend the tax cuts for all income levels. Even so, the banks’ discussions about bonus timing underscore how focused the industry is on protecting every dollar of pay. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. Bonus payouts are traditionally shrouded in secrecy; companies are required to disclose their top executives’ pay, but they do not disclose the size of their total bonus pools in their public filings or internally. Goldman, not surprisingly, is the canary in the coal mine. It often announces its top executives’ bonuses before other firms, and the richness of its payouts sets the tone across the industry. This year the tax debate has imposed a new wrinkle, and executives at two large banks said their companies tentatively decided not to speed payouts, unless Goldman did. Then, these two executives said, they would consider paying early as a competitive measure, so that their workers were not upset. These executives and the people briefed on the Goldman discussions spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Bonus timing is also being discussed at scores of public companies, beyond banks, for top executives who receive multimillion-dollar payouts around the turn of the year. At most companies outside the financial sector, an early bonus would help only a handful of executives, while on Wall Street, the benefit would apply to many more workers. “This has been a topic of conversation among those of us who are involved in designing and administrating compensation plans,” said Brian Foley, a pay consultant in White Plains, N.Y. “But I really would be surprised if anyone went down this path. This is a bounce-back year in terms of bonuses going up and probably not the time to draw attention to yourself.” Wall Street firms pay out billions of dollars in bonuses each year. In good years top executives can receive bonuses worth tens of millions of dollars. Even midlevel financial workers often earn above $250,000 a year, and they receive most of their compensation as bonuses paid early in the new year. Extending the tax cuts for all Americans with taxable income over $250,000 for joint filers ($200,000 for single filers) would cost the country about $40 billion next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and it would cost $700 billion over the next decade. Currently the highest rate for taxable income is 35 percent; that would increase to 39.6 percent if the Bush tax cuts expire this year. The top five Wall Street firms have put aside nearly $90 billion for total pay this year, and they are expected to raise that amount using their end of year earnings. That would make this year one of the best ever for bank pay. As Mr. Foley said, much of the focus within banks is on the appearance of the payouts. Several senior banking executives received either no bonuses or modest ones in recent years, and with the taxpayer-financed bailouts receding, top executives are pushing to be paid well again. Some compensation consultants have been helping their clients devise new labels for the pay that are less likely to inflame the public. For instance, some banks are considering reducing the amount of their payouts that are labeled as bonuses, and instead shifting some to other categories like “long-term incentives.” Depending on how banks structure this part of the payout package, it might not represent much of a change for bankers, since it has long been standard practice to tie up some pay for a few years for retention purposes. But, some bankers said, the goal was to make the dollar amounts appear less offensive. Bankers are also discussing speeding up the way they award company stock. Many banks pay a substantial portion of bonuses in stock, rather than cash, and companies often have a multiyear delay between when those shares are awarded and when the employees can sell them. The tax bill does not come due until employees sell the shares, or own them outright. Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who helped oversee the Treasury Department’s rules on compensation at bailed-out companies, said he would look carefully at footnotes in company filings to see if they accelerated executives’ stock awards. “Even companies who pay in stock instead of cash can structure it to be taxed at this year’s rates,” Mr. Jackson said. “If it does happen, it may be a little tricky to see.” It is not uncommon for Wall Street to consider the tax consequences of its pay practices. Private firms like hedge funds often let workers choose when they’re paid. And until about a decade ago, Goldman allowed its partners to decide whether they received their bonuses in December or January. Back then, Goldman was an investment bank, and like other former investment banks, it closed its books at the end of November, making it easier to pay earlier. One of the challenges for the banks in paying bonuses early would be coming out with exact amounts before the year is over and before they determine their final earnings — a lengthy process. Banks have in the past found ways to get around rules, or make their workers’ pay look lower than it actually was. For instance, a year ago Goldman capped the pay of all of its London workers at £1 million each. But last summer, Goldman made it up to its partners in Britain, albeit quietly. The bank made dozens of multimillion-dollar stock grants to its partners there, according to a person briefed on their pay. Credit Suisse, in similar form, paid its British bankers summer cash bonuses to make up for their lower pay last year.</text></article>

Is Sergey Aleynikov an evil computer scientist who brazenly stole valuable, closely guarded trading code from Goldman Sachs, his former employer? Or is he a humble Russian immigrant who, upon leaving his programming post at Goldman for a higher-paying job, innocuously took some open-source code with him on his way out the door? Those dueling depictions were on display on Tuesday in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where Mr. Aleynikov is on trial on charges that he stole computer source code used in high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs. The case is expected to shine a spotlight on high-frequency trading, an increasingly important driver of profit at investment banks and hedge funds. The trial is also a test of the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov in July 2009 after Goldman reported the suspected theft to authorities. Free on bail since his arrest, the 40-year-old Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of stealing trade secrets. ''This is a case about greed and theft,'' said Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States attorney, during the government's opening statement. Mr. Facciponti told the jury that the evidence would show that Mr. Aleynikov knew that making off with crucial parts of Goldman's trading code would help his new employer, Teza Technologies, a new high-frequency trading firm started by a former executive at the Citadel Investment Group, the large Chicago hedge fund. Mr. Aleynikov was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever in how he went about'' stealing Goldman's code, which ''allows the bank to make lightning-fast trades in markets around the world,'' Mr. Facciponti said. The computer programs form the building blocks of high-frequency trading and power an important part of Goldman's business, he said. The prosecutor likened Goldman's protection of its high-frequency trading code to Coca-Cola's guarding of its secret formula for Coke. (What would a trade secrets case be without an allusion to Coke's secret formula?) Kevin Marino, the defense lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, spent much of his opening statement acknowledging that his client undoubtedly -- and foolishly -- violated Goldman's confidentiality policy in downloading code from the firm's computers. But he repeatedly emphasized that this breach was not a criminal act. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime,'' Mr. Marino said, raising his voice for dramatic effect. Mr. Marino also focused on the issue of intent. He said that in downloading open-source code from the firm's computers, Mr. Aleynikov never intended to harm Goldman's business -- a crucial element of proving that a trade-secrets crime was committed. As far as the proprietary code his client took, Mr. Aleynikov did not intend to steal that from Goldman, he said. Attempting to humanize Mr. Aleynikov, Mr. Marino described a meeting between Mr. Aleynikov and his new employer. During that meeting, in which Mr. Aleynikov is alleged to have shared Goldman's secret code, Mr. Marino said his client was using his computer to play a satire of a Russian folk song about how programmers are married to their jobs and not their wives. ''A little sad, but hardly subversive,'' he said. Mr. Marino got himself into trouble with Judge Denise L. Cote when he twice suggested that this case should be a civil matter and that Goldman could have sued Mr. Aleynikov instead of referring the case to criminal authorities. Visibly upset, Judge Cote interjected both times and instructed the jury to disregard those remarks. At the conclusion of the lawyers' opening statement, the judge reminded the jurors that ''this is a criminal trial'' and the defendant has been accused of violating federal laws. The trial puts mighty Goldman Sachs in the unusual role of victim. A Goldman spokesman and a lawyer from the firm sat in the back row of the spectators' gallery. The spokesman declined to comment on the case, but said the firm would have a representative present for the duration of the trial. The government has requested that portions of the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, be closed to spectators because of the confidential nature of certain testimony. Judge Cote has said she favors an open courtroom and will consider specific requests from the prosecution as the trial progresses.

As a start, Goldman restated its financial results for the third quarter, giving better insight into how much revenue its hedge fund, real estate and private equity operations generated, among other things. This initial disclosure was short of details on Goldman's business, however. Some revenue appears to have simply been reallocated to different business lines. ''It remains to be seen how much detail we'll get,'' said Jim Sinegal, an analyst with Morningstar who covers the banking industry. ''It's still going to be difficult to figure out exactly what they're doing, but it's a step in the right direction,'' he said, noting that ''almost any additional disclosure would be an improvement.'' In a 63-page report on Tuesday, Goldman listed 39 ways to amend its business practices - changes largely aimed at bolstering internal controls and disclosure. Goldman is trying to rehabilitate its public image, which has taken a beating since the financial crisis and its aftermath. The greater detail is intended as a response to criticism that Goldman has put its own interests ahead of those of clients. Goldman clients have complained that ''in some circumstances the firm weighs its interests and short-term incentives too heavily,'' the report said. The report proposes to break down what Goldman sees as its responsibilities, depending on the role it is performing for a client. The bank also plans to offer investors additional insight into its trading revenue, which is among its more secretive practices and an area where the bank's interests do not always align with that of its clients. The bank said it planned to provide enhanced details of whether revenue was coming from trades made on behalf of a client, or only for itself. Yet Goldman is by no means transforming its business. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' And how the report will be received within Goldman is not yet clear. The proposed changes might take time to seep in at the bank, said Kimberly Scott, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who focuses on organizational change. ''All eyes are going to be on what Goldman's leaders and managers are doing and saying,'' said Ms. Scott, who has been a management consultant for more than 15 years. ''If there's any kind of mixed message at all, it will be an uphill battle.'' Goldman's new financial statements, based on Tuesday's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, will expand to include a fourth business line. Goldman currently reports three business lines: investment banking, trading and principal investments, and asset management and securities services. In the future, investors will see investment banking, institutional client services, investing and lending, and investment management. The most noticeable and important change is the creation of a segment called investing and lending. The new category, among other things, sheds more light on the firm's hedge fund, private equity and real estate operations, analysts say. According to the S.E.C. filing, the group notched revenue of nearly $1.8 billion in the third quarter, or about 20 percent of overall revenue. Yet the new institutional client services segment, with nearly $4.7 billion of revenue, is clouded in mystery. About $2.7 billion of its revenue is part of the fixed-income, currency and commodities trading business, or F.I.C.C., Goldman's largest business and one about which it provides very little detail. Nonetheless, Goldman's report could ease some of the public scrutiny facing the bank, according to one public relations consultant. ''You absolutely have to demonstrate, especially to regulators and legislators, that you are taking action,'' said Eric Dezenhall, who runs a crisis management firm in Washington. Goldman on Tuesday took ''baby steps'' in the right direction, he said. ''Imagine what would happen if they didn't do it.''

But the Wall Street firm’s reorganization of how it reports earnings also serves its own purposes. It makes valuing the firm a bit easier by enabling a better sum-of-the-parts analysis than was previously possible.Let’s start with institutional client services, the segment that houses all Goldman’s trading and market-making for clients and accounts for about 60 percent of the firm’s revenue. Being newly scrubbed of any outright proprietary or prop trading means it’s reasonable to compare this with a firm like Knight Capital. Sure, Goldman’s business is larger, but it also probably takes more risk. On Knight’s valuation multiple of around 11.5 times estimated 2010 earnings Goldman’s unit is worth an eye-popping $59 billion. Now for investment management. The division is worth about $9.5 billion if ascribed BlackRock’s price-to-estimated earnings ratio of just under 19 times. Goldman’s investment bank group, meanwhile, is arguably comparable to the financial sector specialist Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, and on that firm’s valuation multiple Goldman’s market-leading franchise is worth about $21.5 billion. All in, that’s $90 billion, or $3.5 billion more than Goldman’s market value on Tuesday. On this back-of-the-envelope analysis, which annualizes Goldman’s pretax earnings for the first nine months of last year and assumes a flat 33 percent tax rate, that suggests shareholders are ascribing no value to the firm’s prop businesses, which are now collected under the investing and lending heading. That’s despite commanding the highest pretax margin of any business line at the firm — almost 50 percent. This valuation also ignores a collection of investments that Goldman reckons are currently worth about $15 billion. It’s reasonable for investors to be cautious of proprietary risk-taking. And client trading can cause losses, too. Being deemed worthless may be a blow to the unit’s ego. But it serves Goldman’s purpose well. Even if the new regulation known as the Volcker Rule were to kill off all its prop activities, the firm’s stock shouldn’t take a hit: it’s already trading at around fair value. That’s fodder for a bullish view of Goldman’s shares. The iPhone Winner Apple has again turned iPhone buzz into gold. Despite all the talk of possible bells and whistles, Verizon Wireless so far looks to be offering the smartphone on terms roughly similar to AT&amp;T’s. The only clear winners will be Apple’s masters of hype. Some AT&amp;T customers might want to switch to Verizon Wireless. But that could cost them. Only a third of AT&amp;T’s iPhone customers have contracts that expire this year, according to UBS. Others would have to pay up to $325 in termination fees and least $199 for a new iPhone from Verizon Wireless, because the two networks run on different standards. As for Verizon Wireless’s customers, they will now get a chance to carry an Apple device. But they will pay much the same as AT&amp;T users. And for Verizon Wireless itself, mass adoption of the iPhone wouldn’t come cheap. Like AT&amp;T, it will subsidize every iPhone to the tune of perhaps $400 upfront for customers with a two-year contract. Furthermore, the handset encourages heavy data use, which in turn demands investment in cell towers and other infrastructure. Add up the burden, and the operators may not even cover their cost of capital. AT&amp;T’s newer customers pay more for downloading more data, which can change this calculus. Yet Verizon Wireless may swallow the cost of sticking with all-you-can-eat plans, at least for a while, to win over customers. Apple is therefore the most obvious beneficiary. Verizon Wireless brings it more than 90 million possible new iPhone users — potentially at the expense of rival smartphone makers. And both AT&amp;T and Verizon Wireless will now have to spend heavily to advertise the iPhone. Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, and his cohorts have already benefited from the chatter surrounding something that, for any other company, would be a routine product line extension. Investors, at least, may have caught on. With the much anticipated announcement now out in the open, Apple’s stock dipped just a fraction on Tuesday. But shares in both AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications, the wireless unit’s controlling shareholder, were down approaching 2 percent.

Regulation<date>Published: January 12, 2011</date><text>Harry Campbell Facebook's sale of private shares to Goldman Sachs's private clients is a Rorschach test. Commentators who think that there is too much regulation have asserted, not surprisingly, that Sarbanes-Oxley and increased United States regulation of public companies deterred Facebook from going ahead with an initial public offering this year. The truth is much more complex. Since Sarbanes-Oxley was enacted in 2002, Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission have actually liberalized the regulatory regime for companies when they go public, in some cases arguably too far. But the outcry in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley was that overregulation had shut down the I.P.O. market. The most prominent evidence cited was that foreign companies were no longer listing in the United States. According to Dealogic, three foreign companies listed on an American stock exchange in 2003 compared with 75 in 2000, the height of the Internet bubble. Sarbanes-Oxley probably did deter foreign companies from listing in the United States, if not for the actual regulation than for bad public relations. But the bad economy at the time was most likely the primary reason for the dearth of I.P.O's. Immense pressure was on the S.E.C. to lure back foreign offerings by liberalizing the regulatory regime applicable to domestic and foreign companies alike. The commission repeatedly acted to reduce the regulatory requirements on foreign companies. The S.E.C. revised its accounting rules to permit use of international accounting standards by foreign issuers and to freely permit these companies to leave the American markets if they thought United States regulation was too burdensome. The S.E.C. also responded more broadly to reduce regulation, particularly that imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley, on all public companies. Among other actions, the commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board made compliance significantly easier with respect to Section 404, the requirement that auditors must certify the validity of a company's internal controls. Section 404 is often cited as Sarbanes-Oxley's most significant burden. And in the Dodd-Frank act, Congress eliminated the requirement to comply with Section 404 for companies with a market value of less than $75 million and directed the S.E.C. to look at removing the restriction for companies with a market capitalization of up to $250 million. The Supreme Court also provided help, by making it significantly harder to sue public companies for securities fraud in several cases. The net result is that regulation for all public companies in the United States is in some cases lighter than before Sarbanes-Oxley. And despite the rhetoric, the evidence on which this liberalization was based was quite mixed. In one study, Robert Bartlett, a Berkeley law professor, found that the overwhelming majority of companies bought by private equity firms still voluntarily complied with the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley in order to issue debt to finance these acquisitions. In other words, investors liked the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, and companies willingly complied when they did not need to. Others argued that the decline of the I.P.O. market was largely unrelated to Sarbanes-Oxley. Grant Thornton, an accounting and consulting firm, has ably detailed in a report why there was a significant drop in small-issuer I.P.O.'s starting in 1997. Grant Thornton asserts that the reason is actually a result of changes in market structure. Decimalization - pricing stocks in cents rather than fractions - took profits out of trading that had previously given incentive to brokers to list small companies. New order-handling rules and the rise of online brokers similarly reduced incentives. The result is that in 1996, the number of I.P.O.'s raising less than $25 million was 309, which declined to nine by 2001, a year before Sarbanes-Oxley, and was only 13 in 2010, according to Dealogic. The flight of foreign companies could be attributed in large part to the development of mature markets elsewhere. Last year, according to Dealogic, Asia will for the first time lead the I.P.O. market with $147 billion worth of issuances, compared with $44.4 billion for the United States and $39.1 billion for all of Europe.</text></article>

The Deal Professor offers a guide to understanding the legal issues surrounding the deal. STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF LOWERED EXPECTATIONS Nielsen Holdings, the television ratings and consumer measurement company, is tempering expectations ahead of its initial public offering. According to an amended version of its prospectus, filed on Monday, Nielsen expects to price its shares at $20 to $22. At the midpoint of that range, Nielsen will raise $1.5 billion -- a significant step down from its previous estimate late last year of $2 billion. Under the terms of the deal, underwriters also have the option to buy an additional 10.7 million shares. And if that option is fully exercised, Nielsen will increase its total fund-raising to about $1.7 billion. EVELYN M. RUSLI SPINOFF Morgan Stanley announced on Monday that it would part ways with its in-house quantitative trading unit by the end of 2012. The new firm will be called PDT Advisors, derived from its original name as the Process Driven Trading unit. The company, in which Morgan is expected to maintain a stake, will be headed by Peter Muller, above. BIG INVESTMENT Square, a mobile payments company, announced Monday that it had raised $27.5 million in a new round of financing led by Sequoia Capital. The deal, which includes several private and strategic investors-- like Khosla Ventures and Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's chief executive -- values the start-up at $240 million, according to a person close to the deal.

The Wall Street investment bank, which has been criticized for putting its own interests ahead of clients', plans to detail new rules around disclosure and financial reporting on Tuesday, as suggested by the study. The rules are aimed at bolstering internal controls, improving transparency and burnishing its reputation. But whether the report will result in any meaningful change or give investors a deep look inside Goldman's opaque trading operations remains an open question, according to one analyst. ''We have all worked at companies where you get these memos. A memo only goes so far,'' said a Credit Agricole Securities analyst, Michael Mayo. ''But it may help define some of the gray areas, and it could incrementally help perception and show clients they are trying to gain more control of the situation.'' The changes, set to be released in a 63-page internal report, are the findings of an internal review into the firm's business practices, broad parts of which were analyzed by The New York Times and appeared in DealBook. In the document, Goldman outlines several modifications to its operations, including enhancing its quarterly financial reports and clearly detailing its specific role in transactions. The firm also said it would strengthen standards in so-called structured products, the complicated investments that got a bad name during the financial crisis. But Goldman is not transforming its business, it is just making adjustments, which many expected when the chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, announced the review at the company's annual meeting in May. In fact, parts of the report reiterate longstanding principles of the firm, including the top one: ''Our clients' interests always come first.'' The internal review was begun just a month after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against Goldman, which claimed the bank omitted crucial facts about its role in developing a subprime mortgage security in which investors lost millions. The bank, which did not admit wrongdoing, settled with the S.E.C. in July and agreed to pay $550 million. But the agreement did not call for an independent monitor to oversee Goldman's business practices. Unprompted by the agency, the firm initiated the review in May. The committee that led the study consisted only of Goldman executives, including E. Gerald Corrigan and J. Michael Evans, a rising star and possible successor to Mr. Blankfein. As part of the process, the committee conducted hundreds of interviews with staff members. It also hired two consulting firms, which reached out to Goldman clients. Some complained that the investment bank should be more forthcoming about its role in transactions. While much of the feedback from clients was ''flattering,'' Mr. Evans said, the firm was also told there was room for improvement, particularly in the areas of transparency and communication. The report includes 39 recommendations, approved by the board in December. On Monday, Mr. Blankfein briefed Goldman partners, including senior managers, in a closed-door, offsite meeting in Connecticut. ''We believe the recommendations of the committee will strengthen the firm's culture in an increasingly complex environment,'' the report concluded. ''In particular, our approach must be: not just 'can we' undertake a given business activity, but 'should we.' '' The committee in its report tries to address longstanding concerns that Goldman is rife with conflicts of interest. Clients have often complained that they do not know where the firm stands on a deal, whether it is simply as facilitator or an interested party with a stake in the potential profits. In response to such criticisim, the firm plans to articulate its responsibilities in a particular transaction, say as an underwriter, developing an initial public offering; a market maker, assisting in the buying and selling of a specific stock; or as an investor, taking a piece of the action. Such revelations should help Goldman avoid the issues raised by the S.E.C. in its civil fraud case. In its complaint, the agency contended that Goldman, in creating a mortgage investment known as Abacus 2007-AC1, did not disclose that a hedge fund helped pick the underlying securities. ''It is important to articulate clearly both to our people and to clients the specific roles we assume in each case,'' Goldman said in the report. Even so, the recommendations are not likely to affect deals like Goldman's recent move to sell $1.5 billion worth of Facebook shares to its wealthy clients. In its pitch, the firm failed to disclose that a powerful unit within Goldman passed on buying a $450 million stake in the social networking behemoth. The firm later took the investment on its own balance sheet, which it revealed publicly. When the firm announces its fourth-quarter profits next week, Goldman is also aiming to be more transparent about its results and risk management, according to people with knowledge of the changes who could not speak publicly on the matter. The bank, for example, is increasing the segments for which it reports revenue to four units from three, potentially giving investors a deeper look at its operations. Still, some changes are at the margin. As part of the committee's recommendations, the firm will move certain underwriting and origination activities to the investment banking group from the securities division - a move mainly designed to streamline workflow. The report also restates its 14 existing principles. ''Goldman Sachs has one reputation,'' the report said. ''It can be affected by any number of decisions and activities across the firm. Every employee has an equal obligation to raise issues or concerns, no matter how small, to protect the firm's reputation.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Lloyd C.

The firm’s nearly $2 billion investment connection with Facebook is relatively small financially, but it’s big in franchise terms. After the lumps Goldman took last year, the deal showed the firm could still wrap its tentacles around an important client for mutual benefit.Goldman could still lose money on the deal for its shareholders, partners and clients. And questions remain as to whether its plan to invest $450 million of its own capital alongside $1.5 billion from others through a single investment entity violates the spirit of Securities Exchange Act disclosure rules. That means there’s still a chance the deal could backfire financially or in the realm of public opinion. But taking calculated risks is what separates Goldman from run-of-the-mill competitors. The Facebook effort also involved stitching its sometimes conflicting strands of business into a fabric that suited a priority customer. That’s a way both to fend off rivals and to mitigate risk in the deal. The Goldman coup surely started with an investment banking relationship with Facebook’s executives and its board, including the early venture capital supporters Peter Thiel and Jim Breyer. Other banks can do that, too, however. So something more was required: capital. Even without the backing of some of its in-house money managers, Goldman found the cash. Its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, carved out a slice of the balance sheet — a bold call given that many bank executives are paralyzed trying to figure out the impact of regulatory changes on proprietary investments. Moreover, Goldman’s Silicon Valley bankers enlisted the private wealth management division to bring in customers as investors. That doesn’t just generate fees, it allows Goldman to boast that it brings clients deals other banks can’t match. The firm’s powerful network of alumni also played a role. Digital Sky Technologies, a Facebook shareholder that’s investing at least $50 million more, counts former partners of the bank among its executives. There are other tentacles poised for the future, too. Goldman will probably take Facebook public eventually, for a juicy fee. And its private bank may make new customers of the social network’s founders and employees when that happens. The likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse should be wondering whether and how they can coordinate their various appendages on such A-list deals so successfully. Balancing Act Commodities markets should like economic growth. Yet despite positive data from Germany and the United States, prices are wobbling. The problem is that oil, food and metals prices have all thrived on a weak dollar, cheap money and inflows into real rather than financial assets. Recovery, a firmer dollar and higher interest rates are giving investors more to think about. There could be a lot of volatility ahead. This week’s lurches come at the end of a superstrong run. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB commodity index jumped 10 percent in December, taking its annual rise for 2010 to 15 percent. Commodities were ripe for a correction. But their fall may signal more than that. Dollar weakness and central bank money printing helped lift a broad range of commodities, as well as gold, last year. Hedge funds made hay with trades that shorted the dollar and went long on commodities. Steep price gains had a marked speculative element. Now, however, a dollar rally looks on. Yields on Treasuries have risen strongly since October, making dollar assets more appealing. The euro zone periphery crisis is another reason to switch out of the single currency and into the dollar. As the dollar rises, commodities, which are priced in dollars, tend to fall. But the influence of real levels of supply and demand must also be taken into account. Real demand for many commodities should be well supported if global growth is indeed firm. Yet stronger growth, too, has its negative side. Inflation is up in China, India and even the euro zone. Asia has already seen interest rate rises. The liquidity taps that provided investors with cheap money are closing. Stronger growth, but probably a stronger dollar, higher global inflation and interest rates, and perhaps less liquidity: that sums up the countervailing forces in commodity markets in 2011. The tide of money that surged into commodities last year may no longer flow so reliably.

In 1964, regulators started requiring companies with more than 499 shareholders to publicly report their financial results. It is a rule that has been debated from the outset - and the issues raised now are the same ones raised then. The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining the frenzied buying and selling of Facebook shares and other private technology companies in the secondary market. To some, the structure of the Goldman deal merely looks like a way to circumvent the law. Through a special purpose vehicle, the firm could potentially pool money from thousands of wealthy clients and still be considered one investor because the entity would be managed by Goldman. Section 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 came about in the 1960s as over-the-counter trading in shares of privately held companies began to heat up and regulators worried that investors were not getting enough information. A special study from that period found that the ''disclosures voluntarily made by unlisted companies left a great deal to be desired,'' according to a speech by the S.E.C. commissioner at the time, Hugh F. Owens, given before the Practicing Law Institute in New York in 1964. ''Not only did the volume of information delivered to shareholders vary considerably, but the candor with which it was presented was highly variable,'' he said in the speech. ''They involve thousands of corporations and hundreds of thousands of investors. The Securities Acts Amendments of 1964 effectively remove the distinction, which has existed as to a large number of the companies whose securities are traded over-the-counter.'' That is the same sort of issue facing regulators now, with shares in Facebook trading at a frenetic pace on the secondary market. The announcement that Goldman will use a special purpose vehicle to raise and invest $1.5 billion in the company - money collected from a variety of wealthy individuals - has only intensified the scrutiny. In practice, a large fund that represents hundreds or thousands of individuals can be considered a single record holder. ''So long as Goldman is the sole decision maker for all investors it's irrelevant,'' said Eleazer Klein, a partner at the law firm Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel. Even so, questions remain about whether such a deal may stray from the spirit of the law while adhering to its letter. ''Whether something is done primarily to circumvent the rules is a philosophical question,'' Mr. Klein said. ''There is a natural tension between being allowed to structure something in a manner that complies with the law and at the same point circumvents the law.'' How did the government come up with the 500-shareholder limit, a threshold that over the years has been called both too high and too low? The government did not want to subject small companies with limited shareholders to the costs of regulation and compliance. At the same time, regulators did not want to allow large companies with a multitude of investors to reap the benefits of public financing without disclosure and registration. Ultimately, lawyers say the number was picked arbitrarily. Scientific or not, it all comes back to investor protection. One issue today is whether wealthy investors - like those who will participate in the Goldman deal - need the same protection as smaller investors. There are plenty of examples where the government has determined that they do not, as with hedge funds and private equity investments. ''We've lowered the bar for certain types of investors that we felt need less protection,'' said Christian Leuz, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''But maybe what we've learned in recent years after the financial crisis is that sophisticated doesn't always mean high net worth.'' Although the 500-investor threshold has long been the subject of debate, start-ups like Google raised it to a new level in the last decade. Many private technology companies reward and attract talent by offering stock options or shares in the company. Those employee-owned shares typically do not count toward the 500-investor limit. But once those shares are sold on a private exchange - often after employees leave the company - they are no longer exempt. Venture capital firms, too, divest shares in the secondary market. The development of this changing dynamic has only complicated the numbers game. ''Prior to that, it was pretty easy to maintain less than 500 shareholders,'' said Adam C. Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTOS: Hugh F.

Goldman Sachs Capital Partners - a group that manages and invests for pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other prominent clients - was given the initial opportunity to invest $450 million in Facebook, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Goldman gives the ''first look'' on many investment opportunities to the $20.3 billion fund. While most of the group's clients are big institutions, the investors also include current and former Goldman partners. But the unit's head, Richard A. Friedman, a longtime Goldman partner, decided the Facebook deal was not suitable for his clients, in part owing to the high valuation and to a mismatch with his investment criteria. The $450 million investment values the Web company at $50 billion. After Goldman's deal, some industry experts cautioned that Facebook's growth would need to accelerate rapidly over the next couple of years to justify such a steep price - a risk with many brand-name technology upstarts. Last year, Facebook recorded revenue of approximately $2 billion, with roughly $400 million in profit, according to people briefed on the company's results. That is up from $220 million in earnings on $770 million in sales in 2009. After Mr. Friedman passed, the Wall Street bank itself made the $450 million Facebook investment, taking the deal on its balance sheet. (About $75 million of that amount is coming from an internal hedge fund, Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, according to a person who reviewed the offering memorandum sent to investors.) The firm is trying to sell $1.5 billion more of shares in the company to wealthy clients - a deal that is expected to be oversubscribed when it closes this week, as early as Thursday, these people said. All Goldman partners will also be able to invest in this fund. Goldman, knowing the deal had the potential to draw regulatory attention, briefed the Securities and Exchange Commission before making the offer to wealthy individuals, according to people with knowledge of the conversation who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The agency is currently looking at trading in private technology companies like Facebook. The S.E.C. declined to comment. The decision by Mr. Friedman, who holds a seat on the firm's vaunted management committee, has raised concerns among some of Goldman's most sophisticated clients who have been pitched on Facebook in recent days. Several wealthy individuals approached about the offering said they had declined, in part, because of Mr. Friedman's rejection. The clients spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear that making a public comment would hurt their relationship with Goldman and their opportunity to have access to future investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Friedman did not return a call. People briefed on Mr. Friedman's decision said he was concerned about Facebook's $50 billion valuation and the terms of the deal. Goldman Sachs Capital Partners frequently likes to take large positions in companies with expectations of holding them for several years or even longer. A $450 million investment in Facebook would have represented less than 1 percent of the firm. One person briefed on the discussions with Mr. Friedman, however, said he would have ''thrown out'' his typical investment philosophy if he had believed a Facebook investment was an ''easy home run.'' Goldman's critics have long complained that the firm puts its own interests ahead of clients. In the Facebook deal, Goldman is investing $450 million, at an implied $50 billion valuation. However, Goldman clients are paying a 4 percent placement fee and a 0.5 percent expense reserve fee for their shares, as well as giving up 5 percent of gains. That means Facebook would need to be worth closer to $60 billion before they make any money. Beside those fees, Goldman is likely to earn additional money from ancillary business - with the biggest victory coming from an eventual initial public offering, perhaps as soon as 2012.</text></article>

On first blush, the answer would appear to be no. After all, in May 2009, the company was valued at $10 billion. Last August, Facebook was valued at $27 billion and now it's $50 billion - for a company with a reported $2 billion in revenue and negligible profits. If General Electric, with 2010 revenue of around $150 billion, traded at a similar multiple of revenue, it would be worth $3.75 trillion instead of $200 billion. Facebook is now considered to be worth more than Time Warner, DuPont and Goldman's rival Morgan Stanley. Just last week, Facebook's shares were said to be trading on a private-market exchange at a valuation of $42.4 billion. Thanks to Goldman's imprimatur, Facebook's value increased 20 percent virtually overnight. Can Goldman really expect to squeeze more water from this stone? Sadly, yes. To understand why, we have to go to the heart of the many problems in the way the Wall Street cartel does business, despite the promised reforms of the Dodd-Frank law. With Goldman's investment in Facebook, we have a front-row seat to the process by which Wall Street creates and inflates financial bubbles. This bout of hysteria involves not only Facebook but other Internet companies including Twitter, the gaming site Zynga, the social buying site Groupon and LinkedIn, another social networking site. The valuation of these companies has soared in the past two years, leading some to worry that the American people bailed out Wall Street so that we could relive the Internet Bubble of 1999. Despite the high price of its investment, Goldman sees in Facebook a business bonanza, a nearly perfect nugget of investment-banking opportunities. First, Goldman's cost of capital is close to zero - as a bank holding company, it can borrow from the Federal Reserve at negligible interest rates - so any capital gain it makes on its venture in Facebook will be sheer profit. Second, Goldman has almost certainly locked up the role of lead manager of the inevitable Facebook initial public offering. Fees for underwriting public offerings are generally about 7 percent of the value of the stock sold. Facebook could easily sell $2 billion of stock or more, generating fees to Goldman and the other underwriters of at least $140 million. The other benefit for Goldman in leading the public offering - aside from major bragging rights - is that it can use its marketing, sales and distribution muscle to make sure the value of Facebook at the time of the offering exceeds the $50 billion valuation at which Goldman invested. Goldman has also won from Facebook the right to offer an additional $1.5 billion of the company's stock to its private-wealth clients. According to The Times, Goldman will be creating a ''special purpose vehicle'' to sell the stock to its wealthy clients and then will charge them a 4 percent initial fee plus 5 percent of any profits. While on paper it seems that these high rollers would be foolish to invest in Facebook at such a lofty valuation, they will still most certainly feel increased loyalty to Goldman for making such an exclusive opportunity available to them. On top of it all, there is the increased likelihood that Goldman will get to manage a good portion of the $12 billion fortune belonging to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's founder, for yet more fees. If Goldman does take all these roles at once - investor, salesman, money manager, I.P.O. underwriter - it would certainly raise the ugly specter of conflicts of interest. But probably not to Goldman executives, who have always prided themselves on being able to ''manage'' through such situations. (In fairness, there's likely no investment-banking firm on the planet that would not eagerly take Goldman's place in this scheme, if offered the chance.) Even though Facebook is reported to have little need for Goldman's money, having Goldman validate Facebook's exponential increase in value gives Mr. Zuckerberg the ultimate Silicon Valley street cred, far more than he got from having Hollywood make a movie about him or from becoming the youngest billionaire on the planet. With all these winners, who will the losers be? The average investor, of course, who will get left holding the bag when, someday, Wall Street realizes the firm's financial performance doesn't live up to its hyped valuation.

    <article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E1D81538F937A35752C0A9679D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Facebook Deal Offers Freedom From Scrutiny<date>Published: January 4, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO - In Silicon Valley, going public used to be the ultimate rite of passage for a start-up - a sign it had arrived. No more. With its $500 million infusion from Goldman Sachs and other investors, Facebook is now flush with cash, and a market value of about $50 billion, giving it the financial muscle it needs to compete with better-heeled rivals like Google. And Facebook hopes for an even bigger advantage from the deal, the ability to delay an initial public offering. That would allow it to remain free of government regulation and from the volatility of Wall Street. It would also allow Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, to retain near absolute control over the company he co-founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004. This strategy was unthinkable in Silicon Valley just a few years ago, when hundreds of start-ups with scant revenue and no profits, like Pets.com and Webvan, raced to go public, and investors eagerly lined up to buy their shares. Lots of people would stand in line to buy shares in Facebook, but for now, only an exclusive few - wealthy clients of Goldman Sachs - will be able to. On Monday, Goldman e-mailed certain clients, offering them the chance to invest in the company. That offer is the latest sign of the emergence of active markets in the shares of closely held companies. Those markets are helping successful start-ups like Facebook develop the financial wherewithal to compete in the big leagues of business. They have also become an avenue for venture capitalists and start-up employees to cash in their stock, turning many overworked engineers into instant millionaires. And so a young mogul like Mr. Zuckerberg, the world's youngest billionaire at age 26, can enjoy many of the benefits of going public without having to tie the knot with Wall Street. Other hot technology companies like Twitter, Zynga and Groupon are also tapping secondary markets to keep stock market investors at bay. They are in no rush to go public and no longer need the bragging rights that a stock offering used to bestow. ''This is a topsy-turvy world,'' said Scott Dettmer, a founding partner of Gunderson Dettmer, a law firm that has advised venture capitalists, start-ups and entrepreneurs since the 1980s. He added that even a few years ago, ''there were all sorts of business reasons to go public, but for entrepreneurs it was also a badge of honor.'' Perhaps more than any company founder, Mr. Zuckerberg, who declined to comment for this article, has frequently expressed his disinterest in Wall Street, though Facebook is clearly not above taking its cash. He passed on opportunities to make a killing, for example, when, at age 22, he rejected billion-dollar offers for Facebook. ''Mark would absolutely prefer not have an I.P.O. until he absolutely has to,'' said David Kirkpatrick, the author of ''The Facebook Effect.'' ''He absolutely doesn't want to sacrifice control because he believes that his vision is necessary to keep powering the company forward.'' Mr. Zuckerberg's quest to keep Facebook private, though, will not last forever. Federal regulations require companies with 500 or more investors to disclose their financial results, eliminating one of the principal advantages of staying private. The Goldman Sachs investment, for a stake of less than 1 percent in the company, is formulated in part to skirt those rules. But it may help for only a limited amount of time. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating private company trades in secondary markets, and regulators may decide that what is good for Facebook is not necessarily good for the investing public. Still, the huge cash infusion is a coup both for Mr. Zuckerberg, who is said to own about a quarter of the company, and Facebook. The deal gives the company cash to hire employees or build data centers. It also puts Facebook, which makes most of its money through advertising, on a path to surpass Google, by some measures, as the most successful Internet company to come out of Silicon Valley. Facebook is on track to bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue this year.</text></article>

In investing $450 million in the social networking giant, Goldman has established itself as the leading candidate to win the lucrative and prestigious assignment of Facebook's initial public offering, whenever that day comes. It also positions itself to reap millions of dollars in banking fees. Goldman has already begun the process of wooing its wealthy clients to invest alongside it in Facebook, forming an investment vehicle that seeks to raise as much $1.5 billion for the Internet company. But Goldman's bold move is also likely to focus the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which last month began an inquiry into the surge in trading shares of privately held Internet companies. While the investment by Goldman is being hailed as a huge coup on Wall Street, the deal - in particular the investment pool being formed for its clients - could become a lightning rod for regulators and policy makers as they examine the growing shadow market in Facebook shares. For Goldman, the investment in Facebook is in many ways a return to the firm's roots. Long before Facebook became a social and cultural phenomenon, Goldman was ''friending'' America's hottest companies and their chief executives, from Sears Roebuck in the 1900s to Ford in the 1950s to eBay in the 1990s. By collecting so many important friends, and obsessively tending to those relationships, Goldman generates big fees. In addition to the potential banking fees generated by an initial public offering of Facebook, there is the billions of dollars of unlocked paper wealth realized by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's 26-year-old chief, and his fellow executives. Goldman, as a lead Facebook investor, will most likely have a leg up in winning the assignment to manage that money, too. The firm's Facebook investment came together over the last month, according to a person involved in the deal who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. After the spike in trading in Facebook over the last several months - in a November auction, Facebook shares traded at a $56 billion valuation - Mr. Zuckerberg expressed an interest in raising money to legitimize the $50 billion valuation. Mr. Zuckerberg felt that gaining the imprimatur of a major investor at such lofty levels would validate Facebook in the eyes of its Silicon Valley competitors with whom it is negotiating deals, this person said. Helping play matchmaker was Yuri Milner, chief executive of DST Global, a Russian firm that invested $50 million alongside Goldman. Goldman has a close relationship with DST and Mr. Milner, a Russian businessman who has emerged as a leading venture capital investor in Internet companies. Mail.ru, the publicly traded sibling of DST Global, has an existing stake in Facebook, as well large positions in Groupon and Zynga, two other popular Web-based businesses. Goldman was a lead underwriter of Mail.ru's successful $1 billion initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in November. The Facebook investment, made from Goldman's balance sheet, also sheds light on the firm's private equity strategy in the wake of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. Although the Facebook investment represents a negligible percentage of Goldman's roughly $900 billion balance sheet, it is symbolically significant because it had been unclear whether the firm would, after the financial crisis, be using its balance sheet to make these types of illiquid, risky investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The closest analogue to Goldman's Facebook investment may be the firm's longtime alliance with the New York fashion designer Ralph Lauren. In 1994, Mr. Lauren was looking for money to expand his business, and Goldman invested a minority stake and took a seat on the company's board. Goldman underwrote Ralph Lauren's initial public offering in 1997. Today, Mr. Lauren's company remains a loyal client of the firm. And when Mr. Lauren sold $1 billion of stock last year to cash out one-quarter of his stake in his company, Goldman handled the trade. Perhaps even more intriguing than Goldman's direct stake in Facebook is the ''special purpose vehicle'' that it is creating to allow its wealthy clients to invest in Facebook alongside the firm.</text></article>

The deal makes Facebook now worth more than companies like eBay, Yahoo and Time Warner. The stake by Goldman Sachs, considered one of Wall Street's savviest investors, signals the increasing might of Facebook, which has already been bearing down on giants like Google. The new money will give Facebook more firepower to steal away valuable employees, develop new products and possibly pursue acquisitions - all without being a publicly traded company. The investment may also allow earlier shareholders, including Facebook employees, to cash out at least some of their stakes. The new investment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commissionhas begun an inquiry into the increasingly hot private market for shares in Internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, the gaming site Zynga and LinkedIn, an online professional networking site. Some experts suggest the inquiry is focused on whether certain companies are improperly using the private market to get around public disclosure requirements. The new money could add pressure on Facebook to go public even as its executives have resisted. The popularity of shares of Microsoft and Google in the private market ultimately pressured them to pursue initial public offerings. So far, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has brushed aside the possibility of an initial public offering or a sale of the company. At an industry conference in November, he said on the topic, ''Don't hold your breath.'' However, people involved in the fund-raising effort suggest that Facebook's board has indicated an intention to consider a public offering in 2012. There has been an explosion in user interest in social media sites. The social buying site Groupon, which recently rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from Google, is in the process of raising as much as $950 million from major institutional investors, at a valuation near $5 billion, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. ''When you think back to the early days of Google, they were kind of ignored by Wall Street investors, until it was time to go public,'' said Chris Sacca, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who is a former Google employee and an investor in Twitter. ''This time, the Street is smartening up. They realize there are true growth businesses out here. Facebook has become a real business, and investors are coming out here and saying, 'We want a piece of it.''' The Facebook investment deal is likely to stir up a debate about what the company would be worth in the public market. Though it does not disclose its financial performance, analysts estimate the company is profitable and could bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue annually. Under the terms of the deal, Goldman has invested $450 million, and Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm that has already sunk about half a billion dollars into Facebook, invested $50 million, people involved in the talks said. Goldman has the right to sell part of its stake, up to $75 million, to the Russian firm, these people said. For Digital Sky Technologies, the deal means its original investment in Facebook, at a valuation of $10 billion, has gone up fivefold. Representatives for Facebook, Goldman and Digital Sky Technologies all declined to comment. Goldman's involvement means it may be in a strong position to take Facebook public when it decides to do so in what is likely to be a lucrative and prominent deal. As part of the deal, Goldman is expected to raise as much as $1.5 billion from investors for Facebook at the $50 billion valuation, people involved in the discussions said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the transaction was not supposed to be made public until the fund-raising had been completed.</text></article>

Feinberg, President Obama's former pay czar, received a lukewarm reception from Wall Street earlier this year, when he suggested that firms adopt a so-called brake provision that would allow employee compensation agreements at big banks to be broken if the government were forced to step and bail them out. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had adopted just such a brake proposal. The filing says that, if the government is forced to bail Goldman out, most of the firm's outstanding compensation awards ''shall immediately terminate.'' The move was applauded by some pay experts as a good corporate governance practice. ''Not many firms as far as I know have done this,'' said Robert J. Jackson Jr., an associate professor at Columbia Law School. ''This is another sign of Goldman's leadership on reforming pay structures, and it will be interesting to see whether other firms follow Goldman's lead.'' Mr. Jackson previously served as deputy special master for TARP executive compensation in the Treasury Department. The brake proposal followed a broad outcry over the American International Group's payout of millions of dollars in bonuses in 2009 even though the government had pumped billions of dollars into the company to rescue it the previous year. Still, there is no danger that Goldman's adoption of the provision will derail its bonuses for 2010. Goldman is thriving. It earned $5.97 billion during the first nine months of the year and put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees.

It is unlikely to be any different when the findings of Goldman’s Business Standards Committee become public early next year. But on one important point Goldman lags some big competitors — the separation of the chief executive and chairman jobs. Now it has a chance to catch up.Since May, the bank has been conducting the financial industry version of group psychoanalysis. The standards group headed by the veteran partners Gerald Corrigan and Michael Evans is scrubbing the bank’s business practices to “reinforce the firm’s client focus” and improve transparency. The firm is examining, among other things, how it manages conflicts between its own activities and those of customers, how it discloses what it does, what responsibilities it has to clients and, critically, how to inculcate a sense of professional ethics in its employees. The results are highly anticipated by more than Goldman’s 35,400 employees. Every firm on Wall Street will pore over them. The firm’s public image may have been tarnished by reams of bad press and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit — since settled — contending that the firm shortchanged some of its customers. But the bank is still considered the gold standard among its peers. So if Goldman decides, say, to exit a business because it feels it creates conflicts of interest with clients, other banks will feel pressure to do the same — or risk expending considerable energy explaining to clients why they are different. What is not obviously on the business standards agenda, though, is Goldman’s own governance. While governance is ultimately a board decision, its absence seems odd given the intensity of the soul-searching going at the firm. Goldman’s financial performance has not suffered in any obvious way from having Lloyd C. Blankfein hold both the chief executive and chairman roles. But Goldman, and specifically Mr. Blankfein, have taken quite a beating in the public arena of late. Though some of the opprobrium was undeserved, the experience should have underlined the merits of separating duties at the top of the firm. The skills that brought Mr. Blankfein the top job at a competitive securities firm that consciously avoids the retail end of the market are not necessarily the same ones that are effective in the unwanted glare of political and Main Street scrutiny. Having a seasoned chairman would have given the firm someone to navigate the shifting political and regulatory tides while Mr. Blankfein focused on the firm’s operations and employees and, most important, on its big corporate and institutional customers. Executives at banks that did separate the top two jobs — a list that includes Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — say the move paid off at the height of the recent crisis and in efforts to shape the regulatory reform bill passed by Congress. Of course, a division of responsibilities is not a substitute for strong leadership. A chairman who does a poor job of working with politicians or the media won’t be able to offer a chief executive much cover. And it is critical that the chairman and the chief executive have a consistent vision for the company, a good working relationship and complementary skills. That’s not always the case, as the British energy giant BP amply illustrated during the months it spent trying to stanch the flow of oil — and the attendant negative press coverage — from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well. Carl-Henric Svanberg earned the sobriquet of “invisible chairman” for his low profile during the fiasco. And when Mr. Svanberg did speak publicly, he did little to help the gaffe-prone chief executive, Tony Hayward, who referred to the oil leak’s victims in the gulf as “the small people.” Mr. Blankfein is no Mr. Hayward. He has the confidence of shareholders, his board and his staff, and he survived antagonistic political hearings in much better shape than Mr. Hayward, if not completely unscathed. Having steered Goldman through the financial crisis and the annus horribilis the bank’s image endured in 2010, his job looks secure. But that makes the timing right for a change in governance. The Business Standards Committee itself offers one possible candidate to step in alongside Mr. Blankfein in the form of Mr. Corrigan, a former president of the New York Federal Reserve. By proposing to add a chairman now, Goldman would avoid the common stigma of separating the two top jobs at a time of weakness. Doing so from a position of strength would set another example for its rivals. ROB COX</text></article>

The men share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable -- and controversial -- fields in finance. They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential. Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk. In theory, this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrillion-dollar market. In practice, it also defends the dominance of the big banks. The banks in this group, which is affiliated with a new derivatives clearinghouse, have fought to block other banks from entering the market, and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available. Banks' influence over this market, and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises, has costly implications for businesses large and small, like Dan Singer's home heating-oil company in Westchester County, north of New York City. This fall, many of Mr. Singer's customers purchased fixed-rate plans to lock in winter heating oil at around $3 a gallon. While that price was above the prevailing $2.80 a gallon then, the contracts will protect homeowners if bitterly cold weather pushes the price higher. But Mr. Singer wonders if his company, Robison Oil, should be getting a better deal. He uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans. But he has no idea how much lower his prices -- and his customers' prices -- could be, he says, because banks don't disclose fees associated with the derivatives. ''At the end of the day, I don't know if I got a fair price, or what they're charging me,'' Mr. Singer said. Derivatives shift risk from one party to another, and they offer many benefits, like enabling Mr. Singer to sell his fixed plans without having to bear all the risk that oil prices could suddenly rise. Derivatives are also big business on Wall Street. Banks collect many billions of dollars annually in undisclosed fees associated with these instruments -- an amount that almost certainly would be lower if there were more competition and transparent prices. Just how much derivatives trading costs ordinary Americans is uncertain. The size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments. States and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs. Airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices. Food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef. The marketplace as it functions now ''adds up to higher costs to all Americans,'' said Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said. But big banks influence the rules governing derivatives through a variety of industry groups. The banks' latest point of influence are clearinghouses like ICE Trust, which holds the monthly meetings with the nine bankers in New York. Under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, many derivatives will be traded via such clearinghouses. Mr. Gensler wants to lessen banks' control over these new institutions. But Republican lawmakers, many of whom received large campaign contributions from bankers who want to influence how the derivatives rules are written, say they plan to push back against much of the coming reform. On Thursday, the commission canceled a vote over a proposal to make prices more transparent, raising speculation that Mr. Gensler did not have enough support from his fellow commissioners. The Department of Justice is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating ''the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,'' according to a department spokeswoman.</text></article>

Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform. He was convicted on two counts - theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property - and faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a business that had been little known outside Wall Street - high-frequency trading, which uses complex computer algorithms to make lightning-fast trades to exploit tiny discrepancies in price. Such trading has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street firms and hedge funds, and those companies fiercely protect the code underpinning their trading strategies. During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman's proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the firm's high-frequency trading business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman's total revenue of $45 billion. The verdict is a victory for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the case and has recently raised its profile with its aggressive pursuit of corporate crime. It is also a victory for the Justice Department more broadly, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority. ''As today's guilty verdict demonstrates, we will use the full force of the federal law to prosecute those who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers, whether those firms are on Wall Street or Main Street,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. Until 18 months ago, Mr. Aleynikov was living the American dream. He came to the United States from Russia in 1990 with expertise in computer programming. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers. He was recruited away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a fledgling firm founded by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple his Goldman salary. During his last three days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end around the company's security systems. After discovering that he had stolen code, Goldman reported him to federal authorities. On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International airport and arrested him. There was no dispute that Mr. Aleynikov had violated Goldman's confidentiality agreements when he uploaded portions of the bank's trading code to a server in Germany. The case, then, boiled down to this: Did Mr. Aleynikov intend to steal Goldman's proprietary source code to benefit his new employer? Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, mounted a defense that tried to draw the distinction that while his client foolishly breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, he did not commit a crime. Mr. Aleynikov acknowledged uploading code but told the F.B.I. that he never intended to steal Goldman's proprietary information. Instead, he merely wanted to take some publicly available open-source code with him on the way out the door. Mr. Marino portrayed his client as a humble and hard-working Russian who came to the United States with $300 in his pocket. Mr. Aleynikov, who is separated from his wife, lives in New Jersey and has three young children. Mr. Marino ridiculed the notion that Mr. Aleynikov was taking Goldman's ''secret sauce algorithms'' and somehow hurting the banking giant. ''There's not a law in the land that makes it a crime to use of collect or download open-source code,'' said Mr. Marino during the trial. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime.'' Federal prosecutors depicted Mr. Aleynikov as a brazen crook who was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever'' in filching thousands of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code from Goldman. He sought to use that code, prosecutors argued, as the building blocks to create a hedge fund trading platform at Teza. The government's strategy was to play to the jury's basic sense of right and wrong. ''This is a case about theft and greed,'' said Joseph Facciponti, the lead prosecutor, in his opening statement. The government made much of Mr. Aleynikov's deleting and encrypting various files after he took them from Goldman's servers. ''Like a good thief, he covered his tracks, brushing aside his digital footprint,'' Rebecca Rohr, a prosecutor, said in her closing remarks. After receiving the case Thursday afternoon, the jury deliberated for three hours Friday morning. Mr. Aleynikov sat stoically as Judge Cote read the verdict. A family friend comforted Mr. Aleynikov's mother, who had watched the trial each day from the spectators' gallery. Both Mr Aleynikov and Mr. Marino, his lawyer, declined to comment. All 12 of the jurors declined to speak about the case. Before dismissing the panel, Judge Cote warned them that if they were going to speak about the case, they must not discuss anything related to Goldman's code. Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set for March 18. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Prosecutors argued that Sergey Aleynikov stole source code from Goldman to help his new firm.

    <article index="19" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/business/06bonus.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Bush Tax Cuts Weigh on Wall Street’s Bonus Season<date>Published: December 5, 2010</date><text>Congress is debating tax rates, and that has Wall Street nervously eyeing the calendar.Worried that lawmakers will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans beginning next year, financial firms are discussing whether to move up their bonus payouts from next year to this month. At stake is a portion of the hefty annual payouts that are a familiar part of the compensation culture on Wall Street, as well as a juicy target of popular anger. If Congress does not extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest income levels, a typical worker who earns a $1 million bonus would pay $40,000 to $50,000 more in taxes next year than this year, depending on base salary. Goldman Sachs is one of the companies discussing how to time bonus season, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions. Pay consultants who work with major Wall Street companies say that just about every other large bank has also considered such a move in recent weeks. With tax politics in Washington unpredictable, bank executives have spent months sketching out several options for their bonus plans, including the possibility of an earlier payout. Lawmakers have been trading accusations across a partisan divide, but after this weekend, it appears likely that a compromise will extend the tax cuts for all income levels. Even so, the banks’ discussions about bonus timing underscore how focused the industry is on protecting every dollar of pay. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. Bonus payouts are traditionally shrouded in secrecy; companies are required to disclose their top executives’ pay, but they do not disclose the size of their total bonus pools in their public filings or internally. Goldman, not surprisingly, is the canary in the coal mine. It often announces its top executives’ bonuses before other firms, and the richness of its payouts sets the tone across the industry. This year the tax debate has imposed a new wrinkle, and executives at two large banks said their companies tentatively decided not to speed payouts, unless Goldman did. Then, these two executives said, they would consider paying early as a competitive measure, so that their workers were not upset. These executives and the people briefed on the Goldman discussions spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Bonus timing is also being discussed at scores of public companies, beyond banks, for top executives who receive multimillion-dollar payouts around the turn of the year. At most companies outside the financial sector, an early bonus would help only a handful of executives, while on Wall Street, the benefit would apply to many more workers. “This has been a topic of conversation among those of us who are involved in designing and administrating compensation plans,” said Brian Foley, a pay consultant in White Plains, N.Y. “But I really would be surprised if anyone went down this path. This is a bounce-back year in terms of bonuses going up and probably not the time to draw attention to yourself.” Wall Street firms pay out billions of dollars in bonuses each year. In good years top executives can receive bonuses worth tens of millions of dollars. Even midlevel financial workers often earn above $250,000 a year, and they receive most of their compensation as bonuses paid early in the new year. Extending the tax cuts for all Americans with taxable income over $250,000 for joint filers ($200,000 for single filers) would cost the country about $40 billion next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and it would cost $700 billion over the next decade. Currently the highest rate for taxable income is 35 percent; that would increase to 39.6 percent if the Bush tax cuts expire this year. The top five Wall Street firms have put aside nearly $90 billion for total pay this year, and they are expected to raise that amount using their end of year earnings. That would make this year one of the best ever for bank pay. As Mr. Foley said, much of the focus within banks is on the appearance of the payouts. Several senior banking executives received either no bonuses or modest ones in recent years, and with the taxpayer-financed bailouts receding, top executives are pushing to be paid well again. Some compensation consultants have been helping their clients devise new labels for the pay that are less likely to inflame the public. For instance, some banks are considering reducing the amount of their payouts that are labeled as bonuses, and instead shifting some to other categories like “long-term incentives.” Depending on how banks structure this part of the payout package, it might not represent much of a change for bankers, since it has long been standard practice to tie up some pay for a few years for retention purposes. But, some bankers said, the goal was to make the dollar amounts appear less offensive. Bankers are also discussing speeding up the way they award company stock. Many banks pay a substantial portion of bonuses in stock, rather than cash, and companies often have a multiyear delay between when those shares are awarded and when the employees can sell them. The tax bill does not come due until employees sell the shares, or own them outright. Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who helped oversee the Treasury Department’s rules on compensation at bailed-out companies, said he would look carefully at footnotes in company filings to see if they accelerated executives’ stock awards. “Even companies who pay in stock instead of cash can structure it to be taxed at this year’s rates,” Mr. Jackson said. “If it does happen, it may be a little tricky to see.” It is not uncommon for Wall Street to consider the tax consequences of its pay practices. Private firms like hedge funds often let workers choose when they’re paid. And until about a decade ago, Goldman allowed its partners to decide whether they received their bonuses in December or January. Back then, Goldman was an investment bank, and like other former investment banks, it closed its books at the end of November, making it easier to pay earlier. One of the challenges for the banks in paying bonuses early would be coming out with exact amounts before the year is over and before they determine their final earnings — a lengthy process. Banks have in the past found ways to get around rules, or make their workers’ pay look lower than it actually was. For instance, a year ago Goldman capped the pay of all of its London workers at £1 million each. But last summer, Goldman made it up to its partners in Britain, albeit quietly. The bank made dozens of multimillion-dollar stock grants to its partners there, according to a person briefed on their pay. Credit Suisse, in similar form, paid its British bankers summer cash bonuses to make up for their lower pay last year.</text></article>

Is Sergey Aleynikov an evil computer scientist who brazenly stole valuable, closely guarded trading code from Goldman Sachs, his former employer? Or is he a humble Russian immigrant who, upon leaving his programming post at Goldman for a higher-paying job, innocuously took some open-source code with him on his way out the door? Those dueling depictions were on display on Tuesday in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where Mr. Aleynikov is on trial on charges that he stole computer source code used in high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs. The case is expected to shine a spotlight on high-frequency trading, an increasingly important driver of profit at investment banks and hedge funds. The trial is also a test of the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov in July 2009 after Goldman reported the suspected theft to authorities. Free on bail since his arrest, the 40-year-old Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of stealing trade secrets. ''This is a case about greed and theft,'' said Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States attorney, during the government's opening statement. Mr. Facciponti told the jury that the evidence would show that Mr. Aleynikov knew that making off with crucial parts of Goldman's trading code would help his new employer, Teza Technologies, a new high-frequency trading firm started by a former executive at the Citadel Investment Group, the large Chicago hedge fund. Mr. Aleynikov was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever in how he went about'' stealing Goldman's code, which ''allows the bank to make lightning-fast trades in markets around the world,'' Mr. Facciponti said. The computer programs form the building blocks of high-frequency trading and power an important part of Goldman's business, he said. The prosecutor likened Goldman's protection of its high-frequency trading code to Coca-Cola's guarding of its secret formula for Coke. (What would a trade secrets case be without an allusion to Coke's secret formula?) Kevin Marino, the defense lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, spent much of his opening statement acknowledging that his client undoubtedly -- and foolishly -- violated Goldman's confidentiality policy in downloading code from the firm's computers. But he repeatedly emphasized that this breach was not a criminal act. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime,'' Mr. Marino said, raising his voice for dramatic effect. Mr. Marino also focused on the issue of intent. He said that in downloading open-source code from the firm's computers, Mr. Aleynikov never intended to harm Goldman's business -- a crucial element of proving that a trade-secrets crime was committed. As far as the proprietary code his client took, Mr. Aleynikov did not intend to steal that from Goldman, he said. Attempting to humanize Mr. Aleynikov, Mr. Marino described a meeting between Mr. Aleynikov and his new employer. During that meeting, in which Mr. Aleynikov is alleged to have shared Goldman's secret code, Mr. Marino said his client was using his computer to play a satire of a Russian folk song about how programmers are married to their jobs and not their wives. ''A little sad, but hardly subversive,'' he said. Mr. Marino got himself into trouble with Judge Denise L. Cote when he twice suggested that this case should be a civil matter and that Goldman could have sued Mr. Aleynikov instead of referring the case to criminal authorities. Visibly upset, Judge Cote interjected both times and instructed the jury to disregard those remarks. At the conclusion of the lawyers' opening statement, the judge reminded the jurors that ''this is a criminal trial'' and the defendant has been accused of violating federal laws. The trial puts mighty Goldman Sachs in the unusual role of victim. A Goldman spokesman and a lawyer from the firm sat in the back row of the spectators' gallery. The spokesman declined to comment on the case, but said the firm would have a representative present for the duration of the trial. The government has requested that portions of the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, be closed to spectators because of the confidential nature of certain testimony. Judge Cote has said she favors an open courtroom and will consider specific requests from the prosecution as the trial progresses.

No more playing bridge, either — he jokingly accuses his brain surgeon of robbing him of the gray matter that contained all the bidding strategy. But when Mr. Murray, a former bond salesman for Goldman Sachs who rose to the managing director level at both Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, decided to cease all treatment five months ago for his glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, his first impulse was not to mourn what he couldn’t do anymore or to buy an island or to move to Paris. Instead, he hunkered down in his tiny home office here and channeled whatever remaining energy he could muster into a slim paperback. It’s called “The Investment Answer,” and he wrote it with his friend and financial adviser Daniel Goldie to explain investing in a handful of simple steps. Why a book? And why this subject? Nine years ago, after retiring from 25 years of pushing bonds on pension and mutual fund managers trying to beat the market averages over long periods of time, Mr. Murray had an epiphany about the futility of his former customers’ pursuits. He eventually went to work as a consultant for Dimensional Fund Advisors, a mutual fund company that rails against active money management. So when his death sentence arrived, Mr. Murray knew he had to work quickly and resolved to get the word out to as many everyday investors as he could. “This is one of the true benefits of having a brain tumor,” Mr. Murray said, laughing. “Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.” He and Mr. Goldie have managed to beat the clock, finishing and printing the book themselves while Mr. Murray is still alive. It is plenty useful for anyone who isn’t already investing in a collection of index or similar funds and dutifully rebalancing every so often. But the mere fact that Mr. Murray felt compelled to write it is itself a remarkable story of an almost willful ignorance of the futility of active money management — and how he finally stumbled upon a better way of investing. Mr. Murray now stands as one the highest-ranking Wall Street veterans to take back much of what he and his colleagues worked for during their careers. Mr. Murray grew up in Baltimore, about the farthest thing from a crusader that you could imagine. “I was the kid you didn’t want your daughter to date,” he said. “I stole baseball cards and cheated on Spanish tests and made fun of the fat kid in the corner with glasses.” He got a lot of second chances thanks to an affluent background and basketball prowess. He eventually landed at Goldman Sachs, long before many people looked askance at anyone who worked there. “Our word was our bond, and good ethics was good business,” he said of his Wall Street career. “That got replaced by liar loans and ‘I hope I’m gone by the time this thing blows up.’ ” After rising to managing director at two other banks, Mr. Murray retired in 2001. At the time, his personal portfolio was the standard Wall Street big-shot barbell, with a pile of municipal bonds at one end to provide safe tax-free income and private equity and hedge fund investments at the other. When some of those bonds came due, he sought out Mr. Goldie, a former professional tennis player and 1989 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, for advice on what to buy next. Right away, Mr. Goldie began teaching him about Dimensional’s funds. The fact that Mr. Murray knew little up until that point about basic asset allocation among stocks and bonds and other investments or the failings of active portfolio management is shocking, until you consider the self-regard that his master-of-the-universe colleagues taught him. “It’s American to think that if you’re smart or work hard, then you can beat the markets,” he said. But it didn’t take long for Mr. Murray to become a true believer in this different way of investing. “I learned more through Dan and Dimensional in a year than I did in 25 years on Wall Street,” he said. Soon Dimensional hired him as a consultant, helping financial advisers who use its funds explain the company’s anti-Wall Street investment philosophy to its clients. “The most inspirational people who talk about alcoholism are people who have gone through A.A.,” said David Booth, Dimensional’s founder and chairman. “It’s the people who have had the experience and now see the light who are our biggest advocates.” Playing that role was enough for Mr. Murray until he received his diagnosis in 2008. But not long after, in the wake of the financial collapse, he testified before a open briefing at the House of Representatives, wondering aloud how it was possible that prosecutors had not yet won criminal convictions against anyone in charge at his old firms and their competitors.</text></article>
    <article index="22" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/business/global/10views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Letting Diageo In Could Help China<date>Published: November 9, 2010</date><text>Scotland has Scotch and China has white liquor. Baijiu, a clear drink that is 50 percent alcohol, is China’s national pride.The sector has been largely off limits to foreign investors, but Diageo, the British distiller, wants to pop it open with a $1.1 billion bid for Shui Jing Fang, a liquor producer. China can show openness by letting Diageo in, and in turn, that could help the country pick up useful skills Diageo covets access to a large and uniquely Chinese market. Top-end baijiu sells for as much $200 a bottle, and sales are growing by more than 10 percent a year, Euromonitor International reported. Shui Jing Fang, in which Diageo owns 40 percent, has a 30 percent operating margin. That is on par with Diageo’s margin and higher than Pernod Ricard’s. Regulators seem to have other ideas. Top liquor brands are on a list in which foreign investment is restricted. True, Shui Jing Fang does not technically appear on the 20-year-old list of such protected brands, even though it is one of China’s largest premium white liquor companies. But the deal has been stuck with the regulator since March. Defending baijiu may inflame protectionism fears. Business leaders are wary after Canada blocked BHP’s bid for the Potash Corporation. China set a precedent in 2009 when it stopped Coca-Cola from buying the juice maker Huiyuan. British politicians have waded in, with the British business secretary, Vince Cable, pledging to support the distiller’s case on his current trip to China. China can afford to change the rules. Approving the deal would send a positive message about openness, which may win China friends when it is under attack for its trade imbalances. Diageo may be able to help foreigners develop more of a taste for baijiu. And as China buys resources like gas and oil in other countries, protecting its spirits industry is hard to justify. Chinese liquor makers may learn some skills from Diageo, which specializes in high-end brands. Western companies still have a distinct advantage in luxury goods. If China wants baijiu to be the new single malt, raising a glass to open markets would be a start. Goldman Begins Shift Closing its proprietary trading desks is just one stage in Goldman Sachs’s makeover, and an early one at that. The Wall Street firm confirmed in a regulatory filing that it had “liquidated substantially all” the positions taken by its principal strategies group. The Volcker Rule required the move. But shutting so-called prop desks is emblematic of a broader shift at the bank. Goldman used to be the master of managing conflicts, perceived or otherwise. Though some clients suspected that the firm’s prop desk was trading against them, Goldman convinced enough of them of its savvy that it was able to increase its trading client base by about 50 percent, to 6,000, from 2006 to 2009. Goldman was also the only major bank to keep its in-house private equity unit intact a few years ago while others folded theirs after buyout funds complained of having to compete with their lenders. Not that Goldman was immune to stepping over the line. In 2006, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Goldman’s chief executive, had to chastise some of his own bankers and private equity executives for collaborating a little too closely. Of course, the Volcker Rule limits private equity, too. But potential conflicts also lurk elsewhere, like in structuring deals like Abacus, the mortgage security that led to a $550 million regulatory fine. Or in advisory: rare though such deals are, it is unlikely Goldman could (or would now want to) dominate a deal like the New York Stock Exchange’s 2005 buyout of Archipelago. It advised both sides and owned a piece of the exchange. Eliminating conflicts will not be easy: working its way around them is part of Goldman’s DNA. And there is enough leeway in the Volcker Rule for suspicions to linger that banks can still make bets with their own money. Overcoming that will take time. But eradicating conflicts could help keep Goldman out of the news and away from regulatory ire. Its partners would surely welcome that. WEI GU and ANTONY CURRIE</text></article>

Goldman was ordered in June to pay $20.6 million to unsecured creditors of the failed hedge fund manager Bayou Group to settle claims that the bank had ignored signs of fraud at the fund. The bank appealed the decision in July, and on Monday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan rejected Goldman's request to vacate the award. ''After full consideration of the parties' briefs and oral argument, the court hereby denies the petition to vacate the arbitration award and grants the cross-petition to confirm the award,'' Judge Rakoff wrote. ''However, final judgment will not be entered in this case until the court issues an opinion setting forth the reasons for this ruling.'' A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on Monday. Ross Intelisano, a partner at New York law firm Rich &amp; Intelisano who represented Bayou creditors, said, ''We are looking forward to investors finally getting some of their money back from this tragic fraud.'' Bayou collapsed in 2005, and the firm's former chief executive,Samuel Israel III, is serving 20 years in prison for fraud. Mr. Israel pleaded guilty to misrepresenting the value of Bayou's funds and defrauding clients out of more than $400 million. Goldman cleared trades for Bayou, which was based in Connecticut, before it collapsed. Bayou's unsecured creditors' committee filed the arbitration claim against Goldman in 2008. During the arbitration, Goldman denied accusations that it had ignored signs of wrongdoing. Goldman is not out of options; it can appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The award was considered a watershed and could have ramifications across the financial sector. Wall Street firms, which handle billions of dollars in trades, assert that their job is simply to clear trades, not police the clients. If upheld, the award could raise the standard among banks for clearing trades. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Payback Still a Long Way Ahead<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>Taxpayers will have to wait a while to reclaim the money invested to keep General Motors out of the scrapyard. The carmaker is running far more smoothly after declaring bankruptcy last year: it earned as much as $2.1 billion in the three months to September, its third straight quarter of profits. But the terms of G.M.’s coming share sale show that, once public, the stock will have to as much as double before its biggest shareholder, the United States government, gets close to breaking even.Assume G.M.’s initial public offering starts at $26, the bottom of the projected price range. That would mean the Treasury, which owns 61 percent, would be taking a 42 percent loss on any stock it sells in the offering. It is planning to sell 263 million shares. If it does, G.M. shares would need to more than double to get back into the black on its investment, reaching more than $52 a share, according to a Reuters Breakingviews analysis. The hurdle for G.M.’s debut performance lowers if G.M.’s bankers can sell the shares at the top of the price range. But if the underwriters sell more of the Treasury’s stock in the I.P.O., the barrier to breaking even increases. The calculation is similar for the G.M. stakes held by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Over all, this sounds like a tall order. All things being equal, it implies that G.M. will have to essentially double its profits. But it could have been worse. Had the Treasury insisted on dumping more stock on the market, as appeared to be the case just a few months ago, the I.P.O. price might have been lower and the need for a huge increase in G.M.’s value afterward far greater. The Treasury, whose G.M. efforts are being led by Ron Bloom, changed its tune and focused less on getting out quickly and more on exiting with minimal damage to taxpayers. That is a sensible about-face, but it still leaves getting back in the black a ways off. Buffett’s Swiss Stake Warren E. Buffett may struggle to repeat his Swiss Re exit. The billionaire bailed out three big companies during the financial crisis: the Swiss insurer, General Electric and Goldman Sachs. On Thursday, he allowed Swiss Re to buy back its expensive convertible stock. He may have less leeway to be as generous with the other two. Of the three deals, Mr. Buffett’s $3.1 billion investment in Swiss Re convertible shares had the most stipulations. Negotiated at the depths of the market slump, the stock paid a 12 percent annual coupon until March 2012, when it would convert into ordinary shares at 25 Swiss francs, or $25.53. As Swiss Re’s share price is now twice that, the insurer was eager to buy back the convertibles. But it had also agreed to pay Mr. Buffett a 40 percent premium if it redeemed before March 2011, and a 20 percent premium after that. Mr. Buffett is allowing Swiss Re to pay only a 20 percent premium, as well as the interest he would have received next March. That means he collects $1 billion, rather than the $1.6 billion to which he was entitled. That may look generous. But Mr. Buffett also owns 3 percent of Swiss Re’s stock, which will benefit from the redemption of the expensive convertible securities. The shares jumped more than 6 percent At first glance, Mr. Buffett faces a similar situation with Goldman and G.E., where he holds preferred shares worth $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Both would like to buy back the stock, which pays an annual coupon of 10 percent. He also has warrants over shares of both companies, giving him an incentive to help raise the stock price. But there is less room for a Swiss Re-style agreement. Because Goldman can redeem its preferred stock at any time for a 10 percent premium, it does not need Mr. Buffett to give it an early discount. G.E.’s stock cannot be redeemed until October 2011, opening the door for a negotiation. But Berkshire Hathaway’s G.E. warrants are deeply out of the money. That means it is unlikely to benefit from any short-term boost to GE’s shares. Despite Mr. Buffett’s apparent generosity with Swiss Re, Goldman and G.E. should not assume he will take the same approach with them.</text></article>

The banks are offloading businesses to comply with new rules, repay government loans or raise money to meet more stringent capital requirements. Even mighty Goldman Sachs is not immune. Its proprietary trading desk in New York, which spawned the careers of Robert E. Rubin and dozens of successful hedge fund managers, is heading to the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as Goldman winds down the operation to comply with new federal regulations. Other private equity firms are also expanding and diversifying. This year, for example, Apollo Global Management acquired Citigroup's real estate investment group, and Blackstone Group took over Bank of America's Asian property business. The hiring of the nine-person team Goldman team, led by Bob Howard, represents K.K.R.'s entry into stock trading. The firm is expected to raise money from outside investors for a hedge fund to be managed by Mr. Howard and his colleagues. The business will help the newly public K.K.R. expand beyond its core private equity operations of buying and selling companies using large amounts of debt. K.K.R. has already expanded into other areas, including a fixed-income asset management arm and a capital markets division that underwrites stock and bond offerings for companies. In its efforts to diversify, K.K.R., co-founded by the billionaire Henry R. Kravis, pictured, is playing catch-up to its largest rival, the Blackstone Group. Blackstone already has four distinct operations; corporate buyouts, real estate investing, hedge funds and advisory services. The evolution of private equity firms into broader money management businesses is occurring as the firms' founders - many of whom are in their 60s - look to cash out by selling stakes to the public. K.K.R. joined Blackstone as a New York Stock Exchange-listed company in July. Other firms that are either preparing or exploring public listings include Apollo and Carlyle Group. As publicly traded companies, these firms are under pressure not only to raise more capital and generate more profits but also to smooth out their earnings by diversifying into areas other than the historically volatile business of private equity. Their expansion efforts are not without risk. Carlyle's reputation was seriously damaged in 2008, when Carlyle Capital, a hedge fund that invested in mortgage securities, imploded in the credit crisis. The move by Mr. Howard and his colleagues to K.K.R. means the unwinding of a Goldman unit that gave rise to many Wall Street luminaries. Once known as the risk arbitrage desk and now called principal strategies, its alumni include Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, and hedge fund managers like Edward S. Lampert, chairman of Sears Holding Corporation, and Daniel S. Och, chief of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group. But new regulations have compelled Goldman to leave this business. Rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the most sweeping financial regulatory overhaul in decades, have limited the involvement of Goldman and other banks in riskier investments like hedge funds and proprietary trading, in which firms bet their own capital. After the restrictions were passed, Goldman bankers fanned out across their client base to help the traders find a new home. A number of firms competed with K.K.R. to hire the Goldman team, including Avenue Capital and Perella Weinberg. Other members of Goldman's proprietary trading desk abroad, like the team in Asia led by Morgan Sze, have weighed their options, which include establishing a fund. Even after jettisoning the United States unit, Goldman has some trading desks that invest with the company's capital, a business model that has come under fire since the financial crisis. It is unclear what Goldman intends to do with those businesses, which include its special situations group in the fixed-income division. Mr. Howard, 39, who leads the United States principal strategies unit, has spent his entire career at Goldman. After graduating from Harvard College, he spent two years as an analyst in investment banking and capital markets before returning to Harvard to earn a master's degree in business administration. He rejoined Goldman in 1998 as an associate in what became principal strategies and remained there ever since. When Mr. Howard and his team start on Jan. 1, he will join many Goldman alumni at K.K.R., which has a close relationship with the investment bank. He will report to William Sonneborn, a former Goldman banker who heads K.K.R.'s asset-management division. And this is not the first merger between K.K.R. and Goldman Sachs this year. In May, a K.K.R. co-founder, George R. Roberts, married Linnea Conrad, a Goldman Sachs investment banker. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Goldman Sachs, which consistently manages to outsmart its rivals when it comes to making money, posted rather ordinary results on Tuesday for the third quarter. The earnings report was the most telling illustration yet of how the slowdown in trading has dented the Wall Street profit machines. Global markets remain fragile two years after the credit crisis unleashed the worst economic rout since the Great Depression. Investors, stung by the May flash crash when the Dow Jones industrial average briefly plunged more than 900 points before recovering, remain shaken and are staying close to the sidelines. Goldman is a trading powerhouse and its quarter suffered as a result. Net revenue in the business that trades bonds, currencies and commodities fell 37 percent, to $3.77 billion. This division accounted for 42 percent of all revenue generated by the firm in the third quarter. Net revenue from equities trading and commissions fell 33 percent, to $1.86 billion. In addition, firms like Goldman are facing new regulatory changes that have and will continue to hurt the earnings power of financial firms. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act signed into law by President Obama in July, restricts certain operations, like proprietary trading. Goldman has already wound down this business, which it previously said accounted for less than 10 percent of its revenue annually. Rules both at home and abroad also have or will require big financial firms to hold more capital against riskier operations. This will most likely force banks like Goldman to exit less profitable business lines. ''It is tremendously challenging for all these firms to grow their business when clients are not that active and they are also busy recalibrating to a new regulatory environment,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura Securities. In a sign of how challenging the business has become, Goldman's return on equity, an important benchmark on Wall Street that shows how efficiently a firm is generating profits from the money shareholders have invested, fell to 10.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with 21.4 percent in the quarter a year ago. In the second quarter, it was 7.9 percent. But Goldman's return on equity since it went public has been 24 percent, and its target is to produce a 20 percent return on equity. Goldman's chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, said during an investor conference call with analysts that ''many of the market concerns that were most prevalent in the second quarter of 2010 continued into the third quarter'' and investors continued to be concerned about pending legislation both at home and abroad. While confidence among chief executives has picked up, he said, it remains fragile. ''These factors, combined with the seasonal dynamics of the third quarter, negatively impacted activity levels within many of our businesses,'' he said. He seemed only marginally more upbeat about business conditions during the last six weeks, which will show up when Goldman reports its fourth-quarter earnings in January, saying while business picked up in September, it wasn't ''roaring.'' For the third quarter, Goldman said its earnings slumped 40 percent, to $1.9 billion, or $2.98 a share, compared with $3.19 billion, or $5.25 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Net revenue was $8.9 billion. Those numbers exceeded analysts' estimates that had been lowered in recent weeks. The most recent survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters had forecast Goldman to earn $2.28 a share, down from estimates of $3.37 a share a month ago. Shares of Goldman rose nearly 2 percent, or $3.02, to $156.72, on a day when the broader marker was down sharply. Mr. Schorr of Nomura noted that despite the dip in revenue in the quarter, Goldman did not tinker with its compensation and benefit accrual, a decision that lowers return on equity in the current period. He expects Goldman to set aside less money for compensation and benefits in the fourth quarter, which will most likely lift the firm's full year 2010 return on equity. Bonus season is soon approaching; Wall Street typically lets employees know their bonus number in December. Goldman has been the target of criticism from Washington and Main Street over its quick return to profitability and big bonuses months after the financial crisis, when financial firms, including Goldman, were forced to accept government help. Goldman set aside $3.8 billion in compensation in the third quarter. It will not decide what it will pay out until the fourth quarter, but so far this year it has put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees. And while business may have slowed, Goldman's ranks actually grew by 1,300 employees in the quarter. The firm said it had hired primarily in Asia and London in its asset management division, bringing on more staff members to deal with big pension funds and other clients. There were a few bright spots in the quarter for Goldman. The firm posted net revenue, or revenue minus interest expense, in its investment bank of $1.1 billion, up 24 percent from the period a year earlier.

    <article index="27" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/20views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman in the Pack, Not Leading It<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs is coming down to earth with a bit of a bump. Sure, the third-quarter earnings of $1.9 billion handily beat what analysts had expected for the Wall Street giant, led by Lloyd Blankfein. That’s good news any time, and especially after talk of a summer slowdown. But Goldman’s results usually lead the pack. Not this time.Take the company’s market-leading franchise in fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, where revenue fell 14 percent from the second quarter, or around 10 percent after accounting for losses taken by marking up the value of its own debt. That’s not bad. But it’s the biggest drop of the major companies that have reported so far. Citigroup’s revenue in the same business area was almost flat, and JPMorgan Chase’s actually improved slightly after adjusting for marking its liabilities to market value. Traders at a resurgent Bank of America took in more than 50 percent more revenue than in the previous three months and crowed about logging a perfect record, meaning no trading losses on any day in the quarter. It’s the second quarter in a row that Goldman’s traders have slipped. Last time, revenue at the company’s equities unit fell precipitously. That helped push company’s second-quarter return on equity down to 9.5 percent, excluding the one-time British bonus tax and the cost of settling a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, the company managed to improve only to a humdrum 10.3 percent return on equity. Compare that to JPMorgan: its investment bank returned 13 percent, and its asset management unit 25 percent. Goldman’s showing is hardly disastrous. Its investment bankers enjoyed a decent summer, with underwriting revenue jumping 40 percent and mergers bringing in 5 percent more income. Equities trading recovered somewhat, and at $3.77 billion, Goldman’s revenue from trading in fixed income, currency and commodities is still the largest in its peer group. And the relative underperformance of the bank’s traders of late may just be a blip in their otherwise enviable record. But for once, these sometimes omniscient-seeming masters of the financial universe are looking like mere mortals. Renminbi Hope China’s first interest rate increase since 2007 sounds more momentous than it actually is. But the modesty of the 0.25 percentage point move means there’s scope for more substantial action on the country’s too-cheap currency. There are two good reasons for China to tighten, namely to push interest rates above inflation and to curb runaway property prices. The new, higher deposit rate of 2.5 percent and lending rate of 5.56 percent won’t really do either. The central bank’s action may just take the edge off stirring inflation, but the maximum allowable reward for holding deposits is still below the hoped-for inflation rate of 3 percent. Depositors’ own inflation expectations are likely to be much higher. China’s savings are still being bled away. Dwindling savings returns have driven depositors back to real-estate speculation, and the rate increases won’t be enough to reverse that. Urban property prices rose 9.1 percent year-on-year in September, and total transactions by value were up more than 50 percent from August. Raising interest rates might threaten a property crash if buyers were highly mortgaged, but they are not. Moreover, the expectation of property gains is now so engrained that a tiny rise in rates is unlikely to dampen the mania. The rate increases may be only a baby step, but they aren’t pointless. Data on the country’s gross domestic product and on inflation to be released Thursday are likely to show that demand remains strong and price pressures are rising. China’s G.D.P. is expected to grow by 10 percent this year. That means interest rates are still low in absolute terms and there is room for more tightening of the kind that both China’s consumers and trade partners really need. Beijing can help control inflation by allowing its currency to appreciate, putting a damper on commodity and other input prices. That would make Chinese exporters less competitive but not deter the budding consumers the country hopes to promote. A stronger renminbi is what almost all of China’s trade partners crave, especially given the currency’s recent declines against almost all of its major trading partners. By raising rates just a little, Beijing may have left itself room for a welcome sequel.</text></article>

Watchdog Says No Political Motivation in Goldman Lawsuit<date>Published: October 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — An investigation by the inspector general of the Securities and Exchange Commission found no evidence that the agency’s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs was politically motivated or that S.E.C. officials leaked advance information about the lawsuit to the media.H. David Kotz, the S.E.C. inspector general, who is an independent watchdog for the agency, said in a report dated Sept. 30 and released late Wednesday that his investigation “found that the investigation’s procedural path and timing was governed primarily by decisions relating to the case itself.” The agency’s initial filing on April 16 of a lawsuit charging Goldman Sachs with defrauding investors with its disclosures about a subprime mortgage investment led to immediate speculation that it was timed to help spur Senate action on the pending bill to strengthen financial regulation. While Mr. Kotz also received complaints that some media, including The New York Times, received advanced notice of the lawsuit, he said he found no evidence of such a leak. But the chief of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, Robert S. Khuzami, testified that the settlement of the lawsuit, announced on July 15, was in reaction to an article about a possible settlement in The Wall Street Journal and fear of further leaks. The inspector general did not find evidence that the Goldman suit was filed on the same day that he released a critical report of the S.E.C.’s actions in the R. Allen Stanford case to deflect attention from that news. Mr. Kotz did criticize the S.E.C. enforcement division for failing to notify Goldman of its lawsuit until after the papers were filed in federal court, a violation of administrative regulations. The agency’s failure to notify the New York Stock Exchange of the pending news also contributed to increased volatility in the markets on the day of the filing, the inspector general said.</text></article>

Energy Future Holdings has been working to restructure its $40 billion worth of debt, which originated from 2007 when the company found itself the target of the largest ever leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs. Since then, the price of gas has dropped drastically, and Energy Futures has fallen on hard times, The Post said. The energy company is hoping to get Mr. Buffett, as well as other unsecured bondholders, to exchange a total of $6 billion of their debt in a subsidiary, known as TCEH, at about 70 percent of its actual value for a debt that matures later, The Post reported. Trying to answer why Mr. Buffett and other bondholders might agree to such a deal, The Post writes: If the TCEH subsidiary goes bankrupt, as analysts predict it will 2014, unsecured bondholders run the risk of not recouping their investment as holders of the new debt would get paid before them. “You are in a prisoner’s dilemma,” said one bond trader.

Penney has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser as the retailer braces for a possible battle from the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, Women’s Wear Daily reports. In selecting Goldman, J.C. Penney is following the approach taken by rival Target, which also used the firm to help devise its successful defense against Mr. Ackman’s proxy challenge in 2009. Securities filings late last week showed that Mr.Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had taken a 16.5 percent stake in J.C. Penney. Pershing is a major real-estate investor, most prominently of late with General Growth Properties, a huge mall operator getting ready to emerge from bankruptcy. Mr. Ackman is working with another major player in commercial real estate, Vornado Realty, which disclosed last week that it had taken a 9.9 percent in J.C. Penney. Both Vornado and General Growth are landlords for J.C. Penney stores. J.C. Penney’s chief executive, Myron E. Ullman III, is expected to meet with Mr. Ackman and Steven Roth within the next 10 days, Women’s Wear Daily said. Shares of J.C. Penney, which surged sharply on Friday on news of the ownership stakes, slipped slightly in midday trading on Wednesday. The company has a market value of nearly $8 billion.

In investing $450 million in the social networking giant, Goldman has established itself as the leading candidate to win the lucrative and prestigious assignment of Facebook's initial public offering, whenever that day comes. It also positions itself to reap millions of dollars in banking fees. Goldman has already begun the process of wooing its wealthy clients to invest alongside it in Facebook, forming an investment vehicle that seeks to raise as much $1.5 billion for the Internet company. But Goldman's bold move is also likely to focus the attention of regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which last month began an inquiry into the surge in trading shares of privately held Internet companies. While the investment by Goldman is being hailed as a huge coup on Wall Street, the deal - in particular the investment pool being formed for its clients - could become a lightning rod for regulators and policy makers as they examine the growing shadow market in Facebook shares. For Goldman, the investment in Facebook is in many ways a return to the firm's roots. Long before Facebook became a social and cultural phenomenon, Goldman was ''friending'' America's hottest companies and their chief executives, from Sears Roebuck in the 1900s to Ford in the 1950s to eBay in the 1990s. By collecting so many important friends, and obsessively tending to those relationships, Goldman generates big fees. In addition to the potential banking fees generated by an initial public offering of Facebook, there is the billions of dollars of unlocked paper wealth realized by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's 26-year-old chief, and his fellow executives. Goldman, as a lead Facebook investor, will most likely have a leg up in winning the assignment to manage that money, too. The firm's Facebook investment came together over the last month, according to a person involved in the deal who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. After the spike in trading in Facebook over the last several months - in a November auction, Facebook shares traded at a $56 billion valuation - Mr. Zuckerberg expressed an interest in raising money to legitimize the $50 billion valuation. Mr. Zuckerberg felt that gaining the imprimatur of a major investor at such lofty levels would validate Facebook in the eyes of its Silicon Valley competitors with whom it is negotiating deals, this person said. Helping play matchmaker was Yuri Milner, chief executive of DST Global, a Russian firm that invested $50 million alongside Goldman. Goldman has a close relationship with DST and Mr. Milner, a Russian businessman who has emerged as a leading venture capital investor in Internet companies. Mail.ru, the publicly traded sibling of DST Global, has an existing stake in Facebook, as well large positions in Groupon and Zynga, two other popular Web-based businesses. Goldman was a lead underwriter of Mail.ru's successful $1 billion initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in November. The Facebook investment, made from Goldman's balance sheet, also sheds light on the firm's private equity strategy in the wake of the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul. Although the Facebook investment represents a negligible percentage of Goldman's roughly $900 billion balance sheet, it is symbolically significant because it had been unclear whether the firm would, after the financial crisis, be using its balance sheet to make these types of illiquid, risky investments. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. The closest analogue to Goldman's Facebook investment may be the firm's longtime alliance with the New York fashion designer Ralph Lauren. In 1994, Mr. Lauren was looking for money to expand his business, and Goldman invested a minority stake and took a seat on the company's board. Goldman underwrote Ralph Lauren's initial public offering in 1997. Today, Mr. Lauren's company remains a loyal client of the firm. And when Mr. Lauren sold $1 billion of stock last year to cash out one-quarter of his stake in his company, Goldman handled the trade. Perhaps even more intriguing than Goldman's direct stake in Facebook is the ''special purpose vehicle'' that it is creating to allow its wealthy clients to invest in Facebook alongside the firm.</text></article>

The deal makes Facebook now worth more than companies like eBay, Yahoo and Time Warner. The stake by Goldman Sachs, considered one of Wall Street's savviest investors, signals the increasing might of Facebook, which has already been bearing down on giants like Google. The new money will give Facebook more firepower to steal away valuable employees, develop new products and possibly pursue acquisitions - all without being a publicly traded company. The investment may also allow earlier shareholders, including Facebook employees, to cash out at least some of their stakes. The new investment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commissionhas begun an inquiry into the increasingly hot private market for shares in Internet companies, including Facebook, Twitter, the gaming site Zynga and LinkedIn, an online professional networking site. Some experts suggest the inquiry is focused on whether certain companies are improperly using the private market to get around public disclosure requirements. The new money could add pressure on Facebook to go public even as its executives have resisted. The popularity of shares of Microsoft and Google in the private market ultimately pressured them to pursue initial public offerings. So far, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has brushed aside the possibility of an initial public offering or a sale of the company. At an industry conference in November, he said on the topic, ''Don't hold your breath.'' However, people involved in the fund-raising effort suggest that Facebook's board has indicated an intention to consider a public offering in 2012. There has been an explosion in user interest in social media sites. The social buying site Groupon, which recently rejected a $6 billion takeover bid from Google, is in the process of raising as much as $950 million from major institutional investors, at a valuation near $5 billion, according to people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly. ''When you think back to the early days of Google, they were kind of ignored by Wall Street investors, until it was time to go public,'' said Chris Sacca, an angel investor in Silicon Valley who is a former Google employee and an investor in Twitter. ''This time, the Street is smartening up. They realize there are true growth businesses out here. Facebook has become a real business, and investors are coming out here and saying, 'We want a piece of it.''' The Facebook investment deal is likely to stir up a debate about what the company would be worth in the public market. Though it does not disclose its financial performance, analysts estimate the company is profitable and could bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue annually. Under the terms of the deal, Goldman has invested $450 million, and Digital Sky Technologies, a Russian investment firm that has already sunk about half a billion dollars into Facebook, invested $50 million, people involved in the talks said. Goldman has the right to sell part of its stake, up to $75 million, to the Russian firm, these people said. For Digital Sky Technologies, the deal means its original investment in Facebook, at a valuation of $10 billion, has gone up fivefold. Representatives for Facebook, Goldman and Digital Sky Technologies all declined to comment. Goldman's involvement means it may be in a strong position to take Facebook public when it decides to do so in what is likely to be a lucrative and prominent deal. As part of the deal, Goldman is expected to raise as much as $1.5 billion from investors for Facebook at the $50 billion valuation, people involved in the discussions said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the transaction was not supposed to be made public until the fund-raising had been completed.</text></article>

Feinberg, President Obama's former pay czar, received a lukewarm reception from Wall Street earlier this year, when he suggested that firms adopt a so-called brake provision that would allow employee compensation agreements at big banks to be broken if the government were forced to step and bail them out. On Thursday, Goldman Sachs disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had adopted just such a brake proposal. The filing says that, if the government is forced to bail Goldman out, most of the firm's outstanding compensation awards ''shall immediately terminate.'' The move was applauded by some pay experts as a good corporate governance practice. ''Not many firms as far as I know have done this,'' said Robert J. Jackson Jr., an associate professor at Columbia Law School. ''This is another sign of Goldman's leadership on reforming pay structures, and it will be interesting to see whether other firms follow Goldman's lead.'' Mr. Jackson previously served as deputy special master for TARP executive compensation in the Treasury Department. The brake proposal followed a broad outcry over the American International Group's payout of millions of dollars in bonuses in 2009 even though the government had pumped billions of dollars into the company to rescue it the previous year. Still, there is no danger that Goldman's adoption of the provision will derail its bonuses for 2010. Goldman is thriving. It earned $5.97 billion during the first nine months of the year and put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees.

MICHAEL J. de la MERCED BULLISH ON BANKING Investment banking is the business that Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, sees as having the most potential next year, according to a new Wall Street analyst report. Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura, says he met with Mr. Blankfein and the firm's chief financial officer, David Viniar, above, and found that management was feeling good about how 2011 was shaping up, given robust M.&amp;A. and equity underwriting pipelines. ANITA RAGHAVAN RETURN TO LAW John C. Dugan, who left the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in August, is rejoining his former law firm, Covington &amp; Burling. He will be chairman of the firm's financial institutions group, the position he held before he was appointed comptroller by President Bush in 2005. Mr. Dugan, 55, will be advising clients on ''a range of legal matters affected by significantly increased regulatory requirements resulting from the financial crisis,'' the firm said. nytimes.com/dealbook PHOTO DRAWING</text></article>

It is unlikely to be any different when the findings of Goldman’s Business Standards Committee become public early next year. But on one important point Goldman lags some big competitors — the separation of the chief executive and chairman jobs. Now it has a chance to catch up.Since May, the bank has been conducting the financial industry version of group psychoanalysis. The standards group headed by the veteran partners Gerald Corrigan and Michael Evans is scrubbing the bank’s business practices to “reinforce the firm’s client focus” and improve transparency. The firm is examining, among other things, how it manages conflicts between its own activities and those of customers, how it discloses what it does, what responsibilities it has to clients and, critically, how to inculcate a sense of professional ethics in its employees. The results are highly anticipated by more than Goldman’s 35,400 employees. Every firm on Wall Street will pore over them. The firm’s public image may have been tarnished by reams of bad press and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit — since settled — contending that the firm shortchanged some of its customers. But the bank is still considered the gold standard among its peers. So if Goldman decides, say, to exit a business because it feels it creates conflicts of interest with clients, other banks will feel pressure to do the same — or risk expending considerable energy explaining to clients why they are different. What is not obviously on the business standards agenda, though, is Goldman’s own governance. While governance is ultimately a board decision, its absence seems odd given the intensity of the soul-searching going at the firm. Goldman’s financial performance has not suffered in any obvious way from having Lloyd C. Blankfein hold both the chief executive and chairman roles. But Goldman, and specifically Mr. Blankfein, have taken quite a beating in the public arena of late. Though some of the opprobrium was undeserved, the experience should have underlined the merits of separating duties at the top of the firm. The skills that brought Mr. Blankfein the top job at a competitive securities firm that consciously avoids the retail end of the market are not necessarily the same ones that are effective in the unwanted glare of political and Main Street scrutiny. Having a seasoned chairman would have given the firm someone to navigate the shifting political and regulatory tides while Mr. Blankfein focused on the firm’s operations and employees and, most important, on its big corporate and institutional customers. Executives at banks that did separate the top two jobs — a list that includes Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — say the move paid off at the height of the recent crisis and in efforts to shape the regulatory reform bill passed by Congress. Of course, a division of responsibilities is not a substitute for strong leadership. A chairman who does a poor job of working with politicians or the media won’t be able to offer a chief executive much cover. And it is critical that the chairman and the chief executive have a consistent vision for the company, a good working relationship and complementary skills. That’s not always the case, as the British energy giant BP amply illustrated during the months it spent trying to stanch the flow of oil — and the attendant negative press coverage — from its leaking Gulf of Mexico well. Carl-Henric Svanberg earned the sobriquet of “invisible chairman” for his low profile during the fiasco. And when Mr. Svanberg did speak publicly, he did little to help the gaffe-prone chief executive, Tony Hayward, who referred to the oil leak’s victims in the gulf as “the small people.” Mr. Blankfein is no Mr. Hayward. He has the confidence of shareholders, his board and his staff, and he survived antagonistic political hearings in much better shape than Mr. Hayward, if not completely unscathed. Having steered Goldman through the financial crisis and the annus horribilis the bank’s image endured in 2010, his job looks secure. But that makes the timing right for a change in governance. The Business Standards Committee itself offers one possible candidate to step in alongside Mr. Blankfein in the form of Mr. Corrigan, a former president of the New York Federal Reserve. By proposing to add a chairman now, Goldman would avoid the common stigma of separating the two top jobs at a time of weakness. Doing so from a position of strength would set another example for its rivals. ROB COX</text></article>

The men share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable -- and controversial -- fields in finance. They also share a common secret: The details of their meetings, even their identities, have been strictly confidential. Drawn from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the bankers form a powerful committee that helps oversee trading in derivatives, instruments which, like insurance, are used to hedge risk. In theory, this group exists to safeguard the integrity of the multitrillion-dollar market. In practice, it also defends the dominance of the big banks. The banks in this group, which is affiliated with a new derivatives clearinghouse, have fought to block other banks from entering the market, and they are also trying to thwart efforts to make full information on prices and fees freely available. Banks' influence over this market, and over clearinghouses like the one this select group advises, has costly implications for businesses large and small, like Dan Singer's home heating-oil company in Westchester County, north of New York City. This fall, many of Mr. Singer's customers purchased fixed-rate plans to lock in winter heating oil at around $3 a gallon. While that price was above the prevailing $2.80 a gallon then, the contracts will protect homeowners if bitterly cold weather pushes the price higher. But Mr. Singer wonders if his company, Robison Oil, should be getting a better deal. He uses derivatives like swaps and options to create his fixed plans. But he has no idea how much lower his prices -- and his customers' prices -- could be, he says, because banks don't disclose fees associated with the derivatives. ''At the end of the day, I don't know if I got a fair price, or what they're charging me,'' Mr. Singer said. Derivatives shift risk from one party to another, and they offer many benefits, like enabling Mr. Singer to sell his fixed plans without having to bear all the risk that oil prices could suddenly rise. Derivatives are also big business on Wall Street. Banks collect many billions of dollars annually in undisclosed fees associated with these instruments -- an amount that almost certainly would be lower if there were more competition and transparent prices. Just how much derivatives trading costs ordinary Americans is uncertain. The size and reach of this market has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Pension funds today use derivatives to hedge investments. States and cities use them to try to hold down borrowing costs. Airlines use them to secure steady fuel prices. Food companies use them to lock in prices of commodities like wheat or beef. The marketplace as it functions now ''adds up to higher costs to all Americans,'' said Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said. But big banks influence the rules governing derivatives through a variety of industry groups. The banks' latest point of influence are clearinghouses like ICE Trust, which holds the monthly meetings with the nine bankers in New York. Under the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul, many derivatives will be traded via such clearinghouses. Mr. Gensler wants to lessen banks' control over these new institutions. But Republican lawmakers, many of whom received large campaign contributions from bankers who want to influence how the derivatives rules are written, say they plan to push back against much of the coming reform. On Thursday, the commission canceled a vote over a proposal to make prices more transparent, raising speculation that Mr. Gensler did not have enough support from his fellow commissioners. The Department of Justice is looking into derivatives, too. The department's antitrust unit is actively investigating ''the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,'' according to a department spokeswoman.</text></article>

Sergey Aleynikov, a 40-year-old former Goldman Sachs programmer, was found guilty on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan of stealing proprietary source code from the bank's high-frequency trading platform. He was convicted on two counts - theft of trade secrets and transportation of stolen property - and faces up to 10 years in prison. Mr. Aleynikov's arrest in 2009 drew attention to a business that had been little known outside Wall Street - high-frequency trading, which uses complex computer algorithms to make lightning-fast trades to exploit tiny discrepancies in price. Such trading has become an increasingly important source of revenue for Wall Street firms and hedge funds, and those companies fiercely protect the code underpinning their trading strategies. During the two-week trial, Judge Denise L. Cote closed the courtroom to the public several times to protect Goldman's proprietary source code. Yet several details emerged about the firm's high-frequency trading business, including that the unit accounted for about $300 million in revenue last year, less than 1 percent of Goldman's total revenue of $45 billion. The verdict is a victory for the United States attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the case and has recently raised its profile with its aggressive pursuit of corporate crime. It is also a victory for the Justice Department more broadly, which has made the prosecution of high-tech crime and intellectual property theft a priority. ''As today's guilty verdict demonstrates, we will use the full force of the federal law to prosecute those who steal valuable and proprietary information from their employers, whether those firms are on Wall Street or Main Street,'' Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. Until 18 months ago, Mr. Aleynikov was living the American dream. He came to the United States from Russia in 1990 with expertise in computer programming. His services were in demand at Goldman, which paid him $400,000 a year to write code for its high-frequency trading business, making him one of the bank's highest-paid programmers. He was recruited away from Goldman by Teza Technologies, a fledgling firm founded by an executive from the Citadel Investment Group, a giant Chicago hedge fund. Teza offered to pay about triple his Goldman salary. During his last three days at Goldman, Mr. Aleynikov uploaded source code to a server in Germany that allowed him to do an end around the company's security systems. After discovering that he had stolen code, Goldman reported him to federal authorities. On the evening of July 3, 2009, six agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation met Mr. Aleynikov as he landed at Newark International airport and arrested him. There was no dispute that Mr. Aleynikov had violated Goldman's confidentiality agreements when he uploaded portions of the bank's trading code to a server in Germany. The case, then, boiled down to this: Did Mr. Aleynikov intend to steal Goldman's proprietary source code to benefit his new employer? Kevin Marino, Mr. Aleynikov's lawyer, mounted a defense that tried to draw the distinction that while his client foolishly breached Goldman's confidentiality agreements, he did not commit a crime. Mr. Aleynikov acknowledged uploading code but told the F.B.I. that he never intended to steal Goldman's proprietary information. Instead, he merely wanted to take some publicly available open-source code with him on the way out the door. Mr. Marino portrayed his client as a humble and hard-working Russian who came to the United States with $300 in his pocket. Mr. Aleynikov, who is separated from his wife, lives in New Jersey and has three young children. Mr. Marino ridiculed the notion that Mr. Aleynikov was taking Goldman's ''secret sauce algorithms'' and somehow hurting the banking giant. ''There's not a law in the land that makes it a crime to use of collect or download open-source code,'' said Mr. Marino during the trial. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime.'' Federal prosecutors depicted Mr. Aleynikov as a brazen crook who was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever'' in filching thousands of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code from Goldman. He sought to use that code, prosecutors argued, as the building blocks to create a hedge fund trading platform at Teza. The government's strategy was to play to the jury's basic sense of right and wrong. ''This is a case about theft and greed,'' said Joseph Facciponti, the lead prosecutor, in his opening statement. The government made much of Mr. Aleynikov's deleting and encrypting various files after he took them from Goldman's servers. ''Like a good thief, he covered his tracks, brushing aside his digital footprint,'' Rebecca Rohr, a prosecutor, said in her closing remarks. After receiving the case Thursday afternoon, the jury deliberated for three hours Friday morning. Mr. Aleynikov sat stoically as Judge Cote read the verdict. A family friend comforted Mr. Aleynikov's mother, who had watched the trial each day from the spectators' gallery. Both Mr Aleynikov and Mr. Marino, his lawyer, declined to comment. All 12 of the jurors declined to speak about the case. Before dismissing the panel, Judge Cote warned them that if they were going to speak about the case, they must not discuss anything related to Goldman's code. Mr. Aleynikov remains free on bail but because he holds dual United States and Russian citizenship, the judge placed him under home confinement and electronic monitoring until his sentencing, which is set for March 18. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Prosecutors argued that Sergey Aleynikov stole source code from Goldman to help his new firm.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/business/06bonus.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Bush Tax Cuts Weigh on Wall Street’s Bonus Season<date>Published: December 5, 2010</date><text>Congress is debating tax rates, and that has Wall Street nervously eyeing the calendar.Worried that lawmakers will allow taxes to rise for the wealthiest Americans beginning next year, financial firms are discussing whether to move up their bonus payouts from next year to this month. At stake is a portion of the hefty annual payouts that are a familiar part of the compensation culture on Wall Street, as well as a juicy target of popular anger. If Congress does not extend the Bush-era tax cuts for the highest income levels, a typical worker who earns a $1 million bonus would pay $40,000 to $50,000 more in taxes next year than this year, depending on base salary. Goldman Sachs is one of the companies discussing how to time bonus season, according to three people who have been briefed on the discussions. Pay consultants who work with major Wall Street companies say that just about every other large bank has also considered such a move in recent weeks. With tax politics in Washington unpredictable, bank executives have spent months sketching out several options for their bonus plans, including the possibility of an earlier payout. Lawmakers have been trading accusations across a partisan divide, but after this weekend, it appears likely that a compromise will extend the tax cuts for all income levels. Even so, the banks’ discussions about bonus timing underscore how focused the industry is on protecting every dollar of pay. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment. Bonus payouts are traditionally shrouded in secrecy; companies are required to disclose their top executives’ pay, but they do not disclose the size of their total bonus pools in their public filings or internally. Goldman, not surprisingly, is the canary in the coal mine. It often announces its top executives’ bonuses before other firms, and the richness of its payouts sets the tone across the industry. This year the tax debate has imposed a new wrinkle, and executives at two large banks said their companies tentatively decided not to speed payouts, unless Goldman did. Then, these two executives said, they would consider paying early as a competitive measure, so that their workers were not upset. These executives and the people briefed on the Goldman discussions spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Bonus timing is also being discussed at scores of public companies, beyond banks, for top executives who receive multimillion-dollar payouts around the turn of the year. At most companies outside the financial sector, an early bonus would help only a handful of executives, while on Wall Street, the benefit would apply to many more workers. “This has been a topic of conversation among those of us who are involved in designing and administrating compensation plans,” said Brian Foley, a pay consultant in White Plains, N.Y. “But I really would be surprised if anyone went down this path. This is a bounce-back year in terms of bonuses going up and probably not the time to draw attention to yourself.” Wall Street firms pay out billions of dollars in bonuses each year. In good years top executives can receive bonuses worth tens of millions of dollars. Even midlevel financial workers often earn above $250,000 a year, and they receive most of their compensation as bonuses paid early in the new year. Extending the tax cuts for all Americans with taxable income over $250,000 for joint filers ($200,000 for single filers) would cost the country about $40 billion next year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and it would cost $700 billion over the next decade. Currently the highest rate for taxable income is 35 percent; that would increase to 39.6 percent if the Bush tax cuts expire this year. The top five Wall Street firms have put aside nearly $90 billion for total pay this year, and they are expected to raise that amount using their end of year earnings. That would make this year one of the best ever for bank pay. As Mr. Foley said, much of the focus within banks is on the appearance of the payouts. Several senior banking executives received either no bonuses or modest ones in recent years, and with the taxpayer-financed bailouts receding, top executives are pushing to be paid well again. Some compensation consultants have been helping their clients devise new labels for the pay that are less likely to inflame the public. For instance, some banks are considering reducing the amount of their payouts that are labeled as bonuses, and instead shifting some to other categories like “long-term incentives.” Depending on how banks structure this part of the payout package, it might not represent much of a change for bankers, since it has long been standard practice to tie up some pay for a few years for retention purposes. But, some bankers said, the goal was to make the dollar amounts appear less offensive. Bankers are also discussing speeding up the way they award company stock. Many banks pay a substantial portion of bonuses in stock, rather than cash, and companies often have a multiyear delay between when those shares are awarded and when the employees can sell them. The tax bill does not come due until employees sell the shares, or own them outright. Robert J. Jackson Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who helped oversee the Treasury Department’s rules on compensation at bailed-out companies, said he would look carefully at footnotes in company filings to see if they accelerated executives’ stock awards. “Even companies who pay in stock instead of cash can structure it to be taxed at this year’s rates,” Mr. Jackson said. “If it does happen, it may be a little tricky to see.” It is not uncommon for Wall Street to consider the tax consequences of its pay practices. Private firms like hedge funds often let workers choose when they’re paid. And until about a decade ago, Goldman allowed its partners to decide whether they received their bonuses in December or January. Back then, Goldman was an investment bank, and like other former investment banks, it closed its books at the end of November, making it easier to pay earlier. One of the challenges for the banks in paying bonuses early would be coming out with exact amounts before the year is over and before they determine their final earnings — a lengthy process. Banks have in the past found ways to get around rules, or make their workers’ pay look lower than it actually was. For instance, a year ago Goldman capped the pay of all of its London workers at £1 million each. But last summer, Goldman made it up to its partners in Britain, albeit quietly. The bank made dozens of multimillion-dollar stock grants to its partners there, according to a person briefed on their pay. Credit Suisse, in similar form, paid its British bankers summer cash bonuses to make up for their lower pay last year.</text></article>

Is Sergey Aleynikov an evil computer scientist who brazenly stole valuable, closely guarded trading code from Goldman Sachs, his former employer? Or is he a humble Russian immigrant who, upon leaving his programming post at Goldman for a higher-paying job, innocuously took some open-source code with him on his way out the door? Those dueling depictions were on display on Tuesday in a federal courtroom in Manhattan, where Mr. Aleynikov is on trial on charges that he stole computer source code used in high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs. The case is expected to shine a spotlight on high-frequency trading, an increasingly important driver of profit at investment banks and hedge funds. The trial is also a test of the boundaries of the Economic Espionage Act, a 15-year-old law that makes it a crime to steal trade secrets. Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested Mr. Aleynikov in July 2009 after Goldman reported the suspected theft to authorities. Free on bail since his arrest, the 40-year-old Mr. Aleynikov faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of stealing trade secrets. ''This is a case about greed and theft,'' said Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States attorney, during the government's opening statement. Mr. Facciponti told the jury that the evidence would show that Mr. Aleynikov knew that making off with crucial parts of Goldman's trading code would help his new employer, Teza Technologies, a new high-frequency trading firm started by a former executive at the Citadel Investment Group, the large Chicago hedge fund. Mr. Aleynikov was ''meticulous, deliberate and clever in how he went about'' stealing Goldman's code, which ''allows the bank to make lightning-fast trades in markets around the world,'' Mr. Facciponti said. The computer programs form the building blocks of high-frequency trading and power an important part of Goldman's business, he said. The prosecutor likened Goldman's protection of its high-frequency trading code to Coca-Cola's guarding of its secret formula for Coke. (What would a trade secrets case be without an allusion to Coke's secret formula?) Kevin Marino, the defense lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, spent much of his opening statement acknowledging that his client undoubtedly -- and foolishly -- violated Goldman's confidentiality policy in downloading code from the firm's computers. But he repeatedly emphasized that this breach was not a criminal act. ''I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs confidentiality provision is a federal crime,'' Mr. Marino said, raising his voice for dramatic effect. Mr. Marino also focused on the issue of intent. He said that in downloading open-source code from the firm's computers, Mr. Aleynikov never intended to harm Goldman's business -- a crucial element of proving that a trade-secrets crime was committed. As far as the proprietary code his client took, Mr. Aleynikov did not intend to steal that from Goldman, he said. Attempting to humanize Mr. Aleynikov, Mr. Marino described a meeting between Mr. Aleynikov and his new employer. During that meeting, in which Mr. Aleynikov is alleged to have shared Goldman's secret code, Mr. Marino said his client was using his computer to play a satire of a Russian folk song about how programmers are married to their jobs and not their wives. ''A little sad, but hardly subversive,'' he said. Mr. Marino got himself into trouble with Judge Denise L. Cote when he twice suggested that this case should be a civil matter and that Goldman could have sued Mr. Aleynikov instead of referring the case to criminal authorities. Visibly upset, Judge Cote interjected both times and instructed the jury to disregard those remarks. At the conclusion of the lawyers' opening statement, the judge reminded the jurors that ''this is a criminal trial'' and the defendant has been accused of violating federal laws. The trial puts mighty Goldman Sachs in the unusual role of victim. A Goldman spokesman and a lawyer from the firm sat in the back row of the spectators' gallery. The spokesman declined to comment on the case, but said the firm would have a representative present for the duration of the trial. The government has requested that portions of the trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, be closed to spectators because of the confidential nature of certain testimony. Judge Cote has said she favors an open courtroom and will consider specific requests from the prosecution as the trial progresses. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/your-money/27money.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">A Dying Banker’s Last Financial Instructions - Your Money<date>Published: November 26, 2010</date><text>BURLINGAME, Calif.There are no one-handed push-ups or headstands on the yoga mat for Gordon Murray anymore. No more playing bridge, either — he jokingly accuses his brain surgeon of robbing him of the gray matter that contained all the bidding strategy. But when Mr. Murray, a former bond salesman for Goldman Sachs who rose to the managing director level at both Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, decided to cease all treatment five months ago for his glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, his first impulse was not to mourn what he couldn’t do anymore or to buy an island or to move to Paris. Instead, he hunkered down in his tiny home office here and channeled whatever remaining energy he could muster into a slim paperback. It’s called “The Investment Answer,” and he wrote it with his friend and financial adviser Daniel Goldie to explain investing in a handful of simple steps. Why a book? And why this subject? Nine years ago, after retiring from 25 years of pushing bonds on pension and mutual fund managers trying to beat the market averages over long periods of time, Mr. Murray had an epiphany about the futility of his former customers’ pursuits. He eventually went to work as a consultant for Dimensional Fund Advisors, a mutual fund company that rails against active money management. So when his death sentence arrived, Mr. Murray knew he had to work quickly and resolved to get the word out to as many everyday investors as he could. “This is one of the true benefits of having a brain tumor,” Mr. Murray said, laughing. “Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.” He and Mr. Goldie have managed to beat the clock, finishing and printing the book themselves while Mr. Murray is still alive. It is plenty useful for anyone who isn’t already investing in a collection of index or similar funds and dutifully rebalancing every so often. But the mere fact that Mr. Murray felt compelled to write it is itself a remarkable story of an almost willful ignorance of the futility of active money management — and how he finally stumbled upon a better way of investing. Mr. Murray now stands as one the highest-ranking Wall Street veterans to take back much of what he and his colleagues worked for during their careers. Mr. Murray grew up in Baltimore, about the farthest thing from a crusader that you could imagine. “I was the kid you didn’t want your daughter to date,” he said. “I stole baseball cards and cheated on Spanish tests and made fun of the fat kid in the corner with glasses.” He got a lot of second chances thanks to an affluent background and basketball prowess. He eventually landed at Goldman Sachs, long before many people looked askance at anyone who worked there. “Our word was our bond, and good ethics was good business,” he said of his Wall Street career. “That got replaced by liar loans and ‘I hope I’m gone by the time this thing blows up.’ ” After rising to managing director at two other banks, Mr. Murray retired in 2001. At the time, his personal portfolio was the standard Wall Street big-shot barbell, with a pile of municipal bonds at one end to provide safe tax-free income and private equity and hedge fund investments at the other. When some of those bonds came due, he sought out Mr. Goldie, a former professional tennis player and 1989 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, for advice on what to buy next. Right away, Mr. Goldie began teaching him about Dimensional’s funds. The fact that Mr. Murray knew little up until that point about basic asset allocation among stocks and bonds and other investments or the failings of active portfolio management is shocking, until you consider the self-regard that his master-of-the-universe colleagues taught him. “It’s American to think that if you’re smart or work hard, then you can beat the markets,” he said. But it didn’t take long for Mr. Murray to become a true believer in this different way of investing. “I learned more through Dan and Dimensional in a year than I did in 25 years on Wall Street,” he said. Soon Dimensional hired him as a consultant, helping financial advisers who use its funds explain the company’s anti-Wall Street investment philosophy to its clients. “The most inspirational people who talk about alcoholism are people who have gone through A.A.,” said David Booth, Dimensional’s founder and chairman. “It’s the people who have had the experience and now see the light who are our biggest advocates.” Playing that role was enough for Mr. Murray until he received his diagnosis in 2008. But not long after, in the wake of the financial collapse, he testified before a open briefing at the House of Representatives, wondering aloud how it was possible that prosecutors had not yet won criminal convictions against anyone in charge at his old firms and their competitors.</text></article>

Baijiu, a clear drink that is 50 percent alcohol, is China’s national pride.The sector has been largely off limits to foreign investors, but Diageo, the British distiller, wants to pop it open with a $1.1 billion bid for Shui Jing Fang, a liquor producer. China can show openness by letting Diageo in, and in turn, that could help the country pick up useful skills Diageo covets access to a large and uniquely Chinese market. Top-end baijiu sells for as much $200 a bottle, and sales are growing by more than 10 percent a year, Euromonitor International reported. Shui Jing Fang, in which Diageo owns 40 percent, has a 30 percent operating margin. That is on par with Diageo’s margin and higher than Pernod Ricard’s. Regulators seem to have other ideas. Top liquor brands are on a list in which foreign investment is restricted. True, Shui Jing Fang does not technically appear on the 20-year-old list of such protected brands, even though it is one of China’s largest premium white liquor companies. But the deal has been stuck with the regulator since March. Defending baijiu may inflame protectionism fears. Business leaders are wary after Canada blocked BHP’s bid for the Potash Corporation. China set a precedent in 2009 when it stopped Coca-Cola from buying the juice maker Huiyuan. British politicians have waded in, with the British business secretary, Vince Cable, pledging to support the distiller’s case on his current trip to China. China can afford to change the rules. Approving the deal would send a positive message about openness, which may win China friends when it is under attack for its trade imbalances. Diageo may be able to help foreigners develop more of a taste for baijiu. And as China buys resources like gas and oil in other countries, protecting its spirits industry is hard to justify. Chinese liquor makers may learn some skills from Diageo, which specializes in high-end brands. Western companies still have a distinct advantage in luxury goods. If China wants baijiu to be the new single malt, raising a glass to open markets would be a start. Goldman Begins Shift Closing its proprietary trading desks is just one stage in Goldman Sachs’s makeover, and an early one at that. The Wall Street firm confirmed in a regulatory filing that it had “liquidated substantially all” the positions taken by its principal strategies group. The Volcker Rule required the move. But shutting so-called prop desks is emblematic of a broader shift at the bank. Goldman used to be the master of managing conflicts, perceived or otherwise. Though some clients suspected that the firm’s prop desk was trading against them, Goldman convinced enough of them of its savvy that it was able to increase its trading client base by about 50 percent, to 6,000, from 2006 to 2009. Goldman was also the only major bank to keep its in-house private equity unit intact a few years ago while others folded theirs after buyout funds complained of having to compete with their lenders. Not that Goldman was immune to stepping over the line. In 2006, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Goldman’s chief executive, had to chastise some of his own bankers and private equity executives for collaborating a little too closely. Of course, the Volcker Rule limits private equity, too. But potential conflicts also lurk elsewhere, like in structuring deals like Abacus, the mortgage security that led to a $550 million regulatory fine. Or in advisory: rare though such deals are, it is unlikely Goldman could (or would now want to) dominate a deal like the New York Stock Exchange’s 2005 buyout of Archipelago. It advised both sides and owned a piece of the exchange. Eliminating conflicts will not be easy: working its way around them is part of Goldman’s DNA. And there is enough leeway in the Volcker Rule for suspicions to linger that banks can still make bets with their own money. Overcoming that will take time. But eradicating conflicts could help keep Goldman out of the news and away from regulatory ire. Its partners would surely welcome that. WEI GU and ANTONY CURRIE</text></article>

Goldman was ordered in June to pay $20.6 million to unsecured creditors of the failed hedge fund manager Bayou Group to settle claims that the bank had ignored signs of fraud at the fund. The bank appealed the decision in July, and on Monday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan rejected Goldman's request to vacate the award. ''After full consideration of the parties' briefs and oral argument, the court hereby denies the petition to vacate the arbitration award and grants the cross-petition to confirm the award,'' Judge Rakoff wrote. ''However, final judgment will not be entered in this case until the court issues an opinion setting forth the reasons for this ruling.'' A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on Monday. Ross Intelisano, a partner at New York law firm Rich &amp; Intelisano who represented Bayou creditors, said, ''We are looking forward to investors finally getting some of their money back from this tragic fraud.'' Bayou collapsed in 2005, and the firm's former chief executive,Samuel Israel III, is serving 20 years in prison for fraud. Mr. Israel pleaded guilty to misrepresenting the value of Bayou's funds and defrauding clients out of more than $400 million. Goldman cleared trades for Bayou, which was based in Connecticut, before it collapsed. Bayou's unsecured creditors' committee filed the arbitration claim against Goldman in 2008. During the arbitration, Goldman denied accusations that it had ignored signs of wrongdoing. Goldman is not out of options; it can appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The award was considered a watershed and could have ramifications across the financial sector. Wall Street firms, which handle billions of dollars in trades, assert that their job is simply to clear trades, not police the clients. If upheld, the award could raise the standard among banks for clearing trades. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Payback Still a Long Way Ahead<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>Taxpayers will have to wait a while to reclaim the money invested to keep General Motors out of the scrapyard. The carmaker is running far more smoothly after declaring bankruptcy last year: it earned as much as $2.1 billion in the three months to September, its third straight quarter of profits. But the terms of G.M.’s coming share sale show that, once public, the stock will have to as much as double before its biggest shareholder, the United States government, gets close to breaking even.Assume G.M.’s initial public offering starts at $26, the bottom of the projected price range. That would mean the Treasury, which owns 61 percent, would be taking a 42 percent loss on any stock it sells in the offering. It is planning to sell 263 million shares. If it does, G.M. shares would need to more than double to get back into the black on its investment, reaching more than $52 a share, according to a Reuters Breakingviews analysis. The hurdle for G.M.’s debut performance lowers if G.M.’s bankers can sell the shares at the top of the price range. But if the underwriters sell more of the Treasury’s stock in the I.P.O., the barrier to breaking even increases. The calculation is similar for the G.M. stakes held by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Over all, this sounds like a tall order. All things being equal, it implies that G.M. will have to essentially double its profits. But it could have been worse. Had the Treasury insisted on dumping more stock on the market, as appeared to be the case just a few months ago, the I.P.O. price might have been lower and the need for a huge increase in G.M.’s value afterward far greater. The Treasury, whose G.M. efforts are being led by Ron Bloom, changed its tune and focused less on getting out quickly and more on exiting with minimal damage to taxpayers. That is a sensible about-face, but it still leaves getting back in the black a ways off. Buffett’s Swiss Stake Warren E. Buffett may struggle to repeat his Swiss Re exit. The billionaire bailed out three big companies during the financial crisis: the Swiss insurer, General Electric and Goldman Sachs. On Thursday, he allowed Swiss Re to buy back its expensive convertible stock. He may have less leeway to be as generous with the other two. Of the three deals, Mr. Buffett’s $3.1 billion investment in Swiss Re convertible shares had the most stipulations. Negotiated at the depths of the market slump, the stock paid a 12 percent annual coupon until March 2012, when it would convert into ordinary shares at 25 Swiss francs, or $25.53. As Swiss Re’s share price is now twice that, the insurer was eager to buy back the convertibles. But it had also agreed to pay Mr. Buffett a 40 percent premium if it redeemed before March 2011, and a 20 percent premium after that. Mr. Buffett is allowing Swiss Re to pay only a 20 percent premium, as well as the interest he would have received next March. That means he collects $1 billion, rather than the $1.6 billion to which he was entitled. That may look generous. But Mr. Buffett also owns 3 percent of Swiss Re’s stock, which will benefit from the redemption of the expensive convertible securities. The shares jumped more than 6 percent At first glance, Mr. Buffett faces a similar situation with Goldman and G.E., where he holds preferred shares worth $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Both would like to buy back the stock, which pays an annual coupon of 10 percent. He also has warrants over shares of both companies, giving him an incentive to help raise the stock price. But there is less room for a Swiss Re-style agreement. Because Goldman can redeem its preferred stock at any time for a 10 percent premium, it does not need Mr. Buffett to give it an early discount. G.E.’s stock cannot be redeemed until October 2011, opening the door for a negotiation. But Berkshire Hathaway’s G.E. warrants are deeply out of the money. That means it is unlikely to benefit from any short-term boost to GE’s shares. Despite Mr. Buffett’s apparent generosity with Swiss Re, Goldman and G.E. should not assume he will take the same approach with them.</text></article>

The banks are offloading businesses to comply with new rules, repay government loans or raise money to meet more stringent capital requirements. Even mighty Goldman Sachs is not immune. Its proprietary trading desk in New York, which spawned the careers of Robert E. Rubin and dozens of successful hedge fund managers, is heading to the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as Goldman winds down the operation to comply with new federal regulations. Other private equity firms are also expanding and diversifying. This year, for example, Apollo Global Management acquired Citigroup's real estate investment group, and Blackstone Group took over Bank of America's Asian property business. The hiring of the nine-person team Goldman team, led by Bob Howard, represents K.K.R.'s entry into stock trading. The firm is expected to raise money from outside investors for a hedge fund to be managed by Mr. Howard and his colleagues. The business will help the newly public K.K.R. expand beyond its core private equity operations of buying and selling companies using large amounts of debt. K.K.R. has already expanded into other areas, including a fixed-income asset management arm and a capital markets division that underwrites stock and bond offerings for companies. In its efforts to diversify, K.K.R., co-founded by the billionaire Henry R. Kravis, pictured, is playing catch-up to its largest rival, the Blackstone Group. Blackstone already has four distinct operations; corporate buyouts, real estate investing, hedge funds and advisory services. The evolution of private equity firms into broader money management businesses is occurring as the firms' founders - many of whom are in their 60s - look to cash out by selling stakes to the public. K.K.R. joined Blackstone as a New York Stock Exchange-listed company in July. Other firms that are either preparing or exploring public listings include Apollo and Carlyle Group. As publicly traded companies, these firms are under pressure not only to raise more capital and generate more profits but also to smooth out their earnings by diversifying into areas other than the historically volatile business of private equity. Their expansion efforts are not without risk. Carlyle's reputation was seriously damaged in 2008, when Carlyle Capital, a hedge fund that invested in mortgage securities, imploded in the credit crisis. The move by Mr. Howard and his colleagues to K.K.R. means the unwinding of a Goldman unit that gave rise to many Wall Street luminaries. Once known as the risk arbitrage desk and now called principal strategies, its alumni include Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, and hedge fund managers like Edward S. Lampert, chairman of Sears Holding Corporation, and Daniel S. Och, chief of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group. But new regulations have compelled Goldman to leave this business. Rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the most sweeping financial regulatory overhaul in decades, have limited the involvement of Goldman and other banks in riskier investments like hedge funds and proprietary trading, in which firms bet their own capital. After the restrictions were passed, Goldman bankers fanned out across their client base to help the traders find a new home. A number of firms competed with K.K.R. to hire the Goldman team, including Avenue Capital and Perella Weinberg. Other members of Goldman's proprietary trading desk abroad, like the team in Asia led by Morgan Sze, have weighed their options, which include establishing a fund. Even after jettisoning the United States unit, Goldman has some trading desks that invest with the company's capital, a business model that has come under fire since the financial crisis. It is unclear what Goldman intends to do with those businesses, which include its special situations group in the fixed-income division. Mr. Howard, 39, who leads the United States principal strategies unit, has spent his entire career at Goldman. After graduating from Harvard College, he spent two years as an analyst in investment banking and capital markets before returning to Harvard to earn a master's degree in business administration. He rejoined Goldman in 1998 as an associate in what became principal strategies and remained there ever since. When Mr. Howard and his team start on Jan. 1, he will join many Goldman alumni at K.K.R., which has a close relationship with the investment bank. He will report to William Sonneborn, a former Goldman banker who heads K.K.R.'s asset-management division. And this is not the first merger between K.K.R. and Goldman Sachs this year. In May, a K.K.R. co-founder, George R. Roberts, married Linnea Conrad, a Goldman Sachs investment banker. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Goldman Sachs, which consistently manages to outsmart its rivals when it comes to making money, posted rather ordinary results on Tuesday for the third quarter. The earnings report was the most telling illustration yet of how the slowdown in trading has dented the Wall Street profit machines. Global markets remain fragile two years after the credit crisis unleashed the worst economic rout since the Great Depression. Investors, stung by the May flash crash when the Dow Jones industrial average briefly plunged more than 900 points before recovering, remain shaken and are staying close to the sidelines. Goldman is a trading powerhouse and its quarter suffered as a result. Net revenue in the business that trades bonds, currencies and commodities fell 37 percent, to $3.77 billion. This division accounted for 42 percent of all revenue generated by the firm in the third quarter. Net revenue from equities trading and commissions fell 33 percent, to $1.86 billion. In addition, firms like Goldman are facing new regulatory changes that have and will continue to hurt the earnings power of financial firms. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act signed into law by President Obama in July, restricts certain operations, like proprietary trading. Goldman has already wound down this business, which it previously said accounted for less than 10 percent of its revenue annually. Rules both at home and abroad also have or will require big financial firms to hold more capital against riskier operations. This will most likely force banks like Goldman to exit less profitable business lines. ''It is tremendously challenging for all these firms to grow their business when clients are not that active and they are also busy recalibrating to a new regulatory environment,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura Securities. In a sign of how challenging the business has become, Goldman's return on equity, an important benchmark on Wall Street that shows how efficiently a firm is generating profits from the money shareholders have invested, fell to 10.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with 21.4 percent in the quarter a year ago. In the second quarter, it was 7.9 percent. But Goldman's return on equity since it went public has been 24 percent, and its target is to produce a 20 percent return on equity. Goldman's chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, said during an investor conference call with analysts that ''many of the market concerns that were most prevalent in the second quarter of 2010 continued into the third quarter'' and investors continued to be concerned about pending legislation both at home and abroad. While confidence among chief executives has picked up, he said, it remains fragile. ''These factors, combined with the seasonal dynamics of the third quarter, negatively impacted activity levels within many of our businesses,'' he said. He seemed only marginally more upbeat about business conditions during the last six weeks, which will show up when Goldman reports its fourth-quarter earnings in January, saying while business picked up in September, it wasn't ''roaring.'' For the third quarter, Goldman said its earnings slumped 40 percent, to $1.9 billion, or $2.98 a share, compared with $3.19 billion, or $5.25 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Net revenue was $8.9 billion. Those numbers exceeded analysts' estimates that had been lowered in recent weeks. The most recent survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters had forecast Goldman to earn $2.28 a share, down from estimates of $3.37 a share a month ago. Shares of Goldman rose nearly 2 percent, or $3.02, to $156.72, on a day when the broader marker was down sharply. Mr. Schorr of Nomura noted that despite the dip in revenue in the quarter, Goldman did not tinker with its compensation and benefit accrual, a decision that lowers return on equity in the current period. He expects Goldman to set aside less money for compensation and benefits in the fourth quarter, which will most likely lift the firm's full year 2010 return on equity. Bonus season is soon approaching; Wall Street typically lets employees know their bonus number in December. Goldman has been the target of criticism from Washington and Main Street over its quick return to profitability and big bonuses months after the financial crisis, when financial firms, including Goldman, were forced to accept government help. Goldman set aside $3.8 billion in compensation in the third quarter. It will not decide what it will pay out until the fourth quarter, but so far this year it has put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees. And while business may have slowed, Goldman's ranks actually grew by 1,300 employees in the quarter. The firm said it had hired primarily in Asia and London in its asset management division, bringing on more staff members to deal with big pension funds and other clients. There were a few bright spots in the quarter for Goldman. The firm posted net revenue, or revenue minus interest expense, in its investment bank of $1.1 billion, up 24 percent from the period a year earlier.

    <article index="17" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/20views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman in the Pack, Not Leading It<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs is coming down to earth with a bit of a bump. Sure, the third-quarter earnings of $1.9 billion handily beat what analysts had expected for the Wall Street giant, led by Lloyd Blankfein. That’s good news any time, and especially after talk of a summer slowdown. But Goldman’s results usually lead the pack. Not this time.Take the company’s market-leading franchise in fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, where revenue fell 14 percent from the second quarter, or around 10 percent after accounting for losses taken by marking up the value of its own debt. That’s not bad. But it’s the biggest drop of the major companies that have reported so far. Citigroup’s revenue in the same business area was almost flat, and JPMorgan Chase’s actually improved slightly after adjusting for marking its liabilities to market value. Traders at a resurgent Bank of America took in more than 50 percent more revenue than in the previous three months and crowed about logging a perfect record, meaning no trading losses on any day in the quarter. It’s the second quarter in a row that Goldman’s traders have slipped. Last time, revenue at the company’s equities unit fell precipitously. That helped push company’s second-quarter return on equity down to 9.5 percent, excluding the one-time British bonus tax and the cost of settling a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, the company managed to improve only to a humdrum 10.3 percent return on equity. Compare that to JPMorgan: its investment bank returned 13 percent, and its asset management unit 25 percent. Goldman’s showing is hardly disastrous. Its investment bankers enjoyed a decent summer, with underwriting revenue jumping 40 percent and mergers bringing in 5 percent more income. Equities trading recovered somewhat, and at $3.77 billion, Goldman’s revenue from trading in fixed income, currency and commodities is still the largest in its peer group. And the relative underperformance of the bank’s traders of late may just be a blip in their otherwise enviable record. But for once, these sometimes omniscient-seeming masters of the financial universe are looking like mere mortals. Renminbi Hope China’s first interest rate increase since 2007 sounds more momentous than it actually is. But the modesty of the 0.25 percentage point move means there’s scope for more substantial action on the country’s too-cheap currency. There are two good reasons for China to tighten, namely to push interest rates above inflation and to curb runaway property prices. The new, higher deposit rate of 2.5 percent and lending rate of 5.56 percent won’t really do either. The central bank’s action may just take the edge off stirring inflation, but the maximum allowable reward for holding deposits is still below the hoped-for inflation rate of 3 percent. Depositors’ own inflation expectations are likely to be much higher. China’s savings are still being bled away. Dwindling savings returns have driven depositors back to real-estate speculation, and the rate increases won’t be enough to reverse that. Urban property prices rose 9.1 percent year-on-year in September, and total transactions by value were up more than 50 percent from August. Raising interest rates might threaten a property crash if buyers were highly mortgaged, but they are not. Moreover, the expectation of property gains is now so engrained that a tiny rise in rates is unlikely to dampen the mania. The rate increases may be only a baby step, but they aren’t pointless. Data on the country’s gross domestic product and on inflation to be released Thursday are likely to show that demand remains strong and price pressures are rising. China’s G.D.P. is expected to grow by 10 percent this year. That means interest rates are still low in absolute terms and there is room for more tightening of the kind that both China’s consumers and trade partners really need. Beijing can help control inflation by allowing its currency to appreciate, putting a damper on commodity and other input prices. That would make Chinese exporters less competitive but not deter the budding consumers the country hopes to promote. A stronger renminbi is what almost all of China’s trade partners crave, especially given the currency’s recent declines against almost all of its major trading partners. By raising rates just a little, Beijing may have left itself room for a welcome sequel.</text></article>

Watchdog Says No Political Motivation in Goldman Lawsuit<date>Published: October 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — An investigation by the inspector general of the Securities and Exchange Commission found no evidence that the agency’s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs was politically motivated or that S.E.C. officials leaked advance information about the lawsuit to the media.H. David Kotz, the S.E.C. inspector general, who is an independent watchdog for the agency, said in a report dated Sept. 30 and released late Wednesday that his investigation “found that the investigation’s procedural path and timing was governed primarily by decisions relating to the case itself.” The agency’s initial filing on April 16 of a lawsuit charging Goldman Sachs with defrauding investors with its disclosures about a subprime mortgage investment led to immediate speculation that it was timed to help spur Senate action on the pending bill to strengthen financial regulation. While Mr. Kotz also received complaints that some media, including The New York Times, received advanced notice of the lawsuit, he said he found no evidence of such a leak. But the chief of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, Robert S. Khuzami, testified that the settlement of the lawsuit, announced on July 15, was in reaction to an article about a possible settlement in The Wall Street Journal and fear of further leaks. The inspector general did not find evidence that the Goldman suit was filed on the same day that he released a critical report of the S.E.C.’s actions in the R. Allen Stanford case to deflect attention from that news. Mr. Kotz did criticize the S.E.C. enforcement division for failing to notify Goldman of its lawsuit until after the papers were filed in federal court, a violation of administrative regulations. The agency’s failure to notify the New York Stock Exchange of the pending news also contributed to increased volatility in the markets on the day of the filing, the inspector general said.</text></article>

Energy Future Holdings has been working to restructure its $40 billion worth of debt, which originated from 2007 when the company found itself the target of the largest ever leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs. Since then, the price of gas has dropped drastically, and Energy Futures has fallen on hard times, The Post said. The energy company is hoping to get Mr. Buffett, as well as other unsecured bondholders, to exchange a total of $6 billion of their debt in a subsidiary, known as TCEH, at about 70 percent of its actual value for a debt that matures later, The Post reported. Trying to answer why Mr. Buffett and other bondholders might agree to such a deal, The Post writes: If the TCEH subsidiary goes bankrupt, as analysts predict it will 2014, unsecured bondholders run the risk of not recouping their investment as holders of the new debt would get paid before them. “You are in a prisoner’s dilemma,” said one bond trader.

Penney has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser as the retailer braces for a possible battle from the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, Women’s Wear Daily reports. In selecting Goldman, J.C. Penney is following the approach taken by rival Target, which also used the firm to help devise its successful defense against Mr. Ackman’s proxy challenge in 2009. Securities filings late last week showed that Mr.Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had taken a 16.5 percent stake in J.C. Penney. Pershing is a major real-estate investor, most prominently of late with General Growth Properties, a huge mall operator getting ready to emerge from bankruptcy. Mr. Ackman is working with another major player in commercial real estate, Vornado Realty, which disclosed last week that it had taken a 9.9 percent in J.C. Penney. Both Vornado and General Growth are landlords for J.C. Penney stores. J.C. Penney’s chief executive, Myron E. Ullman III, is expected to meet with Mr. Ackman and Steven Roth within the next 10 days, Women’s Wear Daily said. Shares of J.C. Penney, which surged sharply on Friday on news of the ownership stakes, slipped slightly in midday trading on Wednesday. The company has a market value of nearly $8 billion.

Weinberg Jr., Former Goldman Executive, Dies at 87<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a senior director of Goldman Sachs and a member of the family dynasty that had played a central role at the investment banking firm since 1907, died Monday at his home in Marion, Mass. Mr. Weinberg, who was also a significant philanthropist, was 87.His death was confirmed by his daughter Sydney Houghton Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs as a general partner in 1965 and led its investment banking services department from 1978 to 1988. He became a limited partner that year and, since 1999, had been a senior director. Mr. Weinberg’s father, Sidney J. Weinberg, was chief executive of Goldman Sachs from 1939 until his death in 1969 and earned the sobriquet “Mr. Wall Street.” His brother, John L. Weinberg, who died in 2006, led the company from 1976 to 1990. In 1971, Mr. Weinberg started a foundation that bears his name and has since made approximately $50 million in grants to support health, science and education institutions, among them New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Princeton University, the Harvard Business School, Claremont Colleges in California, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the New York Times College Scholarship Program. Sidney James Weinberg Jr. was born in Scarsdale, N.Y., on March 27, 1923, one of two sons of Sidney and Helen Livingston Weinberg. After serving in the Army in the Philippines during World War II, he completed his bachelor’s degree at Princeton in 1947 and two years later received a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard. Mr. Weinberg was vice president of the textile division of the Owens Corning company before joining Goldman Sachs. Besides his daughter Sydney, he is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Elizabeth Houghton; another daughter, Elizabeth Smith; a son, Peter; two stepsons, James and Alan McCord; a stepdaughter, Laura Grauer; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</text></article>

Reuters said that Gymboree hired the investment bank last month after it was approached by at least two firms — one of which was Apollo Management, the paper reported. The billionaire Leon Black’s Apollo Management — whose recent unsolicited approach to Gymboree helped spur the auction that’s now under way, according to one source — is expected to be among the leading bidders, The Post said.

Lists Risks as It Launches $15 Billion I.P.O.<date>October 5, 2010, 6:45 am</date><text>The American International Group‘s Asian life insurance unit, which plans to raise up to $14.9 billion from its initial public offering, flagged a series of business risks including the collapsed bid from a British rival, Prudential, as it launched the share offering on Tuesday, Reuters said. The subsidiary, American International Assurance, plans to raise between $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion by selling 5.86 billion shares at 18.38 Hong Kong dollars to 19.68 Hong Kong dollars each, according to a document obtained by Reuters. Including an overallotment option, the I.P.O. could raise up to $17.1 billion, according to the news service. The net proceeds will be used to repay financial aid A.I.G. received from the United States government. A.I.G. revived A.I.A.’s offering after Prudential cut its takeover offer for the unit to $30.4 billion, from $35.5 billion. In contrast, the I.P.O. would value A.I.A. at as much as $30.5 billion, according to Reuters. “The terminated Prudential transaction also adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact agency recruitment and new business production by our agents,” A.I.A. said in its prospectus. “We cannot assure you that our business and prospects will not be materially and adversely affected by the terminated Prudential transaction.” Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators for the I.P.O. Though the total amount has yet to be determined, the standard Hong Kong I.P.O. fee would have the banks involved splitting roughly $500 million in fees.

Now, after a stretch of time when the limelight has been particularly harsh, the company has started its first national advertising campaign aimed not at potential clients, but at ordinary people. Full-page advertisements ran on Wednesday in a number of newspapers, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The campaign, being managed by Young &amp; Rubicam, will continue into next year, with print advertisements in national, regional and local newspapers and banner advertisements on various Web sites, saidDavid Wells, a spokesman for Goldman. He declined to say how much the company planned to spend on the campaign. ''We need to provide a broader audience a better understanding of who we are and what we need to do,'' Mr. Wells said. ''This is meant to help do that.'' Bearing the tagline ''Progress is Everyone's Business,'' the advertisement that ran Wednesday included a photograph of several wind turbines next to a close-up shot of a smiling, hard-hat-wearing worker standing at the base of a turbine. Future advertisements will highlight work that Goldman has done for a range of clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions and individuals, Mr. Wells said. This is not the first time that Goldman has started a national advertising campaign. Shortly after it went public in 1999, Goldman began a campaign that was estimated to cost $10 million. This time, the company is trying to repair a public image that has been damaged by accusations that it profited during the financial crisis. In July, Goldman, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations in the sale of mortgage securities. And public sentiment goes beyond the headlines.Warren E. Buffett, a Goldman investor who has defended the company, captured the mood in an appearance on CNBC in March. Soon, he said, ''they're going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs offering the apple.'' Goldman's chief executive,Lloyd C. Blankfein, has acknowledged that his company has an image problem. ''We have a lot of work to do explaining to people what it is that we do,'' Mr. Blankfein said on the ''Charlie Rose'' television show in April. ''And we're starting from a hole.'' As its most visible step yet in that effort, the company's print ad on Wednesday attracted mixed reviews from marketing professors and people in the advertising industry. Several people described the ad as a fairly standard corporate image ad, consistent with what unpopular companies - say, BP, to take another example - tend to produce when trying to refurbish their image. ''It's tough for any firm to do when an industry is somewhat tainted and when there's a lot of negative sentiment,'' said Kevin L. Keller, a professor of marketing at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ''You're swimming upstream so much.'' And Goldman is evidently proceeding with caution. ''Low key'' was frequently used to describe the advertisement, which pointed readers to a Web page that further details Goldman's work to ''make progress happen,'' in the company's words. In the top-right corner of the advertisement, the Goldman logo took up barely more than one square inch of space. ''It's a huge ad, and you have to squint to be able to see that it's by Goldman,'' said Russell S. Winer, chairman of the marketing department at the New York University Stern School of Business. ''If I just saw the ad, I might think it was for a utility company.'' Others were less forgiving. Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of the Kaplan Thaler Group, a Manhattan ad agency, was mystified by the decision to focus the first advertisement on renewable energy. Wind turbines, she pointed out, are everywhere in energy-related advertisements these days. ''It just looks like a lot of breast-beating, but doesn't really get to the heart of: how has this company changed in a way that I can find them trustworthy?'' she said. ''My verdict is wasted energy.'' - Thomas Kaplan This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The company did not say how many shares it plans to sell or at what price per share in a recent filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. The underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have a 30-day option to buy more shares. GNC Acquisition Holdings plans to use the proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. Last year, GNC’s net income totaled $69.5 million on $1.71 billion in revenue. For the six month ended June 30, net income rose to $51.1 million from $37.4 million in the year-ago period. Revenue increased by nearly 6 percent to $920.7 million from $872.3 million. GNC is owned by an affiliate of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, which bought the store chain in 2007 for $1.65 billion from Apollo Management. Following the I.P.O., the group will hold an undisclosed interest in GNC. It will control the company’s affairs and policies, including the election of directors, mergers or sales of assets and other significant transactions, according to the filing. This isn’t the first time GNC has filed for an I.P.O. Apollo tried to take GNC public twice, but withdrew because of faltering sales and unfavorable market conditions.

The problem? The trader knew that flashing his Goldman credentials at the ticket window would mean risking sneers (or worse) from the tourists and museum employees standing nearby. Instead, he pocketed his ID and paid $20. Everyday questions like this are not uncommon at Goldman, where a damaged public image and executive caution have put the firm's junior analysts on red alert, reluctant to talk about their jobs outside company walls for fear of judgment from outsiders and punishment within the firm. ''It feels like I'm working for the C.I.A.,'' the analyst said. Privacy has long been part of life at investment banks, not just at Goldman. Confidentiality clauses are routinely written into employment contracts, and workers are given strict orders not to cooperate with news media requests. For that reason, all the Goldman employees interviewed for this article spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Still, many of Goldman's younger employees feel additional pressure to keep their lives hidden from view now that the firm is in the limelight. ''Working at Goldman right out of college used to be something you wore on your chest,'' said Patrick Curtis, a former investment banker and founder of the popular finance blog WallStreetOasis.com. ''Now, there's a stigma, and that creates a tremendous pressure for these guys to be vague and discreet when they're around nonfinance people.'' A Goldman representative declined to comment for this article. This summer, a group of new Goldman employees tried to leave the firm's 200 West Street headquarters wearing training nametags emblazoned with the firm's logo, but were stopped by a security guard at the door. ''Take those off before you go outside,'' the guard ordered, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. The Met visitor said that during his training, they were told ''nobody should be able to identify us as Goldman employees once we left the office.'' ''Personal anonymity is almost a core value'' at the firm, founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman, writes Charles D. Ellis in his 2008 book ''The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs'' (Penguin Press). According to Mr. Ellis's account, the namesake partner Samuel Sachs ''believed public relations was a bad thing and would have none of it.'' But Goldman and Sachs themselves might have blanched at the extent of the clampdown that has spread across their firm. Not all of Goldman's employees are put off by the firm's opacity. A recent survey of financial professionals taken by Vault, a career advice Web site, gave Goldman top marks for prestige (as rated by those outside the firm) and quality of life (as rated by those within it). ''Frankly, I'm still proud to tell people I work here,'' said a third-year analyst. ''Regardless of how much scrutiny we get, it's still the best place to work on the Street.'' And having to stay tightlipped is arguably only a slight inconvenience compared with the demands of a job at a bustling investment bank. ''You have to remember, a lot of these guys work 100-hour weeks,'' said Mr. Curtis of WallStreetOasis. ''They don't have time to talk to their friends about anything.'' Still, other Wall Street firms, now that the financial regulation overhaul is in place and there are signs that the public's rage may be slowly subsiding, are beginning to give their young employees a slightly longer leash. A first-year analyst at Morgan Stanley, whose company perks this summer included an open-bar cruise on the Hudson River, said: ''We haven't been given any crazy rules. The people running our training basically said, 'Conduct yourself appropriately, and don't say anything over e-mail you wouldn't want to see in the newspaper.' '' Some young Goldman employees have found their tight privacy restrictions to be a source of mystique. ''It's actually sort of obnoxious,'' said one private equity analyst with friends who work at Goldman. ''They all go around calling it 'the Firm,' and we're supposed to know which firm they're talking about.'' - Kevin Roose Go to DealBook's Fall 2010 Special Section&gt;&gt; This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The panelists included Washington regulators - the very people who will decide how to put to work the new Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul bill passed in July. ''What is the S.E.C. doing to define venture capital funds?'' one attendee asked Jennifer B. McHugh, a senior adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission's chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro. ''And what about financial advisers?'' asked another audience member. To each such question - and there were many - Ms. McHugh's answers were both consistent and noncommittal: ''That is a good question, and we're working on it.'' Welcome to the moment of maximum uncertainty. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the nation's most comprehensive financial overhaul since the Great Depression, is now the law of the land. But with a few exceptions, like the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, much of the detail on how those new rules will work is in the hands of the Obama administration's financial regulators, who have been given enormous latitude to come up with the new rules of the road. Compounding the uncertainty is the fact that the country is a little more than a month away from midterm elections, when Republicans are expected to gains seats, perhaps enough to take over the House of Representatives. Should that happen, a serious effort will most likely be made to roll back parts of the law, or at least minimize its effects. Both John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, and Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are on record calling for a repeal of the consumer bureau. Although that is highly unlikely, a Republican-controlled Congress would certainly push to limit its powers and regulatory reach. Already, Wall Street has begun marshaling a battle plan to press a Republican-led Congress to ease some of the rules being drawn up, like restrictions on derivatives and proprietary trading. Another target is the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, otherwise known as the bank tax. Originally meant to help pay back the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and rein in risk-taking, it has been met with grumbling by Wall Street. Republicans have been pledging privately to bankers that, should they win, they will seek to block it. ''This would be much more than a tax on banks,'' Thomas P. Quaadman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said in a statement. ''This tax would choke off consumers' access to credit and make our bad economic situation worse.'' Even without the specter of the midterms, putting the new rules into effect is very much a work in progress, and the stakes are high for consumers and for banks afraid that too many new hurdles will dent profits. Here is a typical example that has received relatively little attention. Under the current law, a stockbroker can be defined as either a broker-dealer or an investment adviser. The latter is obligated to act in the customer's best interest; the former can operate under a less stringent standard. Because broker-dealers are not considered fiduciaries, they can sell a client products that are suitable, but not necessarily best, for the client. Congress has asked the S.E.C. to study the differences in oversight between the categories and report back on the shortcomings of existing standards. Some Wall Street executives fear the S.E.C. will raise the standards for broker-dealers, limiting their firms' ability to sell in-house products that pull in millions of dollars of revenue. State regulators, however, generally want one rule that holds broker-dealers to the same fiduciary standard as investment bankers. Some banks argue that too-strict rules may harm their ability to compete with global rivals. ''Large U.S. banks must be fully competitive with larger European and Asian banks in all spheres,'' Daniel Alpert, a founding partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital, said. While the rule-making process is far from over, it is not too early to place bets on the likely winners and losers. GOLDMAN SACHS Conventional wisdom dictates that Goldman comes out on top. Like other firms, Goldman is trying to get ahead of the new law instead of waiting for things to play out.</text></article>

Globally, stock underwriting proceeds have slipped 9 percent so far this year, as investors prove less willing to take risks amid an uncertain economic recovery, according to Reuters. Proceeds from global equity capital markets underwriting activity have fallen to $496.14 billion from $544.96 billion so far this year. But the number of deals has increased 5.6 percent to 2,817 deals compared with a year earlier as banks have been willing to underwrite smaller offerings. JPMorgan Chase kept its No.1 ranking, with Morgan Stanley in the No. 2 spot, while Goldman Sachs was third. JPMorgan brought in proceeds of just $39.5 billion compared with $80.07 billion a year earlier.

No more playing bridge, either — he jokingly accuses his brain surgeon of robbing him of the gray matter that contained all the bidding strategy. But when Mr. Murray, a former bond salesman for Goldman Sachs who rose to the managing director level at both Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse First Boston, decided to cease all treatment five months ago for his glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, his first impulse was not to mourn what he couldn’t do anymore or to buy an island or to move to Paris. Instead, he hunkered down in his tiny home office here and channeled whatever remaining energy he could muster into a slim paperback. It’s called “The Investment Answer,” and he wrote it with his friend and financial adviser Daniel Goldie to explain investing in a handful of simple steps. Why a book? And why this subject? Nine years ago, after retiring from 25 years of pushing bonds on pension and mutual fund managers trying to beat the market averages over long periods of time, Mr. Murray had an epiphany about the futility of his former customers’ pursuits. He eventually went to work as a consultant for Dimensional Fund Advisors, a mutual fund company that rails against active money management. So when his death sentence arrived, Mr. Murray knew he had to work quickly and resolved to get the word out to as many everyday investors as he could. “This is one of the true benefits of having a brain tumor,” Mr. Murray said, laughing. “Everyone wants to hear what you have to say.” He and Mr. Goldie have managed to beat the clock, finishing and printing the book themselves while Mr. Murray is still alive. It is plenty useful for anyone who isn’t already investing in a collection of index or similar funds and dutifully rebalancing every so often. But the mere fact that Mr. Murray felt compelled to write it is itself a remarkable story of an almost willful ignorance of the futility of active money management — and how he finally stumbled upon a better way of investing. Mr. Murray now stands as one the highest-ranking Wall Street veterans to take back much of what he and his colleagues worked for during their careers. Mr. Murray grew up in Baltimore, about the farthest thing from a crusader that you could imagine. “I was the kid you didn’t want your daughter to date,” he said. “I stole baseball cards and cheated on Spanish tests and made fun of the fat kid in the corner with glasses.” He got a lot of second chances thanks to an affluent background and basketball prowess. He eventually landed at Goldman Sachs, long before many people looked askance at anyone who worked there. “Our word was our bond, and good ethics was good business,” he said of his Wall Street career. “That got replaced by liar loans and ‘I hope I’m gone by the time this thing blows up.’ ” After rising to managing director at two other banks, Mr. Murray retired in 2001. At the time, his personal portfolio was the standard Wall Street big-shot barbell, with a pile of municipal bonds at one end to provide safe tax-free income and private equity and hedge fund investments at the other. When some of those bonds came due, he sought out Mr. Goldie, a former professional tennis player and 1989 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, for advice on what to buy next. Right away, Mr. Goldie began teaching him about Dimensional’s funds. The fact that Mr. Murray knew little up until that point about basic asset allocation among stocks and bonds and other investments or the failings of active portfolio management is shocking, until you consider the self-regard that his master-of-the-universe colleagues taught him. “It’s American to think that if you’re smart or work hard, then you can beat the markets,” he said. But it didn’t take long for Mr. Murray to become a true believer in this different way of investing. “I learned more through Dan and Dimensional in a year than I did in 25 years on Wall Street,” he said. Soon Dimensional hired him as a consultant, helping financial advisers who use its funds explain the company’s anti-Wall Street investment philosophy to its clients. “The most inspirational people who talk about alcoholism are people who have gone through A.A.,” said David Booth, Dimensional’s founder and chairman. “It’s the people who have had the experience and now see the light who are our biggest advocates.” Playing that role was enough for Mr. Murray until he received his diagnosis in 2008. But not long after, in the wake of the financial collapse, he testified before a open briefing at the House of Representatives, wondering aloud how it was possible that prosecutors had not yet won criminal convictions against anyone in charge at his old firms and their competitors.</text></article>

Baijiu, a clear drink that is 50 percent alcohol, is China’s national pride.The sector has been largely off limits to foreign investors, but Diageo, the British distiller, wants to pop it open with a $1.1 billion bid for Shui Jing Fang, a liquor producer. China can show openness by letting Diageo in, and in turn, that could help the country pick up useful skills Diageo covets access to a large and uniquely Chinese market. Top-end baijiu sells for as much $200 a bottle, and sales are growing by more than 10 percent a year, Euromonitor International reported. Shui Jing Fang, in which Diageo owns 40 percent, has a 30 percent operating margin. That is on par with Diageo’s margin and higher than Pernod Ricard’s. Regulators seem to have other ideas. Top liquor brands are on a list in which foreign investment is restricted. True, Shui Jing Fang does not technically appear on the 20-year-old list of such protected brands, even though it is one of China’s largest premium white liquor companies. But the deal has been stuck with the regulator since March. Defending baijiu may inflame protectionism fears. Business leaders are wary after Canada blocked BHP’s bid for the Potash Corporation. China set a precedent in 2009 when it stopped Coca-Cola from buying the juice maker Huiyuan. British politicians have waded in, with the British business secretary, Vince Cable, pledging to support the distiller’s case on his current trip to China. China can afford to change the rules. Approving the deal would send a positive message about openness, which may win China friends when it is under attack for its trade imbalances. Diageo may be able to help foreigners develop more of a taste for baijiu. And as China buys resources like gas and oil in other countries, protecting its spirits industry is hard to justify. Chinese liquor makers may learn some skills from Diageo, which specializes in high-end brands. Western companies still have a distinct advantage in luxury goods. If China wants baijiu to be the new single malt, raising a glass to open markets would be a start. Goldman Begins Shift Closing its proprietary trading desks is just one stage in Goldman Sachs’s makeover, and an early one at that. The Wall Street firm confirmed in a regulatory filing that it had “liquidated substantially all” the positions taken by its principal strategies group. The Volcker Rule required the move. But shutting so-called prop desks is emblematic of a broader shift at the bank. Goldman used to be the master of managing conflicts, perceived or otherwise. Though some clients suspected that the firm’s prop desk was trading against them, Goldman convinced enough of them of its savvy that it was able to increase its trading client base by about 50 percent, to 6,000, from 2006 to 2009. Goldman was also the only major bank to keep its in-house private equity unit intact a few years ago while others folded theirs after buyout funds complained of having to compete with their lenders. Not that Goldman was immune to stepping over the line. In 2006, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Goldman’s chief executive, had to chastise some of his own bankers and private equity executives for collaborating a little too closely. Of course, the Volcker Rule limits private equity, too. But potential conflicts also lurk elsewhere, like in structuring deals like Abacus, the mortgage security that led to a $550 million regulatory fine. Or in advisory: rare though such deals are, it is unlikely Goldman could (or would now want to) dominate a deal like the New York Stock Exchange’s 2005 buyout of Archipelago. It advised both sides and owned a piece of the exchange. Eliminating conflicts will not be easy: working its way around them is part of Goldman’s DNA. And there is enough leeway in the Volcker Rule for suspicions to linger that banks can still make bets with their own money. Overcoming that will take time. But eradicating conflicts could help keep Goldman out of the news and away from regulatory ire. Its partners would surely welcome that. WEI GU and ANTONY CURRIE</text></article>

Goldman was ordered in June to pay $20.6 million to unsecured creditors of the failed hedge fund manager Bayou Group to settle claims that the bank had ignored signs of fraud at the fund. The bank appealed the decision in July, and on Monday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan rejected Goldman's request to vacate the award. ''After full consideration of the parties' briefs and oral argument, the court hereby denies the petition to vacate the arbitration award and grants the cross-petition to confirm the award,'' Judge Rakoff wrote. ''However, final judgment will not be entered in this case until the court issues an opinion setting forth the reasons for this ruling.'' A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on Monday. Ross Intelisano, a partner at New York law firm Rich &amp; Intelisano who represented Bayou creditors, said, ''We are looking forward to investors finally getting some of their money back from this tragic fraud.'' Bayou collapsed in 2005, and the firm's former chief executive,Samuel Israel III, is serving 20 years in prison for fraud. Mr. Israel pleaded guilty to misrepresenting the value of Bayou's funds and defrauding clients out of more than $400 million. Goldman cleared trades for Bayou, which was based in Connecticut, before it collapsed. Bayou's unsecured creditors' committee filed the arbitration claim against Goldman in 2008. During the arbitration, Goldman denied accusations that it had ignored signs of wrongdoing. Goldman is not out of options; it can appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The award was considered a watershed and could have ramifications across the financial sector. Wall Street firms, which handle billions of dollars in trades, assert that their job is simply to clear trades, not police the clients. If upheld, the award could raise the standard among banks for clearing trades. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article>

Payback Still a Long Way Ahead<date>Published: November 4, 2010</date><text>Taxpayers will have to wait a while to reclaim the money invested to keep General Motors out of the scrapyard. The carmaker is running far more smoothly after declaring bankruptcy last year: it earned as much as $2.1 billion in the three months to September, its third straight quarter of profits. But the terms of G.M.’s coming share sale show that, once public, the stock will have to as much as double before its biggest shareholder, the United States government, gets close to breaking even.Assume G.M.’s initial public offering starts at $26, the bottom of the projected price range. That would mean the Treasury, which owns 61 percent, would be taking a 42 percent loss on any stock it sells in the offering. It is planning to sell 263 million shares. If it does, G.M. shares would need to more than double to get back into the black on its investment, reaching more than $52 a share, according to a Reuters Breakingviews analysis. The hurdle for G.M.’s debut performance lowers if G.M.’s bankers can sell the shares at the top of the price range. But if the underwriters sell more of the Treasury’s stock in the I.P.O., the barrier to breaking even increases. The calculation is similar for the G.M. stakes held by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Over all, this sounds like a tall order. All things being equal, it implies that G.M. will have to essentially double its profits. But it could have been worse. Had the Treasury insisted on dumping more stock on the market, as appeared to be the case just a few months ago, the I.P.O. price might have been lower and the need for a huge increase in G.M.’s value afterward far greater. The Treasury, whose G.M. efforts are being led by Ron Bloom, changed its tune and focused less on getting out quickly and more on exiting with minimal damage to taxpayers. That is a sensible about-face, but it still leaves getting back in the black a ways off. Buffett’s Swiss Stake Warren E. Buffett may struggle to repeat his Swiss Re exit. The billionaire bailed out three big companies during the financial crisis: the Swiss insurer, General Electric and Goldman Sachs. On Thursday, he allowed Swiss Re to buy back its expensive convertible stock. He may have less leeway to be as generous with the other two. Of the three deals, Mr. Buffett’s $3.1 billion investment in Swiss Re convertible shares had the most stipulations. Negotiated at the depths of the market slump, the stock paid a 12 percent annual coupon until March 2012, when it would convert into ordinary shares at 25 Swiss francs, or $25.53. As Swiss Re’s share price is now twice that, the insurer was eager to buy back the convertibles. But it had also agreed to pay Mr. Buffett a 40 percent premium if it redeemed before March 2011, and a 20 percent premium after that. Mr. Buffett is allowing Swiss Re to pay only a 20 percent premium, as well as the interest he would have received next March. That means he collects $1 billion, rather than the $1.6 billion to which he was entitled. That may look generous. But Mr. Buffett also owns 3 percent of Swiss Re’s stock, which will benefit from the redemption of the expensive convertible securities. The shares jumped more than 6 percent At first glance, Mr. Buffett faces a similar situation with Goldman and G.E., where he holds preferred shares worth $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Both would like to buy back the stock, which pays an annual coupon of 10 percent. He also has warrants over shares of both companies, giving him an incentive to help raise the stock price. But there is less room for a Swiss Re-style agreement. Because Goldman can redeem its preferred stock at any time for a 10 percent premium, it does not need Mr. Buffett to give it an early discount. G.E.’s stock cannot be redeemed until October 2011, opening the door for a negotiation. But Berkshire Hathaway’s G.E. warrants are deeply out of the money. That means it is unlikely to benefit from any short-term boost to GE’s shares. Despite Mr. Buffett’s apparent generosity with Swiss Re, Goldman and G.E. should not assume he will take the same approach with them.</text></article>

The banks are offloading businesses to comply with new rules, repay government loans or raise money to meet more stringent capital requirements. Even mighty Goldman Sachs is not immune. Its proprietary trading desk in New York, which spawned the careers of Robert E. Rubin and dozens of successful hedge fund managers, is heading to the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts as Goldman winds down the operation to comply with new federal regulations. Other private equity firms are also expanding and diversifying. This year, for example, Apollo Global Management acquired Citigroup's real estate investment group, and Blackstone Group took over Bank of America's Asian property business. The hiring of the nine-person team Goldman team, led by Bob Howard, represents K.K.R.'s entry into stock trading. The firm is expected to raise money from outside investors for a hedge fund to be managed by Mr. Howard and his colleagues. The business will help the newly public K.K.R. expand beyond its core private equity operations of buying and selling companies using large amounts of debt. K.K.R. has already expanded into other areas, including a fixed-income asset management arm and a capital markets division that underwrites stock and bond offerings for companies. In its efforts to diversify, K.K.R., co-founded by the billionaire Henry R. Kravis, pictured, is playing catch-up to its largest rival, the Blackstone Group. Blackstone already has four distinct operations; corporate buyouts, real estate investing, hedge funds and advisory services. The evolution of private equity firms into broader money management businesses is occurring as the firms' founders - many of whom are in their 60s - look to cash out by selling stakes to the public. K.K.R. joined Blackstone as a New York Stock Exchange-listed company in July. Other firms that are either preparing or exploring public listings include Apollo and Carlyle Group. As publicly traded companies, these firms are under pressure not only to raise more capital and generate more profits but also to smooth out their earnings by diversifying into areas other than the historically volatile business of private equity. Their expansion efforts are not without risk. Carlyle's reputation was seriously damaged in 2008, when Carlyle Capital, a hedge fund that invested in mortgage securities, imploded in the credit crisis. The move by Mr. Howard and his colleagues to K.K.R. means the unwinding of a Goldman unit that gave rise to many Wall Street luminaries. Once known as the risk arbitrage desk and now called principal strategies, its alumni include Mr. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, and hedge fund managers like Edward S. Lampert, chairman of Sears Holding Corporation, and Daniel S. Och, chief of Och-Ziff Capital Management Group. But new regulations have compelled Goldman to leave this business. Rules imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the most sweeping financial regulatory overhaul in decades, have limited the involvement of Goldman and other banks in riskier investments like hedge funds and proprietary trading, in which firms bet their own capital. After the restrictions were passed, Goldman bankers fanned out across their client base to help the traders find a new home. A number of firms competed with K.K.R. to hire the Goldman team, including Avenue Capital and Perella Weinberg. Other members of Goldman's proprietary trading desk abroad, like the team in Asia led by Morgan Sze, have weighed their options, which include establishing a fund. Even after jettisoning the United States unit, Goldman has some trading desks that invest with the company's capital, a business model that has come under fire since the financial crisis. It is unclear what Goldman intends to do with those businesses, which include its special situations group in the fixed-income division. Mr. Howard, 39, who leads the United States principal strategies unit, has spent his entire career at Goldman. After graduating from Harvard College, he spent two years as an analyst in investment banking and capital markets before returning to Harvard to earn a master's degree in business administration. He rejoined Goldman in 1998 as an associate in what became principal strategies and remained there ever since. When Mr. Howard and his team start on Jan. 1, he will join many Goldman alumni at K.K.R., which has a close relationship with the investment bank. He will report to William Sonneborn, a former Goldman banker who heads K.K.R.'s asset-management division. And this is not the first merger between K.K.R. and Goldman Sachs this year. In May, a K.K.R. co-founder, George R. Roberts, married Linnea Conrad, a Goldman Sachs investment banker. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Goldman Sachs, which consistently manages to outsmart its rivals when it comes to making money, posted rather ordinary results on Tuesday for the third quarter. The earnings report was the most telling illustration yet of how the slowdown in trading has dented the Wall Street profit machines. Global markets remain fragile two years after the credit crisis unleashed the worst economic rout since the Great Depression. Investors, stung by the May flash crash when the Dow Jones industrial average briefly plunged more than 900 points before recovering, remain shaken and are staying close to the sidelines. Goldman is a trading powerhouse and its quarter suffered as a result. Net revenue in the business that trades bonds, currencies and commodities fell 37 percent, to $3.77 billion. This division accounted for 42 percent of all revenue generated by the firm in the third quarter. Net revenue from equities trading and commissions fell 33 percent, to $1.86 billion. In addition, firms like Goldman are facing new regulatory changes that have and will continue to hurt the earnings power of financial firms. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Act signed into law by President Obama in July, restricts certain operations, like proprietary trading. Goldman has already wound down this business, which it previously said accounted for less than 10 percent of its revenue annually. Rules both at home and abroad also have or will require big financial firms to hold more capital against riskier operations. This will most likely force banks like Goldman to exit less profitable business lines. ''It is tremendously challenging for all these firms to grow their business when clients are not that active and they are also busy recalibrating to a new regulatory environment,'' said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Nomura Securities. In a sign of how challenging the business has become, Goldman's return on equity, an important benchmark on Wall Street that shows how efficiently a firm is generating profits from the money shareholders have invested, fell to 10.3 percent in the third quarter, compared with 21.4 percent in the quarter a year ago. In the second quarter, it was 7.9 percent. But Goldman's return on equity since it went public has been 24 percent, and its target is to produce a 20 percent return on equity. Goldman's chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, said during an investor conference call with analysts that ''many of the market concerns that were most prevalent in the second quarter of 2010 continued into the third quarter'' and investors continued to be concerned about pending legislation both at home and abroad. While confidence among chief executives has picked up, he said, it remains fragile. ''These factors, combined with the seasonal dynamics of the third quarter, negatively impacted activity levels within many of our businesses,'' he said. He seemed only marginally more upbeat about business conditions during the last six weeks, which will show up when Goldman reports its fourth-quarter earnings in January, saying while business picked up in September, it wasn't ''roaring.'' For the third quarter, Goldman said its earnings slumped 40 percent, to $1.9 billion, or $2.98 a share, compared with $3.19 billion, or $5.25 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Net revenue was $8.9 billion. Those numbers exceeded analysts' estimates that had been lowered in recent weeks. The most recent survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters had forecast Goldman to earn $2.28 a share, down from estimates of $3.37 a share a month ago. Shares of Goldman rose nearly 2 percent, or $3.02, to $156.72, on a day when the broader marker was down sharply. Mr. Schorr of Nomura noted that despite the dip in revenue in the quarter, Goldman did not tinker with its compensation and benefit accrual, a decision that lowers return on equity in the current period. He expects Goldman to set aside less money for compensation and benefits in the fourth quarter, which will most likely lift the firm's full year 2010 return on equity. Bonus season is soon approaching; Wall Street typically lets employees know their bonus number in December. Goldman has been the target of criticism from Washington and Main Street over its quick return to profitability and big bonuses months after the financial crisis, when financial firms, including Goldman, were forced to accept government help. Goldman set aside $3.8 billion in compensation in the third quarter. It will not decide what it will pay out until the fourth quarter, but so far this year it has put aside $13.1 billion in pay for its 35,400 employees. And while business may have slowed, Goldman's ranks actually grew by 1,300 employees in the quarter. The firm said it had hired primarily in Asia and London in its asset management division, bringing on more staff members to deal with big pension funds and other clients. There were a few bright spots in the quarter for Goldman. The firm posted net revenue, or revenue minus interest expense, in its investment bank of $1.1 billion, up 24 percent from the period a year earlier.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/20views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman in the Pack, Not Leading It<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs is coming down to earth with a bit of a bump. Sure, the third-quarter earnings of $1.9 billion handily beat what analysts had expected for the Wall Street giant, led by Lloyd Blankfein. That’s good news any time, and especially after talk of a summer slowdown. But Goldman’s results usually lead the pack. Not this time.Take the company’s market-leading franchise in fixed-income, currency and commodities trading, where revenue fell 14 percent from the second quarter, or around 10 percent after accounting for losses taken by marking up the value of its own debt. That’s not bad. But it’s the biggest drop of the major companies that have reported so far. Citigroup’s revenue in the same business area was almost flat, and JPMorgan Chase’s actually improved slightly after adjusting for marking its liabilities to market value. Traders at a resurgent Bank of America took in more than 50 percent more revenue than in the previous three months and crowed about logging a perfect record, meaning no trading losses on any day in the quarter. It’s the second quarter in a row that Goldman’s traders have slipped. Last time, revenue at the company’s equities unit fell precipitously. That helped push company’s second-quarter return on equity down to 9.5 percent, excluding the one-time British bonus tax and the cost of settling a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This time, the company managed to improve only to a humdrum 10.3 percent return on equity. Compare that to JPMorgan: its investment bank returned 13 percent, and its asset management unit 25 percent. Goldman’s showing is hardly disastrous. Its investment bankers enjoyed a decent summer, with underwriting revenue jumping 40 percent and mergers bringing in 5 percent more income. Equities trading recovered somewhat, and at $3.77 billion, Goldman’s revenue from trading in fixed income, currency and commodities is still the largest in its peer group. And the relative underperformance of the bank’s traders of late may just be a blip in their otherwise enviable record. But for once, these sometimes omniscient-seeming masters of the financial universe are looking like mere mortals. Renminbi Hope China’s first interest rate increase since 2007 sounds more momentous than it actually is. But the modesty of the 0.25 percentage point move means there’s scope for more substantial action on the country’s too-cheap currency. There are two good reasons for China to tighten, namely to push interest rates above inflation and to curb runaway property prices. The new, higher deposit rate of 2.5 percent and lending rate of 5.56 percent won’t really do either. The central bank’s action may just take the edge off stirring inflation, but the maximum allowable reward for holding deposits is still below the hoped-for inflation rate of 3 percent. Depositors’ own inflation expectations are likely to be much higher. China’s savings are still being bled away. Dwindling savings returns have driven depositors back to real-estate speculation, and the rate increases won’t be enough to reverse that. Urban property prices rose 9.1 percent year-on-year in September, and total transactions by value were up more than 50 percent from August. Raising interest rates might threaten a property crash if buyers were highly mortgaged, but they are not. Moreover, the expectation of property gains is now so engrained that a tiny rise in rates is unlikely to dampen the mania. The rate increases may be only a baby step, but they aren’t pointless. Data on the country’s gross domestic product and on inflation to be released Thursday are likely to show that demand remains strong and price pressures are rising. China’s G.D.P. is expected to grow by 10 percent this year. That means interest rates are still low in absolute terms and there is room for more tightening of the kind that both China’s consumers and trade partners really need. Beijing can help control inflation by allowing its currency to appreciate, putting a damper on commodity and other input prices. That would make Chinese exporters less competitive but not deter the budding consumers the country hopes to promote. A stronger renminbi is what almost all of China’s trade partners crave, especially given the currency’s recent declines against almost all of its major trading partners. By raising rates just a little, Beijing may have left itself room for a welcome sequel.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/business/14goldman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">S.E.C. Watchdog Says No Political Motivation in Goldman Lawsuit<date>Published: October 13, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — An investigation by the inspector general of the Securities and Exchange Commission found no evidence that the agency’s lawsuit against Goldman Sachs was politically motivated or that S.E.C. officials leaked advance information about the lawsuit to the media.H. David Kotz, the S.E.C. inspector general, who is an independent watchdog for the agency, said in a report dated Sept. 30 and released late Wednesday that his investigation “found that the investigation’s procedural path and timing was governed primarily by decisions relating to the case itself.” The agency’s initial filing on April 16 of a lawsuit charging Goldman Sachs with defrauding investors with its disclosures about a subprime mortgage investment led to immediate speculation that it was timed to help spur Senate action on the pending bill to strengthen financial regulation. While Mr. Kotz also received complaints that some media, including The New York Times, received advanced notice of the lawsuit, he said he found no evidence of such a leak. But the chief of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, Robert S. Khuzami, testified that the settlement of the lawsuit, announced on July 15, was in reaction to an article about a possible settlement in The Wall Street Journal and fear of further leaks. The inspector general did not find evidence that the Goldman suit was filed on the same day that he released a critical report of the S.E.C.’s actions in the R. Allen Stanford case to deflect attention from that news. Mr. Kotz did criticize the S.E.C. enforcement division for failing to notify Goldman of its lawsuit until after the papers were filed in federal court, a violation of administrative regulations. The agency’s failure to notify the New York Stock Exchange of the pending news also contributed to increased volatility in the markets on the day of the filing, the inspector general said.</text></article>

Energy Future Holdings has been working to restructure its $40 billion worth of debt, which originated from 2007 when the company found itself the target of the largest ever leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs. Since then, the price of gas has dropped drastically, and Energy Futures has fallen on hard times, The Post said. The energy company is hoping to get Mr. Buffett, as well as other unsecured bondholders, to exchange a total of $6 billion of their debt in a subsidiary, known as TCEH, at about 70 percent of its actual value for a debt that matures later, The Post reported. Trying to answer why Mr. Buffett and other bondholders might agree to such a deal, The Post writes: If the TCEH subsidiary goes bankrupt, as analysts predict it will 2014, unsecured bondholders run the risk of not recouping their investment as holders of the new debt would get paid before them. “You are in a prisoner’s dilemma,” said one bond trader.

Penney has hired Goldman Sachs as an adviser as the retailer braces for a possible battle from the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, Women’s Wear Daily reports. In selecting Goldman, J.C. Penney is following the approach taken by rival Target, which also used the firm to help devise its successful defense against Mr. Ackman’s proxy challenge in 2009. Securities filings late last week showed that Mr.Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, had taken a 16.5 percent stake in J.C. Penney. Pershing is a major real-estate investor, most prominently of late with General Growth Properties, a huge mall operator getting ready to emerge from bankruptcy. Mr. Ackman is working with another major player in commercial real estate, Vornado Realty, which disclosed last week that it had taken a 9.9 percent in J.C. Penney. Both Vornado and General Growth are landlords for J.C. Penney stores. J.C. Penney’s chief executive, Myron E. Ullman III, is expected to meet with Mr. Ackman and Steven Roth within the next 10 days, Women’s Wear Daily said. Shares of J.C. Penney, which surged sharply on Friday on news of the ownership stakes, slipped slightly in midday trading on Wednesday. The company has a market value of nearly $8 billion.

Weinberg Jr., Former Goldman Executive, Dies at 87<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a senior director of Goldman Sachs and a member of the family dynasty that had played a central role at the investment banking firm since 1907, died Monday at his home in Marion, Mass. Mr. Weinberg, who was also a significant philanthropist, was 87.His death was confirmed by his daughter Sydney Houghton Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs as a general partner in 1965 and led its investment banking services department from 1978 to 1988. He became a limited partner that year and, since 1999, had been a senior director. Mr. Weinberg’s father, Sidney J. Weinberg, was chief executive of Goldman Sachs from 1939 until his death in 1969 and earned the sobriquet “Mr. Wall Street.” His brother, John L. Weinberg, who died in 2006, led the company from 1976 to 1990. In 1971, Mr. Weinberg started a foundation that bears his name and has since made approximately $50 million in grants to support health, science and education institutions, among them New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Princeton University, the Harvard Business School, Claremont Colleges in California, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the New York Times College Scholarship Program. Sidney James Weinberg Jr. was born in Scarsdale, N.Y., on March 27, 1923, one of two sons of Sidney and Helen Livingston Weinberg. After serving in the Army in the Philippines during World War II, he completed his bachelor’s degree at Princeton in 1947 and two years later received a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard. Mr. Weinberg was vice president of the textile division of the Owens Corning company before joining Goldman Sachs. Besides his daughter Sydney, he is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Elizabeth Houghton; another daughter, Elizabeth Smith; a son, Peter; two stepsons, James and Alan McCord; a stepdaughter, Laura Grauer; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</text></article>

Lists Risks as It Launches $15 Billion I.P.O.<date>October 5, 2010, 6:45 am</date><text>The American International Group‘s Asian life insurance unit, which plans to raise up to $14.9 billion from its initial public offering, flagged a series of business risks including the collapsed bid from a British rival, Prudential, as it launched the share offering on Tuesday, Reuters said. The subsidiary, American International Assurance, plans to raise between $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion by selling 5.86 billion shares at 18.38 Hong Kong dollars to 19.68 Hong Kong dollars each, according to a document obtained by Reuters. Including an overallotment option, the I.P.O. could raise up to $17.1 billion, according to the news service. The net proceeds will be used to repay financial aid A.I.G. received from the United States government. A.I.G. revived A.I.A.’s offering after Prudential cut its takeover offer for the unit to $30.4 billion, from $35.5 billion. In contrast, the I.P.O. would value A.I.A. at as much as $30.5 billion, according to Reuters. “The terminated Prudential transaction also adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact agency recruitment and new business production by our agents,” A.I.A. said in its prospectus. “We cannot assure you that our business and prospects will not be materially and adversely affected by the terminated Prudential transaction.” Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators for the I.P.O. Though the total amount has yet to be determined, the standard Hong Kong I.P.O. fee would have the banks involved splitting roughly $500 million in fees.

Now, after a stretch of time when the limelight has been particularly harsh, the company has started its first national advertising campaign aimed not at potential clients, but at ordinary people. Full-page advertisements ran on Wednesday in a number of newspapers, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The campaign, being managed by Young &amp; Rubicam, will continue into next year, with print advertisements in national, regional and local newspapers and banner advertisements on various Web sites, saidDavid Wells, a spokesman for Goldman. He declined to say how much the company planned to spend on the campaign. ''We need to provide a broader audience a better understanding of who we are and what we need to do,'' Mr. Wells said. ''This is meant to help do that.'' Bearing the tagline ''Progress is Everyone's Business,'' the advertisement that ran Wednesday included a photograph of several wind turbines next to a close-up shot of a smiling, hard-hat-wearing worker standing at the base of a turbine. Future advertisements will highlight work that Goldman has done for a range of clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions and individuals, Mr. Wells said. This is not the first time that Goldman has started a national advertising campaign. Shortly after it went public in 1999, Goldman began a campaign that was estimated to cost $10 million. This time, the company is trying to repair a public image that has been damaged by accusations that it profited during the financial crisis. In July, Goldman, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations in the sale of mortgage securities. And public sentiment goes beyond the headlines.Warren E. Buffett, a Goldman investor who has defended the company, captured the mood in an appearance on CNBC in March. Soon, he said, ''they're going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs offering the apple.'' Goldman's chief executive,Lloyd C. Blankfein, has acknowledged that his company has an image problem. ''We have a lot of work to do explaining to people what it is that we do,'' Mr. Blankfein said on the ''Charlie Rose'' television show in April. ''And we're starting from a hole.'' As its most visible step yet in that effort, the company's print ad on Wednesday attracted mixed reviews from marketing professors and people in the advertising industry. Several people described the ad as a fairly standard corporate image ad, consistent with what unpopular companies - say, BP, to take another example - tend to produce when trying to refurbish their image. ''It's tough for any firm to do when an industry is somewhat tainted and when there's a lot of negative sentiment,'' said Kevin L. Keller, a professor of marketing at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ''You're swimming upstream so much.'' And Goldman is evidently proceeding with caution. ''Low key'' was frequently used to describe the advertisement, which pointed readers to a Web page that further details Goldman's work to ''make progress happen,'' in the company's words. In the top-right corner of the advertisement, the Goldman logo took up barely more than one square inch of space. ''It's a huge ad, and you have to squint to be able to see that it's by Goldman,'' said Russell S. Winer, chairman of the marketing department at the New York University Stern School of Business. ''If I just saw the ad, I might think it was for a utility company.'' Others were less forgiving. Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of the Kaplan Thaler Group, a Manhattan ad agency, was mystified by the decision to focus the first advertisement on renewable energy. Wind turbines, she pointed out, are everywhere in energy-related advertisements these days. ''It just looks like a lot of breast-beating, but doesn't really get to the heart of: how has this company changed in a way that I can find them trustworthy?'' she said. ''My verdict is wasted energy.'' - Thomas Kaplan This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The company did not say how many shares it plans to sell or at what price per share in a recent filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. The underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have a 30-day option to buy more shares. GNC Acquisition Holdings plans to use the proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. Last year, GNC’s net income totaled $69.5 million on $1.71 billion in revenue. For the six month ended June 30, net income rose to $51.1 million from $37.4 million in the year-ago period. Revenue increased by nearly 6 percent to $920.7 million from $872.3 million. GNC is owned by an affiliate of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, which bought the store chain in 2007 for $1.65 billion from Apollo Management. Following the I.P.O., the group will hold an undisclosed interest in GNC. It will control the company’s affairs and policies, including the election of directors, mergers or sales of assets and other significant transactions, according to the filing. This isn’t the first time GNC has filed for an I.P.O. Apollo tried to take GNC public twice, but withdrew because of faltering sales and unfavorable market conditions.

The problem? The trader knew that flashing his Goldman credentials at the ticket window would mean risking sneers (or worse) from the tourists and museum employees standing nearby. Instead, he pocketed his ID and paid $20. Everyday questions like this are not uncommon at Goldman, where a damaged public image and executive caution have put the firm's junior analysts on red alert, reluctant to talk about their jobs outside company walls for fear of judgment from outsiders and punishment within the firm. ''It feels like I'm working for the C.I.A.,'' the analyst said. Privacy has long been part of life at investment banks, not just at Goldman. Confidentiality clauses are routinely written into employment contracts, and workers are given strict orders not to cooperate with news media requests. For that reason, all the Goldman employees interviewed for this article spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Still, many of Goldman's younger employees feel additional pressure to keep their lives hidden from view now that the firm is in the limelight. ''Working at Goldman right out of college used to be something you wore on your chest,'' said Patrick Curtis, a former investment banker and founder of the popular finance blog WallStreetOasis.com. ''Now, there's a stigma, and that creates a tremendous pressure for these guys to be vague and discreet when they're around nonfinance people.'' A Goldman representative declined to comment for this article. This summer, a group of new Goldman employees tried to leave the firm's 200 West Street headquarters wearing training nametags emblazoned with the firm's logo, but were stopped by a security guard at the door. ''Take those off before you go outside,'' the guard ordered, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. The Met visitor said that during his training, they were told ''nobody should be able to identify us as Goldman employees once we left the office.'' ''Personal anonymity is almost a core value'' at the firm, founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman, writes Charles D. Ellis in his 2008 book ''The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs'' (Penguin Press). According to Mr. Ellis's account, the namesake partner Samuel Sachs ''believed public relations was a bad thing and would have none of it.'' But Goldman and Sachs themselves might have blanched at the extent of the clampdown that has spread across their firm. Not all of Goldman's employees are put off by the firm's opacity. A recent survey of financial professionals taken by Vault, a career advice Web site, gave Goldman top marks for prestige (as rated by those outside the firm) and quality of life (as rated by those within it). ''Frankly, I'm still proud to tell people I work here,'' said a third-year analyst. ''Regardless of how much scrutiny we get, it's still the best place to work on the Street.'' And having to stay tightlipped is arguably only a slight inconvenience compared with the demands of a job at a bustling investment bank. ''You have to remember, a lot of these guys work 100-hour weeks,'' said Mr. Curtis of WallStreetOasis. ''They don't have time to talk to their friends about anything.'' Still, other Wall Street firms, now that the financial regulation overhaul is in place and there are signs that the public's rage may be slowly subsiding, are beginning to give their young employees a slightly longer leash. A first-year analyst at Morgan Stanley, whose company perks this summer included an open-bar cruise on the Hudson River, said: ''We haven't been given any crazy rules. The people running our training basically said, 'Conduct yourself appropriately, and don't say anything over e-mail you wouldn't want to see in the newspaper.' '' Some young Goldman employees have found their tight privacy restrictions to be a source of mystique. ''It's actually sort of obnoxious,'' said one private equity analyst with friends who work at Goldman. ''They all go around calling it 'the Firm,' and we're supposed to know which firm they're talking about.'' - Kevin Roose Go to DealBook's Fall 2010 Special Section&gt;&gt; This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The panelists included Washington regulators - the very people who will decide how to put to work the new Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul bill passed in July. ''What is the S.E.C. doing to define venture capital funds?'' one attendee asked Jennifer B. McHugh, a senior adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission's chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro. ''And what about financial advisers?'' asked another audience member. To each such question - and there were many - Ms. McHugh's answers were both consistent and noncommittal: ''That is a good question, and we're working on it.'' Welcome to the moment of maximum uncertainty. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the nation's most comprehensive financial overhaul since the Great Depression, is now the law of the land. But with a few exceptions, like the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, much of the detail on how those new rules will work is in the hands of the Obama administration's financial regulators, who have been given enormous latitude to come up with the new rules of the road. Compounding the uncertainty is the fact that the country is a little more than a month away from midterm elections, when Republicans are expected to gains seats, perhaps enough to take over the House of Representatives. Should that happen, a serious effort will most likely be made to roll back parts of the law, or at least minimize its effects. Both John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, and Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are on record calling for a repeal of the consumer bureau. Although that is highly unlikely, a Republican-controlled Congress would certainly push to limit its powers and regulatory reach. Already, Wall Street has begun marshaling a battle plan to press a Republican-led Congress to ease some of the rules being drawn up, like restrictions on derivatives and proprietary trading. Another target is the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, otherwise known as the bank tax. Originally meant to help pay back the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and rein in risk-taking, it has been met with grumbling by Wall Street. Republicans have been pledging privately to bankers that, should they win, they will seek to block it. ''This would be much more than a tax on banks,'' Thomas P. Quaadman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said in a statement. ''This tax would choke off consumers' access to credit and make our bad economic situation worse.'' Even without the specter of the midterms, putting the new rules into effect is very much a work in progress, and the stakes are high for consumers and for banks afraid that too many new hurdles will dent profits. Here is a typical example that has received relatively little attention. Under the current law, a stockbroker can be defined as either a broker-dealer or an investment adviser. The latter is obligated to act in the customer's best interest; the former can operate under a less stringent standard. Because broker-dealers are not considered fiduciaries, they can sell a client products that are suitable, but not necessarily best, for the client. Congress has asked the S.E.C. to study the differences in oversight between the categories and report back on the shortcomings of existing standards. Some Wall Street executives fear the S.E.C. will raise the standards for broker-dealers, limiting their firms' ability to sell in-house products that pull in millions of dollars of revenue. State regulators, however, generally want one rule that holds broker-dealers to the same fiduciary standard as investment bankers. Some banks argue that too-strict rules may harm their ability to compete with global rivals. ''Large U.S. banks must be fully competitive with larger European and Asian banks in all spheres,'' Daniel Alpert, a founding partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital, said. While the rule-making process is far from over, it is not too early to place bets on the likely winners and losers. GOLDMAN SACHS Conventional wisdom dictates that Goldman comes out on top. Like other firms, Goldman is trying to get ahead of the new law instead of waiting for things to play out.</text></article>

Globally, stock underwriting proceeds have slipped 9 percent so far this year, as investors prove less willing to take risks amid an uncertain economic recovery, according to Reuters. Proceeds from global equity capital markets underwriting activity have fallen to $496.14 billion from $544.96 billion so far this year. But the number of deals has increased 5.6 percent to 2,817 deals compared with a year earlier as banks have been willing to underwrite smaller offerings. JPMorgan Chase kept its No.1 ranking, with Morgan Stanley in the No. 2 spot, while Goldman Sachs was third. JPMorgan brought in proceeds of just $39.5 billion compared with $80.07 billion a year earlier. The bank underwrote 224 offerings according to Thomson Reuters data at the close of markets in the United States on Friday, compared with 290 in the period a year earlier.

Relatively few have landed a role in a client’s Hollywood blockbuster. However, Christian Baha, the head of $1.2 billon hedge fund group Superfund, has been given a cameo in “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” the sequel to the original “Wall Street,” FROM 1987, thanks to a friendship with the director — and Superfund investor — Oliver Stone, Reuters reports. Mr. Baha, whose computer-driven funds aim to exploit trends in global futures markets, has a short speaking role as, perhaps unsurprisingly, a hedge fund manager, while Michael Douglas resumes the role of ruthless financier Gordon Gekko in a film some have seen as a thinly veiled attack on Goldman Sachs. However, Reuters noted, it is likely that Mr. Stone, the Oscar-winning director of “Platoon” and “Born on the Fourth of July” has experienced a roller-coaster ride in the market. Superfund’s most aggressive C share class gained 74.18 percent in market chaos of 2008, but lost more than 50 percent last year. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>

Goldman has hired Deloitte Tohmatsu to arrange the sale, Reuters said. The move comes after Goldman last month sold Teibow, a maker of felt pen nibs, to Wise Partners, a Japanese private equity firm, for as much as 15 billion yen. Goldman bought 67 percent of Primo Japan in 2007 and 86 percent of Teibow in 2006 through its Asia Special Situations Group, a team it formed to acquire debt-ridden companies.

Mr. Iwanowski and Mark Carhart ran Global Alpha when it “expanded its reputation as one of the smartest investing outfits on Wall Street,” as Scott Patterson writes in his book “The Quants.” The two men had taken over the reins from Clifford Asness, now of AQR Capital Management, in 1998. At its peak, Global Alpha managed some $12 billion in assets and was considered the model of a brainy, computer-driven trading firm. But in the 2007, the credit crunch tripped up the quant fund’s strategies, and investors pulled out billions of dollars of their money. Mr. Iwanowski and Mr. Carhart left Goldman in March 2009. Mr. Carhart has since founded hedge fund Kepos Capital. Now, Lawrence Delevingne reports: Iwanowski has been meeting with prime brokers in New York in recent weeks to discuss a potential new offering, according to people familiar with the meetings.

Mr. Robertson and John Thornton, both former Goldman Sachs bankers and non-executive directors on the HSBC board, are frontrunners to succeed Stephen Green, according to the newspaper, which said the board favored a plan to appoint Mr. Robertson on a temporary basis. The board would then look to groom Mr. Thornton or another internal candidate to take over from Mr. Robertson on a permanent basis in two to three years time, according to the report Mr. Robertson is currently non-executive chairman of British airline engine-maker Rolls-Royce. A compromise would be sought by HSBC’s board to enable him to continue in both roles, the newspaper said.

It protects both the egos of those who worked at Goldman (those not selected and those leaving) and the interests of the entity — retaining the productive people and new talents while letting go the less productive. It clearly rewards according to the success of the entire enterprise (not merely some) and tries to diffuse favoritism by dividing the decision-making among the groups. Yet it leaves a sufficient degree of competition to encourage better performance. This mix is the most impressive part of the program. But this program is hard to emulate, because without the culture of commitment another balance must be achieved and less discretion would be given to decision makers. Rules that reduce the discretion would undermine the delicate balance. That may be why Goldman is unique.

    <article index="27" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16bias.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman Sachs Is Accused of Gender Bias<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>Three former female employees at Goldman Sachs sued the investment bank on Wednesday, contending that the firm discriminates systematically against women.The women claim that Goldman intentionally pays its male employees more than their female counterparts, and promotes them more frequently. A persistent pattern of bias has resulted in women being underrepresented in the firm’s management ranks, the complaint said. “The number of women in management positions at Goldman dwindles as the level of management rises,” the complaint said, citing Goldman data that showed that women made up 29 percent of the firm’s vice presidents, 17 percent of its managing directors and 14 percent of its partners. Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said, “We believe this suit is without merit. People are critical to our business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop and retain outstanding women professionals.” The complaint, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a stream of lawsuits filed over the last decade accusing Wall Street firms of denying women the kind of pay packages and job opportunities granted to men. Other suits have claimed harassment in overwhelmingly male offices and trading floors. In 2004, Morgan Stanley paid $54 million to settle accusations that it had denied rises and promotions to women, paid them less than men, excluded them from company events and subjected them to lewd behavior. The firm denied any wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Most recently, three investment advisers who worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch accused the bank of gender bias in a suit filed in federal court in Brooklyn in March. Bank of America has denied the accusations. The same law firms that represented women in the complaint against Goldman Sachs are representing the plaintiffs in the Bank of America suit. The complaint against Goldman, which seeks class-action status, is notable because two of the plaintiffs held executive posts. Their accusations highlight a delicate topic on Wall Street: the lack of women executives at the top. Currently, the most prominent include Sallie Krawchek, the head of global wealth and investment management at Bank of America; and Heidi Miller, head of international operations at JPMorgan Chase. But a number of prominent female executives, including Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, and Zoe Cruz, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley, were ousted by their firms in the fallout from the financial crisis. For Goldman, the lawsuit comes at a time when the firm, among the most prestigious and profitable on Wall Street, has taken a public relations beating. This summer, the firm agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges related to the sale of subprime mortgage securities. The firm has also come under fire for returning to profitability far more quickly than its competitors — a criticism that Goldman executives find puzzling. The three plaintiffs in the Goldman lawsuit are H. Cristina Chen-Oster, who worked in the firm’s equities division from 1997 to 2005 and was promoted to vice president; Lisa Parisi, who worked in the asset management group from 2001 to 2008 and was promoted to managing director; and Shanna Orlich, who worked in the firm’s fixed-income unit from 2007 to 2008 as an associate. The most detailed accusations come from Ms. Chen-Oster, who worked mostly in sales on Goldman’s convertible-bond desk. Ms. Chen-Oster claims in an affidavit that shortly after she joined Goldman in 1997, a celebration for a recently promoted male colleague took place at Scores, a New York strip club, and all the employees were encouraged to join. The lawsuit contends that at the end of the night, a married male colleague escorted her to her boyfriend’s apartment building and in the hallway lobby pinned her against the wall, kissing and groping her. That episode, which the male colleague reported to his supervisor the next morning, led to Ms. Chen-Oster’s experiencing “increased hostility and marginalization at the firm,” according to the complaint. The filing details Ms. Chen-Oster’s compensation throughout her tenure. In her second year at the firm, Goldman paid her $475,000, a number she claims was significantly less than that of her male peers. By 2000, a year in which the stock market peaked, Goldman paid her $800,000, a figure she contends was at least 50 percent less than that paid to male counterparts. Ms. Chen-Oster resigned from Goldman and now works as a managing director at Deutsche Bank. Ms. Orlich, another plaintiff, portrays a male-dominated trading-floor culture centered on golf and other physical pursuits. Ms. Orlich, who received business and law degrees from Columbia, says in an affidavit that Goldman’s management would challenge one of her male colleagues, a former member of the Navy Seals, to do push-up contests and “other displays of masculinity.” She claims to have never been invited to frequent golf outings, even though she was a varsity player in high school. A Goldman managing director also hired scantily clad female escorts wearing Santa hats to attend a holiday party, Ms. Orlich claims. A portion of the complaint takes aim at Goldman’s widely known 360-degree reviews, evaluations of employees that involve feedback from a boss, subordinates and peers, that have become a model management tool for other corporations. The plaintiffs contend that managers’ favoritism toward male employees skews the review process, disproportionately placing men in the top quartile of performance. Janet Hanson, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs for 14 years and the founder of 85 Broads, a professional women’s networking organization named after the address of the firm’s former headquarters, says that this lawsuit belies the experience of most Goldman women professionals. “For every woman at Goldman Sachs who feels she has been treated unfairly, I will find a thousand who don’t feel that way,” said Ms. Hanson. “Unfortunately, the people muzzled in a situation like this are the women who work there but can’t talk to the press, but if you asked them if they loved their jobs and are treated equally, the vast, vast majority would say yes.”</text></article>

    <article index="29" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/14views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Buyout Firms’ Sales May Top Purchases<date>Published: September 13, 2010</date><text>Are buyout barons becoming sellout barons?For the first time on record, private equity firms are on track this year to sell more assets than they buy. One recent example: Burger King, a listed company of which affiliates of TPG Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Bain Capital Investors own approximately 31 percent, was sold to 3G Capital. Buyout firm bosses say this reflects the need to produce cash for investors. That’s probably true to a point. But the prospect of tax increases in the United States has also given the executives a rationale to sell now, even if it doesn’t much help their clients. So far in 2010, private equity firms globally have sold $140 billion of assets from their portfolios. That puts this year on a pace for the most disposals since 2007 and the second-biggest year in history, according to Thomson Reuters. Purchases this year stand at around $136 billion so far. Since at least 1994, as far back as these records go, sales have never exceeded purchases in a full year. To some degree, this follows from the recent boom and bust. In 2006 and 2007, private equity firms went on a takeover rampage fueled by cheap debt, making $1.1 trillion of purchases. At some point, the firms need to exit those investments. And investors in their funds, known as limited partners, have been clamoring to extract cash and reduce future commitments. Last week, the managers of the Harvard endowment, for example, said they were reducing their private equity exposure. But it’s possible that something else is figuring in the great buyout sell-off of 2010: self-interest. Private equity managers earn most of their money in two ways. They charge a management fee, generally around 1.5 percent of the assets they oversee. And they take a cut, typically 20 percent, of any increase in the value of investments. This is known as the “carry” or “carried interest.” Until now, those in the industry have paid income tax rates on their management fees but lower capital gains rates on their slice of investment gains. That is set to change in America, where many big buyout firms are based. With elections scheduled in November, it’s not clear when, or even certain whether, Congress might make the proposed changes law. But private equity executives have largely given up lobbying on the issue, instead focusing efforts on avoiding other tax hits like one that might be put into effect when they sell their firms. If the industry is resigned to higher tax rates on carry, that could be changing its behavior. Consider a hypothetical buyout firm, BSD Partners, which acquired a fictional manufacturer of specialty widgets in 2006 for $2 billion. In that deal, BSD put up 25 percent of the purchase price in equity from one of its funds and borrowed the rest. Now it has a chance to sell the business to the industry leader, Widget Worldwide, even though the company’s good prospects mean it could be worth more in just a few months’ time. Suppose Widget Worldwide is offering BSD $2.5 billion for the business today. That’s not bad. Assuming the unit still carries $1.5 billion of debt, BSD’s original $500 million investment is now worth $1 billion. But if BSD holds on for six months and sells its widget firm after it unveils new products and beats sales targets, the business may be worth $2.6 billion. Investors in BSD’s funds might want to wait. Other things being equal, the value of their equity investment would rise by another $100 million, a 20 percent annualized return. But the bosses at BSD are exposed to slightly different arithmetic. Sell today, and of the $500 million equity profit, $100 million goes to them as carry and $400 million goes to the limited partners. Tax the take of the firm and its employees at a 15 percent capital gains rate, and they take home around $85 million among them. Now consider what happens if BSD waits for the higher price for its widget firm in early 2011, assuming the new taxes are in effect by then. The gain made by the firm’s fund jumps to $600 million, with $120 million kept as carry and $480 million going to outside investors. If taxes are charged at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, the BSD crew share only $78 million for their trouble, nearly 10 percent less. That’s an incentive for the buyout firm’s insiders to sell assets now, even though it could shortchange fund investors. This is a hypothetical example. But it is a calculus that private equity barons must, rationally, be considering. And it may be one factor in the selling trend. ROB COX</text></article>
    <article index="30" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/13partner.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Goldman, Harder to Achieve, and Stay, Partner<date>Published: September 12, 2010</date><text>On Wall Street, becoming a partner at Goldman Sachs is considered the equivalent of winning the lottery.This fall, in a secretive process, some 100 executives will be chosen to receive this golden ticket, bestowing rich pay packages and an inside track to the top jobs at the company. What few outside Goldman know is that this ticket can also be taken away. As many as 60 Goldman executives could be stripped of their partnerships this year to make way for new blood, people with firsthand knowledge of the process say. Inside the firm, the process is known as “de-partnering.” Goldman does not disclose who is no longer a partner, and many move on to jobs elsewhere; some stay, telling few of their fate. “I have friends who have been de-partnered who are still there, and most people inside think they are still partners,” said one former Goldman executive, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. “It is something you just don’t talk about.” Goldman has roughly 35,000 employees, but only 375 or so partners. The former Treasury Secretaries Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin, and former Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, now chief executive of financial firm MF Global, were all partners. It can take years to make partner, and being pushed from the inner circle can be wrenching. “Being partner at Goldman is the pinnacle of Wall Street; if you make it, you are considered set for life,” said Michael Driscoll, a visiting professor at Adelphi University and a senior managing director at Bear Stearns before that firm collapsed in 2008. “To have it taken away would just be devastating to an individual. There is just no other word for it.” The financial blow can be substantial as well. Executives stripped of partnership would retain their base salary, roughly $200,000, but their bonuses could be diminished, potentially costing them millions of dollars in a good year. While gaining the coveted status of partner, and then losing it, is certainly not unheard-of at private financial and law firms on Wall Street, Goldman’s partnership process stands out for its size and intricacy. Goldman weeds out partners because it is worried that if the partnership becomes too big, it will lose its cachet and become less of a motivational tool for talented up-and-comers, people involved in the process say. If too many people stay, it creates a logjam. The average tenure of a partner is about eight years, in part because of natural attrition and retirements. Goldman insiders also note they have what they call an “up-and-out” culture, leading to the active management of the pool. The process of vetting new candidates for partner and deciding which existing partners must go began in earnest in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the process, which takes place every two years. They spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 2010 partners will most likely be announced in November. Candidates are judged on many qualities, primarily their financial contribution to the firm. But lawyers and risk managers — who are not big revenue producers — can also make it to the inner circle. The executives responsible for running the partner process this year are the vice chairmen, J. Michael Evans, Michael S. Sherwood and John S. Weinberg; the head of human resources, Edith W. Cooper; and the bank’s president, Gary D. Cohn. Goldman typically removes 30 or so partners every two years, said those people who described the process. The number is expected to be significantly higher this year because fewer senior executives have left the firm as a sluggish economy and uncertain markets limit their opportunities elsewhere. Removing partners like this is unique to Goldman among publicly traded firms. When companies go public, they shed the private partnership system, and ownership of the company is transferred to shareholders. Goldman’s ownership was also transferred to shareholders, but it created a hybrid partner model as an incentive for employees. Those whom Goldman does not want to keep are likely to be quietly told in the coming weeks. Each situation is handled differently, the people with knowledge of the process say. Some partners are given time to find other jobs outside the firm. Others are told they will not be made partner and are asked to consider what they want to do next within the company. While Goldman is on track to remove many more executives than usual, the process is in its early stages and no final decisions have been made, these people caution. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on how it selects and removes partners. The process is at the heart of Goldman’s culture, a way for the firm to reward and retain top talent. Goldman was one of the last of the big Wall Street partnerships to go public, selling shares in 1999. When it was private, the partners were the owners, sharing in the profits, and in some cases having to put in money to shore up losses. To retain that team spirit as a public company, Goldman continued to name partners. In 1999, there were 221. Yet there are differences from past practices. When Goldman was a private partnership, it was rare that a partner would be asked to leave. “Once you made partner, you typically retired as a partner,” said another former Goldman executive who used to be involved in the process. “If we asked someone to leave, it was because we had really screwed up and the person wasn’t pulling their weight.” It has been a rough year for Goldman. In July, it paid $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities while failing to make critical disclosures. The firm did not admit or deny guilt. Still, even in the worst of years, the chance to ascend into the private partnership at Goldman is a huge honor. Candidates can be up for partnership two or even three times before finally being chosen. Partners get investment opportunities not offered to other employees, and are typically the highest paid at the firm. Goldman will even book tables for them at fashionable New York restaurants. A big payday is not guaranteed, however. When the firm does not do well, partners tend to bear the brunt of it. Top Goldman executives did not receive bonuses in 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. But in 2007, a banner year for Goldman, the firm set aside $20.19 billion for compensation and benefits, and its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, took home $68.5 million in stock and cash. Candidates for partner are vetted by current partners. The review process is known inside Goldman as “cross-ruffing,” a reference to a maneuver in bridge. A few hundred people are typically nominated within the whole company, and the number is eventually whittled down to about 100. Each department compiles a list of potential candidates, with photos and performance reviews. Partners in another department review it. Candidates are not interviewed, and in many cases are unaware they are even up for partner. When final decisions are made, it is usually Mr. Blankfein who breaks the good news to the new partners. Few candidates ever find out why they missed the cut. And Goldman announces only inductees, not those who have been removed. Still, there may be a few telltale signs this year. Goldman recently moved to a new building, just steps away from the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. Outer offices are hard to come by, and typically given only to partners. Goldman insiders are already speculating that de-partnered executives who decide to stay will have to give up their window view.</text></article>

Weinberg Jr., Former Goldman Executive, Dies at 87<date>Published: October 5, 2010</date><text>Sidney J. Weinberg Jr., a senior director of Goldman Sachs and a member of the family dynasty that had played a central role at the investment banking firm since 1907, died Monday at his home in Marion, Mass. Mr. Weinberg, who was also a significant philanthropist, was 87.His death was confirmed by his daughter Sydney Houghton Weinberg. Mr. Weinberg joined Goldman Sachs as a general partner in 1965 and led its investment banking services department from 1978 to 1988. He became a limited partner that year and, since 1999, had been a senior director. Mr. Weinberg’s father, Sidney J. Weinberg, was chief executive of Goldman Sachs from 1939 until his death in 1969 and earned the sobriquet “Mr. Wall Street.” His brother, John L. Weinberg, who died in 2006, led the company from 1976 to 1990. In 1971, Mr. Weinberg started a foundation that bears his name and has since made approximately $50 million in grants to support health, science and education institutions, among them New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Princeton University, the Harvard Business School, Claremont Colleges in California, the Carnegie Institution for Science, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the New York Times College Scholarship Program. Sidney James Weinberg Jr. was born in Scarsdale, N.Y., on March 27, 1923, one of two sons of Sidney and Helen Livingston Weinberg. After serving in the Army in the Philippines during World War II, he completed his bachelor’s degree at Princeton in 1947 and two years later received a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard. Mr. Weinberg was vice president of the textile division of the Owens Corning company before joining Goldman Sachs. Besides his daughter Sydney, he is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Elizabeth Houghton; another daughter, Elizabeth Smith; a son, Peter; two stepsons, James and Alan McCord; a stepdaughter, Laura Grauer; 12 grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.</text></article>

Lists Risks as It Launches $15 Billion I.P.O.<date>October 5, 2010, 6:45 am</date><text>The American International Group‘s Asian life insurance unit, which plans to raise up to $14.9 billion from its initial public offering, flagged a series of business risks including the collapsed bid from a British rival, Prudential, as it launched the share offering on Tuesday, Reuters said. The subsidiary, American International Assurance, plans to raise between $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion by selling 5.86 billion shares at 18.38 Hong Kong dollars to 19.68 Hong Kong dollars each, according to a document obtained by Reuters. Including an overallotment option, the I.P.O. could raise up to $17.1 billion, according to the news service. The net proceeds will be used to repay financial aid A.I.G. received from the United States government. A.I.G. revived A.I.A.’s offering after Prudential cut its takeover offer for the unit to $30.4 billion, from $35.5 billion. In contrast, the I.P.O. would value A.I.A. at as much as $30.5 billion, according to Reuters. “The terminated Prudential transaction also adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact agency recruitment and new business production by our agents,” A.I.A. said in its prospectus. “We cannot assure you that our business and prospects will not be materially and adversely affected by the terminated Prudential transaction.” Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are joint global coordinators for the I.P.O. Though the total amount has yet to be determined, the standard Hong Kong I.P.O. fee would have the banks involved splitting roughly $500 million in fees.

Now, after a stretch of time when the limelight has been particularly harsh, the company has started its first national advertising campaign aimed not at potential clients, but at ordinary people. Full-page advertisements ran on Wednesday in a number of newspapers, including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The campaign, being managed by Young &amp; Rubicam, will continue into next year, with print advertisements in national, regional and local newspapers and banner advertisements on various Web sites, saidDavid Wells, a spokesman for Goldman. He declined to say how much the company planned to spend on the campaign. ''We need to provide a broader audience a better understanding of who we are and what we need to do,'' Mr. Wells said. ''This is meant to help do that.'' Bearing the tagline ''Progress is Everyone's Business,'' the advertisement that ran Wednesday included a photograph of several wind turbines next to a close-up shot of a smiling, hard-hat-wearing worker standing at the base of a turbine. Future advertisements will highlight work that Goldman has done for a range of clients, including corporations, municipalities, institutions and individuals, Mr. Wells said. This is not the first time that Goldman has started a national advertising campaign. Shortly after it went public in 1999, Goldman began a campaign that was estimated to cost $10 million. This time, the company is trying to repair a public image that has been damaged by accusations that it profited during the financial crisis. In July, Goldman, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations in the sale of mortgage securities. And public sentiment goes beyond the headlines.Warren E. Buffett, a Goldman investor who has defended the company, captured the mood in an appearance on CNBC in March. Soon, he said, ''they're going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs offering the apple.'' Goldman's chief executive,Lloyd C. Blankfein, has acknowledged that his company has an image problem. ''We have a lot of work to do explaining to people what it is that we do,'' Mr. Blankfein said on the ''Charlie Rose'' television show in April. ''And we're starting from a hole.'' As its most visible step yet in that effort, the company's print ad on Wednesday attracted mixed reviews from marketing professors and people in the advertising industry. Several people described the ad as a fairly standard corporate image ad, consistent with what unpopular companies - say, BP, to take another example - tend to produce when trying to refurbish their image. ''It's tough for any firm to do when an industry is somewhat tainted and when there's a lot of negative sentiment,'' said Kevin L. Keller, a professor of marketing at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. ''You're swimming upstream so much.'' And Goldman is evidently proceeding with caution. ''Low key'' was frequently used to describe the advertisement, which pointed readers to a Web page that further details Goldman's work to ''make progress happen,'' in the company's words. In the top-right corner of the advertisement, the Goldman logo took up barely more than one square inch of space. ''It's a huge ad, and you have to squint to be able to see that it's by Goldman,'' said Russell S. Winer, chairman of the marketing department at the New York University Stern School of Business. ''If I just saw the ad, I might think it was for a utility company.'' Others were less forgiving. Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive of the Kaplan Thaler Group, a Manhattan ad agency, was mystified by the decision to focus the first advertisement on renewable energy. Wind turbines, she pointed out, are everywhere in energy-related advertisements these days. ''It just looks like a lot of breast-beating, but doesn't really get to the heart of: how has this company changed in a way that I can find them trustworthy?'' she said. ''My verdict is wasted energy.'' - Thomas Kaplan This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The company did not say how many shares it plans to sell or at what price per share in a recent filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission. The underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, have a 30-day option to buy more shares. GNC Acquisition Holdings plans to use the proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. Last year, GNC’s net income totaled $69.5 million on $1.71 billion in revenue. For the six month ended June 30, net income rose to $51.1 million from $37.4 million in the year-ago period. Revenue increased by nearly 6 percent to $920.7 million from $872.3 million. GNC is owned by an affiliate of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, which bought the store chain in 2007 for $1.65 billion from Apollo Management. Following the I.P.O., the group will hold an undisclosed interest in GNC. It will control the company’s affairs and policies, including the election of directors, mergers or sales of assets and other significant transactions, according to the filing. This isn’t the first time GNC has filed for an I.P.O. Apollo tried to take GNC public twice, but withdrew because of faltering sales and unfavorable market conditions.

The problem? The trader knew that flashing his Goldman credentials at the ticket window would mean risking sneers (or worse) from the tourists and museum employees standing nearby. Instead, he pocketed his ID and paid $20. Everyday questions like this are not uncommon at Goldman, where a damaged public image and executive caution have put the firm's junior analysts on red alert, reluctant to talk about their jobs outside company walls for fear of judgment from outsiders and punishment within the firm. ''It feels like I'm working for the C.I.A.,'' the analyst said. Privacy has long been part of life at investment banks, not just at Goldman. Confidentiality clauses are routinely written into employment contracts, and workers are given strict orders not to cooperate with news media requests. For that reason, all the Goldman employees interviewed for this article spoke only on the condition of anonymity. Still, many of Goldman's younger employees feel additional pressure to keep their lives hidden from view now that the firm is in the limelight. ''Working at Goldman right out of college used to be something you wore on your chest,'' said Patrick Curtis, a former investment banker and founder of the popular finance blog WallStreetOasis.com. ''Now, there's a stigma, and that creates a tremendous pressure for these guys to be vague and discreet when they're around nonfinance people.'' A Goldman representative declined to comment for this article. This summer, a group of new Goldman employees tried to leave the firm's 200 West Street headquarters wearing training nametags emblazoned with the firm's logo, but were stopped by a security guard at the door. ''Take those off before you go outside,'' the guard ordered, according to a person with knowledge of the incident. The Met visitor said that during his training, they were told ''nobody should be able to identify us as Goldman employees once we left the office.'' ''Personal anonymity is almost a core value'' at the firm, founded in 1869 by Marcus Goldman, writes Charles D. Ellis in his 2008 book ''The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs'' (Penguin Press). According to Mr. Ellis's account, the namesake partner Samuel Sachs ''believed public relations was a bad thing and would have none of it.'' But Goldman and Sachs themselves might have blanched at the extent of the clampdown that has spread across their firm. Not all of Goldman's employees are put off by the firm's opacity. A recent survey of financial professionals taken by Vault, a career advice Web site, gave Goldman top marks for prestige (as rated by those outside the firm) and quality of life (as rated by those within it). ''Frankly, I'm still proud to tell people I work here,'' said a third-year analyst. ''Regardless of how much scrutiny we get, it's still the best place to work on the Street.'' And having to stay tightlipped is arguably only a slight inconvenience compared with the demands of a job at a bustling investment bank. ''You have to remember, a lot of these guys work 100-hour weeks,'' said Mr. Curtis of WallStreetOasis. ''They don't have time to talk to their friends about anything.'' Still, other Wall Street firms, now that the financial regulation overhaul is in place and there are signs that the public's rage may be slowly subsiding, are beginning to give their young employees a slightly longer leash. A first-year analyst at Morgan Stanley, whose company perks this summer included an open-bar cruise on the Hudson River, said: ''We haven't been given any crazy rules. The people running our training basically said, 'Conduct yourself appropriately, and don't say anything over e-mail you wouldn't want to see in the newspaper.' '' Some young Goldman employees have found their tight privacy restrictions to be a source of mystique. ''It's actually sort of obnoxious,'' said one private equity analyst with friends who work at Goldman. ''They all go around calling it 'the Firm,' and we're supposed to know which firm they're talking about.'' - Kevin Roose Go to DealBook's Fall 2010 Special Section&gt;&gt; This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

The panelists included Washington regulators - the very people who will decide how to put to work the new Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul bill passed in July. ''What is the S.E.C. doing to define venture capital funds?'' one attendee asked Jennifer B. McHugh, a senior adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission's chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro. ''And what about financial advisers?'' asked another audience member. To each such question - and there were many - Ms. McHugh's answers were both consistent and noncommittal: ''That is a good question, and we're working on it.'' Welcome to the moment of maximum uncertainty. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the nation's most comprehensive financial overhaul since the Great Depression, is now the law of the land. But with a few exceptions, like the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, much of the detail on how those new rules will work is in the hands of the Obama administration's financial regulators, who have been given enormous latitude to come up with the new rules of the road. Compounding the uncertainty is the fact that the country is a little more than a month away from midterm elections, when Republicans are expected to gains seats, perhaps enough to take over the House of Representatives. Should that happen, a serious effort will most likely be made to roll back parts of the law, or at least minimize its effects. Both John A. Boehner, the House minority leader, and Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, are on record calling for a repeal of the consumer bureau. Although that is highly unlikely, a Republican-controlled Congress would certainly push to limit its powers and regulatory reach. Already, Wall Street has begun marshaling a battle plan to press a Republican-led Congress to ease some of the rules being drawn up, like restrictions on derivatives and proprietary trading. Another target is the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, otherwise known as the bank tax. Originally meant to help pay back the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program and rein in risk-taking, it has been met with grumbling by Wall Street. Republicans have been pledging privately to bankers that, should they win, they will seek to block it. ''This would be much more than a tax on banks,'' Thomas P. Quaadman, vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said in a statement. ''This tax would choke off consumers' access to credit and make our bad economic situation worse.'' Even without the specter of the midterms, putting the new rules into effect is very much a work in progress, and the stakes are high for consumers and for banks afraid that too many new hurdles will dent profits. Here is a typical example that has received relatively little attention. Under the current law, a stockbroker can be defined as either a broker-dealer or an investment adviser. The latter is obligated to act in the customer's best interest; the former can operate under a less stringent standard. Because broker-dealers are not considered fiduciaries, they can sell a client products that are suitable, but not necessarily best, for the client. Congress has asked the S.E.C. to study the differences in oversight between the categories and report back on the shortcomings of existing standards. Some Wall Street executives fear the S.E.C. will raise the standards for broker-dealers, limiting their firms' ability to sell in-house products that pull in millions of dollars of revenue. State regulators, however, generally want one rule that holds broker-dealers to the same fiduciary standard as investment bankers. Some banks argue that too-strict rules may harm their ability to compete with global rivals. ''Large U.S. banks must be fully competitive with larger European and Asian banks in all spheres,'' Daniel Alpert, a founding partner of the investment bank Westwood Capital, said. While the rule-making process is far from over, it is not too early to place bets on the likely winners and losers. GOLDMAN SACHS Conventional wisdom dictates that Goldman comes out on top. Like other firms, Goldman is trying to get ahead of the new law instead of waiting for things to play out.</text></article>

Globally, stock underwriting proceeds have slipped 9 percent so far this year, as investors prove less willing to take risks amid an uncertain economic recovery, according to Reuters. Proceeds from global equity capital markets underwriting activity have fallen to $496.14 billion from $544.96 billion so far this year. But the number of deals has increased 5.6 percent to 2,817 deals compared with a year earlier as banks have been willing to underwrite smaller offerings. JPMorgan Chase kept its No.1 ranking, with Morgan Stanley in the No. 2 spot, while Goldman Sachs was third. JPMorgan brought in proceeds of just $39.5 billion compared with $80.07 billion a year earlier. The bank underwrote 224 offerings according to Thomson Reuters data at the close of markets in the United States on Friday, compared with 290 in the period a year earlier.

Relatively few have landed a role in a client’s Hollywood blockbuster. However, Christian Baha, the head of $1.2 billon hedge fund group Superfund, has been given a cameo in “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” the sequel to the original “Wall Street,” FROM 1987, thanks to a friendship with the director — and Superfund investor — Oliver Stone, Reuters reports. Mr. Baha, whose computer-driven funds aim to exploit trends in global futures markets, has a short speaking role as, perhaps unsurprisingly, a hedge fund manager, while Michael Douglas resumes the role of ruthless financier Gordon Gekko in a film some have seen as a thinly veiled attack on Goldman Sachs. However, Reuters noted, it is likely that Mr. Stone, the Oscar-winning director of “Platoon” and “Born on the Fourth of July” has experienced a roller-coaster ride in the market. Superfund’s most aggressive C share class gained 74.18 percent in market chaos of 2008, but lost more than 50 percent last year. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>

Goldman has hired Deloitte Tohmatsu to arrange the sale, Reuters said. The move comes after Goldman last month sold Teibow, a maker of felt pen nibs, to Wise Partners, a Japanese private equity firm, for as much as 15 billion yen. Goldman bought 67 percent of Primo Japan in 2007 and 86 percent of Teibow in 2006 through its Asia Special Situations Group, a team it formed to acquire debt-ridden companies. Goldman now owns 47 percent of Primo Japan, while Risa Partners, a Japanese fund manager, owns 26 percent.

Mr. Iwanowski and Mark Carhart ran Global Alpha when it “expanded its reputation as one of the smartest investing outfits on Wall Street,” as Scott Patterson writes in his book “The Quants.” The two men had taken over the reins from Clifford Asness, now of AQR Capital Management, in 1998. At its peak, Global Alpha managed some $12 billion in assets and was considered the model of a brainy, computer-driven trading firm. But in the 2007, the credit crunch tripped up the quant fund’s strategies, and investors pulled out billions of dollars of their money. Mr. Iwanowski and Mr. Carhart left Goldman in March 2009. Mr. Carhart has since founded hedge fund Kepos Capital. Now, Lawrence Delevingne reports: Iwanowski has been meeting with prime brokers in New York in recent weeks to discuss a potential new offering, according to people familiar with the meetings.

Mr. Robertson and John Thornton, both former Goldman Sachs bankers and non-executive directors on the HSBC board, are frontrunners to succeed Stephen Green, according to the newspaper, which said the board favored a plan to appoint Mr. Robertson on a temporary basis. The board would then look to groom Mr. Thornton or another internal candidate to take over from Mr. Robertson on a permanent basis in two to three years time, according to the report Mr. Robertson is currently non-executive chairman of British airline engine-maker Rolls-Royce. A compromise would be sought by HSBC’s board to enable him to continue in both roles, the newspaper said.

It protects both the egos of those who worked at Goldman (those not selected and those leaving) and the interests of the entity — retaining the productive people and new talents while letting go the less productive. It clearly rewards according to the success of the entire enterprise (not merely some) and tries to diffuse favoritism by dividing the decision-making among the groups. Yet it leaves a sufficient degree of competition to encourage better performance. This mix is the most impressive part of the program. But this program is hard to emulate, because without the culture of commitment another balance must be achieved and less discretion would be given to decision makers. Rules that reduce the discretion would undermine the delicate balance. That may be why Goldman is unique.

    <article index="17" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16bias.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman Sachs Is Accused of Gender Bias<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>Three former female employees at Goldman Sachs sued the investment bank on Wednesday, contending that the firm discriminates systematically against women.The women claim that Goldman intentionally pays its male employees more than their female counterparts, and promotes them more frequently. A persistent pattern of bias has resulted in women being underrepresented in the firm’s management ranks, the complaint said. “The number of women in management positions at Goldman dwindles as the level of management rises,” the complaint said, citing Goldman data that showed that women made up 29 percent of the firm’s vice presidents, 17 percent of its managing directors and 14 percent of its partners. Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said, “We believe this suit is without merit. People are critical to our business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop and retain outstanding women professionals.” The complaint, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a stream of lawsuits filed over the last decade accusing Wall Street firms of denying women the kind of pay packages and job opportunities granted to men. Other suits have claimed harassment in overwhelmingly male offices and trading floors. In 2004, Morgan Stanley paid $54 million to settle accusations that it had denied rises and promotions to women, paid them less than men, excluded them from company events and subjected them to lewd behavior. The firm denied any wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Most recently, three investment advisers who worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch accused the bank of gender bias in a suit filed in federal court in Brooklyn in March. Bank of America has denied the accusations. The same law firms that represented women in the complaint against Goldman Sachs are representing the plaintiffs in the Bank of America suit. The complaint against Goldman, which seeks class-action status, is notable because two of the plaintiffs held executive posts. Their accusations highlight a delicate topic on Wall Street: the lack of women executives at the top. Currently, the most prominent include Sallie Krawchek, the head of global wealth and investment management at Bank of America; and Heidi Miller, head of international operations at JPMorgan Chase. But a number of prominent female executives, including Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, and Zoe Cruz, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley, were ousted by their firms in the fallout from the financial crisis. For Goldman, the lawsuit comes at a time when the firm, among the most prestigious and profitable on Wall Street, has taken a public relations beating. This summer, the firm agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges related to the sale of subprime mortgage securities. The firm has also come under fire for returning to profitability far more quickly than its competitors — a criticism that Goldman executives find puzzling. The three plaintiffs in the Goldman lawsuit are H. Cristina Chen-Oster, who worked in the firm’s equities division from 1997 to 2005 and was promoted to vice president; Lisa Parisi, who worked in the asset management group from 2001 to 2008 and was promoted to managing director; and Shanna Orlich, who worked in the firm’s fixed-income unit from 2007 to 2008 as an associate. The most detailed accusations come from Ms. Chen-Oster, who worked mostly in sales on Goldman’s convertible-bond desk. Ms. Chen-Oster claims in an affidavit that shortly after she joined Goldman in 1997, a celebration for a recently promoted male colleague took place at Scores, a New York strip club, and all the employees were encouraged to join. The lawsuit contends that at the end of the night, a married male colleague escorted her to her boyfriend’s apartment building and in the hallway lobby pinned her against the wall, kissing and groping her. That episode, which the male colleague reported to his supervisor the next morning, led to Ms. Chen-Oster’s experiencing “increased hostility and marginalization at the firm,” according to the complaint. The filing details Ms. Chen-Oster’s compensation throughout her tenure. In her second year at the firm, Goldman paid her $475,000, a number she claims was significantly less than that of her male peers. By 2000, a year in which the stock market peaked, Goldman paid her $800,000, a figure she contends was at least 50 percent less than that paid to male counterparts. Ms. Chen-Oster resigned from Goldman and now works as a managing director at Deutsche Bank. Ms. Orlich, another plaintiff, portrays a male-dominated trading-floor culture centered on golf and other physical pursuits. Ms. Orlich, who received business and law degrees from Columbia, says in an affidavit that Goldman’s management would challenge one of her male colleagues, a former member of the Navy Seals, to do push-up contests and “other displays of masculinity.” She claims to have never been invited to frequent golf outings, even though she was a varsity player in high school. A Goldman managing director also hired scantily clad female escorts wearing Santa hats to attend a holiday party, Ms. Orlich claims. A portion of the complaint takes aim at Goldman’s widely known 360-degree reviews, evaluations of employees that involve feedback from a boss, subordinates and peers, that have become a model management tool for other corporations. The plaintiffs contend that managers’ favoritism toward male employees skews the review process, disproportionately placing men in the top quartile of performance. Janet Hanson, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs for 14 years and the founder of 85 Broads, a professional women’s networking organization named after the address of the firm’s former headquarters, says that this lawsuit belies the experience of most Goldman women professionals. “For every woman at Goldman Sachs who feels she has been treated unfairly, I will find a thousand who don’t feel that way,” said Ms. Hanson. “Unfortunately, the people muzzled in a situation like this are the women who work there but can’t talk to the press, but if you asked them if they loved their jobs and are treated equally, the vast, vast majority would say yes.”</text></article>

    <article index="19" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/14views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Buyout Firms’ Sales May Top Purchases<date>Published: September 13, 2010</date><text>Are buyout barons becoming sellout barons?For the first time on record, private equity firms are on track this year to sell more assets than they buy. One recent example: Burger King, a listed company of which affiliates of TPG Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Bain Capital Investors own approximately 31 percent, was sold to 3G Capital. Buyout firm bosses say this reflects the need to produce cash for investors. That’s probably true to a point. But the prospect of tax increases in the United States has also given the executives a rationale to sell now, even if it doesn’t much help their clients. So far in 2010, private equity firms globally have sold $140 billion of assets from their portfolios. That puts this year on a pace for the most disposals since 2007 and the second-biggest year in history, according to Thomson Reuters. Purchases this year stand at around $136 billion so far. Since at least 1994, as far back as these records go, sales have never exceeded purchases in a full year. To some degree, this follows from the recent boom and bust. In 2006 and 2007, private equity firms went on a takeover rampage fueled by cheap debt, making $1.1 trillion of purchases. At some point, the firms need to exit those investments. And investors in their funds, known as limited partners, have been clamoring to extract cash and reduce future commitments. Last week, the managers of the Harvard endowment, for example, said they were reducing their private equity exposure. But it’s possible that something else is figuring in the great buyout sell-off of 2010: self-interest. Private equity managers earn most of their money in two ways. They charge a management fee, generally around 1.5 percent of the assets they oversee. And they take a cut, typically 20 percent, of any increase in the value of investments. This is known as the “carry” or “carried interest.” Until now, those in the industry have paid income tax rates on their management fees but lower capital gains rates on their slice of investment gains. That is set to change in America, where many big buyout firms are based. With elections scheduled in November, it’s not clear when, or even certain whether, Congress might make the proposed changes law. But private equity executives have largely given up lobbying on the issue, instead focusing efforts on avoiding other tax hits like one that might be put into effect when they sell their firms. If the industry is resigned to higher tax rates on carry, that could be changing its behavior. Consider a hypothetical buyout firm, BSD Partners, which acquired a fictional manufacturer of specialty widgets in 2006 for $2 billion. In that deal, BSD put up 25 percent of the purchase price in equity from one of its funds and borrowed the rest. Now it has a chance to sell the business to the industry leader, Widget Worldwide, even though the company’s good prospects mean it could be worth more in just a few months’ time. Suppose Widget Worldwide is offering BSD $2.5 billion for the business today. That’s not bad. Assuming the unit still carries $1.5 billion of debt, BSD’s original $500 million investment is now worth $1 billion. But if BSD holds on for six months and sells its widget firm after it unveils new products and beats sales targets, the business may be worth $2.6 billion. Investors in BSD’s funds might want to wait. Other things being equal, the value of their equity investment would rise by another $100 million, a 20 percent annualized return. But the bosses at BSD are exposed to slightly different arithmetic. Sell today, and of the $500 million equity profit, $100 million goes to them as carry and $400 million goes to the limited partners. Tax the take of the firm and its employees at a 15 percent capital gains rate, and they take home around $85 million among them. Now consider what happens if BSD waits for the higher price for its widget firm in early 2011, assuming the new taxes are in effect by then. The gain made by the firm’s fund jumps to $600 million, with $120 million kept as carry and $480 million going to outside investors. If taxes are charged at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, the BSD crew share only $78 million for their trouble, nearly 10 percent less. That’s an incentive for the buyout firm’s insiders to sell assets now, even though it could shortchange fund investors. This is a hypothetical example. But it is a calculus that private equity barons must, rationally, be considering. And it may be one factor in the selling trend. ROB COX</text></article>
    <article index="20" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/13partner.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Goldman, Harder to Achieve, and Stay, Partner<date>Published: September 12, 2010</date><text>On Wall Street, becoming a partner at Goldman Sachs is considered the equivalent of winning the lottery.This fall, in a secretive process, some 100 executives will be chosen to receive this golden ticket, bestowing rich pay packages and an inside track to the top jobs at the company. What few outside Goldman know is that this ticket can also be taken away. As many as 60 Goldman executives could be stripped of their partnerships this year to make way for new blood, people with firsthand knowledge of the process say. Inside the firm, the process is known as “de-partnering.” Goldman does not disclose who is no longer a partner, and many move on to jobs elsewhere; some stay, telling few of their fate. “I have friends who have been de-partnered who are still there, and most people inside think they are still partners,” said one former Goldman executive, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. “It is something you just don’t talk about.” Goldman has roughly 35,000 employees, but only 375 or so partners. The former Treasury Secretaries Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin, and former Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, now chief executive of financial firm MF Global, were all partners. It can take years to make partner, and being pushed from the inner circle can be wrenching. “Being partner at Goldman is the pinnacle of Wall Street; if you make it, you are considered set for life,” said Michael Driscoll, a visiting professor at Adelphi University and a senior managing director at Bear Stearns before that firm collapsed in 2008. “To have it taken away would just be devastating to an individual. There is just no other word for it.” The financial blow can be substantial as well. Executives stripped of partnership would retain their base salary, roughly $200,000, but their bonuses could be diminished, potentially costing them millions of dollars in a good year. While gaining the coveted status of partner, and then losing it, is certainly not unheard-of at private financial and law firms on Wall Street, Goldman’s partnership process stands out for its size and intricacy. Goldman weeds out partners because it is worried that if the partnership becomes too big, it will lose its cachet and become less of a motivational tool for talented up-and-comers, people involved in the process say. If too many people stay, it creates a logjam. The average tenure of a partner is about eight years, in part because of natural attrition and retirements. Goldman insiders also note they have what they call an “up-and-out” culture, leading to the active management of the pool. The process of vetting new candidates for partner and deciding which existing partners must go began in earnest in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the process, which takes place every two years. They spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 2010 partners will most likely be announced in November. Candidates are judged on many qualities, primarily their financial contribution to the firm. But lawyers and risk managers — who are not big revenue producers — can also make it to the inner circle. The executives responsible for running the partner process this year are the vice chairmen, J. Michael Evans, Michael S. Sherwood and John S. Weinberg; the head of human resources, Edith W. Cooper; and the bank’s president, Gary D. Cohn. Goldman typically removes 30 or so partners every two years, said those people who described the process. The number is expected to be significantly higher this year because fewer senior executives have left the firm as a sluggish economy and uncertain markets limit their opportunities elsewhere. Removing partners like this is unique to Goldman among publicly traded firms. When companies go public, they shed the private partnership system, and ownership of the company is transferred to shareholders. Goldman’s ownership was also transferred to shareholders, but it created a hybrid partner model as an incentive for employees. Those whom Goldman does not want to keep are likely to be quietly told in the coming weeks. Each situation is handled differently, the people with knowledge of the process say. Some partners are given time to find other jobs outside the firm. Others are told they will not be made partner and are asked to consider what they want to do next within the company. While Goldman is on track to remove many more executives than usual, the process is in its early stages and no final decisions have been made, these people caution. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on how it selects and removes partners. The process is at the heart of Goldman’s culture, a way for the firm to reward and retain top talent. Goldman was one of the last of the big Wall Street partnerships to go public, selling shares in 1999. When it was private, the partners were the owners, sharing in the profits, and in some cases having to put in money to shore up losses. To retain that team spirit as a public company, Goldman continued to name partners. In 1999, there were 221. Yet there are differences from past practices. When Goldman was a private partnership, it was rare that a partner would be asked to leave. “Once you made partner, you typically retired as a partner,” said another former Goldman executive who used to be involved in the process. “If we asked someone to leave, it was because we had really screwed up and the person wasn’t pulling their weight.” It has been a rough year for Goldman. In July, it paid $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities while failing to make critical disclosures. The firm did not admit or deny guilt. Still, even in the worst of years, the chance to ascend into the private partnership at Goldman is a huge honor. Candidates can be up for partnership two or even three times before finally being chosen. Partners get investment opportunities not offered to other employees, and are typically the highest paid at the firm. Goldman will even book tables for them at fashionable New York restaurants. A big payday is not guaranteed, however. When the firm does not do well, partners tend to bear the brunt of it. Top Goldman executives did not receive bonuses in 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. But in 2007, a banner year for Goldman, the firm set aside $20.19 billion for compensation and benefits, and its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, took home $68.5 million in stock and cash. Candidates for partner are vetted by current partners. The review process is known inside Goldman as “cross-ruffing,” a reference to a maneuver in bridge. A few hundred people are typically nominated within the whole company, and the number is eventually whittled down to about 100. Each department compiles a list of potential candidates, with photos and performance reviews. Partners in another department review it. Candidates are not interviewed, and in many cases are unaware they are even up for partner. When final decisions are made, it is usually Mr. Blankfein who breaks the good news to the new partners. Few candidates ever find out why they missed the cut. And Goldman announces only inductees, not those who have been removed. Still, there may be a few telltale signs this year. Goldman recently moved to a new building, just steps away from the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. Outer offices are hard to come by, and typically given only to partners. Goldman insiders are already speculating that de-partnered executives who decide to stay will have to give up their window view.</text></article>
    <article index="21" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/business/global/10goldman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Britain Fines Goldman $27 Million Over U.S. Inquiry<date>Published: September 9, 2010</date><text>The British securities regulator said Thursday that it had fined Goldman Sachs £17.5 million, or nearly $27 million, for not disclosing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s inquiry into the synthetic collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus.The regulator, the Financial Services Authority, said Goldman Sachs International, the bank’s London-based unit, “did not have effective procedures in place to ensure that its compliance department was made aware of the S.E.C. investigation so that it could consider whether any notifications needed to be made to the F.S.A.” In an e-mailed statement, Goldman said only that it was “pleased the matter is resolved.” The bank agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle with the S.E.C. over allegations of fraud tied to Abacus 2007-AC1, a credit derivative product based on mortgage-backed securities. The agency’s charges, filed in April after months of inquiry, led its British counterpart to examine whether Goldman should have disclosed the inquiry earlier. At the heart of the case is Fabrice P. Tourre, a Frenchman who in 2007 created Abacus with John A. Paulson, whose hedge fund was betting that the value of the mortgages would decline. Mr. Tourre also helped market the synthetic collateralized debt obligation to investors like ABN Amro and the German bank IKB, both of which lost heavily in the deal. The Dutch bank ABN Amro would later be acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland, while IKB got a government bailout. The S.E.C. charged that Goldman and Mr. Tourre, now on leave from the bank, had not informed those investors about Mr. Paulson’s role in picking a portfolio he saw as likely to default. In September 2009, Mr. Tourre, who had subsequently moved to London to work for Goldman, was served with a Wells notice, which is how the S.E.C. notifies people and corporations that it plans to bring an enforcement action against them. Goldman did not tell the British regulator about the notice, though senior people at the bank’s London office knew of it. As a consequence, “Mr. Tourre remained approved in the U.K. and able to perform a controlled function for several months without further inquiry or challenge from the F.S.A.,” the agency said. It was not until April that Goldman asked to deregister Mr. Tourre from authority’s list of employees allowed to speak to clients. Margaret Cole, managing director for enforcement and financial crime at the regulator, said that Goldman “did not set out to hide anything.” But, referring to the bank’s London unit, she added: “The fact that senior business people at GSI in London knew about Mr Tourre’s Wells notice, but did not consider the obvious regulatory implications for GSI, is very disappointing.” Goldman’s early cooperation with the regulator reduced the fine by about 30 percent, the agency said. The investigation of the Abacus case is continuing in the United States, where Mr. Tourre, the only person named in the S.E.C. complaint, still faces fraud charges because he was not part of the bank’s settlement. He and Goldman have denied deliberately misleading investors about the risks involved with Abacus. The fine of £17.5 million is more than half the £33.3 million that the regulator required JPMorgan Chase to pay in June for not protecting client funds by separating them from the bank’s accounts.</text></article>

    <article index="23" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/01lehman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Lehman Lawyers Seek Records From Hedge Funds and Goldman<date>Published: August 31, 2010</date><text>It is the Wall Street version of the grassy knoll.Nearly two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, some on Wall Street still wonder whether a handful of the nation’s most powerful hedge funds conspired to push the 158-year-old financial giant into bankruptcy while making big profits for themselves. Now, in search of a smoking gun, a law firm hired by the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings has demanded trading records, e-mail and other correspondence for all of 2008 from a collection of prominent hedge funds and the venerable Goldman Sachs. The firms named in the inquiry make up a Who’s Who of the hedge fund world, and include SAC Capital Advisors, run by Steven A. Cohen; Greenlight Capital, managed by David Einhorn; the Citadel Investment Group, led by Kenneth C. Griffin; and Och-Ziff Capital Management, whose chief executive is Daniel Och. At a hearing on Wednesday of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the investigative panel appointed by Congress, Lehman’s former chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., is expected to field questions on the role hedge fund investors might have played in Lehman’s failure, according to people involved with the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Separately, these people said, commission members are expected to press JPMorgan Chase’s chief risk officer, Barry L. Zubrow, about whether the bank was too aggressive in demanding that Lehman post collateral on loans just before Lehman collapsed. No lawsuits have been filed by the Lehman estate against the hedge funds, nor has anyone from the estate accused them of colluding in an effort to hurt Lehman’s stock price and profit from bets they might have placed that the firm’s shares would decline in value. But as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the Lehman estate issued subpoenas in April seeking documents from Goldman and the hedge funds that make reference to their Lehman-related investments, to see if any documents could provide a basis for a lawsuit to recover potentially billions of dollars in damages from the funds. None of the companies that received subpoenas would comment. Some Wall Street experts said that the law firm retained by the Lehman estate, Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman, has produced mixed results pursuing these types of cases, adding that the Lehman estate was looking under several rocks for money that it could return to the firm’s creditors. “The subpoenas appear to be part of a fishing expedition to see if there is any ammunition useful for a lawsuit that can shake some money out of the hedge funds,” said James J. Angel, an associate professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “If anyone digs deep enough they can find some e-mail that can be spun to look bad in court.” And these days, it is fairly easy to put a black hat on hedge funds, particularly those involved in short-selling, or trying to profit by betting that a given company’s stock price will fall. That puts them at odds with the management, stockholders and employees of the target company. Not that long ago, short-sellers were admired for their in-depth research and contrarian points of view. James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates, for instance, was credited with exposing the lies behind the numbers at Enron well before anyone else did. The reputation of short-sellers, however, changed during the financial crisis, when they were sometimes viewed with suspicion by nervous investors and bankers. Soon they were painted as unpatriotic for profiting from the widespread distress in the nation’s banks and brokerage firms. Of course, short-sellers have been blamed for broad market losses before, like during the stock market panic in 1907 and through the huge market swings during the 1930s, said Robert Sloan, author of “Don’t Blame the Shorts: Why Short Sellers Are Always Blamed for Market Crashes and How History is Repeating Itself.” “You think these six guys brought down this firm? They didn’t. Incompetence brought Lehman down,” said Bill Fleckenstein, who said he was short on the stocks of many financial companies in 2008 and today runs a hedge fund that can hold both short and long positions in stocks. Questions about coordinated selling among hedge funds began to swirl when Bear Stearns ran into trouble in 2008. Later, Mr. Fuld and others inside Lehman became increasingly convinced that a cabal of short-sellers had collaborated with individuals inside Goldman Sachs to bring down his firm. In the spring and summer before Lehman collapsed, top executives of the company sent more than 20 complaints about damaging rumors and aggressive short-sellers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Still, despite the feverish post-mortem analysis on the cause of Lehman’s failure, little evidence has surfaced that short-sellers brought down the company, according to experts who have followed the many inquiries into Lehman’s demise. For instance, the effect of short-sellers on Lehman was discussed in just four pages of the 2,200-page report from the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court to determine what went wrong at Lehman and who was at fault. The report pointed instead to numerous factors that contributed to Lehman’s downfall, including accounting maneuvers that shuffled billions of dollars in assets off of Lehman’s books and demands from rival Wall Street banks that Lehman post collateral on loans it needed badly. This spring, the Lehman estate sued JPMorgan Chase, contending that the bank required Lehman to turn over $8.6 billion in collateral, setting off a cash squeeze at the firm. The estate hopes to recoup billions of dollars in collateral as well as damages. JPMorgan, which has denied the accusations in the Lehman suit, filed documents last month in court arguing that it offered financial support to Lehman in the crisis and that the suit “attempts to erase this history, breathing new life into the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.” Furthermore, lawyers for Och-Ziff, the fund run by Mr. Och that was subpoenaed for its records, argued in court documents that the S.E.C. had received and sifted through all of this same data two years ago. That inquiry “has gone nowhere because there is nothing,” a lawyer for Och-Ziff argued last month before Judge James M. Peck in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. But the S.E.C. examination of short-selling activity in 2008 is still active, according to two people with knowledge of the S.E.C.’s inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The funds could still be asked to produce documents beyond those in the initial request, which centered on activities in June 2008, one of the two people said. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. Even if the Lehman estate finds a smoking gun in the hedge funds’ records and decides to pursue a claim against them, the case could be difficult to prove in court, some defense lawyers said. Proving that the hedge funds had positions that would have allowed them to profit from Lehman’s demise is the relatively easy part, they said. Proving that the hedge funds spread false rumors — and that those rumors caused direct harm to Lehman’s business or its stock price — are much tougher hurdles.</text></article>

    <article index="26" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/business/economy/26trade.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Despite Reform, Banks Have Room for Risky Deals<date>Published: August 25, 2010</date><text>When Congress passed a new financial regulation bill last month, it sought to prevent federally insured banks from making speculative bets using their own money. But that will not stop banks from making bets that some critics deem risky, even as the rules go into effect over the next few years.That is because many such bets — on the direction of the stock market or the price of coal, for example — are done on behalf of clients. So, the banks say, they will continue to be allowable despite the new restrictions. Indeed, several trades that were made on behalf of clients went bad for the banks even as the new rules were being debated in Washington this year. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for example, each lost more than $100 million on transactions handled for customers in the period from April to July. Blowups like these, only larger, contributed to the financial crisis and forced the federal government to spend billions of dollars to bail out financial institutions. Yet analysts are quick to point out that many of those transactions were handled by the banks, ostensibly to serve clients. “You can use client activity as a cover for basically anything you are doing,” said Janet Tavakoli, who runs her own structured finance consulting firm. “It’s very problematic that losses like this are showing up. It’s a prime example of what the financial reform bill doesn’t address.” That ambiguity could have broad consequences for the future of trading on Wall Street. Given the size of the banks, these recent losses were relatively small. But they highlight how banks will continue to be able to make bets where their own money is at risk — a practice that has yielded huge profits on Wall Street in recent years. Though these trades were made on behalf of clients, they subjected the banks to the kind of risk that Congress sought to curtail when it devised the Volcker Rule, which banned banks from speculating with their own money. That practice is known as proprietary trading. Even before the new rules were passed, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan began dismantling their stand-alone “prop desks” and shifting those traders into client-related businesses. Goldman is considering changes that could turn some of its star proprietary traders into asset managers who rely on capital from outside investors. But for all the talk of shutting down trading desks and reassigning employees to prepare for the Volcker Rule, proprietary-style trading will probably survive, if under a different name. This year, for example, several large insurance companies approached Goldman Sachs, looking to bet that the markets would not stay quiet. Goldman gladly took the other side of the trades, but when the markets turned choppy in May, the firm was caught short and quickly lost $250 million. Goldman, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its losses on that investment. But in a conference call with analysts last month, the bank’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, explained: “We didn’t hedge it fast enough. Things spiked really dramatically, really fast.” Months before that trade, though, Goldman Sachs’s research department named a bet against volatility as one its top 10 trading strategies for 2010. Goldman followed its own advice and put its own money in play by failing to adequately hedge the trade with the client who wanted to bet on volatility, which would have given Goldman a neutral position. In this way, a client-oriented trade can effectively become a proprietary bet. To be sure, in some cases it is necessary for a bank to take a financial risk in order to execute trades quickly and preserve market liquidity. What is more, it can be difficult even for Wall Streeters to draw the line between holding securities as inventory for clients and owning them with a view toward where the market is going. Goldman Sachs, for example, derived about $37.3 billion from trading activities in 2009, according to a Citigroup research report. Perhaps $1.5 billion, or about 4 percent of that revenue, came from dedicated proprietary trading desks. Were other Goldman traders essentially making proprietary bets in the process of serving clients? Likely, analysts and traders say — though it is very hard to tell. “Goldman tends to have businesses that have a customer focus with a proprietary overlay,” said one hedge fund manager and Goldman alumnus who insisted on anonymity. “That overlay can effectively allow them to make directional bets by using the customer flow to get them there.” But Goldman is hardly unique when it comes to walking the fine line between serving clients and taking positions. Late last year, with clients eager to bet that coal prices would rise, JPMorgan took the other side of the trade and amassed contracts on hundreds of millions of dollars on coal — enough to dominate the European market. Initially the trade went JPMorgan’s way and yielded profits, but in April the Morgan traders were caught off guard when European coal futures abruptly started rising. In fact, the wrong-sided bets erased all of the previous gains, and by the middle of June, it had turned into one of the commodities unit’s biggest losses — nearly $130 million. JPMorgan would not disclose the names of the clients and would not comment for this article. But in an internal conference call, Blythe Masters, who oversees the commodities unit, said that the bank made an error in judgment taking a risk on its own behalf. “We made a bit of a rookie error,” she said, according to parts of a recording first published by Bloomberg News. “We got overexposed in the market and made ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze.” Over the years, banks have shifted from being intermediaries who match buyer and seller to middlemen who put their own capital at risk. When a trade request comes in from a customer, traders have the option of handing it off to a second party that wants to take the other side. But if a second investor cannot be found, or if the trading desk has a market outlook that aligns with the bet, the trader can take the opposing position using the bank’s own account. The bank can then either hold on to that risk or hedge the investment so that its position is effectively neutral. In the case of Goldman’s bet on volatility, the investment soured before the bank could sell it or reduce the risk.</text></article>

Plan to Uncover Companies’ Tax Strategies<date>Published: August 24, 2010</date><text>It is the tax world’s version of blind man’s bluff.Every year, thousands of the nation’s largest corporations are required to report to the I.R.S. whether they have reduced their tax bills by using questionable accounting strategies. They have to supply an estimate of how much they might owe if those strategies failed to withstand an audit. They even have to set aside enough money to pay the government if their claims are found to be improper. But the corporations are not obliged to reveal precisely what those uncertain tax positions are — and if the I.R.S. does not manage to ferret them out and challenge them before the three-year statute of limitations expires, the companies can keep the money. Now, the Internal Revenue Service is calling an end to the game. Beginning next year, the agency plans to mandate that corporations also provide a brief description of their uncertain tax positions and their rationale, offering essentially a road map for its auditors. The stakes are enormous. According to one law firm’s analysis of the most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies in the Fortune 500 this year reported more than $200 billion in uncertain tax positions — exceeding the $138 billion paid in corporate taxes last year. At least 40 companies exceeded $1 billion in such reserves: Microsoft’s was $5.4 billion; Bank of America reported $5.2 billion; the American International Group listed $4.8 billion; and Goldman Sachs, $1.9 billion. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, who wrote and is promoting the plan, which has rattled the accounting world, said it was intended to make tax collection more efficient and to urge businesses to comply more closely with the law. While some companies may pay more taxes, Mr. Shulman acknowledged, the new procedures would also help businesses by encouraging Congress and the I.R.S. to clarify ambiguous portions of the nation’s convoluted tax code more quickly. “We are moving away from what I would describe as a contentious relationship, where we spend too much of our time identifying issues, to one where we know the issues from the outset and spend our time engaging on appropriate issues,” Mr. Shulman said. Though transparency may be considered a virtue by the person collecting taxes, it is viewed as a menace to the people whose job is to minimize them. Mr. Shulman’s initiative, which even his critics concede he has the authority to enact, has set off an anguished response from corporations and accountants. They predict that it will make a cumbersome system even more costly and confrontational. David A. Lifson, former president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, cautions that the plan will allow tax authorities to bully taxpayers by bludgeoning them with the very advice they received from their own accountants and tax lawyers. “We barely ever see a revenue agent who doesn’t find an issue and try to extract some kind of payment for its nuisance value,” said Mr. Lifson, a partner at the accounting firm Crowe Horwath. “Now they want you to give the enemy all the guns and walk into a tax audit ducking. And they can pester you into paying more taxes rather than taking the trouble to figure out what amount is fair.” Others warn that the I.R.S. may gain transparency at the expense of investors and the financial markets. Because the additional disclosure may touch on legally privileged information, some tax lawyers fear that corporate executives may withhold information from their auditors and accountants, who assess a company’s finances and actual value. Many tax practitioners also expect the advent of yet another game of cat and mouse, as corporations devise new ways to limit what information is subject to disclosure. While corporations have long complained about the increasingly complicated way the United States taxes businesses, Mr. Shulman’s proposal would be a fundamental shift in a system where voluntary compliance and regulatory complexity have raised creative interpretation of the tax code to a high art. The current corporate rate of 35 percent is higher than that in many other developed countries. But Congress has larded the code with so many deductions and loopholes — including a dollar-for-dollar credit for taxes paid to foreign governments and generous deductions for depreciation and debt financing — that the effective rate paid by most companies is below 22 percent, lower than in most developed countries. That combination of high marginal rates and a plethora of arcane write-offs and shelters has created a structure that encourages, and rewards, companies that use aggressive tax strategies. Companies routinely hire outside lawyers to review their tax claims and judge the likelihood of withstanding a challenge. In 2006, the I.R.S. began requiring companies to report any tax savings from an accounting strategy that had not been judged “more than likely” to withstand an audit.</text></article>
    <article index="28" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/23wyly.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wyly Brothers Break Silence on S.E.C. Case<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>ASPEN, Colo. — The Texas billionaire Sam Wyly has a laugh that blends the cackle of a mad scientist with the giggle of a teenager — a high-pitched titter that makes him sound thoroughly delighted. Until, that is, talk turns to the recent securities fraud suit against him and his brother, Charles.At that point, Mr. Wyly’s laugh makes him sound thoroughly determined — and a little bit manic. “I can tell you one thing,” he says in a twang that is a little bit Louisiana, where he was raised, and a little bit Texas, where he has spent most of his professional life. “They gonna lose. They gonna get nothing.” Then his eyes brighten and he leans back in his chair. “Tee-hee-hee-hee!” In the six years since the Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating the Wylys, the brothers have not spoken publicly about the business enterprises that produced so many unflattering national headlines about them: a maze of 58 trusts and shell corporations based in two well-known tax havens, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The brothers were silent when a Senate subcommittee released a 2006 report accusing them of using hundreds of millions in untaxed dollars to pay for business ventures and to acquire art and jewelry, including a $622,000 ruby and a $937,500 painting of Benjamin Franklin. And until last week, they had referred to their lawyer all questions about the S.E.C.’s suit, which was filed in late July and accuses them of “an elaborate sham” designed to fraudulently sell more than $500 million in offshore assets. But the Wylys have decided that after months of failed settlement talks with the S.E.C., it was time to make the first jab in the fight over public perception. In separate interviews conducted in this resort town where they spend summers, the Dallas-based entrepreneurs and deep-pocketed Republican donors offer a counternarrative to the government’s scathing 78-page complaint. “I think it’s good politics to beat up on big companies and rich people,” said Sam Wyly. Soon, he said, “the election will be over, and this will be forgotten about, or lost, be shut down, be gone, will be nothing.” For the S.E.C., which has been trying to shake off its pre-2008 torpor, the case might be another attempt to demonstrate some vigor and perhaps notch a new eight- or nine-figure fine, as it did with Goldman Sachs. What is certain is that the S.E.C. has spent a vast amount of time pursuing the Wylys, who have become the elusive White Whale to its Captain Ahab. At one of the last settlement talks, the Wylys’ lawyer, William A. Brewer III, said he pointed out that since the investigation began, nearly every lawyer in the room — on both sides — had celebrated the birth of at least one child. “If this goes on much longer,” he said looking around the conference room on the S.E.C.’s fourth floor, “our kids can settle this with a scrimmage.” A spokesman for the S.E.C. says the agency’s investigation has been so lengthy because of its financial complexity and the Wylys’ efforts to cloak their actions offshore. Now semi-retired, the Wylys became a team in the early ’60s and have jointly founded or acquired companies that sold steaks (Bonanza Steakhouse), arts and crafts supplies (Michaels Stores), software (Sterling Software), financial services (Maverick Capital, a hedge fund) and the list goes on. Sam, who is 75, spotted the opportunities — he likes to call himself “the conceptor” — and Charles, who is 76, minded the details and organization. They were known for acting quickly, for sometimes ruthless payroll cuts and for an occasionally stubborn devotion to their plans, even when the plans were doomed. Most notably, the two lost close to $100 million of their own and their shareholders’ money in the ’70s when a company called Datran failed to compete with AT&amp;T in data transmission. But they recovered from that fiasco. In 2000, Sterling Software was sold for $4 billion, and in 2006 Michaels was sold for $6 billion. “It’s a game,” said Sam. “You win some, you lose some. Some are sort of a tie.” Mostly, the Wylys have won. Depression-era babies, they were raised in rural Louisiana by a well-educated mother and father who fell on hard times by failing to hedge a cotton crop. For a time, the family moved into a shack without electricity or plumbing. Today, Sam is on Forbes’s list of billionaires. Charles would not discuss his net worth other than to note, with a smile, “I’m not on that list.” Charles came dressed for an interview like a man headed to a posh rodeo, in shiny leather boots, jeans and neatly pressed cowboy’s shirt. Like his brother, he does not drink, smoke or swear, in large part, he says, because the Wylys are Christian Scientists, a religion that discourages such behavior. “We don’t carry on that way,” he explained, smiling at his own old-fashionedness. “You walk along and trip, you might say ‘dag-gummit.’”</text></article>

Nightmares<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>TOYOTA, Goldman Sachs and BP have shown some of the steepest declines in public perception this year, according to research groups that analyze corporate reputations based on online polls and phone calls. Although some experts say the online polls should be used with caution -- as the respondents may not represent the entire population -- others say they are one of the best ways to keep tabs on fast-moving public sentiment. Toyota has regained close to half the public support it lost after late January, according to daily public perception scores collected by YouGov, a market research firm. (That month, Toyota suspended sales of eight models over fears about uncontrolled acceleration.) Experts attribute Toyota's rebound to its longstanding reputation for quality and doubt about whether the company was to blame for the problems. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, has had a negative public perception score since 2008, when the government helped bail out Wall Street. And after the company was charged with fraud in April -- a case later settled -- it continued to see damage to its reputation. As for BP, public perception has been on the rise since oil stopped spilling into the Gulf of Mexico on July 15. But experts say the company still has a long way to go to regain public support. ''You still see people strongly associating 'Exxon' and 'Valdez.' And that spill was 21 years ago,'' said Charles Fombrun, chairman and co-founder of the Reputation Institute, which helps companies measure how they are perceived. ''It will take BP years and years and years to disassociate itself from 'Deepwater Horizon' or 'gulf crisis.'''

Relatively few have landed a role in a client’s Hollywood blockbuster. However, Christian Baha, the head of $1.2 billon hedge fund group Superfund, has been given a cameo in “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” the sequel to the original “Wall Street,” FROM 1987, thanks to a friendship with the director — and Superfund investor — Oliver Stone, Reuters reports. Mr. Baha, whose computer-driven funds aim to exploit trends in global futures markets, has a short speaking role as, perhaps unsurprisingly, a hedge fund manager, while Michael Douglas resumes the role of ruthless financier Gordon Gekko in a film some have seen as a thinly veiled attack on Goldman Sachs. However, Reuters noted, it is likely that Mr. Stone, the Oscar-winning director of “Platoon” and “Born on the Fourth of July” has experienced a roller-coaster ride in the market.

Mr. Iwanowski and Mark Carhart ran Global Alpha when it “expanded its reputation as one of the smartest investing outfits on Wall Street,” as Scott Patterson writes in his book “The Quants.” The two men had taken over the reins from Clifford Asness, now of AQR Capital Management, in 1998. At its peak, Global Alpha managed some $12 billion in assets and was considered the model of a brainy, computer-driven trading firm. But in the 2007, the credit crunch tripped up the quant fund’s strategies, and investors pulled out billions of dollars of their money. Mr. Iwanowski and Mr. Carhart left Goldman in March 2009. Mr. Carhart has since founded hedge fund Kepos Capital.

Mr. Robertson and John Thornton, both former Goldman Sachs bankers and non-executive directors on the HSBC board, are frontrunners to succeed Stephen Green, according to the newspaper, which said the board favored a plan to appoint Mr. Robertson on a temporary basis. The board would then look to groom Mr. Thornton or another internal candidate to take over from Mr. Robertson on a permanent basis in two to three years time, according to the report Mr. Robertson is currently non-executive chairman of British airline engine-maker Rolls-Royce. A compromise would be sought by HSBC’s board to enable him to continue in both roles, the newspaper said. HSBC has been searching for a new chairman since September 7, when it said Mr. Green was stepping down to become trade and investment minister in Britain’s coalition government.

It protects both the egos of those who worked at Goldman (those not selected and those leaving) and the interests of the entity — retaining the productive people and new talents while letting go the less productive. It clearly rewards according to the success of the entire enterprise (not merely some) and tries to diffuse favoritism by dividing the decision-making among the groups. Yet it leaves a sufficient degree of competition to encourage better performance. This mix is the most impressive part of the program. But this program is hard to emulate, because without the culture of commitment another balance must be achieved and less discretion would be given to decision makers. Rules that reduce the discretion would undermine the delicate balance. That may be why Goldman is unique.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/16/business/16bias.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman Sachs Is Accused of Gender Bias<date>Published: September 15, 2010</date><text>Three former female employees at Goldman Sachs sued the investment bank on Wednesday, contending that the firm discriminates systematically against women.The women claim that Goldman intentionally pays its male employees more than their female counterparts, and promotes them more frequently. A persistent pattern of bias has resulted in women being underrepresented in the firm’s management ranks, the complaint said. “The number of women in management positions at Goldman dwindles as the level of management rises,” the complaint said, citing Goldman data that showed that women made up 29 percent of the firm’s vice presidents, 17 percent of its managing directors and 14 percent of its partners. Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, said, “We believe this suit is without merit. People are critical to our business, and we make extraordinary efforts to recruit, develop and retain outstanding women professionals.” The complaint, filed in United States District Court in Manhattan, is the latest in a stream of lawsuits filed over the last decade accusing Wall Street firms of denying women the kind of pay packages and job opportunities granted to men. Other suits have claimed harassment in overwhelmingly male offices and trading floors. In 2004, Morgan Stanley paid $54 million to settle accusations that it had denied rises and promotions to women, paid them less than men, excluded them from company events and subjected them to lewd behavior. The firm denied any wrongdoing as part of that settlement. Most recently, three investment advisers who worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch accused the bank of gender bias in a suit filed in federal court in Brooklyn in March. Bank of America has denied the accusations. The same law firms that represented women in the complaint against Goldman Sachs are representing the plaintiffs in the Bank of America suit. The complaint against Goldman, which seeks class-action status, is notable because two of the plaintiffs held executive posts. Their accusations highlight a delicate topic on Wall Street: the lack of women executives at the top. Currently, the most prominent include Sallie Krawchek, the head of global wealth and investment management at Bank of America; and Heidi Miller, head of international operations at JPMorgan Chase. But a number of prominent female executives, including Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, and Zoe Cruz, a former co-president of Morgan Stanley, were ousted by their firms in the fallout from the financial crisis. For Goldman, the lawsuit comes at a time when the firm, among the most prestigious and profitable on Wall Street, has taken a public relations beating. This summer, the firm agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges related to the sale of subprime mortgage securities. The firm has also come under fire for returning to profitability far more quickly than its competitors — a criticism that Goldman executives find puzzling. The three plaintiffs in the Goldman lawsuit are H. Cristina Chen-Oster, who worked in the firm’s equities division from 1997 to 2005 and was promoted to vice president; Lisa Parisi, who worked in the asset management group from 2001 to 2008 and was promoted to managing director; and Shanna Orlich, who worked in the firm’s fixed-income unit from 2007 to 2008 as an associate. The most detailed accusations come from Ms. Chen-Oster, who worked mostly in sales on Goldman’s convertible-bond desk. Ms. Chen-Oster claims in an affidavit that shortly after she joined Goldman in 1997, a celebration for a recently promoted male colleague took place at Scores, a New York strip club, and all the employees were encouraged to join. The lawsuit contends that at the end of the night, a married male colleague escorted her to her boyfriend’s apartment building and in the hallway lobby pinned her against the wall, kissing and groping her. That episode, which the male colleague reported to his supervisor the next morning, led to Ms. Chen-Oster’s experiencing “increased hostility and marginalization at the firm,” according to the complaint. The filing details Ms. Chen-Oster’s compensation throughout her tenure. In her second year at the firm, Goldman paid her $475,000, a number she claims was significantly less than that of her male peers. By 2000, a year in which the stock market peaked, Goldman paid her $800,000, a figure she contends was at least 50 percent less than that paid to male counterparts. Ms. Chen-Oster resigned from Goldman and now works as a managing director at Deutsche Bank. Ms. Orlich, another plaintiff, portrays a male-dominated trading-floor culture centered on golf and other physical pursuits. Ms. Orlich, who received business and law degrees from Columbia, says in an affidavit that Goldman’s management would challenge one of her male colleagues, a former member of the Navy Seals, to do push-up contests and “other displays of masculinity.” She claims to have never been invited to frequent golf outings, even though she was a varsity player in high school. A Goldman managing director also hired scantily clad female escorts wearing Santa hats to attend a holiday party, Ms. Orlich claims. A portion of the complaint takes aim at Goldman’s widely known 360-degree reviews, evaluations of employees that involve feedback from a boss, subordinates and peers, that have become a model management tool for other corporations. The plaintiffs contend that managers’ favoritism toward male employees skews the review process, disproportionately placing men in the top quartile of performance. Janet Hanson, who was an executive at Goldman Sachs for 14 years and the founder of 85 Broads, a professional women’s networking organization named after the address of the firm’s former headquarters, says that this lawsuit belies the experience of most Goldman women professionals. “For every woman at Goldman Sachs who feels she has been treated unfairly, I will find a thousand who don’t feel that way,” said Ms. Hanson. “Unfortunately, the people muzzled in a situation like this are the women who work there but can’t talk to the press, but if you asked them if they loved their jobs and are treated equally, the vast, vast majority would say yes.”</text></article>

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/14views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Buyout Firms’ Sales May Top Purchases<date>Published: September 13, 2010</date><text>Are buyout barons becoming sellout barons?For the first time on record, private equity firms are on track this year to sell more assets than they buy. One recent example: Burger King, a listed company of which affiliates of TPG Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Bain Capital Investors own approximately 31 percent, was sold to 3G Capital. Buyout firm bosses say this reflects the need to produce cash for investors. That’s probably true to a point. But the prospect of tax increases in the United States has also given the executives a rationale to sell now, even if it doesn’t much help their clients. So far in 2010, private equity firms globally have sold $140 billion of assets from their portfolios. That puts this year on a pace for the most disposals since 2007 and the second-biggest year in history, according to Thomson Reuters. Purchases this year stand at around $136 billion so far. Since at least 1994, as far back as these records go, sales have never exceeded purchases in a full year. To some degree, this follows from the recent boom and bust. In 2006 and 2007, private equity firms went on a takeover rampage fueled by cheap debt, making $1.1 trillion of purchases. At some point, the firms need to exit those investments. And investors in their funds, known as limited partners, have been clamoring to extract cash and reduce future commitments. Last week, the managers of the Harvard endowment, for example, said they were reducing their private equity exposure. But it’s possible that something else is figuring in the great buyout sell-off of 2010: self-interest. Private equity managers earn most of their money in two ways. They charge a management fee, generally around 1.5 percent of the assets they oversee. And they take a cut, typically 20 percent, of any increase in the value of investments. This is known as the “carry” or “carried interest.” Until now, those in the industry have paid income tax rates on their management fees but lower capital gains rates on their slice of investment gains. That is set to change in America, where many big buyout firms are based. With elections scheduled in November, it’s not clear when, or even certain whether, Congress might make the proposed changes law. But private equity executives have largely given up lobbying on the issue, instead focusing efforts on avoiding other tax hits like one that might be put into effect when they sell their firms. If the industry is resigned to higher tax rates on carry, that could be changing its behavior. Consider a hypothetical buyout firm, BSD Partners, which acquired a fictional manufacturer of specialty widgets in 2006 for $2 billion. In that deal, BSD put up 25 percent of the purchase price in equity from one of its funds and borrowed the rest. Now it has a chance to sell the business to the industry leader, Widget Worldwide, even though the company’s good prospects mean it could be worth more in just a few months’ time. Suppose Widget Worldwide is offering BSD $2.5 billion for the business today. That’s not bad. Assuming the unit still carries $1.5 billion of debt, BSD’s original $500 million investment is now worth $1 billion. But if BSD holds on for six months and sells its widget firm after it unveils new products and beats sales targets, the business may be worth $2.6 billion. Investors in BSD’s funds might want to wait. Other things being equal, the value of their equity investment would rise by another $100 million, a 20 percent annualized return. But the bosses at BSD are exposed to slightly different arithmetic. Sell today, and of the $500 million equity profit, $100 million goes to them as carry and $400 million goes to the limited partners. Tax the take of the firm and its employees at a 15 percent capital gains rate, and they take home around $85 million among them. Now consider what happens if BSD waits for the higher price for its widget firm in early 2011, assuming the new taxes are in effect by then. The gain made by the firm’s fund jumps to $600 million, with $120 million kept as carry and $480 million going to outside investors. If taxes are charged at ordinary income rates of 35 percent, the BSD crew share only $78 million for their trouble, nearly 10 percent less. That’s an incentive for the buyout firm’s insiders to sell assets now, even though it could shortchange fund investors. This is a hypothetical example. But it is a calculus that private equity barons must, rationally, be considering. And it may be one factor in the selling trend. ROB COX</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/13/business/13partner.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Goldman, Harder to Achieve, and Stay, Partner<date>Published: September 12, 2010</date><text>On Wall Street, becoming a partner at Goldman Sachs is considered the equivalent of winning the lottery.This fall, in a secretive process, some 100 executives will be chosen to receive this golden ticket, bestowing rich pay packages and an inside track to the top jobs at the company. What few outside Goldman know is that this ticket can also be taken away. As many as 60 Goldman executives could be stripped of their partnerships this year to make way for new blood, people with firsthand knowledge of the process say. Inside the firm, the process is known as “de-partnering.” Goldman does not disclose who is no longer a partner, and many move on to jobs elsewhere; some stay, telling few of their fate. “I have friends who have been de-partnered who are still there, and most people inside think they are still partners,” said one former Goldman executive, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity. “It is something you just don’t talk about.” Goldman has roughly 35,000 employees, but only 375 or so partners. The former Treasury Secretaries Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin, and former Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, now chief executive of financial firm MF Global, were all partners. It can take years to make partner, and being pushed from the inner circle can be wrenching. “Being partner at Goldman is the pinnacle of Wall Street; if you make it, you are considered set for life,” said Michael Driscoll, a visiting professor at Adelphi University and a senior managing director at Bear Stearns before that firm collapsed in 2008. “To have it taken away would just be devastating to an individual. There is just no other word for it.” The financial blow can be substantial as well. Executives stripped of partnership would retain their base salary, roughly $200,000, but their bonuses could be diminished, potentially costing them millions of dollars in a good year. While gaining the coveted status of partner, and then losing it, is certainly not unheard-of at private financial and law firms on Wall Street, Goldman’s partnership process stands out for its size and intricacy. Goldman weeds out partners because it is worried that if the partnership becomes too big, it will lose its cachet and become less of a motivational tool for talented up-and-comers, people involved in the process say. If too many people stay, it creates a logjam. The average tenure of a partner is about eight years, in part because of natural attrition and retirements. Goldman insiders also note they have what they call an “up-and-out” culture, leading to the active management of the pool. The process of vetting new candidates for partner and deciding which existing partners must go began in earnest in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the process, which takes place every two years. They spoke on the condition of anonymity. The 2010 partners will most likely be announced in November. Candidates are judged on many qualities, primarily their financial contribution to the firm. But lawyers and risk managers — who are not big revenue producers — can also make it to the inner circle. The executives responsible for running the partner process this year are the vice chairmen, J. Michael Evans, Michael S. Sherwood and John S. Weinberg; the head of human resources, Edith W. Cooper; and the bank’s president, Gary D. Cohn. Goldman typically removes 30 or so partners every two years, said those people who described the process. The number is expected to be significantly higher this year because fewer senior executives have left the firm as a sluggish economy and uncertain markets limit their opportunities elsewhere. Removing partners like this is unique to Goldman among publicly traded firms. When companies go public, they shed the private partnership system, and ownership of the company is transferred to shareholders. Goldman’s ownership was also transferred to shareholders, but it created a hybrid partner model as an incentive for employees. Those whom Goldman does not want to keep are likely to be quietly told in the coming weeks. Each situation is handled differently, the people with knowledge of the process say. Some partners are given time to find other jobs outside the firm. Others are told they will not be made partner and are asked to consider what they want to do next within the company. While Goldman is on track to remove many more executives than usual, the process is in its early stages and no final decisions have been made, these people caution. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on how it selects and removes partners. The process is at the heart of Goldman’s culture, a way for the firm to reward and retain top talent. Goldman was one of the last of the big Wall Street partnerships to go public, selling shares in 1999. When it was private, the partners were the owners, sharing in the profits, and in some cases having to put in money to shore up losses. To retain that team spirit as a public company, Goldman continued to name partners. In 1999, there were 221. Yet there are differences from past practices. When Goldman was a private partnership, it was rare that a partner would be asked to leave. “Once you made partner, you typically retired as a partner,” said another former Goldman executive who used to be involved in the process. “If we asked someone to leave, it was because we had really screwed up and the person wasn’t pulling their weight.” It has been a rough year for Goldman. In July, it paid $550 million to settle civil fraud accusations that it had duped clients by selling mortgage securities while failing to make critical disclosures. The firm did not admit or deny guilt. Still, even in the worst of years, the chance to ascend into the private partnership at Goldman is a huge honor. Candidates can be up for partnership two or even three times before finally being chosen. Partners get investment opportunities not offered to other employees, and are typically the highest paid at the firm. Goldman will even book tables for them at fashionable New York restaurants. A big payday is not guaranteed, however. When the firm does not do well, partners tend to bear the brunt of it. Top Goldman executives did not receive bonuses in 2008, the peak of the financial crisis. But in 2007, a banner year for Goldman, the firm set aside $20.19 billion for compensation and benefits, and its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, took home $68.5 million in stock and cash. Candidates for partner are vetted by current partners. The review process is known inside Goldman as “cross-ruffing,” a reference to a maneuver in bridge. A few hundred people are typically nominated within the whole company, and the number is eventually whittled down to about 100. Each department compiles a list of potential candidates, with photos and performance reviews. Partners in another department review it. Candidates are not interviewed, and in many cases are unaware they are even up for partner. When final decisions are made, it is usually Mr. Blankfein who breaks the good news to the new partners. Few candidates ever find out why they missed the cut. And Goldman announces only inductees, not those who have been removed. Still, there may be a few telltale signs this year. Goldman recently moved to a new building, just steps away from the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. Outer offices are hard to come by, and typically given only to partners. Goldman insiders are already speculating that de-partnered executives who decide to stay will have to give up their window view.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/10/business/global/10goldman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Britain Fines Goldman $27 Million Over U.S. Inquiry<date>Published: September 9, 2010</date><text>The British securities regulator said Thursday that it had fined Goldman Sachs £17.5 million, or nearly $27 million, for not disclosing the Securities and Exchange Commission’s inquiry into the synthetic collateralized debt obligation known as Abacus.The regulator, the Financial Services Authority, said Goldman Sachs International, the bank’s London-based unit, “did not have effective procedures in place to ensure that its compliance department was made aware of the S.E.C. investigation so that it could consider whether any notifications needed to be made to the F.S.A.” In an e-mailed statement, Goldman said only that it was “pleased the matter is resolved.” The bank agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle with the S.E.C. over allegations of fraud tied to Abacus 2007-AC1, a credit derivative product based on mortgage-backed securities. The agency’s charges, filed in April after months of inquiry, led its British counterpart to examine whether Goldman should have disclosed the inquiry earlier. At the heart of the case is Fabrice P. Tourre, a Frenchman who in 2007 created Abacus with John A. Paulson, whose hedge fund was betting that the value of the mortgages would decline. Mr. Tourre also helped market the synthetic collateralized debt obligation to investors like ABN Amro and the German bank IKB, both of which lost heavily in the deal. The Dutch bank ABN Amro would later be acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland, while IKB got a government bailout. The S.E.C. charged that Goldman and Mr. Tourre, now on leave from the bank, had not informed those investors about Mr. Paulson’s role in picking a portfolio he saw as likely to default. In September 2009, Mr. Tourre, who had subsequently moved to London to work for Goldman, was served with a Wells notice, which is how the S.E.C. notifies people and corporations that it plans to bring an enforcement action against them. Goldman did not tell the British regulator about the notice, though senior people at the bank’s London office knew of it. As a consequence, “Mr. Tourre remained approved in the U.K. and able to perform a controlled function for several months without further inquiry or challenge from the F.S.A.,” the agency said. It was not until April that Goldman asked to deregister Mr. Tourre from authority’s list of employees allowed to speak to clients. Margaret Cole, managing director for enforcement and financial crime at the regulator, said that Goldman “did not set out to hide anything.” But, referring to the bank’s London unit, she added: “The fact that senior business people at GSI in London knew about Mr Tourre’s Wells notice, but did not consider the obvious regulatory implications for GSI, is very disappointing.” Goldman’s early cooperation with the regulator reduced the fine by about 30 percent, the agency said. The investigation of the Abacus case is continuing in the United States, where Mr. Tourre, the only person named in the S.E.C. complaint, still faces fraud charges because he was not part of the bank’s settlement. He and Goldman have denied deliberately misleading investors about the risks involved with Abacus. The fine of £17.5 million is more than half the £33.3 million that the regulator required JPMorgan Chase to pay in June for not protecting client funds by separating them from the bank’s accounts.</text></article>

    <article index="13" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/01lehman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Lehman Lawyers Seek Records From Hedge Funds and Goldman<date>Published: August 31, 2010</date><text>It is the Wall Street version of the grassy knoll.Nearly two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, some on Wall Street still wonder whether a handful of the nation’s most powerful hedge funds conspired to push the 158-year-old financial giant into bankruptcy while making big profits for themselves. Now, in search of a smoking gun, a law firm hired by the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings has demanded trading records, e-mail and other correspondence for all of 2008 from a collection of prominent hedge funds and the venerable Goldman Sachs. The firms named in the inquiry make up a Who’s Who of the hedge fund world, and include SAC Capital Advisors, run by Steven A. Cohen; Greenlight Capital, managed by David Einhorn; the Citadel Investment Group, led by Kenneth C. Griffin; and Och-Ziff Capital Management, whose chief executive is Daniel Och. At a hearing on Wednesday of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the investigative panel appointed by Congress, Lehman’s former chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., is expected to field questions on the role hedge fund investors might have played in Lehman’s failure, according to people involved with the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Separately, these people said, commission members are expected to press JPMorgan Chase’s chief risk officer, Barry L. Zubrow, about whether the bank was too aggressive in demanding that Lehman post collateral on loans just before Lehman collapsed. No lawsuits have been filed by the Lehman estate against the hedge funds, nor has anyone from the estate accused them of colluding in an effort to hurt Lehman’s stock price and profit from bets they might have placed that the firm’s shares would decline in value. But as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the Lehman estate issued subpoenas in April seeking documents from Goldman and the hedge funds that make reference to their Lehman-related investments, to see if any documents could provide a basis for a lawsuit to recover potentially billions of dollars in damages from the funds. None of the companies that received subpoenas would comment. Some Wall Street experts said that the law firm retained by the Lehman estate, Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman, has produced mixed results pursuing these types of cases, adding that the Lehman estate was looking under several rocks for money that it could return to the firm’s creditors. “The subpoenas appear to be part of a fishing expedition to see if there is any ammunition useful for a lawsuit that can shake some money out of the hedge funds,” said James J. Angel, an associate professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “If anyone digs deep enough they can find some e-mail that can be spun to look bad in court.” And these days, it is fairly easy to put a black hat on hedge funds, particularly those involved in short-selling, or trying to profit by betting that a given company’s stock price will fall. That puts them at odds with the management, stockholders and employees of the target company. Not that long ago, short-sellers were admired for their in-depth research and contrarian points of view. James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates, for instance, was credited with exposing the lies behind the numbers at Enron well before anyone else did. The reputation of short-sellers, however, changed during the financial crisis, when they were sometimes viewed with suspicion by nervous investors and bankers. Soon they were painted as unpatriotic for profiting from the widespread distress in the nation’s banks and brokerage firms. Of course, short-sellers have been blamed for broad market losses before, like during the stock market panic in 1907 and through the huge market swings during the 1930s, said Robert Sloan, author of “Don’t Blame the Shorts: Why Short Sellers Are Always Blamed for Market Crashes and How History is Repeating Itself.” “You think these six guys brought down this firm? They didn’t. Incompetence brought Lehman down,” said Bill Fleckenstein, who said he was short on the stocks of many financial companies in 2008 and today runs a hedge fund that can hold both short and long positions in stocks. Questions about coordinated selling among hedge funds began to swirl when Bear Stearns ran into trouble in 2008. Later, Mr. Fuld and others inside Lehman became increasingly convinced that a cabal of short-sellers had collaborated with individuals inside Goldman Sachs to bring down his firm. In the spring and summer before Lehman collapsed, top executives of the company sent more than 20 complaints about damaging rumors and aggressive short-sellers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Still, despite the feverish post-mortem analysis on the cause of Lehman’s failure, little evidence has surfaced that short-sellers brought down the company, according to experts who have followed the many inquiries into Lehman’s demise. For instance, the effect of short-sellers on Lehman was discussed in just four pages of the 2,200-page report from the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court to determine what went wrong at Lehman and who was at fault. The report pointed instead to numerous factors that contributed to Lehman’s downfall, including accounting maneuvers that shuffled billions of dollars in assets off of Lehman’s books and demands from rival Wall Street banks that Lehman post collateral on loans it needed badly. This spring, the Lehman estate sued JPMorgan Chase, contending that the bank required Lehman to turn over $8.6 billion in collateral, setting off a cash squeeze at the firm. The estate hopes to recoup billions of dollars in collateral as well as damages. JPMorgan, which has denied the accusations in the Lehman suit, filed documents last month in court arguing that it offered financial support to Lehman in the crisis and that the suit “attempts to erase this history, breathing new life into the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.” Furthermore, lawyers for Och-Ziff, the fund run by Mr. Och that was subpoenaed for its records, argued in court documents that the S.E.C. had received and sifted through all of this same data two years ago. That inquiry “has gone nowhere because there is nothing,” a lawyer for Och-Ziff argued last month before Judge James M. Peck in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. But the S.E.C. examination of short-selling activity in 2008 is still active, according to two people with knowledge of the S.E.C.’s inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The funds could still be asked to produce documents beyond those in the initial request, which centered on activities in June 2008, one of the two people said. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. Even if the Lehman estate finds a smoking gun in the hedge funds’ records and decides to pursue a claim against them, the case could be difficult to prove in court, some defense lawyers said. Proving that the hedge funds had positions that would have allowed them to profit from Lehman’s demise is the relatively easy part, they said. Proving that the hedge funds spread false rumors — and that those rumors caused direct harm to Lehman’s business or its stock price — are much tougher hurdles.</text></article>

But that will not stop banks from making bets that some critics deem risky, even as the rules go into effect over the next few years.That is because many such bets — on the direction of the stock market or the price of coal, for example — are done on behalf of clients. So, the banks say, they will continue to be allowable despite the new restrictions. Indeed, several trades that were made on behalf of clients went bad for the banks even as the new rules were being debated in Washington this year. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for example, each lost more than $100 million on transactions handled for customers in the period from April to July. Blowups like these, only larger, contributed to the financial crisis and forced the federal government to spend billions of dollars to bail out financial institutions. Yet analysts are quick to point out that many of those transactions were handled by the banks, ostensibly to serve clients. “You can use client activity as a cover for basically anything you are doing,” said Janet Tavakoli, who runs her own structured finance consulting firm. “It’s very problematic that losses like this are showing up. It’s a prime example of what the financial reform bill doesn’t address.” That ambiguity could have broad consequences for the future of trading on Wall Street. Given the size of the banks, these recent losses were relatively small. But they highlight how banks will continue to be able to make bets where their own money is at risk — a practice that has yielded huge profits on Wall Street in recent years. Though these trades were made on behalf of clients, they subjected the banks to the kind of risk that Congress sought to curtail when it devised the Volcker Rule, which banned banks from speculating with their own money. That practice is known as proprietary trading. Even before the new rules were passed, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan began dismantling their stand-alone “prop desks” and shifting those traders into client-related businesses. Goldman is considering changes that could turn some of its star proprietary traders into asset managers who rely on capital from outside investors. But for all the talk of shutting down trading desks and reassigning employees to prepare for the Volcker Rule, proprietary-style trading will probably survive, if under a different name. This year, for example, several large insurance companies approached Goldman Sachs, looking to bet that the markets would not stay quiet. Goldman gladly took the other side of the trades, but when the markets turned choppy in May, the firm was caught short and quickly lost $250 million. Goldman, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its losses on that investment. But in a conference call with analysts last month, the bank’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, explained: “We didn’t hedge it fast enough. Things spiked really dramatically, really fast.” Months before that trade, though, Goldman Sachs’s research department named a bet against volatility as one its top 10 trading strategies for 2010. Goldman followed its own advice and put its own money in play by failing to adequately hedge the trade with the client who wanted to bet on volatility, which would have given Goldman a neutral position. In this way, a client-oriented trade can effectively become a proprietary bet. To be sure, in some cases it is necessary for a bank to take a financial risk in order to execute trades quickly and preserve market liquidity. What is more, it can be difficult even for Wall Streeters to draw the line between holding securities as inventory for clients and owning them with a view toward where the market is going. Goldman Sachs, for example, derived about $37.3 billion from trading activities in 2009, according to a Citigroup research report. Perhaps $1.5 billion, or about 4 percent of that revenue, came from dedicated proprietary trading desks. Were other Goldman traders essentially making proprietary bets in the process of serving clients? Likely, analysts and traders say — though it is very hard to tell. “Goldman tends to have businesses that have a customer focus with a proprietary overlay,” said one hedge fund manager and Goldman alumnus who insisted on anonymity. “That overlay can effectively allow them to make directional bets by using the customer flow to get them there.” But Goldman is hardly unique when it comes to walking the fine line between serving clients and taking positions. Late last year, with clients eager to bet that coal prices would rise, JPMorgan took the other side of the trade and amassed contracts on hundreds of millions of dollars on coal — enough to dominate the European market. Initially the trade went JPMorgan’s way and yielded profits, but in April the Morgan traders were caught off guard when European coal futures abruptly started rising. In fact, the wrong-sided bets erased all of the previous gains, and by the middle of June, it had turned into one of the commodities unit’s biggest losses — nearly $130 million. JPMorgan would not disclose the names of the clients and would not comment for this article. But in an internal conference call, Blythe Masters, who oversees the commodities unit, said that the bank made an error in judgment taking a risk on its own behalf. “We made a bit of a rookie error,” she said, according to parts of a recording first published by Bloomberg News. “We got overexposed in the market and made ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze.” Over the years, banks have shifted from being intermediaries who match buyer and seller to middlemen who put their own capital at risk. When a trade request comes in from a customer, traders have the option of handing it off to a second party that wants to take the other side. But if a second investor cannot be found, or if the trading desk has a market outlook that aligns with the bet, the trader can take the opposing position using the bank’s own account. The bank can then either hold on to that risk or hedge the investment so that its position is effectively neutral. In the case of Goldman’s bet on volatility, the investment soured before the bank could sell it or reduce the risk.</text></article>

Plan to Uncover Companies’ Tax Strategies<date>Published: August 24, 2010</date><text>It is the tax world’s version of blind man’s bluff.Every year, thousands of the nation’s largest corporations are required to report to the I.R.S. whether they have reduced their tax bills by using questionable accounting strategies. They have to supply an estimate of how much they might owe if those strategies failed to withstand an audit. They even have to set aside enough money to pay the government if their claims are found to be improper. But the corporations are not obliged to reveal precisely what those uncertain tax positions are — and if the I.R.S. does not manage to ferret them out and challenge them before the three-year statute of limitations expires, the companies can keep the money. Now, the Internal Revenue Service is calling an end to the game. Beginning next year, the agency plans to mandate that corporations also provide a brief description of their uncertain tax positions and their rationale, offering essentially a road map for its auditors. The stakes are enormous. According to one law firm’s analysis of the most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies in the Fortune 500 this year reported more than $200 billion in uncertain tax positions — exceeding the $138 billion paid in corporate taxes last year. At least 40 companies exceeded $1 billion in such reserves: Microsoft’s was $5.4 billion; Bank of America reported $5.2 billion; the American International Group listed $4.8 billion; and Goldman Sachs, $1.9 billion. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, who wrote and is promoting the plan, which has rattled the accounting world, said it was intended to make tax collection more efficient and to urge businesses to comply more closely with the law. While some companies may pay more taxes, Mr. Shulman acknowledged, the new procedures would also help businesses by encouraging Congress and the I.R.S. to clarify ambiguous portions of the nation’s convoluted tax code more quickly. “We are moving away from what I would describe as a contentious relationship, where we spend too much of our time identifying issues, to one where we know the issues from the outset and spend our time engaging on appropriate issues,” Mr. Shulman said. Though transparency may be considered a virtue by the person collecting taxes, it is viewed as a menace to the people whose job is to minimize them. Mr. Shulman’s initiative, which even his critics concede he has the authority to enact, has set off an anguished response from corporations and accountants. They predict that it will make a cumbersome system even more costly and confrontational. David A. Lifson, former president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, cautions that the plan will allow tax authorities to bully taxpayers by bludgeoning them with the very advice they received from their own accountants and tax lawyers. “We barely ever see a revenue agent who doesn’t find an issue and try to extract some kind of payment for its nuisance value,” said Mr. Lifson, a partner at the accounting firm Crowe Horwath. “Now they want you to give the enemy all the guns and walk into a tax audit ducking. And they can pester you into paying more taxes rather than taking the trouble to figure out what amount is fair.” Others warn that the I.R.S. may gain transparency at the expense of investors and the financial markets. Because the additional disclosure may touch on legally privileged information, some tax lawyers fear that corporate executives may withhold information from their auditors and accountants, who assess a company’s finances and actual value. Many tax practitioners also expect the advent of yet another game of cat and mouse, as corporations devise new ways to limit what information is subject to disclosure. While corporations have long complained about the increasingly complicated way the United States taxes businesses, Mr. Shulman’s proposal would be a fundamental shift in a system where voluntary compliance and regulatory complexity have raised creative interpretation of the tax code to a high art. The current corporate rate of 35 percent is higher than that in many other developed countries. But Congress has larded the code with so many deductions and loopholes — including a dollar-for-dollar credit for taxes paid to foreign governments and generous deductions for depreciation and debt financing — that the effective rate paid by most companies is below 22 percent, lower than in most developed countries. That combination of high marginal rates and a plethora of arcane write-offs and shelters has created a structure that encourages, and rewards, companies that use aggressive tax strategies. Companies routinely hire outside lawyers to review their tax claims and judge the likelihood of withstanding a challenge. In 2006, the I.R.S. began requiring companies to report any tax savings from an accounting strategy that had not been judged “more than likely” to withstand an audit.</text></article>
    <article index="18" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/23wyly.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wyly Brothers Break Silence on S.E.C. Case<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>ASPEN, Colo. — The Texas billionaire Sam Wyly has a laugh that blends the cackle of a mad scientist with the giggle of a teenager — a high-pitched titter that makes him sound thoroughly delighted. Until, that is, talk turns to the recent securities fraud suit against him and his brother, Charles.At that point, Mr. Wyly’s laugh makes him sound thoroughly determined — and a little bit manic. “I can tell you one thing,” he says in a twang that is a little bit Louisiana, where he was raised, and a little bit Texas, where he has spent most of his professional life. “They gonna lose. They gonna get nothing.” Then his eyes brighten and he leans back in his chair. “Tee-hee-hee-hee!” In the six years since the Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating the Wylys, the brothers have not spoken publicly about the business enterprises that produced so many unflattering national headlines about them: a maze of 58 trusts and shell corporations based in two well-known tax havens, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The brothers were silent when a Senate subcommittee released a 2006 report accusing them of using hundreds of millions in untaxed dollars to pay for business ventures and to acquire art and jewelry, including a $622,000 ruby and a $937,500 painting of Benjamin Franklin. And until last week, they had referred to their lawyer all questions about the S.E.C.’s suit, which was filed in late July and accuses them of “an elaborate sham” designed to fraudulently sell more than $500 million in offshore assets. But the Wylys have decided that after months of failed settlement talks with the S.E.C., it was time to make the first jab in the fight over public perception. In separate interviews conducted in this resort town where they spend summers, the Dallas-based entrepreneurs and deep-pocketed Republican donors offer a counternarrative to the government’s scathing 78-page complaint. “I think it’s good politics to beat up on big companies and rich people,” said Sam Wyly. Soon, he said, “the election will be over, and this will be forgotten about, or lost, be shut down, be gone, will be nothing.” For the S.E.C., which has been trying to shake off its pre-2008 torpor, the case might be another attempt to demonstrate some vigor and perhaps notch a new eight- or nine-figure fine, as it did with Goldman Sachs. What is certain is that the S.E.C. has spent a vast amount of time pursuing the Wylys, who have become the elusive White Whale to its Captain Ahab. At one of the last settlement talks, the Wylys’ lawyer, William A. Brewer III, said he pointed out that since the investigation began, nearly every lawyer in the room — on both sides — had celebrated the birth of at least one child. “If this goes on much longer,” he said looking around the conference room on the S.E.C.’s fourth floor, “our kids can settle this with a scrimmage.” A spokesman for the S.E.C. says the agency’s investigation has been so lengthy because of its financial complexity and the Wylys’ efforts to cloak their actions offshore. Now semi-retired, the Wylys became a team in the early ’60s and have jointly founded or acquired companies that sold steaks (Bonanza Steakhouse), arts and crafts supplies (Michaels Stores), software (Sterling Software), financial services (Maverick Capital, a hedge fund) and the list goes on. Sam, who is 75, spotted the opportunities — he likes to call himself “the conceptor” — and Charles, who is 76, minded the details and organization. They were known for acting quickly, for sometimes ruthless payroll cuts and for an occasionally stubborn devotion to their plans, even when the plans were doomed. Most notably, the two lost close to $100 million of their own and their shareholders’ money in the ’70s when a company called Datran failed to compete with AT&amp;T in data transmission. But they recovered from that fiasco. In 2000, Sterling Software was sold for $4 billion, and in 2006 Michaels was sold for $6 billion. “It’s a game,” said Sam. “You win some, you lose some. Some are sort of a tie.” Mostly, the Wylys have won. Depression-era babies, they were raised in rural Louisiana by a well-educated mother and father who fell on hard times by failing to hedge a cotton crop. For a time, the family moved into a shack without electricity or plumbing. Today, Sam is on Forbes’s list of billionaires. Charles would not discuss his net worth other than to note, with a smile, “I’m not on that list.” Charles came dressed for an interview like a man headed to a posh rodeo, in shiny leather boots, jeans and neatly pressed cowboy’s shirt. Like his brother, he does not drink, smoke or swear, in large part, he says, because the Wylys are Christian Scientists, a religion that discourages such behavior. “We don’t carry on that way,” he explained, smiling at his own old-fashionedness. “You walk along and trip, you might say ‘dag-gummit.’”</text></article>

Blankfein has drawn an unusual amount of publicity for a leader of a financial firm. He has been on countless front pages and has had a front-row seat at more than a few Senate hearings. So one might wonder when he has time to buy and sell Manhattan real estate.Mr. Blankfein just sold a five-bedroom duplex apartment at 941 Park Avenue, with two maid’s rooms, a 30-foot-long living room and maintenance of $11,327 a month. According to public records, he parted with it for about $12 million. The buyers listed on the deed are Bryce and Elisabeth Markus, a couple in their early 30s. The apartment was listed with Royce Pinkwater at Sotheby’s International Realty. The last listed price was $13.5 million. Ms. Pinkwater declined to comment. Streeteasy.com indicates that Mr. Blankfein first put the co-op on the market in 2009 for $15 million. It went into contract a year later. Early in 2008, Mr. Blankfein bought another duplex, this time a condo at 15 Central Park West. The price? $26 million.</text></article>

Nightmares<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>TOYOTA, Goldman Sachs and BP have shown some of the steepest declines in public perception this year, according to research groups that analyze corporate reputations based on online polls and phone calls. Although some experts say the online polls should be used with caution -- as the respondents may not represent the entire population -- others say they are one of the best ways to keep tabs on fast-moving public sentiment. Toyota has regained close to half the public support it lost after late January, according to daily public perception scores collected by YouGov, a market research firm. (That month, Toyota suspended sales of eight models over fears about uncontrolled acceleration.) Experts attribute Toyota's rebound to its longstanding reputation for quality and doubt about whether the company was to blame for the problems. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, has had a negative public perception score since 2008, when the government helped bail out Wall Street. And after the company was charged with fraud in April -- a case later settled -- it continued to see damage to its reputation. As for BP, public perception has been on the rise since oil stopped spilling into the Gulf of Mexico on July 15. But experts say the company still has a long way to go to regain public support. ''You still see people strongly associating 'Exxon' and 'Valdez.' And that spill was 21 years ago,'' said Charles Fombrun, chairman and co-founder of the Reputation Institute, which helps companies measure how they are perceived. ''It will take BP years and years and years to disassociate itself from 'Deepwater Horizon' or 'gulf crisis.'''

    <article index="22" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D61131F933A1575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Treasury, Geithner Struggles to Escape a Past He Never Had<date>Published: August 20, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- Timothy F. Geithner has been misidentified as a former Wall Street insider from Goldman Sachs so many times since he became the Treasury secretary that he and his advisers had taken to joking about it. Then the joke backfired. Earlier this month, Mr. Geithner had breakfast in Manhattan with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Robert Steel, a deputy mayor and former Treasury official in the Bush administration who had previously worked at Goldman. Facetiously, a Geithner aide said Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner knew each other from the investment bank. Later that day at a public event, the mayor in all seriousness referred to Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner, and added, ''They both worked at Goldman.'' Oops. Just as the Geithner aide's humor fell flat, likewise newspaper corrections, Mr. Geithner's objections to TV news interviewers and his staff's work to spread the boss's résumé have failed to dispel the belief that Mr. Geithner is a former Wall Street banker, or more specifically, a Goldman guy. That perception over the last 20 months has united liberal and conservative critics but reflects a broader antagonism against the government bailouts for which Mr. Geithner has been a frontline architect. With many Americans viewing those policies as benefiting only Wall Street, its rich chief executives and Goldman in particular, the belief that Mr. Geithner came from the firm -- as his predecessor in the Bush administration did -- has easily taken root, further undermining support for those policies. So perhaps it is good for the Geithner image that he is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. White House aides at times have urged Mr. Geithner to take more populist stands and he has balked -- on capping executive pay, for example. But advisers say he is comfortable opposing the tax cuts for reasons that have nothing to do with separating himself from the real Wall Street types. In speeches and interviews, he has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. ''I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,'' Mr. Geithner said in a recent speech. Treasury advisers say the mislabeling of Mr. Geithner began before he took office, with a column in The Washington Post before the presidential inauguration that referred to him as ''a Goldman Sachs alum.'' The columnist, Al Kamen, wrote this the next day: ''The folks at Goldman Sachs called to note an error in yesterday's column. Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy F. Geithner has not worked at the investment bank. Our apologies to Goldman Sachs -- and to Geithner.'' Except for his first three years out of graduate school, when Mr. Geithner was a researcher for the global consulting firm founded by Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, he has worked at governmental agencies and mostly at Treasury. Mr. Geithner, who turned 49 on Wednesday, began as a lower-level civil servant late in the Reagan administration and left 12 years later as under secretary for international finance at the end of the Clinton administration. He went to the International Monetary Fund for two years. In late 2003, he became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, part of the Federal Reserve System -- picked by a board that includes the heads of some of the big banks that the New York Fed regulates. Administration officials and others close to Mr. Geithner say it most likely was the Fed job that gave rise to the sense that he hails from Wall Street, along with the fact that his mentor at the Clinton Treasury, former Secretary Robert E. Rubin, previously headed Goldman Sachs. As the New York Fed president, Mr. Geithner in 2008 became prominent as part of the triumvirate with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs -- that engineered the government's bailout of the financial system. ''He was always being pictured with these guys and it looked like he was part of their retinue,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who monitors Americans' attitudes toward public officials. ''I think at this stage he has established his own credentials,'' Mr. Hart said, but initially ''it probably made a lot more difference'' -- and not in a good way. After some controversies in his first months as secretary, including one over bonuses at American International Group, Mr. Geithner by the spring 2009 was hearing some critics' calls for his head. At this point, he came to epitomize an Obama economic team that many viewed as too close to Wall Street. At a hearing in April 2009 of the panel Congress created to monitor the financial bailout program, Damon A. Silvers, a labor lawyer and panel member, remarked to Mr. Geithner, ''You have been in banking.'' Mr. Geithner interrupted: ''I have never actually been in banking. I have only been in public service.'' His questioner persisted: ''Well, a long time ago. A long time.'' ''Actually, never,'' Mr. Geithner replied. ''Investment banking, I meant.'' ''Never investment banking.'' ''Well, all right,'' the questioner conceded. ''Very well then.'' The confusion grew so widespread that Mr. Geithner himself has privately told others of a dinner where the wife of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, remarked that Mr. Geithner must look forward to returning to Goldman. For an August 2009 Wall Street Journal webcast interview, Mr. Geithner took questions submitted by online readers. Since ''you were/are a part of'' Goldman, one questioner wrote, was it not ''a textbook example of political corruption'' that as Treasury secretary Mr. Geithner now funneled money to the bank to benefit himself ''and your old buddies.'' Mr. Geithner, smiling wanly, said he had never worked for Goldman nor did he own stock. As for Goldman's government money, he said the bank had repaid taxpayers with a return exceeding 20 percent. Nine months later, it was the turn of the CBS newsman Harry Smith. ''People look at you and they say, 'There's a Goldman Sachs guy who's running the Treasury Department,' '' Mr. Smith began. Mr. Geithner cut in, not for the first time or the last, ''Let me just stop you there.'' PHOTOS: Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

During the crisis, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, noticeably stood out among his investment banking brethren because he argued vociferously against an industrywide push to relax mark-to-market accounting. But on matters relating to its image, Goldman has been stubbornly resistant. That may be about to change. When it comes to public perception, Goldman has been to hell and back. Its financial success coming out of the 2008 panic and subsequent market rescue by the government made it a public whipping boy for all who detest Wall Street, and blame the industry for sinking America into an economic crisis. Goldman has been pilloried by politicians, labeled a blood-sucking vampire squid in Rolling Stone magazine and henpecked by regulators. In the markets, wide shifts in sentiment are common, of course. In March last year, investors hated all manner of financial assets, almost indiscriminately. Goldman executives didn’t think that was fair, but they accepted the realities of the market, wrote down the value of assets on the company’s books and took their lumps. In a mark-to-market world, you don’t fight the judgment, you roll with it and adapt. That’s not the way Goldman handled its image, though. With few exceptions, Goldman dismissed the verdicts of its critics. That just created more of them, culminating in an ignominious Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charge and settlement. It all tarnished the firm’s stated goal of unparalleled client focus. But Goldman’s leaders seem at last to be acutely aware of all this. The firm is examining not just its business practices but its business model more broadly. Some executives talk of a spiritual, introspective exercise taking place under the aegis of the Business Standards Committee established in May to “reinforce the firm’s client focus and improve upon the transparency of our activities.” When Goldman examines itself, it does so with vigor, intensity and creativity. Indeed, the last time it undertook such analysis, it decided to go public. This time around could be equally revolutionary. There are already signs of what may come. The firm is, for example, considering a spinoff of its private equity businesses, something it doesn’t strictly have to do to comply with new government rules. Similarly, it may give the bulk of its proprietary traders their freedom. Because so many of them have left of their own volition over the years, starting some of the more successful names of the hedge fund firmament — Eric Mindich of Eton Park and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management come to mind — this wouldn’t be so radical. Such changes would amount to Goldman giving up some of its golden geese. In the public’s eye, the firm could argue it’s doing so for compliance reasons. But the truth is, both businesses have created unseemly opportunities for conflict with core Goldman clients. This is something that many Goldman partners — particularly those on its Business Standards Committee — should be fully considering. Nothing has been more hurtful to the firm than the notion that Goldman put its own interests ahead of those of its clients. It’s a charge that Goldman has weathered for years, but which took on renewed energy amid its recent travails. These aren’t the only innovations, however, that may result from Goldman’s introspection. It has shareholders and a desire to grow, too. As it jettisons businesses, it will naturally look to new opportunities. The firm isn’t saying what those might be, but there are some logical, if potentially unexpected, avenues the firm could take. How about some kinds of retail business? Goldman is unlikely to ever offer free toasters to bring in checking account customers. But one of the lessons learned from the crisis is that being a wholesale bank doesn’t provide immunity from the masses. In fact, it might actually hurt. The likes of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and even Goldman’s primary investment banking rival, Morgan Stanley, have tens of millions of customers who interact with the bank, its employees and its brand every day. Provided they are happy, these are armies that can be subtly, even naturally, deployed in an institution’s defense. It may be a stretch to think Goldman will go this far in its next iteration. And there’s always a risk the firm’s analysis takes it in a very different direction. But Goldman consists of smart, creative — and yes, highly paid — people. Expect surprises.

Blankfein, left, its chairman and chief executive, exercised stock options this week and earned millions of dollars in profits by selling the firm’s shares, Reuters reports. Mr. Blankfein exercised 90,681 stock options at a strike price of $82.875, and obtained a $6.09 million gross profit by selling the resulting shares on Wednesday at prices of $148.97 to $152. More from Reuters: In similar options exercises and sales, Goldman’s president, Gary D. Cohn, exercised 73,653 options and had a $4.95 million profit, The firm’s chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, exercised 67,326 options and had a $4.52 million profit, and the general counsel, Gregory K. Palm, exercised 47,895 options and had a $3.22 million profit. Goldman said the options were granted in November 2000 and scheduled to expire this November. It disclosed the transactions in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman is Wall Street’s most profitable bank. It earned just $453 million in its latest quarter, however, because it paid $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges with the S.E.C. and $600 million to its City of London bankers because of a special British bonus tax.

Among the biggest moves it has made is securing a $5 billion credit facility from 10 big banks to provide an additional cushion as it seeks to go public. As you can see in the list after the jump, the lenders are the usual suspects — and they are each committing a relatively significant chunk of change to be part of the facility. And what has become increasingly clear is how integrated the loan is to G.M.’s stock offering plans. The lead banks on the five-year facility are Citigroup and Bank of America, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Thursday. And the following are the other members of the initial consortium: JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Credit Suisse Barclays Capital Deutsche Bank UBS Royal Bank of Canada Each is committing, at first, $500 million as part of the facility, these people said. As other institutions join the lending group, however, the commitments of the initial 10 are expected to shrink, leaving the overall size of the credit facility at about $5 billion. Among the financial firms that could join the retail syndication round is the Royal Bank of Scotland, according to the people briefed on the matter. The loan, modeled in large part on Ford Motor‘s $18 billion loan from 2006, includes provisions largely in line with the market, these people said. It is relatively free of the most onerous kind of covenants and other requirements from lenders, in part because it is backed by significant amounts of collateral. While the loan itself bears fees that appear relatively high for this kind of facility, those charges help offset the slim fee that banks are charging to help manage G.M.’s offering, one of these people said. (Banks are charging about 0.75 percent for the offering, the people briefed on the matter said.) Perhaps most important for the lenders, all have been promised a role in managing the G.M. offering, these people said. “You have to think of these as part of an all-in-one transaction,” one of these people said of the credit facility and the offering. – Michael J. de la Merced Go to Related Article from The New York Times » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article>

The figures were part of a Goldman response to a request by the panel to disclose information about its derivatives holdings and operations, Reuters reported, citing the Journal story. The inquiry commission was set up by the United States government to examine the causes of the financial and economic crisis. The panel is also examining the role of derivatives in flaring up the financial crisis. Goldman was already scrutinized by the panel for its derivative deals with the bailed out insurer A.I.G. during the financial crisis. A memo sent to the panel Thursday night by Goldman included an analysis of derivatives-based revenue from 2006 through 2009, a person told The Journal. Based on the percentages provided by Goldman, derivatives businesses generated $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company’s $45.17 billion in net revenue for 2009, the newspaper said.

    <article index="30" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/06wall.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wall St. Faces Prospect of Separating Trading Units<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>They are the elite among the elite at Goldman Sachs, highfliers who are the envy of Wall Street.But on Washington’s orders, Goldman is now considering a step that once would have been unthinkable: disbanding the corps of market wizards at the heart of its lucrative trading operation. Under the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations, Goldman must break up its principal strategies group, the wildly successful trading unit that has helped power the bank’s profits. Goldman is considering several options, including moving the traders to another division or shutting the unit altogether, according to people briefed on the matter. Across Wall Street, other financial giants are also embarking on the delicate task of complying with the new rules governing their trading and investments. Morgan Stanley is considering ceding control of its $7 billion hedge fund firm, FrontPoint Partners. At Citigroup, executives have sold hedge fund and private equity businesses and are now discussing paring back proprietary trading, which relies on a bank’s own capital to make bets in the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase has already begun dismantling its stand-alone proprietary trading desk and is modifying the structure of some investments of One Equity Partners, its internal private equity business. While many of these plans are still under discussion and could take years to fully put into effect, the Dodd-Frank rules are slowly starting to change Wall Street, at least on the surface. How deep the changes will go is uncertain. Citigroup and others, for instance, are considering moving proprietary traders to desks that handle trades for clients, although the traders would still be able to make their own bets in the markets. Analysts nonetheless characterized the coming shift as nothing short of a sea change. Some of the banks’ big businesses — trading, hedge funds and private equity, for example — must now be overhauled. “This is the real stuff,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “It shows that if you squeeze Wall Street, like a balloon it will come out somewhere else, and we really are squeezing Wall Street. Their business models are changing.” The changes are aimed at complying with rules intended to reduce risk and speculation. Perhaps nowhere is this shift more profound that at Goldman, whose powerful proprietary trading operation is legendary on Wall Street. In the 1980s, under Robert E. Rubin, its arbitragers profitably navigated an era of heady mergers. Today, the group is walled off from other traders on Goldman’s trading floor. The loss of the division would be a big change for Goldman. The group has long been one of the most sought-after places to work at Goldman, and one of the most highly compensated. One option under consideration would be to fold the group into Goldman’s asset management unit, allowing it to bring in outside investors. This way, Goldman would gradually reduce its direct financial stake in the unit. Another option would be to shut the group or let its traders spin it off into a separate fund or funds and seek capital from outside investors. A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said: “We are reviewing our options and will, of course, comply with the new legislation.” In recent years, the group had as much as $10 billion of Goldman’s capital and focused mostly on stocks. It has also produced several prominent hedge fund managers, among them Edward S. Lampert, Thomas F. Steyer and Daniel S. Och. At Morgan Stanley, executives have decided to spin off FrontPoint to the fund’s management, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. FrontPoint’s principals were negotiating terms, and the deal could still founder. Under a tentative plan, Morgan would reduce its ownership of FrontPoint, which employs about 180 people, to about 25 percent. That stake could then be reduced further over the next five years. Morgan Stanley executives view the restructuring not as a reaction to the financial overhaul but as part of the bank’s recovery since the financial crisis, and as part of the reorganization of its asset management business that was set in motion by the new chief executive, James P. Gorman. The move would represent something of a break with the era of John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chairman, who pushed the bank into areas like hedge funds. But even if Morgan Stanley spins off FrontPoint, it will still own minority stakes in several other hedge funds. Like other banks, Morgan Stanley is also reviewing the future of its large and successful proprietary equities trading unit. Mr. Gorman is considering whether to spin it off into the asset management division. Citigroup has already sold its real estate arm, its SkyBridge Capital hedge fund group and its private equity division. It has also been scaling back its proprietary trading operations. Now, Citigroup executives are discussing plans for broader changes. One alternative is to shift some of its proprietary traders onto other trading desks. Another would be to fold them into the asset management area. While JPMorgan is also scaling back its stand-alone proprietary trading operations, its giant hedge fund firm, Highbridge Capital Partners, will be unscathed by the Dodd-Frank rules. That is because Highbridge, with $21 billion in assets, is considered an asset manager, as it relies primarily on capital from investors, rather than Morgan.</text></article>

The agency’s charges, filed in April after months of inquiry, led its British counterpart to examine whether Goldman should have disclosed the inquiry earlier. At the heart of the case is Fabrice P. Tourre, a Frenchman who in 2007 created Abacus with John A. Paulson, whose hedge fund was betting that the value of the mortgages would decline. Mr. Tourre also helped market the synthetic collateralized debt obligation to investors like ABN Amro and the German bank IKB, both of which lost heavily in the deal. The Dutch bank ABN Amro would later be acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland, while IKB got a government bailout. The S.E.C. charged that Goldman and Mr. Tourre, now on leave from the bank, had not informed those investors about Mr. Paulson’s role in picking a portfolio he saw as likely to default. In September 2009, Mr. Tourre, who had subsequently moved to London to work for Goldman, was served with a Wells notice, which is how the S.E.C. notifies people and corporations that it plans to bring an enforcement action against them. Goldman did not tell the British regulator about the notice, though senior people at the bank’s London office knew of it. As a consequence, “Mr. Tourre remained approved in the U.K. and able to perform a controlled function for several months without further inquiry or challenge from the F.S.A.,” the agency said. It was not until April that Goldman asked to deregister Mr. Tourre from authority’s list of employees allowed to speak to clients. Margaret Cole, managing director for enforcement and financial crime at the regulator, said that Goldman “did not set out to hide anything.” But, referring to the bank’s London unit, she added: “The fact that senior business people at GSI in London knew about Mr Tourre’s Wells notice, but did not consider the obvious regulatory implications for GSI, is very disappointing.” Goldman’s early cooperation with the regulator reduced the fine by about 30 percent, the agency said. The investigation of the Abacus case is continuing in the United States, where Mr. Tourre, the only person named in the S.E.C. complaint, still faces fraud charges because he was not part of the bank’s settlement. He and Goldman have denied deliberately misleading investors about the risks involved with Abacus. The fine of £17.5 million is more than half the £33.3 million that the regulator required JPMorgan Chase to pay in June for not protecting client funds by separating them from the bank’s accounts.</text></article>

    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/01lehman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Lehman Lawyers Seek Records From Hedge Funds and Goldman<date>Published: August 31, 2010</date><text>It is the Wall Street version of the grassy knoll.Nearly two years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, some on Wall Street still wonder whether a handful of the nation’s most powerful hedge funds conspired to push the 158-year-old financial giant into bankruptcy while making big profits for themselves. Now, in search of a smoking gun, a law firm hired by the estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings has demanded trading records, e-mail and other correspondence for all of 2008 from a collection of prominent hedge funds and the venerable Goldman Sachs. The firms named in the inquiry make up a Who’s Who of the hedge fund world, and include SAC Capital Advisors, run by Steven A. Cohen; Greenlight Capital, managed by David Einhorn; the Citadel Investment Group, led by Kenneth C. Griffin; and Och-Ziff Capital Management, whose chief executive is Daniel Och. At a hearing on Wednesday of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the investigative panel appointed by Congress, Lehman’s former chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., is expected to field questions on the role hedge fund investors might have played in Lehman’s failure, according to people involved with the proceedings who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Separately, these people said, commission members are expected to press JPMorgan Chase’s chief risk officer, Barry L. Zubrow, about whether the bank was too aggressive in demanding that Lehman post collateral on loans just before Lehman collapsed. No lawsuits have been filed by the Lehman estate against the hedge funds, nor has anyone from the estate accused them of colluding in an effort to hurt Lehman’s stock price and profit from bets they might have placed that the firm’s shares would decline in value. But as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the Lehman estate issued subpoenas in April seeking documents from Goldman and the hedge funds that make reference to their Lehman-related investments, to see if any documents could provide a basis for a lawsuit to recover potentially billions of dollars in damages from the funds. None of the companies that received subpoenas would comment. Some Wall Street experts said that the law firm retained by the Lehman estate, Kasowitz Benson Torres &amp; Friedman, has produced mixed results pursuing these types of cases, adding that the Lehman estate was looking under several rocks for money that it could return to the firm’s creditors. “The subpoenas appear to be part of a fishing expedition to see if there is any ammunition useful for a lawsuit that can shake some money out of the hedge funds,” said James J. Angel, an associate professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “If anyone digs deep enough they can find some e-mail that can be spun to look bad in court.” And these days, it is fairly easy to put a black hat on hedge funds, particularly those involved in short-selling, or trying to profit by betting that a given company’s stock price will fall. That puts them at odds with the management, stockholders and employees of the target company. Not that long ago, short-sellers were admired for their in-depth research and contrarian points of view. James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates, for instance, was credited with exposing the lies behind the numbers at Enron well before anyone else did. The reputation of short-sellers, however, changed during the financial crisis, when they were sometimes viewed with suspicion by nervous investors and bankers. Soon they were painted as unpatriotic for profiting from the widespread distress in the nation’s banks and brokerage firms. Of course, short-sellers have been blamed for broad market losses before, like during the stock market panic in 1907 and through the huge market swings during the 1930s, said Robert Sloan, author of “Don’t Blame the Shorts: Why Short Sellers Are Always Blamed for Market Crashes and How History is Repeating Itself.” “You think these six guys brought down this firm? They didn’t. Incompetence brought Lehman down,” said Bill Fleckenstein, who said he was short on the stocks of many financial companies in 2008 and today runs a hedge fund that can hold both short and long positions in stocks. Questions about coordinated selling among hedge funds began to swirl when Bear Stearns ran into trouble in 2008. Later, Mr. Fuld and others inside Lehman became increasingly convinced that a cabal of short-sellers had collaborated with individuals inside Goldman Sachs to bring down his firm. In the spring and summer before Lehman collapsed, top executives of the company sent more than 20 complaints about damaging rumors and aggressive short-sellers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Still, despite the feverish post-mortem analysis on the cause of Lehman’s failure, little evidence has surfaced that short-sellers brought down the company, according to experts who have followed the many inquiries into Lehman’s demise. For instance, the effect of short-sellers on Lehman was discussed in just four pages of the 2,200-page report from the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court to determine what went wrong at Lehman and who was at fault. The report pointed instead to numerous factors that contributed to Lehman’s downfall, including accounting maneuvers that shuffled billions of dollars in assets off of Lehman’s books and demands from rival Wall Street banks that Lehman post collateral on loans it needed badly. This spring, the Lehman estate sued JPMorgan Chase, contending that the bank required Lehman to turn over $8.6 billion in collateral, setting off a cash squeeze at the firm. The estate hopes to recoup billions of dollars in collateral as well as damages. JPMorgan, which has denied the accusations in the Lehman suit, filed documents last month in court arguing that it offered financial support to Lehman in the crisis and that the suit “attempts to erase this history, breathing new life into the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.” Furthermore, lawyers for Och-Ziff, the fund run by Mr. Och that was subpoenaed for its records, argued in court documents that the S.E.C. had received and sifted through all of this same data two years ago. That inquiry “has gone nowhere because there is nothing,” a lawyer for Och-Ziff argued last month before Judge James M. Peck in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. But the S.E.C. examination of short-selling activity in 2008 is still active, according to two people with knowledge of the S.E.C.’s inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The funds could still be asked to produce documents beyond those in the initial request, which centered on activities in June 2008, one of the two people said. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008. Even if the Lehman estate finds a smoking gun in the hedge funds’ records and decides to pursue a claim against them, the case could be difficult to prove in court, some defense lawyers said. Proving that the hedge funds had positions that would have allowed them to profit from Lehman’s demise is the relatively easy part, they said. Proving that the hedge funds spread false rumors — and that those rumors caused direct harm to Lehman’s business or its stock price — are much tougher hurdles.</text></article>

    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/business/economy/26trade.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Despite Reform, Banks Have Room for Risky Deals<date>Published: August 25, 2010</date><text>When Congress passed a new financial regulation bill last month, it sought to prevent federally insured banks from making speculative bets using their own money. But that will not stop banks from making bets that some critics deem risky, even as the rules go into effect over the next few years.That is because many such bets — on the direction of the stock market or the price of coal, for example — are done on behalf of clients. So, the banks say, they will continue to be allowable despite the new restrictions. Indeed, several trades that were made on behalf of clients went bad for the banks even as the new rules were being debated in Washington this year. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for example, each lost more than $100 million on transactions handled for customers in the period from April to July. Blowups like these, only larger, contributed to the financial crisis and forced the federal government to spend billions of dollars to bail out financial institutions. Yet analysts are quick to point out that many of those transactions were handled by the banks, ostensibly to serve clients. “You can use client activity as a cover for basically anything you are doing,” said Janet Tavakoli, who runs her own structured finance consulting firm. “It’s very problematic that losses like this are showing up. It’s a prime example of what the financial reform bill doesn’t address.” That ambiguity could have broad consequences for the future of trading on Wall Street. Given the size of the banks, these recent losses were relatively small. But they highlight how banks will continue to be able to make bets where their own money is at risk — a practice that has yielded huge profits on Wall Street in recent years. Though these trades were made on behalf of clients, they subjected the banks to the kind of risk that Congress sought to curtail when it devised the Volcker Rule, which banned banks from speculating with their own money. That practice is known as proprietary trading. Even before the new rules were passed, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan began dismantling their stand-alone “prop desks” and shifting those traders into client-related businesses. Goldman is considering changes that could turn some of its star proprietary traders into asset managers who rely on capital from outside investors. But for all the talk of shutting down trading desks and reassigning employees to prepare for the Volcker Rule, proprietary-style trading will probably survive, if under a different name. This year, for example, several large insurance companies approached Goldman Sachs, looking to bet that the markets would not stay quiet. Goldman gladly took the other side of the trades, but when the markets turned choppy in May, the firm was caught short and quickly lost $250 million. Goldman, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its losses on that investment. But in a conference call with analysts last month, the bank’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, explained: “We didn’t hedge it fast enough. Things spiked really dramatically, really fast.” Months before that trade, though, Goldman Sachs’s research department named a bet against volatility as one its top 10 trading strategies for 2010. Goldman followed its own advice and put its own money in play by failing to adequately hedge the trade with the client who wanted to bet on volatility, which would have given Goldman a neutral position. In this way, a client-oriented trade can effectively become a proprietary bet. To be sure, in some cases it is necessary for a bank to take a financial risk in order to execute trades quickly and preserve market liquidity. What is more, it can be difficult even for Wall Streeters to draw the line between holding securities as inventory for clients and owning them with a view toward where the market is going. Goldman Sachs, for example, derived about $37.3 billion from trading activities in 2009, according to a Citigroup research report. Perhaps $1.5 billion, or about 4 percent of that revenue, came from dedicated proprietary trading desks. Were other Goldman traders essentially making proprietary bets in the process of serving clients? Likely, analysts and traders say — though it is very hard to tell. “Goldman tends to have businesses that have a customer focus with a proprietary overlay,” said one hedge fund manager and Goldman alumnus who insisted on anonymity. “That overlay can effectively allow them to make directional bets by using the customer flow to get them there.” But Goldman is hardly unique when it comes to walking the fine line between serving clients and taking positions. Late last year, with clients eager to bet that coal prices would rise, JPMorgan took the other side of the trade and amassed contracts on hundreds of millions of dollars on coal — enough to dominate the European market. Initially the trade went JPMorgan’s way and yielded profits, but in April the Morgan traders were caught off guard when European coal futures abruptly started rising. In fact, the wrong-sided bets erased all of the previous gains, and by the middle of June, it had turned into one of the commodities unit’s biggest losses — nearly $130 million. JPMorgan would not disclose the names of the clients and would not comment for this article. But in an internal conference call, Blythe Masters, who oversees the commodities unit, said that the bank made an error in judgment taking a risk on its own behalf. “We made a bit of a rookie error,” she said, according to parts of a recording first published by Bloomberg News. “We got overexposed in the market and made ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze.” Over the years, banks have shifted from being intermediaries who match buyer and seller to middlemen who put their own capital at risk. When a trade request comes in from a customer, traders have the option of handing it off to a second party that wants to take the other side. But if a second investor cannot be found, or if the trading desk has a market outlook that aligns with the bet, the trader can take the opposing position using the bank’s own account. The bank can then either hold on to that risk or hedge the investment so that its position is effectively neutral. In the case of Goldman’s bet on volatility, the investment soured before the bank could sell it or reduce the risk.</text></article>

Plan to Uncover Companies’ Tax Strategies<date>Published: August 24, 2010</date><text>It is the tax world’s version of blind man’s bluff.Every year, thousands of the nation’s largest corporations are required to report to the I.R.S. whether they have reduced their tax bills by using questionable accounting strategies. They have to supply an estimate of how much they might owe if those strategies failed to withstand an audit. They even have to set aside enough money to pay the government if their claims are found to be improper. But the corporations are not obliged to reveal precisely what those uncertain tax positions are — and if the I.R.S. does not manage to ferret them out and challenge them before the three-year statute of limitations expires, the companies can keep the money. Now, the Internal Revenue Service is calling an end to the game. Beginning next year, the agency plans to mandate that corporations also provide a brief description of their uncertain tax positions and their rationale, offering essentially a road map for its auditors. The stakes are enormous. According to one law firm’s analysis of the most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the companies in the Fortune 500 this year reported more than $200 billion in uncertain tax positions — exceeding the $138 billion paid in corporate taxes last year. At least 40 companies exceeded $1 billion in such reserves: Microsoft’s was $5.4 billion; Bank of America reported $5.2 billion; the American International Group listed $4.8 billion; and Goldman Sachs, $1.9 billion. Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, who wrote and is promoting the plan, which has rattled the accounting world, said it was intended to make tax collection more efficient and to urge businesses to comply more closely with the law. While some companies may pay more taxes, Mr. Shulman acknowledged, the new procedures would also help businesses by encouraging Congress and the I.R.S. to clarify ambiguous portions of the nation’s convoluted tax code more quickly. “We are moving away from what I would describe as a contentious relationship, where we spend too much of our time identifying issues, to one where we know the issues from the outset and spend our time engaging on appropriate issues,” Mr. Shulman said. Though transparency may be considered a virtue by the person collecting taxes, it is viewed as a menace to the people whose job is to minimize them. Mr. Shulman’s initiative, which even his critics concede he has the authority to enact, has set off an anguished response from corporations and accountants. They predict that it will make a cumbersome system even more costly and confrontational. David A. Lifson, former president of the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, cautions that the plan will allow tax authorities to bully taxpayers by bludgeoning them with the very advice they received from their own accountants and tax lawyers. “We barely ever see a revenue agent who doesn’t find an issue and try to extract some kind of payment for its nuisance value,” said Mr. Lifson, a partner at the accounting firm Crowe Horwath. “Now they want you to give the enemy all the guns and walk into a tax audit ducking. And they can pester you into paying more taxes rather than taking the trouble to figure out what amount is fair.” Others warn that the I.R.S. may gain transparency at the expense of investors and the financial markets. Because the additional disclosure may touch on legally privileged information, some tax lawyers fear that corporate executives may withhold information from their auditors and accountants, who assess a company’s finances and actual value. Many tax practitioners also expect the advent of yet another game of cat and mouse, as corporations devise new ways to limit what information is subject to disclosure. While corporations have long complained about the increasingly complicated way the United States taxes businesses, Mr. Shulman’s proposal would be a fundamental shift in a system where voluntary compliance and regulatory complexity have raised creative interpretation of the tax code to a high art. The current corporate rate of 35 percent is higher than that in many other developed countries. But Congress has larded the code with so many deductions and loopholes — including a dollar-for-dollar credit for taxes paid to foreign governments and generous deductions for depreciation and debt financing — that the effective rate paid by most companies is below 22 percent, lower than in most developed countries. That combination of high marginal rates and a plethora of arcane write-offs and shelters has created a structure that encourages, and rewards, companies that use aggressive tax strategies. Companies routinely hire outside lawyers to review their tax claims and judge the likelihood of withstanding a challenge. In 2006, the I.R.S. began requiring companies to report any tax savings from an accounting strategy that had not been judged “more than likely” to withstand an audit.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/business/23wyly.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wyly Brothers Break Silence on S.E.C. Case<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>ASPEN, Colo. — The Texas billionaire Sam Wyly has a laugh that blends the cackle of a mad scientist with the giggle of a teenager — a high-pitched titter that makes him sound thoroughly delighted. Until, that is, talk turns to the recent securities fraud suit against him and his brother, Charles.At that point, Mr. Wyly’s laugh makes him sound thoroughly determined — and a little bit manic. “I can tell you one thing,” he says in a twang that is a little bit Louisiana, where he was raised, and a little bit Texas, where he has spent most of his professional life. “They gonna lose. They gonna get nothing.” Then his eyes brighten and he leans back in his chair. “Tee-hee-hee-hee!” In the six years since the Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating the Wylys, the brothers have not spoken publicly about the business enterprises that produced so many unflattering national headlines about them: a maze of 58 trusts and shell corporations based in two well-known tax havens, the Isle of Man and the Cayman Islands. The brothers were silent when a Senate subcommittee released a 2006 report accusing them of using hundreds of millions in untaxed dollars to pay for business ventures and to acquire art and jewelry, including a $622,000 ruby and a $937,500 painting of Benjamin Franklin. And until last week, they had referred to their lawyer all questions about the S.E.C.’s suit, which was filed in late July and accuses them of “an elaborate sham” designed to fraudulently sell more than $500 million in offshore assets. But the Wylys have decided that after months of failed settlement talks with the S.E.C., it was time to make the first jab in the fight over public perception. In separate interviews conducted in this resort town where they spend summers, the Dallas-based entrepreneurs and deep-pocketed Republican donors offer a counternarrative to the government’s scathing 78-page complaint. “I think it’s good politics to beat up on big companies and rich people,” said Sam Wyly. Soon, he said, “the election will be over, and this will be forgotten about, or lost, be shut down, be gone, will be nothing.” For the S.E.C., which has been trying to shake off its pre-2008 torpor, the case might be another attempt to demonstrate some vigor and perhaps notch a new eight- or nine-figure fine, as it did with Goldman Sachs. What is certain is that the S.E.C. has spent a vast amount of time pursuing the Wylys, who have become the elusive White Whale to its Captain Ahab. At one of the last settlement talks, the Wylys’ lawyer, William A. Brewer III, said he pointed out that since the investigation began, nearly every lawyer in the room — on both sides — had celebrated the birth of at least one child. “If this goes on much longer,” he said looking around the conference room on the S.E.C.’s fourth floor, “our kids can settle this with a scrimmage.” A spokesman for the S.E.C. says the agency’s investigation has been so lengthy because of its financial complexity and the Wylys’ efforts to cloak their actions offshore. Now semi-retired, the Wylys became a team in the early ’60s and have jointly founded or acquired companies that sold steaks (Bonanza Steakhouse), arts and crafts supplies (Michaels Stores), software (Sterling Software), financial services (Maverick Capital, a hedge fund) and the list goes on. Sam, who is 75, spotted the opportunities — he likes to call himself “the conceptor” — and Charles, who is 76, minded the details and organization. They were known for acting quickly, for sometimes ruthless payroll cuts and for an occasionally stubborn devotion to their plans, even when the plans were doomed. Most notably, the two lost close to $100 million of their own and their shareholders’ money in the ’70s when a company called Datran failed to compete with AT&amp;T in data transmission. But they recovered from that fiasco. In 2000, Sterling Software was sold for $4 billion, and in 2006 Michaels was sold for $6 billion. “It’s a game,” said Sam. “You win some, you lose some. Some are sort of a tie.” Mostly, the Wylys have won. Depression-era babies, they were raised in rural Louisiana by a well-educated mother and father who fell on hard times by failing to hedge a cotton crop. For a time, the family moved into a shack without electricity or plumbing. Today, Sam is on Forbes’s list of billionaires. Charles would not discuss his net worth other than to note, with a smile, “I’m not on that list.” Charles came dressed for an interview like a man headed to a posh rodeo, in shiny leather boots, jeans and neatly pressed cowboy’s shirt. Like his brother, he does not drink, smoke or swear, in large part, he says, because the Wylys are Christian Scientists, a religion that discourages such behavior. “We don’t carry on that way,” he explained, smiling at his own old-fashionedness. “You walk along and trip, you might say ‘dag-gummit.’”</text></article>

Blankfein has drawn an unusual amount of publicity for a leader of a financial firm. He has been on countless front pages and has had a front-row seat at more than a few Senate hearings. So one might wonder when he has time to buy and sell Manhattan real estate.Mr. Blankfein just sold a five-bedroom duplex apartment at 941 Park Avenue, with two maid’s rooms, a 30-foot-long living room and maintenance of $11,327 a month. According to public records, he parted with it for about $12 million. The buyers listed on the deed are Bryce and Elisabeth Markus, a couple in their early 30s. The apartment was listed with Royce Pinkwater at Sotheby’s International Realty. The last listed price was $13.5 million. Ms. Pinkwater declined to comment. Streeteasy.com indicates that Mr. Blankfein first put the co-op on the market in 2009 for $15 million. It went into contract a year later. Early in 2008, Mr. Blankfein bought another duplex, this time a condo at 15 Central Park West. The price? $26 million.</text></article>

Nightmares<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>TOYOTA, Goldman Sachs and BP have shown some of the steepest declines in public perception this year, according to research groups that analyze corporate reputations based on online polls and phone calls. Although some experts say the online polls should be used with caution -- as the respondents may not represent the entire population -- others say they are one of the best ways to keep tabs on fast-moving public sentiment. Toyota has regained close to half the public support it lost after late January, according to daily public perception scores collected by YouGov, a market research firm. (That month, Toyota suspended sales of eight models over fears about uncontrolled acceleration.) Experts attribute Toyota's rebound to its longstanding reputation for quality and doubt about whether the company was to blame for the problems. Goldman Sachs, on the other hand, has had a negative public perception score since 2008, when the government helped bail out Wall Street. And after the company was charged with fraud in April -- a case later settled -- it continued to see damage to its reputation. As for BP, public perception has been on the rise since oil stopped spilling into the Gulf of Mexico on July 15. But experts say the company still has a long way to go to regain public support. ''You still see people strongly associating 'Exxon' and 'Valdez.' And that spill was 21 years ago,'' said Charles Fombrun, chairman and co-founder of the Reputation Institute, which helps companies measure how they are perceived. ''It will take BP years and years and years to disassociate itself from 'Deepwater Horizon' or 'gulf crisis.'''

    <article index="12" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D61131F933A1575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Treasury, Geithner Struggles to Escape a Past He Never Had<date>Published: August 20, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- Timothy F. Geithner has been misidentified as a former Wall Street insider from Goldman Sachs so many times since he became the Treasury secretary that he and his advisers had taken to joking about it. Then the joke backfired. Earlier this month, Mr. Geithner had breakfast in Manhattan with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Robert Steel, a deputy mayor and former Treasury official in the Bush administration who had previously worked at Goldman. Facetiously, a Geithner aide said Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner knew each other from the investment bank. Later that day at a public event, the mayor in all seriousness referred to Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner, and added, ''They both worked at Goldman.'' Oops. Just as the Geithner aide's humor fell flat, likewise newspaper corrections, Mr. Geithner's objections to TV news interviewers and his staff's work to spread the boss's résumé have failed to dispel the belief that Mr. Geithner is a former Wall Street banker, or more specifically, a Goldman guy. That perception over the last 20 months has united liberal and conservative critics but reflects a broader antagonism against the government bailouts for which Mr. Geithner has been a frontline architect. With many Americans viewing those policies as benefiting only Wall Street, its rich chief executives and Goldman in particular, the belief that Mr. Geithner came from the firm -- as his predecessor in the Bush administration did -- has easily taken root, further undermining support for those policies. So perhaps it is good for the Geithner image that he is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. White House aides at times have urged Mr. Geithner to take more populist stands and he has balked -- on capping executive pay, for example. But advisers say he is comfortable opposing the tax cuts for reasons that have nothing to do with separating himself from the real Wall Street types. In speeches and interviews, he has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. ''I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,'' Mr. Geithner said in a recent speech. Treasury advisers say the mislabeling of Mr. Geithner began before he took office, with a column in The Washington Post before the presidential inauguration that referred to him as ''a Goldman Sachs alum.'' The columnist, Al Kamen, wrote this the next day: ''The folks at Goldman Sachs called to note an error in yesterday's column. Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy F. Geithner has not worked at the investment bank. Our apologies to Goldman Sachs -- and to Geithner.'' Except for his first three years out of graduate school, when Mr. Geithner was a researcher for the global consulting firm founded by Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, he has worked at governmental agencies and mostly at Treasury. Mr. Geithner, who turned 49 on Wednesday, began as a lower-level civil servant late in the Reagan administration and left 12 years later as under secretary for international finance at the end of the Clinton administration. He went to the International Monetary Fund for two years. In late 2003, he became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, part of the Federal Reserve System -- picked by a board that includes the heads of some of the big banks that the New York Fed regulates. Administration officials and others close to Mr. Geithner say it most likely was the Fed job that gave rise to the sense that he hails from Wall Street, along with the fact that his mentor at the Clinton Treasury, former Secretary Robert E. Rubin, previously headed Goldman Sachs. As the New York Fed president, Mr. Geithner in 2008 became prominent as part of the triumvirate with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs -- that engineered the government's bailout of the financial system. ''He was always being pictured with these guys and it looked like he was part of their retinue,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who monitors Americans' attitudes toward public officials. ''I think at this stage he has established his own credentials,'' Mr. Hart said, but initially ''it probably made a lot more difference'' -- and not in a good way. After some controversies in his first months as secretary, including one over bonuses at American International Group, Mr. Geithner by the spring 2009 was hearing some critics' calls for his head. At this point, he came to epitomize an Obama economic team that many viewed as too close to Wall Street. At a hearing in April 2009 of the panel Congress created to monitor the financial bailout program, Damon A. Silvers, a labor lawyer and panel member, remarked to Mr. Geithner, ''You have been in banking.'' Mr. Geithner interrupted: ''I have never actually been in banking. I have only been in public service.'' His questioner persisted: ''Well, a long time ago. A long time.'' ''Actually, never,'' Mr. Geithner replied. ''Investment banking, I meant.'' ''Never investment banking.'' ''Well, all right,'' the questioner conceded. ''Very well then.'' The confusion grew so widespread that Mr. Geithner himself has privately told others of a dinner where the wife of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, remarked that Mr. Geithner must look forward to returning to Goldman. For an August 2009 Wall Street Journal webcast interview, Mr. Geithner took questions submitted by online readers. Since ''you were/are a part of'' Goldman, one questioner wrote, was it not ''a textbook example of political corruption'' that as Treasury secretary Mr. Geithner now funneled money to the bank to benefit himself ''and your old buddies.'' Mr. Geithner, smiling wanly, said he had never worked for Goldman nor did he own stock. As for Goldman's government money, he said the bank had repaid taxpayers with a return exceeding 20 percent. Nine months later, it was the turn of the CBS newsman Harry Smith. ''People look at you and they say, 'There's a Goldman Sachs guy who's running the Treasury Department,' '' Mr. Smith began. Mr. Geithner cut in, not for the first time or the last, ''Let me just stop you there.'' PHOTOS: Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

    <article index="14" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/business/17views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">A Self-Analysis Likely to Alter Goldman<date>Published: August 16, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs has been at the vanguard of Wall Street firms in accepting the realities of the marketplace. During the crisis, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, noticeably stood out among his investment banking brethren because he argued vociferously against an industrywide push to relax mark-to-market accounting. But on matters relating to its image, Goldman has been stubbornly resistant. That may be about to change. When it comes to public perception, Goldman has been to hell and back. Its financial success coming out of the 2008 panic and subsequent market rescue by the government made it a public whipping boy for all who detest Wall Street, and blame the industry for sinking America into an economic crisis. Goldman has been pilloried by politicians, labeled a blood-sucking vampire squid in Rolling Stone magazine and henpecked by regulators. In the markets, wide shifts in sentiment are common, of course. In March last year, investors hated all manner of financial assets, almost indiscriminately. Goldman executives didn’t think that was fair, but they accepted the realities of the market, wrote down the value of assets on the company’s books and took their lumps. In a mark-to-market world, you don’t fight the judgment, you roll with it and adapt. That’s not the way Goldman handled its image, though. With few exceptions, Goldman dismissed the verdicts of its critics. That just created more of them, culminating in an ignominious Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charge and settlement. It all tarnished the firm’s stated goal of unparalleled client focus. But Goldman’s leaders seem at last to be acutely aware of all this. The firm is examining not just its business practices but its business model more broadly. Some executives talk of a spiritual, introspective exercise taking place under the aegis of the Business Standards Committee established in May to “reinforce the firm’s client focus and improve upon the transparency of our activities.” When Goldman examines itself, it does so with vigor, intensity and creativity. Indeed, the last time it undertook such analysis, it decided to go public. This time around could be equally revolutionary. There are already signs of what may come. The firm is, for example, considering a spinoff of its private equity businesses, something it doesn’t strictly have to do to comply with new government rules. Similarly, it may give the bulk of its proprietary traders their freedom. Because so many of them have left of their own volition over the years, starting some of the more successful names of the hedge fund firmament — Eric Mindich of Eton Park and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management come to mind — this wouldn’t be so radical. Such changes would amount to Goldman giving up some of its golden geese. In the public’s eye, the firm could argue it’s doing so for compliance reasons. But the truth is, both businesses have created unseemly opportunities for conflict with core Goldman clients. This is something that many Goldman partners — particularly those on its Business Standards Committee — should be fully considering. Nothing has been more hurtful to the firm than the notion that Goldman put its own interests ahead of those of its clients. It’s a charge that Goldman has weathered for years, but which took on renewed energy amid its recent travails. These aren’t the only innovations, however, that may result from Goldman’s introspection. It has shareholders and a desire to grow, too. As it jettisons businesses, it will naturally look to new opportunities. The firm isn’t saying what those might be, but there are some logical, if potentially unexpected, avenues the firm could take. How about some kinds of retail business? Goldman is unlikely to ever offer free toasters to bring in checking account customers. But one of the lessons learned from the crisis is that being a wholesale bank doesn’t provide immunity from the masses. In fact, it might actually hurt. The likes of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and even Goldman’s primary investment banking rival, Morgan Stanley, have tens of millions of customers who interact with the bank, its employees and its brand every day. Provided they are happy, these are armies that can be subtly, even naturally, deployed in an institution’s defense. It may be a stretch to think Goldman will go this far in its next iteration. And there’s always a risk the firm’s analysis takes it in a very different direction. But Goldman consists of smart, creative — and yes, highly paid — people. Expect surprises.

Blankfein, left, its chairman and chief executive, exercised stock options this week and earned millions of dollars in profits by selling the firm’s shares, Reuters reports. Mr. Blankfein exercised 90,681 stock options at a strike price of $82.875, and obtained a $6.09 million gross profit by selling the resulting shares on Wednesday at prices of $148.97 to $152. More from Reuters: In similar options exercises and sales, Goldman’s president, Gary D. Cohn, exercised 73,653 options and had a $4.95 million profit, The firm’s chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, exercised 67,326 options and had a $4.52 million profit, and the general counsel, Gregory K. Palm, exercised 47,895 options and had a $3.22 million profit. Goldman said the options were granted in November 2000 and scheduled to expire this November. It disclosed the transactions in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman is Wall Street’s most profitable bank. It earned just $453 million in its latest quarter, however, because it paid $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges with the S.E.C. and $600 million to its City of London bankers because of a special British bonus tax.

    <article index="16" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/the-banks-behind-g-m-s-5-billion-loan/?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">The Banks Behind G.M.'s $5 Billion Loan<date>August 12, 2010, 5:53 pm</date><text>As General Motors continues in its march toward an initial public offering, perhaps filing for one as soon as Friday, the automaker has taken big steps to bolster its financial health as much as possible. Among the biggest moves it has made is securing a $5 billion credit facility from 10 big banks to provide an additional cushion as it seeks to go public. As you can see in the list after the jump, the lenders are the usual suspects — and they are each committing a relatively significant chunk of change to be part of the facility. And what has become increasingly clear is how integrated the loan is to G.M.’s stock offering plans. The lead banks on the five-year facility are Citigroup and Bank of America, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Thursday. And the following are the other members of the initial consortium: JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Credit Suisse Barclays Capital Deutsche Bank UBS Royal Bank of Canada Each is committing, at first, $500 million as part of the facility, these people said. As other institutions join the lending group, however, the commitments of the initial 10 are expected to shrink, leaving the overall size of the credit facility at about $5 billion. Among the financial firms that could join the retail syndication round is the Royal Bank of Scotland, according to the people briefed on the matter. The loan, modeled in large part on Ford Motor‘s $18 billion loan from 2006, includes provisions largely in line with the market, these people said. It is relatively free of the most onerous kind of covenants and other requirements from lenders, in part because it is backed by significant amounts of collateral. While the loan itself bears fees that appear relatively high for this kind of facility, those charges help offset the slim fee that banks are charging to help manage G.M.’s offering, one of these people said. (Banks are charging about 0.75 percent for the offering, the people briefed on the matter said.) Perhaps most important for the lenders, all have been promised a role in managing the G.M. offering, these people said. “You have to think of these as part of an all-in-one transaction,” one of these people said of the credit facility and the offering. – Michael J. de la Merced Go to Related Article from The New York Times » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article>

The figures were part of a Goldman response to a request by the panel to disclose information about its derivatives holdings and operations, Reuters reported, citing the Journal story. The inquiry commission was set up by the United States government to examine the causes of the financial and economic crisis. The panel is also examining the role of derivatives in flaring up the financial crisis. Goldman was already scrutinized by the panel for its derivative deals with the bailed out insurer A.I.G. during the financial crisis. A memo sent to the panel Thursday night by Goldman included an analysis of derivatives-based revenue from 2006 through 2009, a person told The Journal. Based on the percentages provided by Goldman, derivatives businesses generated $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company’s $45.17 billion in net revenue for 2009, the newspaper said.

The repurchase is at a 0.5 percent discount to the closing price on Friday. An Allied World spokeswoman said the repurchase was not related to new financial regulatory reform legislation. Speculation continues to grow as to which Wall Street banks will be looking to get out of proprietary trading or the private equity business to comply with new legislation, which restricts banks from proprietary trading and sets new limits on the size of private equity or hedge fund investments.

    <article index="20" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/06wall.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wall St. Faces Prospect of Separating Trading Units<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>They are the elite among the elite at Goldman Sachs, highfliers who are the envy of Wall Street.But on Washington’s orders, Goldman is now considering a step that once would have been unthinkable: disbanding the corps of market wizards at the heart of its lucrative trading operation. Under the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations, Goldman must break up its principal strategies group, the wildly successful trading unit that has helped power the bank’s profits. Goldman is considering several options, including moving the traders to another division or shutting the unit altogether, according to people briefed on the matter. Across Wall Street, other financial giants are also embarking on the delicate task of complying with the new rules governing their trading and investments. Morgan Stanley is considering ceding control of its $7 billion hedge fund firm, FrontPoint Partners. At Citigroup, executives have sold hedge fund and private equity businesses and are now discussing paring back proprietary trading, which relies on a bank’s own capital to make bets in the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase has already begun dismantling its stand-alone proprietary trading desk and is modifying the structure of some investments of One Equity Partners, its internal private equity business. While many of these plans are still under discussion and could take years to fully put into effect, the Dodd-Frank rules are slowly starting to change Wall Street, at least on the surface. How deep the changes will go is uncertain. Citigroup and others, for instance, are considering moving proprietary traders to desks that handle trades for clients, although the traders would still be able to make their own bets in the markets. Analysts nonetheless characterized the coming shift as nothing short of a sea change. Some of the banks’ big businesses — trading, hedge funds and private equity, for example — must now be overhauled. “This is the real stuff,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “It shows that if you squeeze Wall Street, like a balloon it will come out somewhere else, and we really are squeezing Wall Street. Their business models are changing.” The changes are aimed at complying with rules intended to reduce risk and speculation. Perhaps nowhere is this shift more profound that at Goldman, whose powerful proprietary trading operation is legendary on Wall Street. In the 1980s, under Robert E. Rubin, its arbitragers profitably navigated an era of heady mergers. Today, the group is walled off from other traders on Goldman’s trading floor. The loss of the division would be a big change for Goldman. The group has long been one of the most sought-after places to work at Goldman, and one of the most highly compensated. One option under consideration would be to fold the group into Goldman’s asset management unit, allowing it to bring in outside investors. This way, Goldman would gradually reduce its direct financial stake in the unit. Another option would be to shut the group or let its traders spin it off into a separate fund or funds and seek capital from outside investors. A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said: “We are reviewing our options and will, of course, comply with the new legislation.” In recent years, the group had as much as $10 billion of Goldman’s capital and focused mostly on stocks. It has also produced several prominent hedge fund managers, among them Edward S. Lampert, Thomas F. Steyer and Daniel S. Och. At Morgan Stanley, executives have decided to spin off FrontPoint to the fund’s management, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. FrontPoint’s principals were negotiating terms, and the deal could still founder. Under a tentative plan, Morgan would reduce its ownership of FrontPoint, which employs about 180 people, to about 25 percent. That stake could then be reduced further over the next five years. Morgan Stanley executives view the restructuring not as a reaction to the financial overhaul but as part of the bank’s recovery since the financial crisis, and as part of the reorganization of its asset management business that was set in motion by the new chief executive, James P. Gorman. The move would represent something of a break with the era of John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chairman, who pushed the bank into areas like hedge funds. But even if Morgan Stanley spins off FrontPoint, it will still own minority stakes in several other hedge funds. Like other banks, Morgan Stanley is also reviewing the future of its large and successful proprietary equities trading unit. Mr. Gorman is considering whether to spin it off into the asset management division. Citigroup has already sold its real estate arm, its SkyBridge Capital hedge fund group and its private equity division. It has also been scaling back its proprietary trading operations. Now, Citigroup executives are discussing plans for broader changes. One alternative is to shift some of its proprietary traders onto other trading desks. Another would be to fold them into the asset management area. While JPMorgan is also scaling back its stand-alone proprietary trading operations, its giant hedge fund firm, Highbridge Capital Partners, will be unscathed by the Dodd-Frank rules. That is because Highbridge, with $21 billion in assets, is considered an asset manager, as it relies primarily on capital from investors, rather than Morgan.</text></article>
    <article index="21" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/06views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Even With the Volcker Rule, Banks Can Still Make Big Bets<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs may be rushing to reorganize or spin off its private equity and proprietary trading units to comply with the newly enacted Volcker Rule. But the directive, intended to prevent banks from making big bets for their own accounts, remains vague enough for Goldman and its Wall Street rivals to put plenty of money at risk.Investment banks can still use their own money to facilitate trades for customers. The rules envisage limiting that to the expected near-term demand for client trades. But identifying where that ends and proprietary trading begins is a blurry line. The Volcker Rule’s definition of proprietary trading is also open to interpretation. At first blush, it looks watertight: the rule forbids banks from buying and selling financial products for their “trading account.” That, in turn, is defined as an account meant to profit in the “near term” from “short term” movements in prices. That clearly knocks on the head trades that last for, say, a few days. But it’s unclear how far “near term” and “short term” are supposed to stretch. For instance, would the new rule have prohibited Morgan Stanley from placing a huge short bet on the mortgage market that lost the firm some $10 billion? That trade, though modified at times, was in place for almost a year. And banks can still trade government and agency securities for their own account. These are hardly risk free. Some of the problems at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management stemmed from trying to arbitrage prices between Treasuries of different terms. And the Carlyle Capital Corporation, a heavily leveraged debt fund, crashed in 2008 when prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds dropped. Longer-term investments aren’t ruled out either, so long as they’re not part of a private equity unit. Goldman’s special situations group, for example, sits in the firm’s fixed income division and invests in securities over a year or more. This group’s precrisis annual profit may have been as much as $1 billion. Prop trading and private equity may be dead. But long live principal investing. Big Oil, Big Gas United States oil companies are becoming less liquid — but not in a financial sense. With natural gas so plentiful, Big Oil is fast becoming Big Gas. Shareholders may be underestimating the impact of the shift on future returns while an unexpected advantage is tipping to the oiliest majors. America’s energy titans are finding it increasingly difficult to ramp up oil output. Exxon Mobil is on track to pump 5 percent less this year than in 2005, according to Barclays Capital forecasts. Instead, the company has turned to gas for growth. A big project in Papua New Guinea and its acquisition of XTO Energy are accelerating the shift. Gas, which accounted for 38 percent of Exxon’s output in 2005, could account for up to 48 percent next year. Exxon isn’t alone. Two rivals, ConocoPhillips and, to a lesser extent, Chevron, are also expanding in gas. The trend looks ominous. Oil offers fatter margins and, in the United States, sells for almost three times more than gas for the same quantity of energy. Drillers are partly victims of their own success, with new techniques raising gas reserves and driving down prices. Meanwhile, lawmakers have ditched proposals for a carbon tax, which had promised to spur demand for cleaner-burning gas. The gas market is not so grim everywhere. Multidecade contracts for liquefied natural gas in Asia are typically hooked to oil and so can fetch double the price in the United States. That helps Chevron in particular. But even overseas markets look less safe over the long run. The same drilling innovations that led to plunging prices in North America are being plied in Germany, Poland and China. Meanwhile other monster gas projects in Qatar and Australia are expected by the International Energy Agency to increase output by 50 percent by 2013. With even Chevron drifting toward gas, Occidental Petroleum, which still gets 75 percent of its output from black gold, might wind up the last of the majors deserving the moniker Big Oil. Its stock is costlier than its three biggest rivals, trading at 14 times expected 2010 earnings compared with an average of about 9.5 times. But its significantly lower exposure to gas justifies the premium, and then some. ANTONY CURRIE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN</text></article>
    <article index="22" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/economy/06deflation.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">2 Top Economists Differ Sharply on Deflation<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>When the latest unemployment figures are announced on Friday, all of Wall Street will be watching. But for Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley and Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, the results will be more than just another marker in an avalanche of data.Instead, the numbers will be a clue as to which of the two economists is right about where the American economy is headed. Their sharp disagreement over that question adds yet another twist to the fierce rivalry between the firms, Wall Street’s version of the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Mr. Hatzius is arguably Wall Street’s most prominent pessimist. He warns that the American economy is poised for a sharp slowdown in the second half of the year. That would send unemployment higher again and raise the risk of deflation. A rare occurrence, deflation can have a devastating effect on a struggling economy as prices and wages fall. He says he may be compelled to downgrade his already anemic growth predictions for the economy. For months, Mr. Berner has been sticking to a more optimistic forecast, despite growing evidence in favor of Mr. Hatzius’s view. Last week, Mr. Berner was caught by surprise when the federal government reported that the economy grew at a 2..4 percent pace in the second quarter, well below the 3.8 percent he had forecast a month before. Mr. Hatzius came closer to hitting the mark, having projected a 2 percent growth rate. Mr. Berner and his deputy, David Greenlaw, still expect a pickup in the second half of the year, which would help gradually bring down unemployment. They play down the danger posed by deflation, the malady that deepened the Great Depression and contributed to Japan’s lost decade of the 1990s. “I’d say at this point the data and the sentiment in the marketplace have certainly gone more Jan’s way than mine,” Mr. Berner said. Some people, he added, “think I’m out of my mind. But I have a conviction in my beliefs that’s based on my analysis.” Mr. Hatzius, a 41-year-old native of Germany who was 3 when Mr. Berner started out as an economist, is more restrained. He can afford to be, having snagged the top spot in a recent ranking of Wall Street economists as well as an award from Arizona State University honoring his “uncanny economic forecasting that anticipated the global financial crisis.” On Wall Street, both men were among a very small group that accurately predicted the recent recession. Mr. Berner’s long résumé includes stints at the Federal Reserve in Washington and Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. “I’ve seen plenty of ups and downs,” said Mr. Berner, 64, sitting in a corner office overlooking the Manhattan skyline at Morgan Stanley’s Midtown headquarters. Showing not even a hint of doubt, Mr. Hatzius said, “The prospect of substantial inflation seems very remote, but the prospect for deflation is far from remote. A double dip is certainly possible but not likely.” Mr. Berner does not expect substantial inflation, but he is predicting inflation will run 1 to 2 percent annually rather than the near-zero level Mr. Hatzius sees by the end of next year. “There is still a one in 10 chance of deflation,” Mr. Berner calculates. “But we already have been much more aggressive and proactive in dealing with the problem than Japan was,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s decision to quickly cut rates and aggressively buy government securities. The split between the chief economists, whose work helps inform trading strategies recommended to investors by their firms, echoes a broader and sometimes fiercer debate among academic economists and commentators about the threat posed by deflation and what the government’s response should be. According to the deflationistas, as they are nicknamed, a new round of stimulus spending by Washington is urgently required to stave off a Depression-like cycle of falling prices and wages that is difficult to reverse once it is set in motion. Inflationistas, by contrast, worry more about the effect that additional government borrowing could have on the recovery. With the budget deficit expected to hover around $1 trillion a year for the next decade, they say, interest rates could eventually surge, making borrowing — and goods — more expensive. A double dip, they say, is highly unlikely. Mr. Hatzius’s gloomy outlook is owed centrally to Americans’ slowdown in spending. Recent data suggest that consumers are using any extra cash they have to pay down debt or put into savings. That places a strain on an American economy that has become hugely dependent on consumer spending. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that Americans saved 6.4 percent of their after-tax income in June, in contrast to the years before the recession, when savings rates stood at 1 to 2 percent. Last month, the Federal Reserve reported that consumer debt dropped by 4.5 percent in May, a $9 billion decline. It was the 20th consecutive month that figure has dropped. In 2007, consumer debt jumped by 5.7 percent, or nearly $40 billion.</text></article>

Proceeds Hit Pre-2008 Crisis Levels<date>August 3, 2010, 4:36 am</date><text>Proceeds from initial public offerings in July soared on a global basis, hitting their highest level since before the 2008 financial meltdown, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $30.5 billion that new issues raised globally in July was the most since November 2007 and exceeded the amount raised by follow-on issues for the month. Follow-ons, which were led by Mizuho Financial Group and INPEX in Japan, raised a total of $30.4 billion in July. That was a turnaround from 2009, when I.P.O.s for the most part were dwarfed by secondary offerings, many of them by banks under pressure from regulators to raise capital. Year-to-date fees from the new issues, buoyed by Agricultural Bank of China‘s $20.8 billion I.P.O. and Britain’s $1.04 billion Vallar Plc I.P.O., reached $3.7 billion. That is more than five times the $706 million of fees banks reaped in the first seven months of 2009. Including I.P.O.s, follow-ons and convertibles, the No. 1 ranked underwriting bank, year to date on a global basis, is JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan has underwritten 185 deals worth $35.32 billion. Goldman Sachs is in the No. 2 position with 128 deals worth $31.03 billion, and Morgan Stanley is No. 3, with 143 deals worth $25.49 billion.

    <article index="25" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/nyregion/03goldman.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Goldman Sachs Pledges Not to Spend on Political Ads<date>Published: August 2, 2010</date><text>Facing pressure from critics of Wall Street to limit its role in elections, Goldman Sachs has pledged not to spend any of its vast corporate reserves on political advertising. The move was an unexpected sign of restraint after a major Supreme Court ruling this year that gave corporations the power to devote unlimited amounts to electing or defeating candidates for federal office. The investment bank quietly revised its statement on political activities on its Web site last week, adding a sentence addressing the powers that were granted under the Supreme Court decision in January, known as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. “Goldman Sachs also does not spend corporate funds directly on electioneering communications,” the firm said in its statement. Those communications are generally interpreted to mean advertisements on radio and television broadcasts in the run-up to an election. The decision came after weeks of talks with the New York City public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who has lobbied for greater transparency from companies seeking to sway the outcome of elections. The investment bank, not usually known as an ally of grass-roots causes, declined to comment on its position. Mr. de Blasio hailed Goldman’s pledge as game-changing and, given the firm’s stature, he said, it could prompt other companies to follow suit. “This could be one of those moments that determines whether we are going to have a political system literally dominated by corporate money, or some ability by the people at the grass roots to determine the outcome of elections,” Mr. de Blasio said. Critics of the Citizens United decision, including President Obama, said it would allow corporations to drown out competing messages and corrupt the political system. But the Supreme Court said in its 5-to-4 decision that it was upholding a central tenet of the Constitution: the right to free speech by anyone, including corporations. Federal law prohibits corporations from donating directly to candidates for federal office, but, the court decision said, they may pay for advertisements supporting or opposing them. Goldman employees may make personal contributions, but the firm requires that they first submit them for approval. Campaign finance experts said companies like Goldman still had other means of exerting political influence. Goldman, like many large companies, operates political action committees at the state and national levels that could raise money for the purpose of influencing political races. In addition, companies are free to spend money to advocate positions on specific issues, like health care, gun control or financial regulation. “This doesn’t mean they are disarmed,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University who specializes in campaign finance. Lawrence A. Mandelker, a New York lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law, said Goldman’s position might persuade other businesses to abstain from political spending. “It’s a precedent that can be cited to other companies, suggesting that they too decide not to exercise the right to spend unlimited amounts,” he said. Some corporations have already started taking advantage of the new powers afforded by the Supreme Court. Target, for instance, recently donated $150,000 to a group that is running ads in support of a Republican candidate for governor in Minnesota who opposes gay marriage. Employees and gay rights advocates have criticized the donation. Indeed, entering the political sphere comes with certain costs, including the potential for backlash from investors, the public and politicians. Mr. Briffault said that some companies might be put off by those dangers, and that others might not be willing to tolerate the intense back-room lobbying for their support. “It’s not clear that corporations are going to be zooming to take advantage of this,” he said.</text></article>

Until now, the bank hadn’t revealed how it had calculated the worth of those increasingly toxic assets, but in a report (PDF) sent to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last week, Goldman laid out its methodology. “We made collateral calls to A.I.G., and other counterparties, consistent with the further deterioration in the market,” the bank said. “We made those collateral calls based on prices that reflected the deteriorating conditions in the market for the underlying collateral in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (R.M.B.S.) and C.D.O.’s and specific transactions in comparable securities — transactions in which we acted as a market-maker and transactions we observed between other market participants.” Go to Goldman Sachs Report (PDF) » Go to Related Article from The Wall Street Journal (Subscription Required) » Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>

Neighbors<date>August 2, 2010, 7:05 am</date><text>Local New York City residents are up in arms over a plan by Goldman Sachs to replace a discount shoe shop, a pizza joint, a recently closed New York Sports Club gym and a budget inn outside its new $2.1 billion headquarters with a string of designer restaurants and a luxury hotel. The Telegraph reported that the bank is being accused by denizens of “breaking promises.” The bank’s neighbors have demanded basic services like a supermarket and a hardware store but instead are poised to see a trio of restaurants run by the impresario, Danny Meyer, as well as a new ballroom and a conference center which will be attached to the upgraded hotel. The bank also plans 5,000 square feet of retail units, the newspaper said. “It appears that Goldman has no intention of replacing this retail tenant with one more attractive to the community,” long-term area resident Tom Goodkind told the newspaper of the closing of the shoe outlet at a meeting of the area’s community board last week. “This loss of space seems to break the promise made to our community,” when Goldman originally got permission to purchase the building four years ago, Mr. Goodkind added. Goldman’s global head of corporate services and real estate told the newspaper that both the gym and the shoe shop had asked to break their own leases following falling sales and also defended the bank’s plans, saying that not every retailer brought in would be expensive.

    <article index="29" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02ferry.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Ferries Carrying Goldman Workers Called Too Loud<date>Published: August 1, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs, which has certainly borne its share of public anger about the financial crisis, is now drawing heat for another reason: noisy ferryboats. The boats, which have been running almost constantly across the Hudson River every weekday since Goldman moved into its new headquarters in Battery Park City, have generated frequent complaints from residents of the neighborhood. Goldman does not own the offending boats, but it is paying a ferry company to keep them running 16 hours a day between a floating terminal at the edge of Battery Park City and a dock near Goldman’s waterfront office tower in Jersey City. The dispute about the boat noise has droned on for so long that Battery Park City officials have hinted that they might want to give the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the $50 million floating terminal, the heave-ho, saying the agency is violating the terms of its lease with the high noise levels. In a letter he drafted to the Port Authority recently, James E. Cavanaugh, the president of the Battery Park City Authority, demanded an end to the “unreasonable noise” emanating from what he called the Goldman service. Now, having fielded complaints for eight months, Goldman is preparing to solve the problem with its wallet. The firm is having two ferryboats built to its specifications at an estimated cost of more than $5 million, said people with knowledge of the firm’s plan who insisted on anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss it. The two boats, which would be more luxurious than the typical commuter ferry on the Hudson, could arrive before the end of the year, these people said. Goldman intends to substitute the new vessels for the NY Waterway boats that have been plying the short route between its office towers on opposite sides of the river. Mr. Cavanaugh said he hoped that the matter could be resolved without legal action, but he did not rule out the possibility of litigation. The draft letter he sent to the Port Authority said the “Goldman service” had “unreasonably inconvenienced and annoyed” some residents of Battery Park City. It alluded to noise readings taken by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection in April and May that exceeded the city’s legal limit of 10 decibels above the ambient noise level. Mr. Cavanaugh blamed the problem on the use of older, noisier boats since Goldman increased the frequency of ferry runs — to every seven or eight minutes — when its employees began moving into the new tower late last year. The ferries run from 6 a.m. to almost 10 p.m. The terminal is operated for the Port Authority by a ferry company known as BillyBey, which is named after its owner, William Wachtel, a politically active Manhattan lawyer. Goldman Sachs, in turn, pays BillyBey to run boats between the terminal and the Jersey City dock, known as Paulus Hook. The boats, which fly the NY Waterway commuter-service flag, are open to the public for a fare of $5.50 each way. But community leaders in Battery Park City say that, outside of the morning and evening rush hours, the ferries serve primarily as shuttles for Goldman employees. Indeed, they run far more frequently than other commuter ferries do: NY Waterway boats run as infrequently as twice an hour in the middle of the day between the train terminal in Hoboken, N.J., and Battery Park City. Privately, some Goldman officials bridle at the complaints, suggesting that the neighbors were piling criticism on a firm that has already been faulted in the public eye. They declined to discuss the firm’s plan to obtain its own boats. But, in a statement, the firm said it had contracted with BillyBey “to provide the most efficient form of transportation for our employees to shuttle between our two buildings, while also providing a public service.” It added that the firm was “aware there have been some issues raised” and was working with the ferry operator to explore all options to address them. A spokesman for BillyBey said the company had switched to newer, quieter boats after the complaints first arose late last year and had not received any complaints since then. But Mr. Cavanaugh said he had seen the older boats — nicknamed the Italian class because they were named after famous Italian-Americans like Frank Sinatra and Yogi Berra — operating on the route recently and had heard about other sightings by residents of Battery Park City. “I saw those Italian-class boats well after Waterways promised not to use them,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. “That equipment continues to show up.” For his part, Mr. Wachtel, the ferry operator, said, “We’re confident in short order all concerns will, in fact, be allayed.”</text></article>

Charges Billionaire Dallas Brothers With Securities Fraud<date>Published: July 29, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Samuel and Charles Wyly, the billionaire brothers from Dallas who are large donors to philanthropies and to conservative causes, were charged Thursday with conducting an extensive securities fraud that the Securities and Exchange Commission said reaped $550 million in undisclosed gains.The brothers, who founded Sterling Software, a business software and services company that they sold for $4 billion in stock to the software company CA in 2000, were also charged with insider trading violations from which they profited by more than $31 million, the S.E.C. said The civil charges, coming just two weeks after the S.E.C. reached a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs, are part of a concerted effort by the commission to focus more sharply on prominent enforcement cases. The agency came under fierce attack after the financial crisis of 2007-8 for failing to uncover fraudulent activity in the mortgage securities markets and for missing chances to halt the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff. The Wyly brothers are in many ways a study in contrasts, paradigms of self-made billionaires who for years have fought investigations into suspected tax dodges by the offshore trusts that the S.E.C. claims they controlled. Samuel E. Wyly, 75, and Charles J. Wyly Jr., 76, who through a lawyer called the charges “without merit,” have given millions of dollars to Republican candidates and organizations, but Sam Wyly this year was also named one of the world’s 10 “greenest” billionaires by Forbes magazine. The S.E.C. case, which was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, centers on charges of securities fraud and insider trading related to the shares of companies founded by the Wyly bothers or where they served as directors or executives. They include the retail craft chain Michaels Stores, Sterling Software, Sterling Commerce and Scottish Annuity and Life Holdings. The ill-gotten gains, according to the S.E.C., were used to buy tens of millions of dollars of art, collectibles and jewelry; $100 million of real estate, including two ranches in Aspen, Colo., and a 100-acre horse farm near Dallas; and for charitable contributions, including $10 million to the business school at Samuel Wyly’s alma mater, the University of Michigan. The charges are the result of a six-year investigation that began in 2004 when Bank of America reported to the S.E.C. that it had terminated numerous accounts held in the name of companies based in the Isle of Man because it could not determine who actually owned the companies. The S.E.C. found that those companies, and similar entities registered in the Cayman Islands, were registered as trusts over which the Wylys said they had no formal control. But in fact, the S.E.C. charged, the brothers directed nearly all the investment activity in the trusts, selling hundreds of millions of dollars in shares without following S.E.C. disclosure rules governing stock ownership and trading by company insiders. Through a lawyer, the Wylys said that they believed the charges were “a misapplication of the law” and that they had conducted all of their activities on the basis of accounting and legal advice that they received. “They have never been given any reason to believe the financial transactions in question were anything other than legal and fully appropriate,” said William A. Brewer III, a partner at the Dallas law firm of Bickel &amp; Brewer who is lead counsel for the Wylys. The brothers “expect to be fully vindicated,” he said. Also charged in connection with the case were a lawyer for the Wylys, Michael C. French of Dallas, and a stockbroker, Louis J. Schaufele III, also of Dallas. Lawyers representing Mr. French and Mr. Schaufele did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. The S.E.C. can bring only civil actions, but the brothers have previously been reported to be under criminal investigation for actions related to their investment activities. Lorin L. Reisner, the deputy director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, declined to comment on whether the commission had referred its current findings to the Justice Department or other law enforcement agencies. The S.E.C. claimed that a scheme of undisclosed investments and securities sales took place over 13 years and involved three-quarters of a billion dollars in stock. As longtime executives and directors of public companies, the S.E.C. said that the Wylys knew or should have known their obligations as the owners of more than 5 percent of the stock of several companies. S.E.C. regulations require that holders of more than 5 percent of a company’s stock disclose that fact, and that company directors and executives report any and all sales or purchases of shares. Though they claimed to own only small stakes in their companies, the S.E.C. charged that they owned from 16 percent to 36 percent of the four companies named in the complaint. Many investors track stock sales by company insiders because they believe that can provide clues to a company’s prospects; if well-informed company insiders are selling, investors might conclude that a company’s financial position is weakening. “By concealing that the entities making the sales were under the control of the Wylys, other investors paid inflated prices for the shares they sold,” Mr. Reisner said. If the S.E.C. is successful in proving all of its allegations, it could result in one of the biggest judgments ever in a securities fraud case. The commission is seeking disgorgement of the $550 million in gains and prejudgment interest and financial penalties. Unlike some billionaires who maintain a cloak of privacy around their private lives, the Wylys maintain their own Web site extolling their business history, philanthropic activities and other interests. They have been, at times, similarly open about their political affiliations. In 2000, Sam Wyly was a principal contributor to Republicans for Clean Air, a group that bought ads extolling then-Gov. George W. Bush’s environmental record and criticizing the record of Senator John McCain. Four years later, the Wyly brothers were substantial contributors to the Swift Boat campaign that raised questions about the war record of Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who was running for president against President Bush.</text></article>

    <article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E3D61131F933A1575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">At Treasury, Geithner Struggles to Escape a Past He Never Had<date>Published: August 20, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON -- Timothy F. Geithner has been misidentified as a former Wall Street insider from Goldman Sachs so many times since he became the Treasury secretary that he and his advisers had taken to joking about it. Then the joke backfired. Earlier this month, Mr. Geithner had breakfast in Manhattan with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Robert Steel, a deputy mayor and former Treasury official in the Bush administration who had previously worked at Goldman. Facetiously, a Geithner aide said Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner knew each other from the investment bank. Later that day at a public event, the mayor in all seriousness referred to Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner, and added, ''They both worked at Goldman.'' Oops. Just as the Geithner aide's humor fell flat, likewise newspaper corrections, Mr. Geithner's objections to TV news interviewers and his staff's work to spread the boss's résumé have failed to dispel the belief that Mr. Geithner is a former Wall Street banker, or more specifically, a Goldman guy. That perception over the last 20 months has united liberal and conservative critics but reflects a broader antagonism against the government bailouts for which Mr. Geithner has been a frontline architect. With many Americans viewing those policies as benefiting only Wall Street, its rich chief executives and Goldman in particular, the belief that Mr. Geithner came from the firm -- as his predecessor in the Bush administration did -- has easily taken root, further undermining support for those policies. So perhaps it is good for the Geithner image that he is President Obama's point man in opposing the extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy after their Dec. 31 expiration. White House aides at times have urged Mr. Geithner to take more populist stands and he has balked -- on capping executive pay, for example. But advisers say he is comfortable opposing the tax cuts for reasons that have nothing to do with separating himself from the real Wall Street types. In speeches and interviews, he has cited the projected $700 billion, 10-year cost of the tax cuts, and nonpartisan analyses that they do not stimulate the economy because the wealthy tend to save the additional money rather than spend it. ''I believe there is no credible argument to be made that the purpose of government is to borrow from future generations of Americans to finance an extension of tax cuts for the top 2 percent,'' Mr. Geithner said in a recent speech. Treasury advisers say the mislabeling of Mr. Geithner began before he took office, with a column in The Washington Post before the presidential inauguration that referred to him as ''a Goldman Sachs alum.'' The columnist, Al Kamen, wrote this the next day: ''The folks at Goldman Sachs called to note an error in yesterday's column. Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy F. Geithner has not worked at the investment bank. Our apologies to Goldman Sachs -- and to Geithner.'' Except for his first three years out of graduate school, when Mr. Geithner was a researcher for the global consulting firm founded by Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state, he has worked at governmental agencies and mostly at Treasury. Mr. Geithner, who turned 49 on Wednesday, began as a lower-level civil servant late in the Reagan administration and left 12 years later as under secretary for international finance at the end of the Clinton administration. He went to the International Monetary Fund for two years. In late 2003, he became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, part of the Federal Reserve System -- picked by a board that includes the heads of some of the big banks that the New York Fed regulates. Administration officials and others close to Mr. Geithner say it most likely was the Fed job that gave rise to the sense that he hails from Wall Street, along with the fact that his mentor at the Clinton Treasury, former Secretary Robert E. Rubin, previously headed Goldman Sachs. As the New York Fed president, Mr. Geithner in 2008 became prominent as part of the triumvirate with the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. -- a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs -- that engineered the government's bailout of the financial system. ''He was always being pictured with these guys and it looked like he was part of their retinue,'' said Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster who monitors Americans' attitudes toward public officials. ''I think at this stage he has established his own credentials,'' Mr. Hart said, but initially ''it probably made a lot more difference'' -- and not in a good way. After some controversies in his first months as secretary, including one over bonuses at American International Group, Mr. Geithner by the spring 2009 was hearing some critics' calls for his head. At this point, he came to epitomize an Obama economic team that many viewed as too close to Wall Street. At a hearing in April 2009 of the panel Congress created to monitor the financial bailout program, Damon A. Silvers, a labor lawyer and panel member, remarked to Mr. Geithner, ''You have been in banking.'' Mr. Geithner interrupted: ''I have never actually been in banking. I have only been in public service.'' His questioner persisted: ''Well, a long time ago. A long time.'' ''Actually, never,'' Mr. Geithner replied. ''Investment banking, I meant.'' ''Never investment banking.'' ''Well, all right,'' the questioner conceded. ''Very well then.'' The confusion grew so widespread that Mr. Geithner himself has privately told others of a dinner where the wife of the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, remarked that Mr. Geithner must look forward to returning to Goldman. For an August 2009 Wall Street Journal webcast interview, Mr. Geithner took questions submitted by online readers. Since ''you were/are a part of'' Goldman, one questioner wrote, was it not ''a textbook example of political corruption'' that as Treasury secretary Mr. Geithner now funneled money to the bank to benefit himself ''and your old buddies.'' Mr. Geithner, smiling wanly, said he had never worked for Goldman nor did he own stock. As for Goldman's government money, he said the bank had repaid taxpayers with a return exceeding 20 percent. Nine months later, it was the turn of the CBS newsman Harry Smith. ''People look at you and they say, 'There's a Goldman Sachs guy who's running the Treasury Department,' '' Mr. Smith began. Mr. Geithner cut in, not for the first time or the last, ''Let me just stop you there.'' PHOTOS: Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/business/17views.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">A Self-Analysis Likely to Alter Goldman<date>Published: August 16, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs has been at the vanguard of Wall Street firms in accepting the realities of the marketplace. During the crisis, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, noticeably stood out among his investment banking brethren because he argued vociferously against an industrywide push to relax mark-to-market accounting. But on matters relating to its image, Goldman has been stubbornly resistant. That may be about to change. When it comes to public perception, Goldman has been to hell and back. Its financial success coming out of the 2008 panic and subsequent market rescue by the government made it a public whipping boy for all who detest Wall Street, and blame the industry for sinking America into an economic crisis. Goldman has been pilloried by politicians, labeled a blood-sucking vampire squid in Rolling Stone magazine and henpecked by regulators. In the markets, wide shifts in sentiment are common, of course. In March last year, investors hated all manner of financial assets, almost indiscriminately. Goldman executives didn’t think that was fair, but they accepted the realities of the market, wrote down the value of assets on the company’s books and took their lumps. In a mark-to-market world, you don’t fight the judgment, you roll with it and adapt. That’s not the way Goldman handled its image, though. With few exceptions, Goldman dismissed the verdicts of its critics. That just created more of them, culminating in an ignominious Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charge and settlement. It all tarnished the firm’s stated goal of unparalleled client focus. But Goldman’s leaders seem at last to be acutely aware of all this. The firm is examining not just its business practices but its business model more broadly. Some executives talk of a spiritual, introspective exercise taking place under the aegis of the Business Standards Committee established in May to “reinforce the firm’s client focus and improve upon the transparency of our activities.” When Goldman examines itself, it does so with vigor, intensity and creativity. Indeed, the last time it undertook such analysis, it decided to go public. This time around could be equally revolutionary. There are already signs of what may come. The firm is, for example, considering a spinoff of its private equity businesses, something it doesn’t strictly have to do to comply with new government rules. Similarly, it may give the bulk of its proprietary traders their freedom. Because so many of them have left of their own volition over the years, starting some of the more successful names of the hedge fund firmament — Eric Mindich of Eton Park and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management come to mind — this wouldn’t be so radical. Such changes would amount to Goldman giving up some of its golden geese. In the public’s eye, the firm could argue it’s doing so for compliance reasons. But the truth is, both businesses have created unseemly opportunities for conflict with core Goldman clients. This is something that many Goldman partners — particularly those on its Business Standards Committee — should be fully considering. Nothing has been more hurtful to the firm than the notion that Goldman put its own interests ahead of those of its clients. It’s a charge that Goldman has weathered for years, but which took on renewed energy amid its recent travails. These aren’t the only innovations, however, that may result from Goldman’s introspection. It has shareholders and a desire to grow, too. As it jettisons businesses, it will naturally look to new opportunities. The firm isn’t saying what those might be, but there are some logical, if potentially unexpected, avenues the firm could take. How about some kinds of retail business? Goldman is unlikely to ever offer free toasters to bring in checking account customers. But one of the lessons learned from the crisis is that being a wholesale bank doesn’t provide immunity from the masses. In fact, it might actually hurt. The likes of Citigroup, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and even Goldman’s primary investment banking rival, Morgan Stanley, have tens of millions of customers who interact with the bank, its employees and its brand every day. Provided they are happy, these are armies that can be subtly, even naturally, deployed in an institution’s defense. It may be a stretch to think Goldman will go this far in its next iteration. And there’s always a risk the firm’s analysis takes it in a very different direction. But Goldman consists of smart, creative — and yes, highly paid — people. Expect surprises.

Blankfein, left, its chairman and chief executive, exercised stock options this week and earned millions of dollars in profits by selling the firm’s shares, Reuters reports. Mr. Blankfein exercised 90,681 stock options at a strike price of $82.875, and obtained a $6.09 million gross profit by selling the resulting shares on Wednesday at prices of $148.97 to $152. More from Reuters: In similar options exercises and sales, Goldman’s president, Gary D. Cohn, exercised 73,653 options and had a $4.95 million profit, The firm’s chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, exercised 67,326 options and had a $4.52 million profit, and the general counsel, Gregory K. Palm, exercised 47,895 options and had a $3.22 million profit. Goldman said the options were granted in November 2000 and scheduled to expire this November. It disclosed the transactions in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Goldman is Wall Street’s most profitable bank. It earned just $453 million in its latest quarter, however, because it paid $550 million to settle civil securities fraud charges with the S.E.C. and $600 million to its City of London bankers because of a special British bonus tax.

Among the biggest moves it has made is securing a $5 billion credit facility from 10 big banks to provide an additional cushion as it seeks to go public. As you can see in the list after the jump, the lenders are the usual suspects — and they are each committing a relatively significant chunk of change to be part of the facility. And what has become increasingly clear is how integrated the loan is to G.M.’s stock offering plans. The lead banks on the five-year facility are Citigroup and Bank of America, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Thursday. And the following are the other members of the initial consortium: JPMorgan Chase Morgan Stanley Goldman Sachs Credit Suisse Barclays Capital Deutsche Bank UBS Royal Bank of Canada Each is committing, at first, $500 million as part of the facility, these people said. As other institutions join the lending group, however, the commitments of the initial 10 are expected to shrink, leaving the overall size of the credit facility at about $5 billion. Among the financial firms that could join the retail syndication round is the Royal Bank of Scotland, according to the people briefed on the matter. The loan, modeled in large part on Ford Motor‘s $18 billion loan from 2006, includes provisions largely in line with the market, these people said. It is relatively free of the most onerous kind of covenants and other requirements from lenders, in part because it is backed by significant amounts of collateral. While the loan itself bears fees that appear relatively high for this kind of facility, those charges help offset the slim fee that banks are charging to help manage G.M.’s offering, one of these people said. (Banks are charging about 0.75 percent for the offering, the people briefed on the matter said.) Perhaps most important for the lenders, all have been promised a role in managing the G.M. offering, these people said. “You have to think of these as part of an all-in-one transaction,” one of these people said of the credit facility and the offering. – Michael J. de la Merced Go to Related Article from The New York Times » Go to Previous Item from DealBook »</text></article>

The figures were part of a Goldman response to a request by the panel to disclose information about its derivatives holdings and operations, Reuters reported, citing the Journal story. The inquiry commission was set up by the United States government to examine the causes of the financial and economic crisis. The panel is also examining the role of derivatives in flaring up the financial crisis. Goldman was already scrutinized by the panel for its derivative deals with the bailed out insurer A.I.G. during the financial crisis. A memo sent to the panel Thursday night by Goldman included an analysis of derivatives-based revenue from 2006 through 2009, a person told The Journal. Based on the percentages provided by Goldman, derivatives businesses generated $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company’s $45.17 billion in net revenue for 2009, the newspaper said.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/06wall.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wall St. Faces Prospect of Separating Trading Units<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>They are the elite among the elite at Goldman Sachs, highfliers who are the envy of Wall Street.But on Washington’s orders, Goldman is now considering a step that once would have been unthinkable: disbanding the corps of market wizards at the heart of its lucrative trading operation. Under the new Dodd-Frank financial regulations, Goldman must break up its principal strategies group, the wildly successful trading unit that has helped power the bank’s profits. Goldman is considering several options, including moving the traders to another division or shutting the unit altogether, according to people briefed on the matter. Across Wall Street, other financial giants are also embarking on the delicate task of complying with the new rules governing their trading and investments. Morgan Stanley is considering ceding control of its $7 billion hedge fund firm, FrontPoint Partners. At Citigroup, executives have sold hedge fund and private equity businesses and are now discussing paring back proprietary trading, which relies on a bank’s own capital to make bets in the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase has already begun dismantling its stand-alone proprietary trading desk and is modifying the structure of some investments of One Equity Partners, its internal private equity business. While many of these plans are still under discussion and could take years to fully put into effect, the Dodd-Frank rules are slowly starting to change Wall Street, at least on the surface. How deep the changes will go is uncertain. Citigroup and others, for instance, are considering moving proprietary traders to desks that handle trades for clients, although the traders would still be able to make their own bets in the markets. Analysts nonetheless characterized the coming shift as nothing short of a sea change. Some of the banks’ big businesses — trading, hedge funds and private equity, for example — must now be overhauled. “This is the real stuff,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “It shows that if you squeeze Wall Street, like a balloon it will come out somewhere else, and we really are squeezing Wall Street. Their business models are changing.” The changes are aimed at complying with rules intended to reduce risk and speculation. Perhaps nowhere is this shift more profound that at Goldman, whose powerful proprietary trading operation is legendary on Wall Street. In the 1980s, under Robert E. Rubin, its arbitragers profitably navigated an era of heady mergers. Today, the group is walled off from other traders on Goldman’s trading floor. The loss of the division would be a big change for Goldman. The group has long been one of the most sought-after places to work at Goldman, and one of the most highly compensated. One option under consideration would be to fold the group into Goldman’s asset management unit, allowing it to bring in outside investors. This way, Goldman would gradually reduce its direct financial stake in the unit. Another option would be to shut the group or let its traders spin it off into a separate fund or funds and seek capital from outside investors. A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said: “We are reviewing our options and will, of course, comply with the new legislation.” In recent years, the group had as much as $10 billion of Goldman’s capital and focused mostly on stocks. It has also produced several prominent hedge fund managers, among them Edward S. Lampert, Thomas F. Steyer and Daniel S. Och. At Morgan Stanley, executives have decided to spin off FrontPoint to the fund’s management, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. FrontPoint’s principals were negotiating terms, and the deal could still founder. Under a tentative plan, Morgan would reduce its ownership of FrontPoint, which employs about 180 people, to about 25 percent. That stake could then be reduced further over the next five years. Morgan Stanley executives view the restructuring not as a reaction to the financial overhaul but as part of the bank’s recovery since the financial crisis, and as part of the reorganization of its asset management business that was set in motion by the new chief executive, James P. Gorman. The move would represent something of a break with the era of John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley’s chairman, who pushed the bank into areas like hedge funds. But even if Morgan Stanley spins off FrontPoint, it will still own minority stakes in several other hedge funds. Like other banks, Morgan Stanley is also reviewing the future of its large and successful proprietary equities trading unit. Mr. Gorman is considering whether to spin it off into the asset management division. Citigroup has already sold its real estate arm, its SkyBridge Capital hedge fund group and its private equity division. It has also been scaling back its proprietary trading operations. Now, Citigroup executives are discussing plans for broader changes. One alternative is to shift some of its proprietary traders onto other trading desks. Another would be to fold them into the asset management area. While JPMorgan is also scaling back its stand-alone proprietary trading operations, its giant hedge fund firm, Highbridge Capital Partners, will be unscathed by the Dodd-Frank rules. That is because Highbridge, with $21 billion in assets, is considered an asset manager, as it relies primarily on capital from investors, rather than Morgan.</text></article>

But the directive, intended to prevent banks from making big bets for their own accounts, remains vague enough for Goldman and its Wall Street rivals to put plenty of money at risk.Investment banks can still use their own money to facilitate trades for customers. The rules envisage limiting that to the expected near-term demand for client trades. But identifying where that ends and proprietary trading begins is a blurry line. The Volcker Rule’s definition of proprietary trading is also open to interpretation. At first blush, it looks watertight: the rule forbids banks from buying and selling financial products for their “trading account.” That, in turn, is defined as an account meant to profit in the “near term” from “short term” movements in prices. That clearly knocks on the head trades that last for, say, a few days. But it’s unclear how far “near term” and “short term” are supposed to stretch. For instance, would the new rule have prohibited Morgan Stanley from placing a huge short bet on the mortgage market that lost the firm some $10 billion? That trade, though modified at times, was in place for almost a year. And banks can still trade government and agency securities for their own account. These are hardly risk free. Some of the problems at the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management stemmed from trying to arbitrage prices between Treasuries of different terms. And the Carlyle Capital Corporation, a heavily leveraged debt fund, crashed in 2008 when prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage bonds dropped. Longer-term investments aren’t ruled out either, so long as they’re not part of a private equity unit. Goldman’s special situations group, for example, sits in the firm’s fixed income division and invests in securities over a year or more. This group’s precrisis annual profit may have been as much as $1 billion. Prop trading and private equity may be dead. But long live principal investing. Big Oil, Big Gas United States oil companies are becoming less liquid — but not in a financial sense. With natural gas so plentiful, Big Oil is fast becoming Big Gas. Shareholders may be underestimating the impact of the shift on future returns while an unexpected advantage is tipping to the oiliest majors. America’s energy titans are finding it increasingly difficult to ramp up oil output. Exxon Mobil is on track to pump 5 percent less this year than in 2005, according to Barclays Capital forecasts. Instead, the company has turned to gas for growth. A big project in Papua New Guinea and its acquisition of XTO Energy are accelerating the shift. Gas, which accounted for 38 percent of Exxon’s output in 2005, could account for up to 48 percent next year. Exxon isn’t alone. Two rivals, ConocoPhillips and, to a lesser extent, Chevron, are also expanding in gas. The trend looks ominous. Oil offers fatter margins and, in the United States, sells for almost three times more than gas for the same quantity of energy. Drillers are partly victims of their own success, with new techniques raising gas reserves and driving down prices. Meanwhile, lawmakers have ditched proposals for a carbon tax, which had promised to spur demand for cleaner-burning gas. The gas market is not so grim everywhere. Multidecade contracts for liquefied natural gas in Asia are typically hooked to oil and so can fetch double the price in the United States. That helps Chevron in particular. But even overseas markets look less safe over the long run. The same drilling innovations that led to plunging prices in North America are being plied in Germany, Poland and China. Meanwhile other monster gas projects in Qatar and Australia are expected by the International Energy Agency to increase output by 50 percent by 2013. With even Chevron drifting toward gas, Occidental Petroleum, which still gets 75 percent of its output from black gold, might wind up the last of the majors deserving the moniker Big Oil. Its stock is costlier than its three biggest rivals, trading at 14 times expected 2010 earnings compared with an average of about 9.5 times. But its significantly lower exposure to gas justifies the premium, and then some. ANTONY CURRIE and CHRISTOPHER SWANN</text></article>
    <article index="12" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/business/economy/06deflation.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">2 Top Economists Differ Sharply on Deflation<date>Published: August 5, 2010</date><text>When the latest unemployment figures are announced on Friday, all of Wall Street will be watching. But for Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley and Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs, the results will be more than just another marker in an avalanche of data.Instead, the numbers will be a clue as to which of the two economists is right about where the American economy is headed. Their sharp disagreement over that question adds yet another twist to the fierce rivalry between the firms, Wall Street’s version of the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Mr. Hatzius is arguably Wall Street’s most prominent pessimist. He warns that the American economy is poised for a sharp slowdown in the second half of the year. That would send unemployment higher again and raise the risk of deflation. A rare occurrence, deflation can have a devastating effect on a struggling economy as prices and wages fall. He says he may be compelled to downgrade his already anemic growth predictions for the economy. For months, Mr. Berner has been sticking to a more optimistic forecast, despite growing evidence in favor of Mr. Hatzius’s view. Last week, Mr. Berner was caught by surprise when the federal government reported that the economy grew at a 2..4 percent pace in the second quarter, well below the 3.8 percent he had forecast a month before. Mr. Hatzius came closer to hitting the mark, having projected a 2 percent growth rate. Mr. Berner and his deputy, David Greenlaw, still expect a pickup in the second half of the year, which would help gradually bring down unemployment. They play down the danger posed by deflation, the malady that deepened the Great Depression and contributed to Japan’s lost decade of the 1990s. “I’d say at this point the data and the sentiment in the marketplace have certainly gone more Jan’s way than mine,” Mr. Berner said. Some people, he added, “think I’m out of my mind. But I have a conviction in my beliefs that’s based on my analysis.” Mr. Hatzius, a 41-year-old native of Germany who was 3 when Mr. Berner started out as an economist, is more restrained. He can afford to be, having snagged the top spot in a recent ranking of Wall Street economists as well as an award from Arizona State University honoring his “uncanny economic forecasting that anticipated the global financial crisis.” On Wall Street, both men were among a very small group that accurately predicted the recent recession. Mr. Berner’s long résumé includes stints at the Federal Reserve in Washington and Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. “I’ve seen plenty of ups and downs,” said Mr. Berner, 64, sitting in a corner office overlooking the Manhattan skyline at Morgan Stanley’s Midtown headquarters. Showing not even a hint of doubt, Mr. Hatzius said, “The prospect of substantial inflation seems very remote, but the prospect for deflation is far from remote. A double dip is certainly possible but not likely.” Mr. Berner does not expect substantial inflation, but he is predicting inflation will run 1 to 2 percent annually rather than the near-zero level Mr. Hatzius sees by the end of next year. “There is still a one in 10 chance of deflation,” Mr. Berner calculates. “But we already have been much more aggressive and proactive in dealing with the problem than Japan was,” he said, referring to the Federal Reserve’s decision to quickly cut rates and aggressively buy government securities. The split between the chief economists, whose work helps inform trading strategies recommended to investors by their firms, echoes a broader and sometimes fiercer debate among academic economists and commentators about the threat posed by deflation and what the government’s response should be. According to the deflationistas, as they are nicknamed, a new round of stimulus spending by Washington is urgently required to stave off a Depression-like cycle of falling prices and wages that is difficult to reverse once it is set in motion. Inflationistas, by contrast, worry more about the effect that additional government borrowing could have on the recovery. With the budget deficit expected to hover around $1 trillion a year for the next decade, they say, interest rates could eventually surge, making borrowing — and goods — more expensive. A double dip, they say, is highly unlikely. Mr. Hatzius’s gloomy outlook is owed centrally to Americans’ slowdown in spending. Recent data suggest that consumers are using any extra cash they have to pay down debt or put into savings. That places a strain on an American economy that has become hugely dependent on consumer spending. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that Americans saved 6.4 percent of their after-tax income in June, in contrast to the years before the recession, when savings rates stood at 1 to 2 percent. Last month, the Federal Reserve reported that consumer debt dropped by 4.5 percent in May, a $9 billion decline. It was the 20th consecutive month that figure has dropped. In 2007, consumer debt jumped by 5.7 percent, or nearly $40 billion.</text></article>

Proceeds Hit Pre-2008 Crisis Levels<date>August 3, 2010, 4:36 am</date><text>Proceeds from initial public offerings in July soared on a global basis, hitting their highest level since before the 2008 financial meltdown, according to Thomson Reuters data. The $30.5 billion that new issues raised globally in July was the most since November 2007 and exceeded the amount raised by follow-on issues for the month. Follow-ons, which were led by Mizuho Financial Group and INPEX in Japan, raised a total of $30.4 billion in July. That was a turnaround from 2009, when I.P.O.s for the most part were dwarfed by secondary offerings, many of them by banks under pressure from regulators to raise capital. Year-to-date fees from the new issues, buoyed by Agricultural Bank of China‘s $20.8 billion I.P.O. and Britain’s $1.04 billion Vallar Plc I.P.O., reached $3.7 billion. That is more than five times the $706 million of fees banks reaped in the first seven months of 2009. Including I.P.O.s, follow-ons and convertibles, the No. 1 ranked underwriting bank, year to date on a global basis, is JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan has underwritten 185 deals worth $35.32 billion. Goldman Sachs is in the No. 2 position with 128 deals worth $31.03 billion, and Morgan Stanley is No. 3, with 143 deals worth $25.49 billion.

The move was an unexpected sign of restraint after a major Supreme Court ruling this year that gave corporations the power to devote unlimited amounts to electing or defeating candidates for federal office. The investment bank quietly revised its statement on political activities on its Web site last week, adding a sentence addressing the powers that were granted under the Supreme Court decision in January, known as Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. “Goldman Sachs also does not spend corporate funds directly on electioneering communications,” the firm said in its statement. Those communications are generally interpreted to mean advertisements on radio and television broadcasts in the run-up to an election. The decision came after weeks of talks with the New York City public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who has lobbied for greater transparency from companies seeking to sway the outcome of elections. The investment bank, not usually known as an ally of grass-roots causes, declined to comment on its position. Mr. de Blasio hailed Goldman’s pledge as game-changing and, given the firm’s stature, he said, it could prompt other companies to follow suit. “This could be one of those moments that determines whether we are going to have a political system literally dominated by corporate money, or some ability by the people at the grass roots to determine the outcome of elections,” Mr. de Blasio said. Critics of the Citizens United decision, including President Obama, said it would allow corporations to drown out competing messages and corrupt the political system. But the Supreme Court said in its 5-to-4 decision that it was upholding a central tenet of the Constitution: the right to free speech by anyone, including corporations. Federal law prohibits corporations from donating directly to candidates for federal office, but, the court decision said, they may pay for advertisements supporting or opposing them. Goldman employees may make personal contributions, but the firm requires that they first submit them for approval. Campaign finance experts said companies like Goldman still had other means of exerting political influence. Goldman, like many large companies, operates political action committees at the state and national levels that could raise money for the purpose of influencing political races. In addition, companies are free to spend money to advocate positions on specific issues, like health care, gun control or financial regulation. “This doesn’t mean they are disarmed,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University who specializes in campaign finance. Lawrence A. Mandelker, a New York lawyer who specializes in campaign finance law, said Goldman’s position might persuade other businesses to abstain from political spending. “It’s a precedent that can be cited to other companies, suggesting that they too decide not to exercise the right to spend unlimited amounts,” he said. Some corporations have already started taking advantage of the new powers afforded by the Supreme Court. Target, for instance, recently donated $150,000 to a group that is running ads in support of a Republican candidate for governor in Minnesota who opposes gay marriage. Employees and gay rights advocates have criticized the donation. Indeed, entering the political sphere comes with certain costs, including the potential for backlash from investors, the public and politicians. Mr. Briffault said that some companies might be put off by those dangers, and that others might not be willing to tolerate the intense back-room lobbying for their support. “It’s not clear that corporations are going to be zooming to take advantage of this,” he said.</text></article>

Until now, the bank hadn’t revealed how it had calculated the worth of those increasingly toxic assets, but in a report (PDF) sent to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission last week, Goldman laid out its methodology. “We made collateral calls to A.I.G., and other counterparties, consistent with the further deterioration in the market,” the bank said. “We made those collateral calls based on prices that reflected the deteriorating conditions in the market for the underlying collateral in Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (R.M.B.S.) and C.D.O.’s and specific transactions in comparable securities — transactions in which we acted as a market-maker and transactions we observed between other market participants.” Go to Goldman Sachs Report (PDF) » Go to Related Article from The Wall Street Journal (Subscription Required) » Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>

Neighbors<date>August 2, 2010, 7:05 am</date><text>Local New York City residents are up in arms over a plan by Goldman Sachs to replace a discount shoe shop, a pizza joint, a recently closed New York Sports Club gym and a budget inn outside its new $2.1 billion headquarters with a string of designer restaurants and a luxury hotel. The Telegraph reported that the bank is being accused by denizens of “breaking promises.” The bank’s neighbors have demanded basic services like a supermarket and a hardware store but instead are poised to see a trio of restaurants run by the impresario, Danny Meyer, as well as a new ballroom and a conference center which will be attached to the upgraded hotel. The bank also plans 5,000 square feet of retail units, the newspaper said. “It appears that Goldman has no intention of replacing this retail tenant with one more attractive to the community,” long-term area resident Tom Goodkind told the newspaper of the closing of the shoe outlet at a meeting of the area’s community board last week. “This loss of space seems to break the promise made to our community,” when Goldman originally got permission to purchase the building four years ago, Mr. Goodkind added. Goldman’s global head of corporate services and real estate told the newspaper that both the gym and the shoe shop had asked to break their own leases following falling sales and also defended the bank’s plans, saying that not every retailer brought in would be expensive.

    <article index="19" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/02/nyregion/02ferry.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Ferries Carrying Goldman Workers Called Too Loud<date>Published: August 1, 2010</date><text>Goldman Sachs, which has certainly borne its share of public anger about the financial crisis, is now drawing heat for another reason: noisy ferryboats. The boats, which have been running almost constantly across the Hudson River every weekday since Goldman moved into its new headquarters in Battery Park City, have generated frequent complaints from residents of the neighborhood. Goldman does not own the offending boats, but it is paying a ferry company to keep them running 16 hours a day between a floating terminal at the edge of Battery Park City and a dock near Goldman’s waterfront office tower in Jersey City. The dispute about the boat noise has droned on for so long that Battery Park City officials have hinted that they might want to give the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the $50 million floating terminal, the heave-ho, saying the agency is violating the terms of its lease with the high noise levels. In a letter he drafted to the Port Authority recently, James E. Cavanaugh, the president of the Battery Park City Authority, demanded an end to the “unreasonable noise” emanating from what he called the Goldman service. Now, having fielded complaints for eight months, Goldman is preparing to solve the problem with its wallet. The firm is having two ferryboats built to its specifications at an estimated cost of more than $5 million, said people with knowledge of the firm’s plan who insisted on anonymity because they did not have permission to discuss it. The two boats, which would be more luxurious than the typical commuter ferry on the Hudson, could arrive before the end of the year, these people said. Goldman intends to substitute the new vessels for the NY Waterway boats that have been plying the short route between its office towers on opposite sides of the river. Mr. Cavanaugh said he hoped that the matter could be resolved without legal action, but he did not rule out the possibility of litigation. The draft letter he sent to the Port Authority said the “Goldman service” had “unreasonably inconvenienced and annoyed” some residents of Battery Park City. It alluded to noise readings taken by the city’s Department of Environmental Protection in April and May that exceeded the city’s legal limit of 10 decibels above the ambient noise level. Mr. Cavanaugh blamed the problem on the use of older, noisier boats since Goldman increased the frequency of ferry runs — to every seven or eight minutes — when its employees began moving into the new tower late last year. The ferries run from 6 a.m. to almost 10 p.m. The terminal is operated for the Port Authority by a ferry company known as BillyBey, which is named after its owner, William Wachtel, a politically active Manhattan lawyer. Goldman Sachs, in turn, pays BillyBey to run boats between the terminal and the Jersey City dock, known as Paulus Hook. The boats, which fly the NY Waterway commuter-service flag, are open to the public for a fare of $5.50 each way. But community leaders in Battery Park City say that, outside of the morning and evening rush hours, the ferries serve primarily as shuttles for Goldman employees. Indeed, they run far more frequently than other commuter ferries do: NY Waterway boats run as infrequently as twice an hour in the middle of the day between the train terminal in Hoboken, N.J., and Battery Park City. Privately, some Goldman officials bridle at the complaints, suggesting that the neighbors were piling criticism on a firm that has already been faulted in the public eye. They declined to discuss the firm’s plan to obtain its own boats. But, in a statement, the firm said it had contracted with BillyBey “to provide the most efficient form of transportation for our employees to shuttle between our two buildings, while also providing a public service.” It added that the firm was “aware there have been some issues raised” and was working with the ferry operator to explore all options to address them. A spokesman for BillyBey said the company had switched to newer, quieter boats after the complaints first arose late last year and had not received any complaints since then. But Mr. Cavanaugh said he had seen the older boats — nicknamed the Italian class because they were named after famous Italian-Americans like Frank Sinatra and Yogi Berra — operating on the route recently and had heard about other sightings by residents of Battery Park City. “I saw those Italian-class boats well after Waterways promised not to use them,” Mr. Cavanaugh said. “That equipment continues to show up.” For his part, Mr. Wachtel, the ferry operator, said, “We’re confident in short order all concerns will, in fact, be allayed.”</text></article>

Charges Billionaire Dallas Brothers With Securities Fraud<date>Published: July 29, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — Samuel and Charles Wyly, the billionaire brothers from Dallas who are large donors to philanthropies and to conservative causes, were charged Thursday with conducting an extensive securities fraud that the Securities and Exchange Commission said reaped $550 million in undisclosed gains.The brothers, who founded Sterling Software, a business software and services company that they sold for $4 billion in stock to the software company CA in 2000, were also charged with insider trading violations from which they profited by more than $31 million, the S.E.C. said The civil charges, coming just two weeks after the S.E.C. reached a $550 million settlement with Goldman Sachs, are part of a concerted effort by the commission to focus more sharply on prominent enforcement cases. The agency came under fierce attack after the financial crisis of 2007-8 for failing to uncover fraudulent activity in the mortgage securities markets and for missing chances to halt the Ponzi scheme operated by Bernard L. Madoff. The Wyly brothers are in many ways a study in contrasts, paradigms of self-made billionaires who for years have fought investigations into suspected tax dodges by the offshore trusts that the S.E.C. claims they controlled. Samuel E. Wyly, 75, and Charles J. Wyly Jr., 76, who through a lawyer called the charges “without merit,” have given millions of dollars to Republican candidates and organizations, but Sam Wyly this year was also named one of the world’s 10 “greenest” billionaires by Forbes magazine. The S.E.C. case, which was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, centers on charges of securities fraud and insider trading related to the shares of companies founded by the Wyly bothers or where they served as directors or executives. They include the retail craft chain Michaels Stores, Sterling Software, Sterling Commerce and Scottish Annuity and Life Holdings. The ill-gotten gains, according to the S.E.C., were used to buy tens of millions of dollars of art, collectibles and jewelry; $100 million of real estate, including two ranches in Aspen, Colo., and a 100-acre horse farm near Dallas; and for charitable contributions, including $10 million to the business school at Samuel Wyly’s alma mater, the University of Michigan. The charges are the result of a six-year investigation that began in 2004 when Bank of America reported to the S.E.C. that it had terminated numerous accounts held in the name of companies based in the Isle of Man because it could not determine who actually owned the companies. The S.E.C. found that those companies, and similar entities registered in the Cayman Islands, were registered as trusts over which the Wylys said they had no formal control. But in fact, the S.E.C. charged, the brothers directed nearly all the investment activity in the trusts, selling hundreds of millions of dollars in shares without following S.E.C. disclosure rules governing stock ownership and trading by company insiders. Through a lawyer, the Wylys said that they believed the charges were “a misapplication of the law” and that they had conducted all of their activities on the basis of accounting and legal advice that they received. “They have never been given any reason to believe the financial transactions in question were anything other than legal and fully appropriate,” said William A. Brewer III, a partner at the Dallas law firm of Bickel &amp; Brewer who is lead counsel for the Wylys. The brothers “expect to be fully vindicated,” he said. Also charged in connection with the case were a lawyer for the Wylys, Michael C. French of Dallas, and a stockbroker, Louis J. Schaufele III, also of Dallas. Lawyers representing Mr. French and Mr. Schaufele did not immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. The S.E.C. can bring only civil actions, but the brothers have previously been reported to be under criminal investigation for actions related to their investment activities. Lorin L. Reisner, the deputy director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, declined to comment on whether the commission had referred its current findings to the Justice Department or other law enforcement agencies. The S.E.C. claimed that a scheme of undisclosed investments and securities sales took place over 13 years and involved three-quarters of a billion dollars in stock. As longtime executives and directors of public companies, the S.E.C. said that the Wylys knew or should have known their obligations as the owners of more than 5 percent of the stock of several companies. S.E.C. regulations require that holders of more than 5 percent of a company’s stock disclose that fact, and that company directors and executives report any and all sales or purchases of shares. Though they claimed to own only small stakes in their companies, the S.E.C. charged that they owned from 16 percent to 36 percent of the four companies named in the complaint. Many investors track stock sales by company insiders because they believe that can provide clues to a company’s prospects; if well-informed company insiders are selling, investors might conclude that a company’s financial position is weakening. “By concealing that the entities making the sales were under the control of the Wylys, other investors paid inflated prices for the shares they sold,” Mr. Reisner said. If the S.E.C. is successful in proving all of its allegations, it could result in one of the biggest judgments ever in a securities fraud case. The commission is seeking disgorgement of the $550 million in gains and prejudgment interest and financial penalties. Unlike some billionaires who maintain a cloak of privacy around their private lives, the Wylys maintain their own Web site extolling their business history, philanthropic activities and other interests. They have been, at times, similarly open about their political affiliations. In 2000, Sam Wyly was a principal contributor to Republicans for Clean Air, a group that bought ads extolling then-Gov. George W. Bush’s environmental record and criticizing the record of Senator John McCain. Four years later, the Wyly brothers were substantial contributors to the Swift Boat campaign that raised questions about the war record of Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who was running for president against President Bush.</text></article>

    <article index="23" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/27/business/27sorkin.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Documents Back Goldman’s Contentions on A.I.G.<date>Published: July 26, 2010</date><text>For almost two years, Goldman Sachs has been spinning what many believed was a far-fetched tale.Goldman has maintained that it had entirely hedged its exposure to the American International Group before A.I.G. collapsed in September 2008. Goldman’s chief financial officer, David Viniar, has repeated over and over again: “We had no direct exposure.” Wall Street laughed. Congress laughed. The media laughed. Impossible! Just last week, Elizabeth Warren, the chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel, reiterated her skepticism during a Senate hearing. “We cannot evaluate the credibility of their claim that they had nothing at stake one way or the other in the A.I.G. bailout,” she said. A popular narrative has been constructed that government officials, led by Henry M. Paulson Jr., then Treasury secretary and the former chief executive of Goldman, and Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saved A.I.G. to save banks that were exposed to the insurance giant — and in particular Goldman. So what was Goldman’s exposure? According to some newly released documents, perhaps far less than its detractors maintain. First, some numbers by way of background. Goldman Sachs originally had bought about $20 billion in protection against an underlying portfolio of collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, with exposure to A.I.G. By that September, given the decline in the value of those instruments, Goldman’s gross exposure was $10 billion. A.I.G. posted $7.5 billion in collateral, leaving Goldman exposed to a potential $2.5 billion loss. But documents released by the Senate Finance Committee late Friday suggested Goldman was trying to brace for that potential loss. It now appears that Goldman had hedged itself against such a potential loss by buying $1.7 billion in insurance on A.I.G. from more than 30 different banks, and made other bets against A.I.G. worth more than $600 million. Whether it would have all paid off remains an unanswered question. Another document — released by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — has gone unnoticed and might be even more important. It contains an e-mail message to Mr. Geithner, sent on Sept. 16, 2008, at 12:02 p.m., just as he and the board of the Federal Reserve were deciding to inject $85 billion into A.I.G., which they did several hours later. The e-mail message came from one of Mr. Geithner’s lieutenants, Brian Peters. In the message, Mr. Peters said that he had just spoken to Goldman’s chief risk officer, Craig Broderick. Mr. Peters spelled out his understanding of Goldman’s direct exposure to A.I.G. to Mr. Geithner. He said that Goldman’s “net exposure is $2.3 billion,” but immediately added, “They have credit hedges of $2.5 billion, $500 million of which is internal, so they are roughly flat.” Of course, Goldman Sachs would most likely have been susceptible to broader market problems had A.I.G. failed, a point that the firm has long acknowledged. And, had A.I.G. gone bankrupt, it is possible that a judge would have sought to claw back the $7.5 billion in collateral that A.I.G. had posted with Goldman, but that is an open question. “I am not saying that we would have been unaffected; I don’t think there is any company in the world that would have been unaffected by a failure of A.I.G. because all of the world’s financial markets would have been affected,” Mr. Viniar said in a conference call last year. In that same e-mail message to Mr. Geithner on Sept. 16, 2008, Mr. Peters had put together a model of the worst case for Goldman in an industrywide Armageddon situation after an A.I.G. failure. His estimate, which he admitted in the e-mail message “tries (crudely) to look at market effects and could be too dark,” was a $6 billion loss for Goldman. Even Mr. Peters said at the time, “Bottom line: their number is essentially the current number.” In other words, the Fed believed Goldman was hedged the day it saved A.I.G. But were its numbers right? By the calculations of the documents released Friday, Goldman had hedged its $2.5 billion exposure with somewhere from $2.375 billion to $2.5 billion on the other side, meaning it was pretty close to being fully hedged, with a little bit of wiggle room on either side of those numbers. Of course, some of the insurance came from financial institutions that probably would have suffered to some degree and might have struggled to make the payments. Lehman Brothers (which was bankrupt) and Citigroup were among the firms that had provided the insurance. On Friday, Senator Charles E. Grassley asked, in questions for Ms. Warren’s panel: “Is it possible that financial health of the other institutions on the list may have prevented them from being able to pay Goldman in the event of an A.I.G. default?” The answer is yes, but only a little bit. Goldman had been demanding cash collateral from all its counterparties up until A.I.G.’s near failure, so that even if one of its counterparties could not make the payment, it already had most of the cash. “We have said repeatedly that we had no direct material economic exposure to A.I.G.,” Lucas van Praag, Goldman’s spokesman, told me. “Banks from whom we purchased credit protection, including Lehman Brothers, were required to post collateral to settle their net exposure to us on a daily basis. A default by any particular counterparty would not have created credit exposure for us if adequate collateral had been posted, which was the case. Put simply, our risk was limited by the fact that we already had the money.” A.I.G.’s rescue has repeatedly been described as a “backdoor bailout” of Wall Street. In fact, it was a front door bailout aimed at stabilizing the entire financial system. Whether any of the big banks, including Goldman, could have withstood the domino effects of an A.I.G. collapse is uncertain. But Goldman seems to have been better prepared for the worst than anyone would have believed.</text></article>

More from Reuters: Regulators are preparing rules that will require the majority of privately traded derivatives be cleared through central counterparties, which stand between trading partners and guarantee the trades. Goldman’s clearing business will offer client clearing for interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivatives. Derivatives are based on underlying securities such as stocks, bonds, foreign exchange or commodities or are used to bet or protect against changes in interest rates.

    <article index="25" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/opinion/26sauer.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Wall Street Still Doesn’t Have a Sheriff<date>Published: July 25, 2010</date><text>THE current range of opinion on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s $550 million settlement in the Goldman Sachs fraud suit lines up closely with that evoked by previous S.E.C. settlements with corporate defendants. Some Americans are outraged that Goldman “got off easy,” while others feel the deal could be a model for gaining some measure of justice against those responsible for Wall Street’s meltdown. Both sides are wrong: at best, such agreements reflect case-specific facts and circumstances; at worst, they are nearly arbitrary. While the government often claims such high-profile deals are of historic significance, they typically have little effect on future cases and do nothing to resolve long-standing conflicts as to how the law should treat misconduct by public companies. The question of how best to discipline what Chief Justice John Marshall in 1819 called “an artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in contemplation of law” is indeed vexing. A corporation can’t be put in jail, its fines are ultimately paid by investors not responsible for the misconduct, and a court order forbidding future violations merely shelves the issue until the next occurrence. In 19th-century America, permissive incorporation laws and rapid economic development led to the rise of the large corporation, which, in turn, led to a century of expanding federal regulation. Most measures regulated certain forms of conduct and prohibited others, specifying fines for failure to comply. There was little consideration given to questions of when, as a matter of practical legal policy, an artificial entity should be treated as if it were a person. The S.E.C. wasn’t forced to grapple with the issue until 1990, when Congress greatly expanded its power to seek financial penalties from corporate violators. (Before then, companies could shrug off civil orders as a passing embarrassment.) Initially, however, the agency made infrequent use of this new authority. Its staff saw fining public companies as harmful to shareholders, the very people the S.E.C. was created to protect. It also feared that managers would tap their corporate treasuries to buy their way out of individual liability. But the public, the press and Congress didn’t accept any abstract arguments that corporations shouldn’t pay fines for securities law violations, as they did for, say, antitrust violations. Eventually heeding these views, the S.E.C. began to seek money penalties from public companies more frequently, in ever-increasing amounts. As with the recent Goldman settlement, record penalties were presented by S.E.C. officials as illustrating the agency’s resolve to enforce securities laws. Objections that such settlements only hurt shareholders were partly overcome with the Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002, which included a provision authorizing the S.E.C. to give civil penalties it collected to injured investors rather than the Treasury. But doing so can put the agency in the same business as class-action lawyers: taking money from current shareholders for the benefit of previous investors, who are deemed somehow more worthy. In 2006, however, the pro-business tenor of the S.E.C. under President George W. Bush found expression in written guidelines widely seen as intended to provide a principled basis for limiting fines paid by public companies. They emphasized such mitigating factors as a corporate defendant’s cooperation with investigators. The commissioners, who have to approve all deals in the end, also now insisted that staff consult them before soliciting settlement offers, apparently to avoid putting themselves in the potentially embarrassing position of rejecting penalties negotiated by the staff. (This policy has now been discarded — wisely in my view.) The S.E.C. under its current chairwoman, Mary Schapiro, is clearly raising the ceiling on the money penalties it will seek from (at least) high-profile corporate wrongdoers. Thus investors will find there is yet another way that management misconduct can cost them. This is defensible if it achieves compelling law-enforcement objectives. But that is where things get muddy. When, exactly, does fining a public company deter potential future violators, bring attention to the significance of particular forms of misconduct, signal shareholders to throw the (management) bums out, or readjust appropriately the interests of current and former shareholders? And when, on the other hand, does it merely provide a platform for agency self-congratulation? Do not look to the Goldman settlement for guidance. It concludes a case in which the S.E.C. injected itself into a transaction between large financial entities (Goldman and the banks and funds that bought the subprime-mortgage vehicles it peddled) quite capable of defending their own legal interests. This was an unexplained departure from previous practice. The amount of the money penalty bears no relation to the benefits derived by Goldman from its alleged misconduct (reported as $15 million). More important, the settlement brings the commission no closer to developing a clear standard when it comes to seeking redress for the behavior that led to the economic disaster. Its settlements with public companies will probably be much like settlements in private litigation, an ad hoc process that defies standardization and sometimes logic. The quality of the evidence, the perceived culpability of the wrongdoer and the parties’ negotiating prowess and appetite for complex litigation will all go into the mix, with unpredictable results. As for the half-billion paid by Goldman — well, given the unfortunate vagueness of the system, it’s probably about as good a number as any.</text></article>
    <article index="26" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/24/business/24sec.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Inquiry Begun of S.E.C. Timing in Goldman Fraud Case<date>Published: July 23, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON — The inspector general of the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether political or other factors influenced the timing of the filing and subsequent settlement of the commission’s securities fraud case against Goldman Sachs, according to letters between his office and a Republican congressman.The inquiry also focuses on Representative Darrell E. Issa’s assertion that commission officials leaked details of the case to The New York Times before it was formally announced, and whether the settlement timing was influenced by an article in The Wall Street Journal. The S.E.C. charged Goldman in a civil complaint on April 16 with securities fraud related to the creation and sale of a subprime mortgage security. On July 15, Goldman agreed to pay $550 million to settle the case without admitting or denying the accusations. H. David Kotz, the S.E.C. inspector general, who is an independent watchdog for the agency, began the inquiry in response to an April 23 letter from Mr. Issa, a California Republican who is the ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The S.E.C. has denied that its timing was influenced by politics. A spokesman for the S.E.C. said Friday that the agency announced the lawsuit in a news release at 10:35 a.m. on April 16. In an April 20 letter to Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., that was also sent to Mr. Kotz, Mr. Issa stated that “a version of the story” by The Times was published on its Web site at 10:39 a.m. that day. Diane McNulty, a spokeswoman for The New York Times, confirmed that the Times article was published after the announcement of the S.E.C. lawsuit. She declined to comment on whether the newspaper had been contacted in the investigation. On Thursday, Mr. Kotz wrote to Mr. Issa that his office was expanding his investigation to include further allegations made in a second letter received that day from Mr. Issa. In the latest letter, Mr. Issa raised questions about the timing of the S.E.C.’s settlement of the case with Goldman Sachs, which occurred on July 15, the same day that the Senate passed the financial regulation bill. In the letter, Mr. Issa noted that a July 17 article in The Wall Street Journal about the settlement reported that Robert Khuzami, the director of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division, accused Goldman of leaking a story to The Journal suggesting that “Goldman had bested the S.E.C.” in the settlement negotiations. As a result, Mr. Issa said, the commission “may have entered into a ‘landmark settlement’ resulting in the ‘largest-ever penalty paid by a Wall Street firm’ in order to avoid further criticism in the press.” A spokeswoman for The Wall Street Journal said the newspaper had not been contacted by the inspector general about the investigation.</text></article>

Failure Would Have Cost Goldman Sachs, Documents Show<date>Published: July 24, 2010</date><text>Since the United States government stepped in to rescue the American International Group in the fall of 2008, Goldman Sachs has maintained that it would have faced few if any losses had the insurer failed. Though it was the insurer's biggest trading partner, Goldman contended that it had bought credit insurance from financial institutions that would have protected it, but it declined to identify the institutions. A Congressional document released late Friday lists those institutions and shows that Goldman was exposed to losses in an A.I.G. default because some of the investment bank's trading partners, such as Citibank and Lehman Brothers, were financially unstable and might have been unable to make good on large claims from Goldman. The document details every institution that had sold credit insurance on A.I.G. to Goldman as of Sept. 15, 2008, the day before the New York Fed arranged the insurer's rescue with an $85 billion backstop. The document, supplied by Goldman Sachs, was released by Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. Goldman had purchased credit protection on A.I.G. worth $402 million from Citigroup and $175 million from Lehman Brothers, the document shows. As of the date of the document, Lehman had already filed for bankruptcy protection. ''This illustrates that the Goldman version of reality is not entirely accurate,'' said Christopher Whalen, managing director at Institutional Risk Analytics. ''They did have exposure to A.I.G., and that is what drove their behavior in the bailout.'' Lucas van Praag, a Goldman spokesman, reiterated that the firm was fully protected from an A.I.G. default and noted that the protection it had purchased from financial institutions required that they post cash to Goldman to cover rising exposures. ''Given that we were receiving and paying collateral on a daily basis, the risk to us of not being able to collect on our hedges had A.I.G. defaulted was de minimus,'' Mr. van Praag said. For decades, Goldman and A.I.G. had a long and fruitful relationship, with A.I.G. insuring billions in mortgage-related securities that Goldman Sachs underwrote. When the mortgage market started to deteriorate in 2007, however, the relationship went sour and Goldman began demanding cash from A.I.G. to cover the declining value of the securities it had insured. A dispute ensued, and Goldman began buying credit insurance on A.I.G. to protect against possible losses arising from its dealings with the company. According to the document, Goldman held a total of $1.7 billion in insurance on A.I.G. from almost 90 institutions. Its exposure to A.I.G. at that time was $2.6 billion. Goldman bought most of the insurance from large foreign and domestic banks, including Credit Suisse ($310 million), Morgan Stanley ($243 million) and JPMorgan Chase ($216 million). Goldman also bought $223 million in insurance on A.I.G. from a variety of funds overseen by Pimco, the money management firm. JPMorgan and Credit Suisse declined to comment late Friday. A Pimco official could not be reached. Critics of the A.I.G. rescue have characterized it as a ''backdoor bailout'' of financial institutions that had made mortgage bets guaranteed by the beleaguered insurer. Initially, the government refused to identify these institutions, causing consternation among some in Congress, including Mr. Grassley, who thought the taxpayers should know whom they had benefited. The issue of the rescue's beneficiaries surfaced again last Wednesday in hearings sponsored by the Senate Finance Committee. Elizabeth Warren, the chairwoman of the Congressional panel that oversees the government's responses to the credit crisis, testified that Goldman Sachs had declined to supply her staff with information about the insurance it had bought to protect itself from an A.I.G. failure. Because the Congressional panel cannot issue subpoenas, Mr. Grassley suggested that his committee request the information from Goldman, subpoenaing the firm if necessary. Goldman quickly submitted the materials. ''It's as if the New York Fed used A.I.G. as a front man to bail out big banks all over the world,'' Mr. Grassley said in a statement. ''It took nearly two years for the public to learn these details, and they only were revealed because Congress wouldn't take no for an answer. Taxpayers deserve to know what happened with their money.'' PHOTO: Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, testifying in April before a Senate subcommittee hearing in Washington.

    <article index="28" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0D91E30F930A15754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Federal Report Faults Banks on Huge Bonuses<date>Published: July 23, 2010</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED With the financial system on the verge of collapse in late 2008, a group of troubled banks doled out more than $2 billion in bonuses and other payments to their highest earners. Now, the federal authority on banker pay says that nearly 80 percent of that sum was unmerited. In a report to be released on Friday, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the Obama administration's special master for executive compensation, is expected to name 17 financial companies that made questionable payouts totaling $1.58 billion immediately after accepting billions of dollars of taxpayer aid, according to two government officials with knowledge of his findings who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the report. The group includes Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and the American International Group as well as small lenders like Boston Private Financial Holdings. Mr. Feinberg's report points to companies that he says paid eye-popping amounts or used haphazard criteria for awarding bonuses, the people with knowledge of his findings said. Even so, Mr. Feinberg has very limited power to reclaim any money. He can use his status as President Obama's point man on pay to jawbone the companies into reimbursing the government, but he has no legal authority to claw back excessive payouts. Mr. Feinberg's political leverage has been weakened by the banks' speedy repayment of their bailout funds. Eleven of the 17 companies that received criticism in the report have repaid the government with interest, so they have no outstanding obligations to reimburse. As a result, Mr. Feinberg will merely propose that the banks voluntarily adopt a ''brake provision'' that would allow their boards to nullify or alter any bonus payouts or employment contracts in the event of a future financial crisis. All 17 companies have told Mr. Feinberg that they will consider adopting the provision, though none has committed to do so. Mr. Feinberg is expected to call the payouts ill advised but not unlawful or contrary to the public interest, the people with knowledge of his report said. On Wall Street, meanwhile, profits and pay have already rebounded. Goldman Sachs is on pace to hand out an average of $544,000 per worker in salary and bonuses, though many could earn several times that amount. JPMorgan Chase's investment bank is on track to pay its workers, on average, about $425,000, while the average Morgan Stanley employee could collect about $260,000. If the second half of 2010 plays out like the first half, Wall Street bonuses will be paid out at about the same level as last year and similar to 2007 levels, when the crisis had just started to unfold. ''It's healthier than I would have ever expected a year ago,'' said Alan Johnson, a longtime compensation consultant who specializes in financial services. Mr. Feinberg was named last month as the independent administrator for claims tied to the BPoil spill, making it likely that the release of his findings on the financial firms will be his final act as the overseer of banker pay. The review, mandated by the 2009 economic stimulus bill, broadened the scope of Mr. Feinberg's duties to include examining the pay packages of top earners at 419 companies that accepted bailout funds. However, it did not give him the power to demand changes to the compensation arrangements, as he did in each of the last two years at seven companies that received multiple bailouts. Mr. Feinberg spent five months reviewing compensation paid to each company's 25 highest earners between October 2008, when the first bailouts were dispensed, and February 2009, when the stimulus bill took effect. He narrowed his scrutiny to about 600 executives at 17 banks, with payouts totaling $2.03 billion. Mr. Feinberg's criteria for identifying the worst offenders were large payouts, in aggregate or to specific individuals; overly generous exit packages; or a failure to provide clear performance criteria or other rationale for extra pay. Mr. Feinberg then approached each of the 17 companies with his proposed remedy during conference calls over the last two weeks. The 11 companies that have fully repaid their bailout money are American Express, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon, Boston Private, Capital One Financial, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, PNC Financial, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo. The six companies that have not fully repaid their bailout funds are A.I.G, Citigroup, the CIT Group, M&amp;T Bank, Regions Financial and SunTrust Banks. Among the banks that have not fully repaid the government, Citigroup was identified by Mr. Feinberg as having the most egregious compensation packages during the bailout period, according to officials with knowledge of his report. The bank handed out several hundred million dollars in pay in 2008 as it struggled to stay afloat. Roughly two-thirds of the outsize payouts were from bonuses awarded to Andrew Hall and another trader who were part of the bank's Phibro energy trading unit. Citigroup sold that business to Occidental Petroleum last fall, under pressure from Mr. Feinberg, after the disclosure that Mr. Hall had received a $100 million payout. Mr. Feinberg is not expected to name individual executives who received the highest awards. His review is among several compensation initiatives scrutinizing banker pay. In June, the Federal Reserve ordered about two dozen of the biggest banks to address several pay practices that, even after the crisis, it said encouraged excessive risk-taking. European banking regulators introduced tough new standards for bonus payments earlier this month. And the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is developing a plan that would partly tie bank insurance premiums to the perceived risk of their executive pay packages. That proposal could be reviewed by the agency's board as early as next month. PHOTO: Kenneth R. Feinberg is expected to name 17 financial companies that made questionable payouts.

    <article index="29" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/business/global/23iht-suisse.html?ref=goldmansachsgroupinc">Credit Suisse Sees Small Increase in Profit<date>Published: July 22, 2010</date><text>LONDON — Credit Suisse on Thursday joined its Wall Street rivals in reporting a sharp drop in trading revenue in the second quarter as clients shied away from taking risks in a volatile market. The Swiss bank reported a surprise increase in profit as it benefited from a tax credit. But earnings at its investment banking operation dropped 53 percent as unnerved clients cut back on trades. Credit Suisse shares dropped 2.3 percent in Zurich early Thursday. They have fallen 15 percent this year while shares in local rival UBS dropped 5 percent. Credit Suisse’s profit rose 1.4 percent to 1.59 billion Swiss francs, or $1.5 billion, in the second quarter, from 1.57 billion francs in the same period last year. The average estimate in a Reuters poll was for 1.23 billion Swiss francs. The bank had a tax credit of 522 million francs and said it booked a gain of 922 million francs as the value of its own liabilities dropped. But overall trading revenue fell 27 percent from the previous quarter to 3.16 billion francs. Trading in bonds dropped 46 percent even as equity trading, where the bank gained market share, rose 2 percent. Credit Suisse blamed the drop on “volatile market conditions arising from sovereign debt concerns and regulatory uncertainty resulting in client risk aversion.” Goldman Sachs reported a 82 percent drop in profits for the quarter on Tuesday and JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also saw a decline. After a good year for trading, helped by low interest rates, clients became more cautious this year. Credit Suisse’s chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, called the group’s earnings a “resilient performance during a difficult second quarter for the banking sector.” Credit Suisse’s private banking business had net new assets of 13.8 billion francs in the quarter, helped especially by its business in Asia, Russia and the Middle East. But pretax profit at the unit fell 7 percent to 874 million francs on higher operating costs. Credit Suisse offices in Germany were searched by investigators last week and data confiscated as part of an investigation into allegations that some employees might have helped clients evade taxes. Mr. Dougan said that he “hopes there is a recognition that we do complete our business in a very compliant way” and that the recent new client funds show that any impact of the probe on Credit Suisse’s client behavior would be minimal. Pretax profit in the investment banking operation more than halved to 784 million francs, from 1.66 billion francs in the second quarter of last year, because of weaker fixed-income sales and trading revenues, the bank said. Credit Suisse hired 600 people for the investment banking unit over the last three months. Mr. Dougan invested in the bank’s debt trading operation by hiring staff to gain market share in an area some analysts had defined as one of the bank’s weaknesses. When the bank was criticized by some analysts in April for not emulating the strong performance of first-quarter earnings by rivals like Goldman Sachs, Mr. Dougan said the Swiss bank’s earnings were “higher quality, lower volatility earnings.” Credit Suisse’s risk-weighted assets in the first three months of this year were less than half of Goldman Sachs’s and decreased further to $142 billion in the second quarter, it said. UBS and Deutsche Bank are due to report quarterly figures on Tuesday.</text></article>

Said to Probe Timing of Goldman Settlement<date>July 23, 2010, 5:05 am</date><text>The Securities and Exchange Commission’s inspector general, David Kotz, said on Thursday that he will expand his investigation of the agency’s fraud suit against Goldman Sachs to look into concerns raised about the timing of the firm’s $550 million settlement, Reuters reported. Mr. Kotz said that he will look into “the circumstances surrounding the timing of the S.E.C.’s settlement reached with Goldman on July 16,” according to a letter seen by Reuters. The investment bank and the investor protection agency announced an agreement earlier this month to settle the S.E.C.’s civil fraud suit, which claimed Goldman misrepresented a debt product tied to subprime mortgages. As part of the settlement, Goldman did not admit or deny the charges, but agreed to pay $550 million and admitted that it had failed to disclose certain information in its marketing materials. The S.E.C.’s inspector general had already begun investigating the suit in April, after Republicans in Washington suggested political motives may have been behind the timing of the S.E.C.’s decision to sue Goldman. Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, had asked Mr. Kotz to open an initial probe into the timing of the suit in April. The letter on Thursday which agreed to expand the probe to look at the settlement’s timing was also addressed to Mr. Issa. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times »</text></article>
