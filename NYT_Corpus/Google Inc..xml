It is one of the biggest tweaks to Google’s search algorithm, affecting about 35 percent of all searches. The new algorithm is a recognition that Google, whose dominance depends on providing the most useful results, is being increasingly challenged by services like Twitter and Facebook, which have trained people to expect constant updates with seconds-old news. It is also a reflection of how people use the Web as a real-time news feed — that if, for example, you search for a baseball score, you probably want to find the score of a game being played at the moment, not last week, which is what Google often gave you. “This is the result of them saying we need to find a way to more effectively get fresh content up,” said Danny Sullivan, editor of Search Engine Land and an industry expert. “It does help with the issue of people thinking, ‘Wow, if I need to find out about something breaking, I’ll go to Facebook or Twitter for that.’ ” Timeliness has long mattered to Google and its search results. Nevertheless, the company said that it always looks for improvements, and the latest change goes much further in freshening search results. Google tried once before to create real-time search, in 2009, when it introduced google.com/realtime, a service that incorporated Twitter posts that Google paid Twitter to use. But that contract expired in July and the two companies could not agree on terms to renew it, so Google disabled the site. Americans still turn to Google for two-thirds of their Web searches, but for people who want the latest chatter about events happening now, it competes with Facebook, Twitter and Bing, Microsoft’s search engine, which includes more Twitter and Facebook posts than Google does in search results. “The biggest source of the very freshest information is Twitter, and Google doesn’t have anywhere near the access to that kind of data as it had before,” Mr. Sullivan said. “But when people do those kinds of searches, they’re looking for a lot of reactions, looking for Twitter itself. So even with these changes, this doesn’t really solve that problem.” Google became dominant by finding archived Web sites and showing links to them. But today people sometimes expect years-old links, like the best banana bread recipe; week-old links, like the last episode of “Gossip Girl”; or seconds-old links, like this morning’s presidential campaign news. Google makes more than 500 changes to its algorithm a year, but most affect only a small percentage of results. With its new formula, which Google calls a freshness algorithm, Google tried to teach itself the difference between those types of requests, Amit Singhal, a Google fellow who works on search, wrote in a blog post announcing the changes. “Depending on the search terms, the algorithm needs to be able to figure out if a result from a week ago about a TV show is recent, or if a result from a week ago about breaking news is too old,” he wrote. “This algorithmic improvement is designed to better understand how to differentiate between these kinds of searches and the level of freshness you need.” Google last announced a significant change to its search algorithm in February, when it said it would raise the rankings of high-quality sites to fight low-quality ones, often described as content farms, that were flooding the search engine with mindless articles tied to popular search queries. The new formula, which affects search results globally but will not change nearby ads, will bring up minutes-old results for recent events, like an unfolding news story, and for recurring events like the Oscars or a political campaign. It will also show fresher results for topics that are often updated, like reviews of a new iPhone. It will understand that unlike breaking news, reviews from a few weeks ago are also useful, the company said. These are “queries we don’t think we’re doing perfectly well on,” said Rajan Patel, a Google software engineer who worked on the new algorithm. “We just realized that people expect Google to return the most up-to-date results for all kinds of queries, from hot topics to more general queries like a TV show.” For evergreen results, like recipes or how to change a tire, Google said the algorithm would know to show the best results no matter when they were posted. The algorithm uses technology that Google built last year in response to the greater speed at which people were publishing updates online. It is a Web indexing system it calls Caffeine, which crawls the Web more quickly, updating Google’s index of Web sites continuously instead of every couple of weeks. Thursday’s revision changes how Google ranks those links now that it has them in its index, Mr. Patel said. Google’s main competitor, Bing, has also developed a way to index Web sites that change often, like blogs and news feeds, and analyzes Twitter posts to identify popular topics, said Stefan Weitz, senior director at Bing. Mr. Patel said that Google planned to incorporate posts from Google+, its new social network, into its search results to further improve their freshness.</text></article>

DUBAI — When Hanan Abdel Meguid started her first technology company in Cairo nearly 20 years ago, the Web was not publicly available in the Middle East and many big global players like Microsoft did not operate there. Now, Ms. Meguid, 42, oversees OTVentures, one of the region’s largest technology companies, which operates in 17 countries and maintains exclusive partnerships with Facebook and Microsoft. “I started my first company with friends right after university because our dreams and our capabilities were much bigger than the opportunities in the market,” said Ms. Meguid, a mother of two. “A similar experience is happening for Arab youth today. I.T. is becoming a catalyst for change, not just a platform or business tool.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Ms. Meguid has a unique perch from which to view the change. As a serial entrepreneur in the early years of the Internet, she had to develop her own playbook, learning to raise money from venture capitalists, manage multiple technology platforms and strike deals with large international companies. They are lessons she is sharing with the next generation of start-ups by guiding young entrepreneurs on how to turn ideas into commercially viable businesses. “There are a lot of depressed young people in Egypt today not finding the right work opportunities, but we have to move away from this idea that when you graduate you must find a job with a multinational company to succeed,” said Ms. Meguid, who serves as a mentor for new advisory and seed investment programs including Tahrir2, Flat6labs and Google’s Ebda2 initiative. “You can have a dream, build on it and become a major contributor to your economy without being an employee.” Ms. Meguid ended up in technology by chance. In the early 1990s as a student at the American University in Cairo, she decided to major in computer science even though she had never seen a computer. After spending nights coding, she switched to economics to try something a little easier, but a year later went back to the field, one dominated by men. She got the idea for her first venture, Microlabs, while playing squash with a classmate, Khaled Bichara, during a college trip to Sharm el Sheik, an Egyptian town on the Red Sea. Ms. Meguid and Mr. Bichara wanted to work as programmers, but the two realized that there were no companies in Egypt to develop programs for the Windows platform. I.B.M., one of the few international technology companies in Egypt at the time, had only a sales office with no development capabilities. So they decided to start their own business. “By graduation, we were all so inspired we decided to create our own lab to develop applications on Windows,” Ms. Meguid said. “And we were good.” Microlabs got off to a quick start in 1993. With only $3,500 and three computers, they landed contracts to create accounting systems for big companies and won a competition to design a time-management software for the Egyptian government. But the venture started to sour a year later when Microlabs merged with a larger software company, Pie Practical Solutions. The two businesses began working together right away to migrate a software program to the Windows platform, expecting to take care of legal paperwork later that would formalize the combination. While the business took off, everything was still legally under the name of Pie Practical, and the Microlabs team was not entitled to any of the profits. “Our partners ended up taking over the company,” said Mr. Bichara, who is currently the president of a Russian mobile service provider, VimpelCom, and group executive chairman of Orascom Telecom, a global telecommunications firm that started operations in Egypt in 1998. “We learned the hard way from this experience.” After being pushed out of the merged entity, Ms. Meguid, who had registered Microlabs in her name, was stuck winding down the operations for what was left. It was a complicated process, given that the laws about liquidating a business and settling debt were unclear at the time. Even after she thought Microlabs had been shut down, she received letters six years later from government authorities asking for outstanding taxes. Wael Amin — one of the three founders of Microlabs who stayed on with Pie — said that the merged entity eventually went broke and dissolved. With the failure fresh in her mind, she opted in 1996 for a more low-key and stable position, developing Web sites for the Egyptian government. The government role gave her access to the Internet, which was not commercially available at the time. She recalls the first Web site she saw was Yahoo, which was updated once a day with the latest news. Eventually, she was tapped to run Web development for the government. The entrepreneurial spirit remained. A year later, she joined a start-up affiliated with Orascom Telecom alongside Mr. Bichara called Link Development. It took six months for him to persuade her to join, but Ms. Meguid eventually accepted the challenge because it provided freedom to develop “dream Web sites and services” and prepare for the day when the Internet would become a commercial success. Ms. Meguid, who became the chief executive of Link, began developing cultural Web sites like yallabina.com and partnered with Microsoft at the end of 1997. “Our work together goes beyond a business partnership; I consider her an adviser or coach because she calls us out on areas that we need to fix and improve,” said Ali Faramawy, president of Microsoft’s operations in the Middle East and Africa. “I’ve seen her steadily growing in confidence and in impact.” Her past mistakes have informed her current decisions. She paid extra attention to the legal process when Link merged with InTouch Communications in 2000 to form LinkdotNet. Her network also widened when LinkdotNet acquired eight established Egyptian Internet companies two years later. After Link sold part of the business to Mobinil for $130 million last year, Ms. Meguid took on the role of chief executive of the spin-off firm, OTVentures. “She is one of very few Egyptian women who has a good knowledge of technology and of business, so she is a great inspiration to mentees,” said Wael Fakharany, head of Google’s operations in Egypt. “She’s an icon in Egypt’s Internet world.” Ms. Meguid is adapting to the changing political environment in her home country. When the Egyptian revolution began in early 2011, many of Ms. Meguid’s clients cut their budgets. But the situation also heightened the awareness of social media and entrepreneurship, all of which she thinks will drive the technology industry in the region. “The revolution turned out to be a validation of our vision,” she said.</text></article>

    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/business/on-hulu-and-youtube-commercials-by-multiple-choice.html?ref=googleinc">On Hulu and YouTube, Commercials by Multiple Choice<date>Published: October 29, 2011</date><text>ON a television set, 10 feet away, commercials are often irritating.On a computer monitor, just inches away, they are often something else: downright invasive. Both Hulu.com and YouTube know that many of their viewers hate commercials, and yet their business models have depended mostly on advertising. So both have been trying to make online commercials more appealing. And both are headed in the same direction: offering online viewers the chance to choose which commercials they watch. This month, Hulu introduced a format that gives users the option of clicking an “ad swap” button after a commercial begins and choosing to replace it with one of two or three options. Don’t want to sit through an oil company’s commercial? Then go with one from a cellphone carrier or a razor maker. The system isn’t perfect. By the time users decide to go with an alternative, they may have already seen a good portion of the first ad. Beginning a second one means a longer commercial break. So why not delay starting an ad to let the user choose first? Hulu has tried precisely that with an older format it still uses. It found, however, that many users were annoyed by the process of having to choose or wait for a default choice. People were also not happy with choices that consisted only of three variations on one product, like shampoos tailored for fine, thick or curly hair. When presented with the newest ad format, Hulu users can elect not to click the button to swap commercials and instead continue to watch whatever is shown by default. “We didn’t want to make using Hulu a lot of work,” says Jean-Paul Colaco, its senior vice president for advertising. “Like Amazon.com’s 1-Click button, you don’t have to use it,” he says. (With 1-Click, users order an item immediately, without visiting a checkout page.) Those who log in as Hulu users are more likely to see commercials that interest them. Hulu notes users’ ad selections as well as feedback about a commercial if they answer a question that may be above the frame: “Is this ad relevant to you?” In generating revenue from advertisers, Hulu must make the most of its commercials because it typically shows only half as many minutes of ads for a given program as there would be on television. For a “half-hour” show, which actually runs 22 minutes, it shows four minutes of commercials instead of eight. But those four minutes may seem about as long as the eight because they include a commercial that plays even before the show begins, then three commercial breaks during the show — and there is no way to fast-forward as one could with a DVR. HULU offers other formats to advertisers, too. In one of them, viewers have this choice at the beginning: endure one 2 1/2 -minute ad at the beginning and be done with commercials, or watch as usual. Another format offers the option of playing a trivia quiz or a puzzle, sponsored by an advertiser, in order to earn a commercial-free viewing. Such trade-offs have not been enormously popular. Mr. Colaco says Hulu is concentrating on trying to match each user with the right ads and letting users fix the occasional mismatch for themselves by choosing an alternative. YouTube is also offering formats that give users an option, including one in beta testing that provides a choice of three commercials. It is being tried only on YouTube’s long-form videos, which run at least 10 minutes. The format has not yet attracted enough advertisers to be used with a significant number of videos; I tried but had no luck seeing it in the wild. For shorter videos, YouTube offers a “skippable” ad format. This allows a user to end the ad after five seconds — and no replacement follows. The program simply resumes. The advertiser is charged only when users have chosen to watch the ad. Baljeet Singh, a senior product manager at YouTube, said that when it first tried skippable ads, the skip rate was low — surprisingly low. So the skip button was made more prominent and the rate rose. This assured advertisers that viewers who stuck around did so by choice. Google acquired YouTube in 2006 and does not break out its financial performance. Hulu, which says it is profitable, is a joint venture whose owners include NBC Universal, the News Corporation and the Walt Disney Company. It is possible that Hulu may decide that free, ad-supported television simply isn’t viable. Last year, it introduced a subscription service, Hulu Plus, that is growing rapidly. For $7.99 a month, the subscribers have access to more episodes of shows, can watch the shows on portable devices and are exposed to fewer commercials, though still some. The company says the service exceeded one million paid subscribers this summer and expects its subscription services to account for more than half its overall revenue within the next 12 months. THEN there is another strategy: creating commercials that people actually look forward to watching. Consider last year’s Old Spice commercials, featuring Isaiah Mustafa as the Old Spice Man. In just two months, the videos of these ads set a YouTube record for shortest time for any program to reach 100 million views. (Sorry, Susan Boyle.) Every one of those 100 million views was by choice. Now, we await an idyllic future when every other commercial seen online is viewed voluntarily, too.ON a television set, 10 feet away, commercials are often irritating.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/business/media/youtube-plans-to-create-new-online-channels.html?ref=googleinc">YouTube Plans to Create New Online Channels<date>Published: October 28, 2011</date><text>YouTube, making an expensive bet on original content, is planning to create dozens of channels featuring comedians, sports stars, musicians and other entertainers, the company said on Friday.The channels will receive programming from a long list of media companies, including big television production companies like FremantleMedia as well as small start-ups like Maker Studios, YouTube said. “Today, the Web is bringing us entertainment from an even wider range of talented producers, and many of the defining channels of the next generation are being born, and watched, on YouTube,” Robert Kyncl, YouTube’s global head of content partnerships, wrote in a blog post. Parts of the plan have been well known in Hollywood for months. YouTube, a unit of Google, has made no secret of the fact that it wants to create an alternative to cable television on the Internet. It offered cash advances to prospective producers that totaled more than $100 million, according to people with knowledge of the plan who were not authorized to speak publicly. The investments in the channels reflect Google’s belief that the Internet is the third phase of the television business, after network TV (with a few channels) and cable TV (with hundreds). “We’re not going from three to 300 channels but to millions of channels,” Mario Quieroz, head of Google TV, said in a recent interview. “The Web is essentially infinite content.” Mr. Quieroz said that YouTube is not trying to compete with cable. “Like when the cable channels came to TV, we don’t believe the Web is going to replace linear TV,” he said. “This is designed to be complementary to cable TV.” But the six-year-old site has gradually set itself up as a hub for professionally produced, made-for-the-Web material, in addition to the torrent of amateur video that is posted daily. YouTube even bought camera equipment and editing software for some of its top producers. Those purchases, made in the form of grants, were described as a way to improve the quantity of TV-quality content on the site. The forthcoming channels will increase the number of shows that viewers can watch on big-screen TV sets as well as laptops and tablets. Some of the channels will come online in November, according to people involved in the productions, but many others will not be ready until 2012. The channels, like other professional content on YouTube, will be free for viewers and supported by advertisers. Rather than signing the top TV studios, which have so far been reluctant to offer Google free Web content, YouTube has recruited up-and-coming digital studios like Electus and Vice, as well as established brands like the Wall Street Journal, Thomson Reuters and WWE, the wrestling producer. Production companies associated with celebrities like Madonna, Rainn Wilson, and Shaquille O’Neal are also on YouTube’s list of participants, as are online video outlets like Demand Media and the TED Conferences.  “We’re looking for the next generation of MTVs, HBOs, just like cable,” added Rishi Chandra, the director of product management for Google TV. Earlier on Friday, Google announced a new version of Google TV, including a new version of YouTube that looked more like TV. Google also added easier search tools so people searching for cooking shows or sports events could see shows available on cable, YouTube or Web apps like those from Amazon.com, Netflix and HBO.YouTube, making an expensive bet on original content, is planning to create dozens of channels featuring comedians, sports stars, musicians and other entertainers, the company said on Friday.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/energy-environment/in-clean-tech-venture-capital-looks-for-problem-solvers.html?ref=googleinc">In Clean Tech, Venture Capital Looks for Problem-Solvers<date>Published: October 25, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCOSHELBY CLARK, the founder of a start-up called RelayRides, was honored last week as a rising star in clean technology. But as he took the stage alongside companies creating new kinds of energy, he felt out of place. RelayRides is a car-sharing start-up. Since when did encouraging people to drive carbon-spewing cars qualify as clean tech? In Silicon Valley, where venture capital dollars nurture fledgling technology companies, clean tech is getting a makeover. Many investors are shying away from the high risks and costs of creating new forms of energy. Instead, they are doing what they do best — using software to cope with problems, in this case caused by climate change. RelayRides, which lets car owners rent their vehicles to others, takes cars off the road because people can avoid owning them and the service’s users drive less than other people, Mr. Clark said. “You can have a major impact on an individual’s carbon footprint by re-creating business models or behaviors without inventing a new energy,” he said. This strategy has been percolating among some in Silicon Valley for a couple of years. But for many investors, doubts about alternative energy were confirmed last month when Solyndra, which made solar panel arrays and had raised more than $1 billion in venture capital and $528 million in government loans, filed for bankruptcy protection. “A lot of people see it as a symbol of what they do not like in green investments or government involvement in tech,” said Nathan E. Hultman, director of the environmental policy program at the University of Maryland and a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “If the V.C.’s pull back, then a lot of these companies are going to have to fold, or at least put their plans on hold. “This is a very familiar stage in the energy industry called the valley of death,” he said. Green tech investing had been declining even before Solyndra. Venture capitalists invested $891 million in 80 such start-ups in the third quarter, an 11 percent decline from $1 billion in 88 companies in the second quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Investors, accustomed to financing low-cost Web start-ups, had grown wary of spending the money needed to pay for basic research and build factories to produce energy. Adding to their caution is uncertainty over whether Congress will exact a carbon tax, an increase in natural gas production in the United States and the difficulty of competing with the established energy industry. But the Solyndra bankruptcy further spooked venture capitalists and particularly the pension funds, endowments and foundations that invest in venture capital, said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association. Investors, he said, would continue to shift from investing in alternative energy to investing in companies that cope with climate change by, for example, using software to make buildings and cars more efficient. Venture capitalists are on track to invest $275 million this year in start-ups that make software and other technologies that conserve energy or manage its use, up from $234 million last year and $104 million in 2009. “Capital-intensive companies that take long cycles to create things, whether they’re solar voltaic cells or giant wind turbines, are not very scalable, so those are really tough businesses to imagine as venture-funded opportunities,” said Bill Maris, managing partner at Google Ventures. His firm has invested in RelayRides and other start-ups that stretch the definition of clean tech investing. They include the Climate Corporation, for extreme weather insurance; Clean Power Finance, which runs an online marketplace for financing residential solar panels; and Transphorm, which makes tools that reduce power loss when electricity is converted in data centers or industrial motors. “It’s tech companies that are applying their technology to this industry,” Mr. Maris said. “Those are the kinds of companies we tend to really understand and like.” At first glance, companies like the Climate Corporation, which insures rural farmers, seem to have nothing to do with either technology or climate change. But David Friedberg, a Google veteran who is the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said its goal was “to help all the world’s business adapt to and understand climate change.” For farmers, that means analyzing “crazy big data,” Mr. Friedberg said, from weather stations, government data feeds, soil moisture models and Doppler radar images. The Climate Corporation simulates the weather for the next two years and runs a Web site where farmers can enter their location and crop, buy insurance coverage and automatically receive payments for bad weather. Soybean farmers in the Dakotas were recently paid for delayed planting because of an unusually rainy spring, and wheat farmers in Oklahoma and Texas were covered for a intense drought. 1 2 Next Page »SAN FRANCISCO</text></article>

Microsoft and Google are both weighing whether to participate in the bidding. Each has its own business reasons for wanting to see the continued existence of Yahoo, which despite its financial struggles still has a monthly audience of almost 700 million unique visitors. But there's one thing the technology giants have in common: Not one of them wants to actually buy or run Yahoo. Instead, Microsoft and Google are considering lending financial support to private equity firms or others weighing a bid, according to people briefed on the matter. Microsoft is the furthest along, having held discussions with a number of leveraged buyout firms, these people said. Under one possible combination, Microsoft would chip in billions of dollars in financing as part of a consortium led by the private equity firm Silver Lake and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, three of these people said. That group would be backstopped by billions of dollars in bank financing as well. Google, for its part, has had conversations with two private equity firms about backing a takeover, according to another person briefed on the matter. Such discussions are in the early stages and may not lead to a bid, this person said. Representatives for Microsoft, Google, Silver Lake and Yahoo declined to comment on any potential bidding. While nearly every major private equity firm has been conducting some preliminary due diligence on Yahoo, potential suitors have been trying to sort out what bids would look like before they sign nondisclosure agreements with Yahoo to officially pore over its books, according to people briefed on the matter. These people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about confidential deal negotiations. But what has become apparent is that the private equity firms would be focused on turning around the company, while a deep-pocketed backer like Microsoft or Google would supply capital. A crucial Yahoo adviser, Allen &amp; Company, has told potential bidders that they should focus on how to improve the company's core North American operations and not worry about the divestiture of the company's huge holdings in the Alibaba Group of China and Yahoo Japan. Players like Microsoft and Google are primarily interested in what they could reap from teaming up with Yahoo. Yahoo's news arm reported 81.2 million unique visitors in August, making it the biggest online news site. Microsoft already has in place a wide-ranging agreement with Yahoo: Its Bing search engine fetches answers to user queries, while Yahoo's sales force sells ads against those results. Microsoft may also push to integrate its newest acquisition, the Internet communications company Skype, into Yahoo. With a deal, Google could eventually wrest Yahoo away from Microsoft when their partnership expires. By doing so, the company could provide its own search technology and use its DoubleClick display advertising subsidiary to service Yahoo's advertising inventory, this person said. Google could also use Yahoo to promote its other offerings, like the Google Plus social network. However, it is unclear whether a Google-Yahoo partnership would pass antitrust scrutiny. The two companies previously discussed forming an advertising alliance in 2008, only to see the talks founder amid likely opposition by the Justice Department. Still, even if Google considered the regulatory challenges insurmountable, it could participate in the bidding process to help drive up the price, to frustrate its rival. News of Google's discussions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online. Such discussions are expected to play out over a matter of weeks or even months. Yahoo's board is still weighing whether to sell the company outright, accept a minority investment, or do nothing. Yahoo's board has named the chief financial officer, Timothy Morse, as interim chief executive while it searches for a permanent leader after having ousted Carol A. Bartz last month. Meanwhile, potential buyers are speaking to former Yahoo executives about taking an operational role should they succeed in taking over the company. One possible point of contention is price. Private equity firms have indicated they are unwilling to pay much more than Yahoo's current market value of $20 billion, arguing that the stock price already includes the expectation of a sale, according to people briefed on the matter. Many of the potential suitors for Yahoo have contacted Alibaba's chairman and chief executive, Jack Ma, looking to gauge his interest in working with them, these people said. The agreement that governs Yahoo's 40 percent stake in his company gives Mr. Ma what some analysts have said is a kingmaker role. Alibaba is also in discussions with Yahoo about buying back its stake on its own, separately from any takeover of Yahoo as a whole. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print. PHOTO: Jack Ma, the chief executive of Alibaba, of which Yahoo owns a 40 percent stake.

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/technology/24iht-nokia24.html?ref=googleinc">Crucial Test for Nokia as Latest Smartphones Arrive<date>Published: October 23, 2011</date><text>BERLIN — When Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, introduces the company’s first phones bearing Microsoft Windows Phone software Wednesday, he will probably be met with equal parts good will and skepticism. On the one hand, many mobile operators are pulling for Nokia and Microsoft to succeed, creating a credible third smartphone lineup that they can use to leverage better terms from Google and Apple, which in four years have taken over the high-end mobile business. On the other, the partnership with Microsoft was struck while Nokia, the erstwhile market leader, was under duress, undertaking an 18 percent cut to its work force. The company absorbed combined losses of €436 million, or $597 million, in the second and third quarters. Worst of all, since the deal was made in February, Nokia has had to tread water as engineers combined the companies’ smartphone technologies, allowing Google, Apple and Samsung to secure their positions in the pecking order. As a result, Nokia’s share of the global smartphone market has fallen by nearly half, to 15.5 percent in September from 27.5 percent in December, according to International Data Corp., an information technology research firm. “The road back for Nokia is going to be a long one,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst in London for International Data. “There is a risk that they are too late to the party.” At a conference in London on Wednesday, Nokia intends to present at least two new phones, one aimed at high-end users and one for the midrange mass market, people with knowledge of the presentation said. Time is not an ally for Nokia in the fast-moving smartphone segment of the mobile market, which now accounts for more than half of all cellphone sales in North America and Western Europe. For Nokia, the decision to abandon its own Symbian operating system in favor of Windows Phone came at a price. Operators quickly reduced their stocks of all Symbian devices, both smartphones and basic phones, hurting Nokia’s bread-and-butter business. Nokia’s share of the overall global cellphone market fell to 24.5 percent in September from 30.7 percent in December, according to International Data. On Thursday, when the company reported a €68 million loss for the third quarter, which was smaller than some investors had expected, Mr. Elop spoke of the “many important steps ahead in our journey of transformation.” “With each step,” he continued, “you will see us methodically implement our strategy, pursuing steady improvement through a period that has known transition risks, while also dealing with the various unexpected ups and downs that typify the dynamic nature of the industry.” For Mr. Elop, a former Microsoft executive who made the decision to enter the alliance, and for Nokia, the success or failure of the collaboration will be a defining event. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst in London with the technology research firm Gartner, said Mr. Elop so far appeared to be delivering on his promise to turn Nokia around. The company’s upgrades this year of Symbian, Symbian Belle and Symbian Anna were tangible improvements that showed Nokia could innovate on the fly. Nokia released the N9, considered its best smartphone to date and a product of the now-defunct alliance with Intel, to positive reviews. Sales of two new dual-SIM devices, the C2-03 and C2-06, helped Nokia lift sales of basic phones 8 percent in the third quarter. Gartner is predicting that Nokia and Microsoft will succeed, gaining 20 percent share in the smartphone market by 2015. While that would still be below Nokia’s peak, it is a lot better than where it is now. “I am not sure if success is a given,” Ms. Milanesi said. “Their major issue will remain brand and making both Nokia and Microsoft sexy enough for consumers.” Nokia must succeed at the top and middle ends of the smartphone business to reclaim a leadership position, said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics in Milton Keynes, England. Profit margins for top-end devices, like Apple’s iPhone, are about 36 percent, Mr. Mawston said. For midrange devices, the gains are much smaller, from 1 percent to 15 percent. “The top end is where the biggest revenue and profit pools lie,” Mr. Mawston said. “The volume is at the low- and midtier.” Mobile network operators are hoping that Nokia-Microsoft smartphones will sell well, because that will help them command lower prices from Apple and the makers of Google’s Android phones for their models, Mr. Mawston said. “Apple’s iPhone is widely perceived among operators as being overpriced, but Apple is so popular that operators can’t reduce the price they pay for it by even a small amount,” he said. Nokia is expected to introduce the first new Microsoft devices in places where it already has a relatively strong market share, like Western Europe. It hopes to build momentum and positive reviews and take the devices to the United States, the world’s largest smartphone market. There, Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is helping Nokia of Finland open doors to the four largest U.S. operators, which control more than 90 percent of all cellphone sales. Nokia’s North American market share in smartphones in the third quarter was only 1.2 percent, according to International Data. Microsoft’s share of the global smartphone software market was not much bigger: 2 percent, globally. While Internet access is rapidly shifting from traditional desktop and laptop PCs to mobile devices, Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, can still fall back for the time being on its dominant Windows licensing business. That is why Nokia, which makes most of its money selling cellphones, has much more at stake in the collaboration than Microsoft, analysts said. But the venture is also crucial to Microsoft, which despite several attempts on its own has largely failed to gain a foothold in the software business for mobile devices. “I think given Microsoft’s dominant position in fixed and portable keyboard computing, Nokia is not their final chance, but it is probably one of their final chances to enter this market,” Mr. Mawston said. “They probably won’t get too many goes after Nokia.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: October 25, 2011 An article on Monday about Nokiaâs pending introduction of smartphones bearing Windows Phone software misidentified the smartphone that resulted from Nokiaâs now-defunct alliance with Intel. It was the N9, not the N8.BERLIN — When Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, introduces the company’s first phones bearing Microsoft Windows Phone software Wednesday, he will probably be met with equal parts good will and skepticism. On the one hand, many mobile operators are pulling for Nokia and Microsoft to succeed, creating a credible third smartphone lineup that they can use to leverage better terms from Google and Apple, which in four years have taken over the high-end mobile business. On the other, the partnership with Microsoft was struck while Nokia, the erstwhile market leader, was under duress, undertaking an 18 percent cut to its work force. The company absorbed combined losses of €436 million, or $597 million, in the second and third quarters.

But they will eventually show up, said Vic Gundotra, Google’s senior vice president in charge of Google+. Tony Avelar/Bloomberg NewsSergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, responded to a memo from a Google engineer trashing Google+. “We’re in an enviable position where people come to Google,” Mr. Gundotra said. “Over time your network will show up.” He spoke Wednesday at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco along with Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, onstage and later at a press conference. The conversation, which centered on Google+, also covered the latest Android phones, cars that drive themselves and Mr. Brin’s new role at the company. Though incumbent social networks like Facebook have a clear advantage because users are already there, Mr. Gundotra said, Google has a different advantage: most people visit Google every day, so Google constantly has the chance to lure them to Google+. For instance, people who signed up in July, when Google+ was first released to a select group, stopped using it because their friends weren’t on the network, but started again last month when it opened to the public because they saw alerts on other Google products notifying them that their friends had joined. “Our strategy is not to win by just users who come to Google+,” Mr. Gundotra said. “It’s to activate the users of existing Google services like search, Maps and Android.” He also took a swipe at Facebook’s recent efforts to promote automatic sharing of things like songs people are listening to. “We do not believe in over-sharing,” he said. “There is a reason why every thought in your head does not come out of your mouth. We think a core attribute to be human is to curate, in how others perceive you and what you say.” While Facebook now shows the songs users listen to on Spotify, he doesn’t want anyone to know he listens to Britney Spears, Mr. Gundotra said. By the end of the year, Google+ will work with more Google products, he said, so when someone wants to share a YouTube video, for instance, it will be easy to share it with a Google+ Circle directly from YouTube. The integration between Google+ and Google Apps will happen in the next few days, he said. “When we’re done, Google is going to come across as a beautifully integrated set of services,” Mr. Gundotra said. Other changes to Google+ are coming soon, too. People will eventually be able to use pseudonyms on the service, Mr. Gundotra said for the first time, after its policy requiring real names raised complaints. First Google must overcome the technical hurdles and figure out how to prevent anonymous comments from cluttering the site. After Mr. Gundotra made the announcement, he said he received many Google+ messages, mostly from women, who said they wished Google would continue to require real names. Google+ users can also expect custom profile addresses and brand pages. Software developers have been complaining that they cannot yet build apps for Google+, but they will have to keep waiting, Mr. Gundotra said. He said he wants to avoid making the mistakes that other companies made, indirectly referring to Twitter, by inviting developers to build apps and then competing with them. Mr. Brin showed off the Galaxy Nexus, the new phone unveiled Wednesday that uses the latest version of Google’s Android software, called Ice Cream Sandwich. It represents a turning point for Android, Mr. Brin said. “It’s so pretty,” he said. “I feel like they finally had the maturity and platform to pay attention to the finer aesthetics and features.” Since Larry Page, Google’s other founder, took over as chief executive in April, Mr. Brin has been tasked with special projects. He loves his new job, he said, because he gets to explore technical issues that he didn’t have time for before. He spends a day a week with Google executives, two days on infrastructure projects and two days on advanced research projects, like cars that drive themselves. He wouldn’t reveal the other projects, except to say that one will be introduced by the end of the year. “Where I spend my time is on farther-afield projects, which we hope will graduate to important key businesses in the future,” Mr. Brin said. He also responded to the memo that a Google engineer accidentally made public on Google+ that trashed the service, calling it “a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership.” Mr. Brin said he had seen the very long post, “but I didn’t make it past the first 1,000 pages.” “I would advise those who write memos to share them appropriately,” he said. “Also, if you want to get a point across to a large audience, try to confine it to a paragraph or so. Sometimes I use it as a nighttime aid now.”</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

Now a consortium of small labels has buried the hatchet with YouTube through a licensing agreement that will allow them to collect advertising revenue when their songs are used in videos on the site. The deal was announced on Wednesday by YouTube and Merlin, the consortium, which represents about 1,400 independent labels around the world. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. With the new deals, the independents will finally be able to take part in a revenue source long enjoyed by the major labels and music publishers. Through its ContentID system, which recognizes the music used in any video — whether a professional film or a wedding party with the bride’s favorite song playing in the background — YouTube can split some of the ad revenue with the song’s copyright owners. Some of the biggest indies, like the Beggars Group and Merge Records, have already had deals with YouTube, although they are also Merlin members. The Beggars Group releases music by acts like Vampire Weekend and Sonic Youth, and Merge’s bands include Arcade Fire. The Merlin deal comes a few days after YouTube unveiled a set of features to help do-it-yourself musicians sell merchandise, concert tickets and other goods through the site.</text></article>

What exactly does the “I’m Feeling Lucky” button in Google Picasa do to make pictures look better? A. The “I’m Feeling Lucky” button in Google’s free Picasa photo-editing software automatically analyzes the image and adjusts the picture’s contrast and color. (Other photo programs have similar “enhance” buttons for one-click improvements.) Changing the contrast usually makes the image seem a bit sharper by increasing the difference between the points of color in the file. If the contrast is adjusted properly for a particular image, it might “pop” a little more and help make the subject or other elements in the photo’s composition stand out better. Adjusting the color within an image is another method for making the picture look better. Many photo programs in addition to Picasa offer tools to adjust the saturation and balance of color — which can make the image look richer, brighter and better. Picasa’s “I’m Feeling Lucky” button has its fans, but its powers may not work consistently on all your photos. Google has a help guide for using Picasa’s “Basic Fixes,” as well as links to the program’s controls for more fine-tuned editing here.</text></article>

But can mobile ever be as big a business as desktop search? Google says it will, and that mobile is on track to contribute $2.5 billion of its revenue in the next year, or about 7 percent. But some analysts question whether it could ever catch up with desktop search. People might use mobile phones as much as or more than computers, they say, but they use them differently – which means doing less comparison shopping and clicking on fewer ads. “Overall search activity is shifting toward mobile devices, but the preponderance of search activity on mobile devices is not monetizable,” said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “I am worried that Google doesn’t have the same strategic position in an untethered world that it does in a world dominated by desktops and laptops.” He was speaking on his mobile phone on the train, after he had called his local pizza place to order dinner. He used Google to look up the name and number of the restaurant and made the call – and Google was paid nothing. On a computer, though, he might have clicked on an ad for the pizza place or researched other nearby pizza places. Searching and clicking behavior is different on mobile phones partly because of the small screen size and partly because cellphone users are in a different frame of mind, said Roger Barnette, president of IgnitionOne, which tracks digital advertising data. “When searching something on mobile, it’s a very specific query they’re looking for and a very specific answer,” he said. “They’re less likely to be navigating in a discovery mode.” Still, new kinds of ads like local coupons, which Google is already offering, change that equation. If Mr. Rohan had looked up his local pizza place and seen an ad offering loyalty points for making a purchase or an ad with a discount for another restaurant nearby, he might have clicked. But advertisers tend to pay less for mobile ads than for desktop ads. Google wants to improve that over time, said Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising at Google, on a conference call with analysts. “We see a lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow mobile,” she said. For example, advertisers can build mobile landing pages for people who click on their ads and Google is improving its algorithm for showing ads, she said. Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, said that Google was taking a long-term view in turning mobile into a big business. “It’s still very early in the mobile business,” he said. “And you see that it’s an incredibly exciting business. There’s a lot of activity. We’ve done well by having a long-term view on that.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/technology/default-choices-are-hard-to-resist-online-or-not.html?ref=googleinc">Default Choices Are Hard to Resist, Online or Not<date>Published: October 15, 2011</date><text>IN the wide-open Web, choice and competition are said to be merely “one click away,” to use Google’s favorite phrase. But in practice, the power of digital distribution channels, default product settings and traditional human behavior often matters most.In a Senate hearing last month about Google, Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief executive of Yelp, pointed to that reality in his testimony. “If competition really were just ‘one click away,’ as Google suggests,” he said, “why have they invested so heavily to be the default choice on Web browsers and mobile phones?” “Clearly,” he added, “they are not taking any chances.” Indeed, Google made a big bet early in its history: In 2002, it reached a deal with AOL, guaranteeing a payment of $50 million to come from advertising revenue if AOL made Google its automatic first-choice search engine — the one shown to users by default. Today, Google pays an estimated $100 million a year to Mozilla, coming from shared ad revenue, to be the default search engine on Mozilla’s popular Firefox Web browser in the United States and other countries. Google has many such arrangements with Web sites. Most economists agree that Google’s default deals aren’t anticompetitive. Rivals like Bing, the general search engine from Microsoft, and partial competitors like Yelp, an online review and listing service for local businesses, have their own Web sites and other paths of distribution. Choice, in theory, is one click away. But most people, of course, never make that single click. Defaults win. The role of defaults in steering decisions is by no means confined to the online world. For behavioral economists, psychologists and marketers, defaults are part of a rich field of study that explores “decision architecture” — how a choice is presented or framed. The field has been popularized by the 2008 book “Nudge,” by Richard H. Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago and a frequent contributor to the Sunday Business section, and Cass R. Sunstein, a Harvard Law School professor who is now on leave and is working for the Obama administration. Nudges are default choices. In decision-making, examples of the default preference abound: Workers are far more likely to save in retirement plans if enrollment is the automatic option. And the percentage of pregnant women tested for H.I.V. in some African nations where AIDS is widespread has surged since the test became a regular prenatal procedure and women had to opt out if they didn’t want it. A study published in 2003 showed that while large majorities of Americans approved of organ donations, only about a quarter consented to donate their own. By contrast, nearly all Austrians, French and Portuguese consent to donate theirs. The default explains the difference. In the United States, people must choose to become an organ donor. In much of Europe, people must choose not to donate. Defaults, according to economists and psychologists, frame how a person is presented with a choice. But they say there are other forces that make the default path hard to resist. One is natural human inertia, or laziness, that favors making the quick, easy choice instead of exerting the mental energy to make a different one. Another, they say, is that most people perceive a default as an authoritative recommendation. “All those work, and that is why defaults are so powerful,” says Eric J. Johnson, a professor at the Columbia Business School and co-director of the university’s Center for Decision Sciences. THE default values built into product designs can be particularly potent in the infinitely malleable medium of software, and on the Internet, where a software product or service can be constantly fine-tuned. “Computing allows you to slice and dice choices in so many ways,” says Ben Shneiderman, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland. “Those design choices also shape our social, cultural and economic choices in ways most people don’t appreciate or understand.” Default design choices play a central role in the debate over the privacy issues raised by marketers’ tracking of online consumer behavior. The Federal Trade Commission is considering what rules should limit how much online personal information marketers can collect, hold and pass along to other marketers — and whether those rules should be government regulations or self-regulatory guidelines. Privacy advocates want tighter curbs on gathering online behavioral data, and want marketers to have to ask consumers to collect and share their information, presumably in exchange for discount offers or extra services. Advertisers want a fairly free hand to track online behavior, and to cut back only if consumers choose to opt out. New research by a team at Carnegie Mellon University suggests the difficulty that ordinary users have in changing the default settings on Internet browsers or in configuring software tools for greater online privacy. The project, called “Why Johnny Can’t Opt Out,” has just been completed and the results have not yet been published. Forty-five people of various backgrounds and ages in the Pittsburgh area were recruited for the study. To qualify as research subjects, they had to be frequent Internet users and express an interest in learning about protecting their privacy online. Each was interviewed for 90 minutes, and each watched a video showing how online behavioral advertising works. Then, each person was given a laptop computer and told to set privacy settings as he or she preferred, using one of nine online tools. The tools included the privacy options on browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, and online programs like Ghostery and Adblock Plus, as well as Consumer Choice from the Digital Advertising Alliance. The privacy tools typically proved too complicated and confusing to serve the needs of rank-and-file Internet users. “The settings they chose didn’t block as much as they thought they were blocking, often blocking nothing,” says Lorrie Faith Cranor, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon who led the research. Ms. Cranor says the research points to the need to simplify privacy software to few choices. “If you turn it on, it should be pretty privacy-protective,” she says. “The defaults are crucial.”IN the wide-open Web, choice and competition are said to be merely “one click away,” to use Google’s favorite phrase. But in practice, the power of digital distribution channels, default product settings and traditional human behavior often matters most.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/travel/fine-tuning-your-flight-search.html?ref=googleinc">Fine-Tuning Your Flight Search<date>Published: October 12, 2011</date><text>LAST month, Google introduced the first version of its new flight search feature (Google.com/flights) and the response has mostly focused on what it does not offer. Right now, it can search only for round-trip tickets for select domestic destinations. And while it is much faster than other travel search engines, it does not display fares from all the airlines that serve a particular route.Sean Carlson, a Google spokesman, said the current flight search is only an “early look” at what is in the pipeline and that more options will be added as engineers integrate technology from ITA Software, which Google bought earlier this year. Though Google’s debut may have been premature, its foray into flight search has shaken up the competitive landscape, which is good news for travelers. One notable change is that travel search engines are finally moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach to booking a flight, and are building tools that answer specific questions about different types of trips. Here are some of the most pertinent queries that search engines are currently taking on. WHAT IS THE TICKET PRICE, INCLUDING BAG FEES? Most search engines give you only the price of a ticket. But escalating fees for baggage, preferred seats and other extras have made some passengers wish they could see the total cost of a flight. Kayak.com has a fix — at least for the cost of checked luggage. On the left side of the fare results page, a link allows users to “Add baggage” to the fares Kayak has found. “You can enter the number of bags you’re going to check, and we will instantly reprice all of those flights for you,” said Robert Birge, Kayak’s chief marketing officer. Although Kayak does not display fares from Southwest — which allows two free checked bags but does not share its fare data with other Web sites — this feature makes Kayak a good choice if you are going to check a bag when you fly. IS THE TRAIN LESS EXPENSIVE? Hipmunk.com, a travel search engine that made its debut last year, automatically includes Amtrak prices and departure times when you search for flights on a route that is also served by the train. Adam Goldstein, one of Hipmunk’s founders, said that is an especially popular feature for trips between Boston, New York and Washington, but that it also appeals to people traveling on other short routes, like Chicago to Milwaukee or Seattle to Portland. Hipmunk even highlights which trains have Wi-Fi, and its bar graph interface makes it easy to compare travel times and prices: the time bar stretches from the departure time to the arrival time for each flight and train. Hipmunk is known for taking a more visual approach to presenting information (rather than showing a long list of flights), but other travel sites, including Google, are experimenting with maps and graphs as well. WHEN IS THE CHEAPEST TIME TO TRAVEL? Most travel Web sites now allow users to search for fares on dates close to the ones you initially input, so you can potentially save money by shifting your itinerary by a day or two. But for some trips — like a weekend visit with a friend — you may want to be even more flexible, looking for the cheapest time to travel in the next month or more. My favorite site for this type of search is ITA Software’s Matrix search tool, which lets you select an option called “See calendar of lowest fares.” Once you enter the earliest date you can travel and the number of nights you want to stay, a calendar shows the lowest price for each departure date in the next month. One drawback of using ITA Software is that it does not sell tickets; you have to recreate your itinerary and buy it through the airline or another site. But Google offers a similar feature if you click the not-so-obvious calendar icon after you enter your itinerary (it’s a gray square below the route map). Say you entered a three-night itinerary — a bar graph appears showing the price of a three-night trip for each departure date in the next six months. As you scroll down through each date, your trip is also highlighted on a calendar, so you can easily scan the cheapest Friday departures. Although Kayak and other sites also offer versions of the flexible search option, Google’s calendar stretches out farther, its results are quicker, and its interface is better. Once Google’s flight selection is more comprehensive, its flexible search will be tough to beat. WHERE CAN I GO WITHIN MY BUDGET? One area travel sites have been slow to address is what Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group, calls the dream phase of vacation planning. “Not everybody knows where they want to go when they start thinking about a trip,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “I think this is where the future of flight search is going to be.” He pointed to Kayak’s explore feature (kayak.com/explore) as a model; it lets you enter your departure city, travel season, budget and maximum flight time and then displays a map showing where you can go within those parameters. Although the airfares displayed above each city are subject to change after you choose a travel date, this feature is a good way to discover destinations you might not have considered, like comparing various islands in the Caribbean. Google also has a version of this feature; a route map is displayed when you search for flights, showing prices for major cities and adding other destinations as you zoom in. But Google’s current flight data limitations make that feature less useful for now. WHEN’S THE BEST TIME TO BOOK? Microsoft’s Bing flight tool (travel.bing.com) does the best job of helping travelers decide when to book by presenting a “buy now” or “wait” recommendation above the results when you search for a flight. Although those predictions can be hit or miss, Bing’s “fare history” link shows the average low and the recent price history for the route you entered, so you can gauge whether you are getting a reasonable fare. That is especially useful if you are flying somewhere new and have no idea what a ticket should cost. Kayak offers a similar option (“Show fare charts”) in the left margin of its search results, but its link is easy to overlook — a design challenge as sites add new tools. “There’s a really tough balance here in terms of how much information to present,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “But you have to make it easy for customers to discover what they want.”LAST month, Google introduced the first version of its new flight search feature (Google.com/flights) and the response has mostly focused on what it does not offer. Right now, it can search only for round-trip tickets for select domestic destinations. And while it is much faster than other travel search engines, it does not display fares from all the airlines that serve a particular route.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/google-reports-strong-earnings-topping-expectations.html?ref=googleinc">Google Reports Strong Earnings and Exceeds Expectations<date>Published: October 13, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — Google showed on Thursday that it was making money from people searching online with their mobile devices, providing evidence that it could follow users wherever they searched the Web.Google, which presented quarterly earnings that easily surpassed analysts’ expectations, reported that revenue climbed 33 percent and net income rose 26 percent. Although it does not typically break out revenue from different types of ads, it said mobile was on track to generate more than $2.5 billion in revenue in the coming year and grew 2.5 times in the last year. “When I look back over the last quarter, the word that springs to mind is ‘gangbusters,’ “ Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, said in a call with analysts after the earnings were announced. “It’s not bad for a 13-year-old,” he said, referring to Google’s age. “We are also seeing a huge positive revenue impact of mobile,” he said. Google, which makes the Android mobile operating system and offers mobile search, apps and ads, has nearly 100 percent market share in mobile search and is investing heavily in mobile. But until now, it offered little detail on how much mobile ads and Android, which it gives handset manufacturers free, contribute to revenue. The announcement should appease those analysts concerned about whether Google’s search business would keep up its steady rate of impressive growth. More searches are being done on mobile phones, where people are less likely to click on ads and the ads tend to cost less, and advertisers are spending more money on display and social ads instead of search ads. Almost all of Google’s revenue comes from advertising and the vast majority from search advertising. “The quantification of mobile revenues gives us an indication that Android is cementing Google’s position in mobile advertising,” said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “Google’s ability to diversify away from the parts of its businesses that are maturing is impressive.” Last week, Stifel Nicolaus downgraded Google stock from buy to hold, citing concerns about a slowdown in search. “The paid search industry is maturing and slowing down, without a doubt,” said Roger Barnette, president of IgnitionOne, which provides digital marketing data. “Advertisers have other options that they haven’t had before.” Nikesh Arora, Google’s chief business officer, said that its desktop business maintained momentum and that Google.com grew faster than a year ago. Google’s financial report also showed that desktop search advertising continued to chug along. That provided some comfort to shareholders and analysts who have been spooked by Google’s charging ahead with aggressive hiring, new businesses and high-priced acquisitions, like its $12.5 billion bid for Motorola Mobility. On Thursday, Google said it hired 2,585 people in the third quarter, up from 1,526 new people in the same quarter a year ago, bringing its total to 31,353. The third quarter was its second-highest quarter ever for hiring recent college graduates. “I don’t love a lot of the things that Google’s doing, but their core business is a powerhouse,” said Colin W. Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners. “When they bust out revenues above expectations, all the sins are forgiven.” Such worries about expenses — along with concerns about continuing antitrust investigations, competition from Facebook and deteriorating economic conditions — have caused Google’s share price to drop 8 percent this year. But in after-hours trading, shareholders responded favorably to the earnings report, as shares rose 6 percent. Google also highlighted the growth of several of its newer businesses. Google+, its social network and Facebook competitor, has 40 million users who have uploaded 3.4 billion photos, Mr. Page said, and Google plans to begin incorporating it into other Google products. Chrome, its browser, has 200 million users, and people have activated 190 million Android phones. Google so far seems to be mostly sheltered from the slumping economy, which has hurt other Web sites and publications that rely on advertising. Still, Mr. Barnette said, if the economy continues to suffer advertisers could cut back or move in greater numbers to new kinds of ads. “Growth going forward will more closely mimic the overall economic industry and ad budgets in general,” he said. Clicks on ads on Google and other Web sites increased 28 percent over the same quarter last year and 13 percent over the second quarter this year, Google said. The amount Google was paid for clicks increased 5 percent over last year, but decreased 5 percent over the second quarter of this year. An increase in paid clicks often corresponds with a decrease in the amount paid for those clicks, said Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president for advertising at Google. The increase in mobile searching could also have caused a decrease in the cost per click, because mobile ads tend to cost less than desktop ones. Mr. Gillis said consumers spent more time comparing prices and made purchases less often. Google has seen some softness in ad sales in Western Europe because of its economic struggles, Mr. Arora said. The North America business has been stable, and business in Australia, India and Brazil has been growing rapidly, he said. Google reported net income for the period ending Sept. 30 of $2.73 billion, or $8.33 a share, up from $2.17 billion, or $6.72 a share, a year ago. Excluding the cost of stock options and the related tax benefits, Google’s third-quarter profit was $9.72 a share. Analysts had expected $8.74 a share. The company said revenue was $9.72 billion, up from $7.29 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue, which excludes payments to ad partners, was $7.51 billion, up from $5.48 billion, above analysts’ expectations of $7.2 billion.SAN FRANCISCO — Google showed on Thursday that it was making money from people searching online with their mobile devices, providing evidence that it could follow users wherever they searched the Web.</text></article>

Second<date>October 6, 2011, 1:37 pm</date><text>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images 2:45 p.m. | Updated Correcting the photo of the indicator light on the Mac laptop. If you walked into the office of almost any chief executive and asked him or her to describe a favorite font, I’m pretty sure you would be greeted with a blank stare and silence. If you asked Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, you had better make yourself comfortable: Mr. Jobs was passionate about typography and would have described, in great detail, the intricacies of a single serif. That is what made Mr. Jobs’s products feel so impeccable. He didn’t just pore over spreadsheets, personnel issues and revenue numbers, as most C.E.O.’s are expected to do. He thought about design, too. In fact, he went beyond thinking about it. He obsessed over it — every curve, every pixel, every ligature, every gradient. In his widely noted commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005, Mr. Jobs explained where this design passion came from, describing a typography class he attended after dropping out of college: “Because I had dropped out and didn’t have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can’t capture, and I found it fascinating. “None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.” His focus on the little things like the “space between different letter combinations” was a constant from the development of the Macintosh to the iPhone, which was released more than 20 years later. This is what separated Mr. Jobs, as a chief executive, from everyone else. When Mr. Jobs resigned as Apple’s chief executive in August, Vic Gundotra, senior vice president for engineering at Google, posted an account of an exchange with Mr. Jobs before the introduction of the iPhone. Mr. Gundotra said Mr. Jobs had called him on a Sunday morning with an “urgent issue, one that I need addressed right away.” Mr. Jobs said: “I’ve been looking at the Google logo on the iPhone and I’m not happy with the icon. The second O in Google doesn’t have the right yellow gradient. It’s just wrong and I’m going to have Greg fix it tomorrow. Is that O.K. with you?” The hundreds of designers who had been involved in the iPhone development didn’t notice that the shading in a yellow O might have a slightly incorrect gradient. But Mr. Jobs did. But the greatest example of Mr. Jobs’s attention to detail and design can be found in the little millimeter-sized glowing light that appears on every MacBook Laptop. The light, known as a sleep indicator, glows when the laptop is closed, or sleeping. Competing laptops have this feature too, but Apple’s is different. screenshot via Apple.com The sleep indicator light on MacBook laptops glows at the pace of a breathing adult. The Mac sleep indicator is timed to glow at the average breathing rate of an adult: 12 breaths per minute. As with the space between typographic letter on the Macintosh, only Mr. Jobs could pay attention to such detail. Correction: An image with an earlier version of this post was included in error. A correct MacBook laptop image of the sleep indicator light has been substituted.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/google-opens-pop-up-shops-for-a-hands-on-chromebook-experience/?ref=googleinc">Google Opens Pop-Up Shops for a Hands-On Chromebook Experience<date>October 6, 2011, 10:07 am</date><text>GoogleA Chrome Zone, a pop-up station for using Google Chromebooks, in the Virgin America terminal at San Francisco International Airport. When Google introduced Chromebooks, laptops running its Chrome operating system, it showed a promotional video with the tagline, “Ready when you are.” It was an acknowledgment that it would take some time for consumers to adjust to a computing world in which they do everything in a browser, meaning no desktop software and no hard drive storage. Slowing adoption even more was the fact that Google only sells Chromebooks online — at Amazon.com and BestBuy.com in the United States — so people must be willing to spend $350 or more on a new device without playing with it first. Now Google is trying to speed things up with pop-up stations in airports and stores that give people the chance to get their hands on Chromebooks. The effort comes as Google is runs a nationwide ad campaign on TV and online to promote the Chrome browser. Virgin America, which has been hosting Chrome Zones, the name for the testing stations, in airports in San Francisco, Dallas, Boston and Chicago, recently decided to keep the stations open through January 15 and expand to more airports. Dixons, a consumer electronics and appliance retailer in Britain that sells Chromebooks online, opened a pop-up shop in its London store and plans to open more. The Ace Hotel in New York also offered Chromebooks to guests. At first, Google figured that only tech-savvy people would buy Chromebooks online, and that selling them on the shelves of stores would confuse people who did not understand the difference between a Chromebook and a typical laptop. But now it is ready to educate the masses. “The vast majority of laptops are bought in physical stores, so that was a deliberate challenge,” Lily Lin, a Google spokeswoman, said about Google’s decision to sell Chromebooks online only. “But people need to spend some time with them to understand the concept, so this is a testing ground in a retail environment.” At Virgin America terminals, flyers can use Chromebooks in the airport and ask for help from Google’s so-called Chrome ambassadors. They can also check out a Chromebook to use on the plane with in-flight Wi-Fi and return it when they arrive at the next airport. Google does not sell the computers in airports. Chromebooks store nothing on the computer — users work using cloud-based services like Gmail, Google Docs or Picasa — and people can browse the Web incognito, so the next user will not be able to view their activity. Google declined to say whether it has seen an uptick in Chromebook sales since it opened the pop-up stations. But Ms. Lin said that tens of thousands of people have used Chromebooks in airports and that Google and Virgin America frequently lend the maximum number of computers, which is capped on flights because of the availability of in-air bandwidth.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

Jobs and Eric E. Schmidt at a 2006 Macworld conference in San Francisco, when a partnership to provide Google software on an Apple iPhone was announced. Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google and a longtime friend and competitor of Steve Jobs, says Mr. Jobs’s influence may yet be seen in new ways. “This is a man whose impact is equal to any global leader,” he said. “He very much wanted to live and have a third act” beyond Apple’s founding and its revival. As for whether that impact may grow through the wealth he leaves behind, Mr. Schmidt said, “it is not for me to characterize” what will happen with Mr. Jobs’s fortune. “All of that will unfold,” he added. “I will say that he was a very thoughtful person, and he cared a lot about the world.” Mr. Schmidt knew Mr. Jobs for decades and did business with him while Mr. Schmidt was at Sun Microsystems and Mr. Jobs was starting the computer company NeXT. He was also a member of Apple’s board from 2006 to 2009. “The NeXT thing was really important” in Mr. Jobs’s life, Mr. Schmidt said. “It helped him think in whole new ways, how to lead and innovate.” NeXT was purchased by Apple in 1996, bringing Mr. Jobs back into Apple after his dismissal in 1985. While an Apple board member, Mr. Schmidt said, he had extensive dealings with Tim Cook, now Apple’s chief executive. “The culture of this company is strong, and it will continue,” he said. “Tim was an extremely good operational executive, and he will move to preserve the culture.” “He is not an ordinary executive,” Mr. Schmidt added. Mr. Schmidt left Apple’s board when Google’s entry into both mobile communications and computers — with, respectively, the Android and Chrome operating systems — presented numerous business conflicts between the two companies. “I learned an attention to style and quality” while sitting on Apple’s board, he said. “The board would see a lot of demos. Steve had a real level of pride in what they were producing.” Since that time, there have been reports in The Times and elsewhere of open discord between the two men and their companies. Mr. Schmidt, however, denied any such personal enmity. “We understood it was a possibility when I joined the board,” he said of the business conflicts. “We had adult conversations about it at the beginning and the end. “All those reports in the press were wrong,” he added. “After I left the board, they had me to events and to private dinners.”</text></article>

Chances are someone was showing off an application — perhaps using Shazam to identify a song or shaking his phone to serve up restaurant recommendations on UrbanSpoon. Those novel and quirky apps, and many more, have helped Apple sell hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPod Touches and iPads around the globe. Now, here’s another question. When is the last time someone showed off an app to you? Apple has long cultivated a devoted following of fans who are obsessed with its products. But as Google and its Android operating system nip at the company’s heels, it becomes ever more crucial that Apple still be able to dazzle consumers — and a new hardware design may no longer be sufficient. Siri, analysts say, may be the answer. Siri acts as a virtual personal assistant that uses a combination of artificial intelligence and natural language processing to perform tasks like scheduling appointments and helping users figure out whether or not they need an umbrella. If it’s as impressive as early reports seem to suggest, it could be the feature of the otherwise fairly predictable iPhone 4S that, when experienced firsthand, will help the phone gain a solid footing among consumers whose attention and eyes might otherwise drift to a Google-powered phone. “The software enhancements are becoming more and more critical because we’ve ultimately settled on the current form factor,” said Roger Entner, founder and analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s a slab of glass with a little bit of plastic around it. How much can you innovate on that?” Siri, he said, “transforms how you interact with your phone, and that is a huge differentiator for Apple.” Voice recognition technology certainly isn’t new, and neither are virtual personal assistants. Siri was available as a stand-alone app before Apple acquired it last year. But the full integration into a phone’s operating system, where the software can start to learn about the daily habits of a user, could help recreate the early wonder of playing with an iPhone. It could even have a trickle-down impact on the entire phone ecosystem — much as the App Store did. “The other phones will now look dumb if they don’t have an assistant, too,” said Mr. Entner.</text></article>

Tuesday’s iPhone unveiling didn’t have as much to do with Apple as it did with Google. And in regards to Google, Tuesday’s announcement was, to quote the rapper Diddy, “All about the Benjamins.” It’s no secret that Google and Apple are currently embroiled in a smartphone war. According to the latest numbers by several research firms that track smartphone sales, twice as many Android devices are currently being activated each day as Apple devices. Analysts have repeatedly said that one of the main reasons people opt for Google’s Android over Apple’s  iOS is the price of the phone. “The Android phone is available on almost any carrier at almost any price,” said Charles Golvin, an analyst for Forrester Research specializing in mobile technology. “And now the big growth in the smartphone space is not coming from people that need a new phone every three weeks. It’s your brother or your cousin or your aunt.” This means that Apple needed to compete with Android in the same way. To do this the company had to offer a high-end phone that is very Applesque, complete with the slickest new features and software: the iPhone 4S, which starts at $200 and goes as high as $400. In addition, the company needed to offer iPhones for the masses: the iPhone 3GS, which is now free. All of these prices are valid with a two-year contract with the carrier for wireless service. The iPhone may have lacked a new design, but the broad pricing plan represented the first time Apple had used this strategy for its phones. “Just like Apple built a product portfolio for the iPod that allowed anyone to get an iPod, no matter how much money they had, it’s the same now, if you want an iPhone,” Mr. Golvin said. “There’s everything from the high-end version to the free one.” Apple has also streamlined the cost of building the iPhone. The iPhone 4S uses a chip that will work globally across all carriers. This means Apple can manufacture a smartphone that will work on Sprint, Verizon and AT&amp;T in the United States, and a long list of others abroad. This will bring huge savings to Apple, which in the end will help Apple compete with Google globally.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/04/technology/apple-iphone-faces-divided-loyalties.html?ref=googleinc">Apple iPhone Faces Android, and Split Loyalties<date>Published: October 3, 2011</date><text>SAN FRANCISCO — As soon as Apple unveils its highly anticipated new version of the iPhone on Tuesday, millions of people are likely to start plotting how to be among the first to buy it. But millions more may be considering a competitor — an Android phone.Despite all the hoopla surrounding the Apple announcement, more people buy smartphones running Google’s Android operating system than buy Apple phones. Android’s share of new smartphone sales is now more than double Apple’s share, a striking change from a year ago, when the two were roughly even, and a reflection of how Android phones have improved and become more broadly available. In this altered competitive landscape, any new phone from Apple will have to stack up favorably against the most popular Android phones. Even app developers, many of whom once devoted all their energy to building for the iPhone, now have more divided loyalties. “The more the Android platform matures, the more it becomes a real competitor,” said Mike Novak, an Android engineer at GroupMe, a group messaging service that has over a million users. “It’d be foolish not to support both Apple and Android.” Yet Apple, by many measures, still remains the smartphone player to beat, with better profits from the business, huge influence among mobile app makers and innovations that rivals scramble to copy. Apple is expected to introduce a new iPhone with a variety of slick new features, but the product could also get a lift from an old-fashioned distribution deal. Apple has struck a deal with Sprint Nextel to offer the new iPhone to its customers, according to a person with knowledge of the deal who was not authorized to speak about the arrangement. The agreement could help blunt some of the distribution advantages that have helped propel Google’s Android into more and more smartphones. Until now, Apple phones have been available in the United States only on AT&amp;T and Verizon. Apple also faces another big challenge in releasing a new iPhone: it has to top itself. It must show it can still deliver enough of the cutting-edge features that have made the company a trend-setter. “They set the bar,” said Phil Libin, the chief executive of Evernote, a start-up that makes a mobile note-taking app, who said he had no knowledge of Apple’s new phone. “Android and other devices have had to catch up.” Analysts widely expect the new iPhone to include a faster microprocessor for running applications at a greater speed, along with a more powerful camera. Some have speculated that Apple might finally include big improvements in the voice recognition capabilities of the new phone using technology the company acquired when it bought Siri, a start-up, last year. Some have also speculated that Apple might introduce more than one phone, including one with fewer new features that could sell for $99 with a carrier contract. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment before Tuesday’s event, which is to take place at Apple’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. In the second quarter, handsets running the Android system accounted for 43.4 percent of worldwide smartphone sales, compared with 18.2 percent for Apple, according to the research firm Gartner. During the same period last year, the two companies were roughly neck-and-neck, with Android and Apple holding 17.2 percent and 14.1 percent of the market, respectively. For both companies, growth in market share has come at the expense of technology laggards like Symbian, the mobile software backed by Nokia, and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, rather than each other. Despite its smaller share of the market, Apple earns outsize profits. Thanks to its comparatively healthy profit margins, Apple had about half of the operating profits in the mobile handset business in the first quarter of the year, even though its sales accounted for only 4.9 percent of the phones sold, according to a recent report by the analyst Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity. Apple could get a boost from its new relationship with Sprint, which may have a card up its sleeve to lure customers — its unlimited mobile data plan. That plan allows cellphone users to gorge themselves on streaming media services like Spotify and Netflix, without worrying about accidentally going over the monthly allotment. AT&amp;T and Verizon both have monthly limits on the data its iPhone customers can consume. A Sprint spokesperson declined to comment. Android’s surge in the market means app developers are splitting more of their time between the competing phone systems. Mr. Novak, the engineer at GroupMe, who also helps organize a monthly gathering in New York for Android developers, said Apple would need to impress developers, as it did with the iPhone 4, if the company hoped to persuade them to stay committed to the iPhone. “It really comes down to the wow factor,” Mr. Novak said. “Without that, it leaves the door wide open for whatever announcements Google plans to make.” Adam Goldstein, a founder of a flight search engine called Hipmunk, said the company decided to release a version of its mobile application for Android earlier this month after watching the popularity of the platform grow. “We definitely did the iPhone first,” he said. “But requests kept coming in from the Android side.” Mr. Goldstein said the company was dividing its programming resources equally between Android and Apple phones.SAN FRANCISCO — As soon as Apple unveils its highly anticipated new version of the iPhone on Tuesday, millions of people are likely to start plotting how to be among the first to buy it. But millions more may be considering a competitor — an Android phone.</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/microsofts-patent-strategy-against-android/?ref=googleinc">Microsoft's Patent Strategy Against Android<date>October 3, 2011, 12:20 pm</date><text>When Samsung Electronics blinked last week, Microsoft scored another win in its campaign to strike patent-licensing deals with the makers of smartphones and tablets using Google’s Android software. Samsung, the largest maker of Android products, will pay Microsoft an undisclosed fee for every smartphone and tablet it makes that uses Google’s free operating system. Previously, Taiwan’s HTC, the second-largest maker of phones using Android, struck a patent-licensing deal with Microsoft. Free, it seems, has its costs. Google sees Microsoft as the ringleader in a shady cabal of competitors – “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents,” David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post. Not surprisingly, Microsoft views things differently. In an interview last Friday, Brad Smith, the company’s general counsel, said what is happening with patents in the smartphone market is merely a rerun of similar episodes in the past. When Microsoft moved beyond personal computers into corporate, data-center computing, it licensed technology from its predecessors in the business market. In the last decade, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft has paid $4.5 billion in licensing fees to companies including I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle), Cisco and Silicon Graphics. “That’s the way the industry works and has always worked,” Mr. Smith said. The rise of the smartphone has added a new layer of patent licenses for the cellphone business. The first layer – or “stack” of technology – was the basic radio technology for cellular communication. The largest patent beneficiary in the radio layer is the leader in that technology, Qualcomm. The company collects about $20 on every smartphone produced, Mr. Smith estimates. The second layer was media technology, allowing music and video to play on modern smartphones. Those patent-licensing fees are about $3 to $5 a phone, and go to a variety of companies, Mr. Smith said. The next layer, he said, is the software layer – the computing operating systems that animate smartphones. The companies that have been working on that technology for years, like Apple and Microsoft, went first and developed software ideas that Android builds upon, according to Microsoft and Apple. And Android uses Java software technology, developed by its Sun unit, Oracle contends. The inventors, Mr. Smith said, deserve to be compensated through reasonable patent royalties. Their claims have stirred controversy, he concedes, but he points out that was true as well of Qualcomm’s initial efforts to charge licensing fees for its radio technology. “We’re seeing a licensing regime emerging for the software stack,” Mr. Smith said. Google says the Microsoft campaign is not just bad for Android, but bad for the industry and consumers as well by substituting litigation and patent deal-making for innovation. Mr. Smith disagreed. “Patent-licensing regimes allow companies to build on the shoulders of others,” he said. “It allows companies to use technology and ideas, after paying reasonable fees. They can spend their resources on new ideas instead of trying to figure out ways to invent around the work done by others. In that way, patent-licensing is very much pro-innovation.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/03/two-ipad-cases-and-a-screed/?ref=googleinc">Two iPad Cases and a Screed<date>October 3, 2011, 8:57 am</date><text>What could be simpler than an iPad case? A company just sent me two that raise that question and illustrate a tenet of design that hardware and software makers seem to be forgetting. It is the importance of simplicity. Take, for example, the two iPad covers I recently received from Joby, makers of those clever GorillaPod tripods with the bendable legs. One of its cases is a stand using the classic GorillaPod legs; the other is a folding aluminum cover that converts into a stand. The Yogi iPad case from Joby. The case with the articulated legs, the GorillaMobile $40 Yogi for the iPad 2, has the legs attached to a plastic back that snaps onto the tablet. You can bend the legs so the iPad can stand on a desk or uneven surface, or it can be wrapped around a lamp or what have you. There is a direction booklet with basically one direction: how to disconnect the legs. The Ori The other case is the Ori, a $70 aluminum composite case which folds origami-like into several configurations and rotates so you can see your screen in portrait or landscape orientation. The Ori’s instruction book takes several pages to describe how to set the case into its different formations. In fact, some directions are right on the case itself, which shows that Joby knows you are likely to need continuing help. But here’s the problem. When an iPad case requires instructions to operate it, you are on the wrong track. I’m not saying that it takes an advanced degree to use the Ori. With a bit of study and practice, it’s a nifty case. It’s not that much work, but should an iPad case require any work at all? It’s the same problem with Facebook’s recent reboot. In an apparent attempt to add features that reviewer’s applauded in Google+, Facebook made changes that weren’t self explanatory. Facebook users were incensed. Of course, people always balk at changes, but this time the volume and ferocity were unprecedented because the new version was just much to intuit. Another reboot is due shortly, which is supposed to make Facebook easier to use again. So here is the thing, designers and developers. We understand that there is a constant tug of war between adding new features and keeping products simple – we get that. But while adding lots of features is really great, it is even better when we can figure out how to use them without a lot of guidance. As a photographer told me about the learning required with each new iteration of editing software, “I don’t want to have to get the equivalent of a Ph.D. every 18 months.” And if you force re-education on us, please save it for the big items, not entertainments like Facebook and accessories like iPad stands. C’mon designers, do some more work on your end so we can do less on ours.</text></article>

I know Photoshop lets you edit pictures, but what about searching and organizing? Also, are there any basic programs that do facial recognition — can I identify someone once and it automatically tags that person in all the pictures? A. Adobe Systems makes different versions of its flagship image-editing software. These include its $700 Adobe Photoshop program aimed at industry professionals, and the more moderately priced $100 Adobe Photoshop Elements version designed for home photography enthusiasts. In addition to being a less expensive option for image editing, Adobe Photoshop Elements includes an organizer function for sorting pictures. The program also has a facial-recognition feature that automatically analyzes your photos for familiar faces so you can sort the pictures by who is in them. If you want to see the software in action, Adobe has a video on how its “people recognition” feature works. There is also a free 30-day trial version of the recently released Adobe Photoshop Elements 10 for Windows or Mac OS X. While the software scans your photo collection for familiar faces and suggests name tags for people you have labeled during the setup process, you still may have to verify the suggested tags with a few mouse clicks. Most programs that offer facial recognition also create individual photo albums for each name in your collection — so you can find all the photos of a particular person in one place. Other photo programs offer facial recognition, too. These include Apple’s iPhoto for Mac OS X (a video tutorial on its Faces feature is here); the current version of Google’s Picasa for Windows and Mac OS X; and Fotobounce for Windows and Mac OS X (fotobounce.com; free with ads or $49 without ads).</text></article>

Bezos, chief executive of Amazon, with the new  Fire tablet. Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, was on a roll. Moments earlier, he had unveiled the Kindle Fire, Amazon’s newest mobile device, a sleek and chic tablet with a full-color touch screen. By all accounts, the presentation had been a hit, setting off a wave of congratulatory Tweets. Now he was making himself comfortable in a private room for one-on-one interviews. He poured himself a cup of coffee and settled back to chat. Mr. Bezos deftly answered a handful of questions, none of which seemed to rattle his composure — not those about whether the Kindle Fire could challenge the iPad, nor even queries about recent articles exposing harsh working conditions at an Amazon distribution center. He pointed to Amazon’s previous statements on that issue, and when pressed for his own reaction, he just stared evenly for a few beats. Cool as a cucumber. But then things got interesting. The point was raised that although the Kindle Fire is built on Android, like many other tablets, there was no visible signifier that the tablet was at all powered by Google. No Google-branded e-mail, Web search, maps, anything. Mr. Bezos nodded, saying that to the average consumer, the Fire’s software would be “unrecognizable as Android.” “We used the open-source code directly and built on top of that,” he said. “So it’s really our own thing.” Mr. Bezos added that the company would be “happy to partner” with Google to ensure that the Fire software would work smoothly with new Android releases. But when pressed about whether his company had been in talks with Google during the development of the Fire, he grew uneasy. “You’d have to ask someone else,” he sputtered. “I don’t know.” An Amazon spokesman, Andrew Herdener, said on Thursday that the companies had not collaborated. Shari Doherty, a spokeswoman for Google, said the company was happy that Amazon chose Android as the software for its tablet but declined to comment further about the Fire. Amazon was not required to work with Google to use its software, which Google gives away. But in this case Amazon had a reason to be secretive about its tablet plans — and Mr. Bezos may have a reason to be jittery when the subject of his company’s relationship with Google comes up. Amazon is jumping into the browser wars, putting it in competition with Mozilla, Microsoft and, of course, Google, which has been pouring resources into Chrome. But it is going a step further with its Silk browser by acting as a middleman between the Fire and the Web sites a user wants to visit, saying it will use its powerful cloud computing resources to speed up delivery of Web pages. Chris Espinosa, the eighth hire at Apple and a senior engineer at the company, tossed out a theory this week that Amazon wants to take a bite out of Google, using a tablet built on Google’s own software. “Fire isn’t a noun, it’s a verb, and it’s what Amazon has done in the targeted direction of Google,” he wrote in a post on his personal blog. “This is the first shot in the new war for replacing the Internet with a privatized merchant data-aggregation network.” Mr. Espinosa points out, as other savvy tech writers have in the days since the Fire was unveiled, that there are some serious security and privacy implications to the Silk browser. Because its users’ Web traffic is piped through Amazon’s servers, it may give Amazon unique insight into the Web clicks, buying patterns and media habits of Kindle Fire owners. “Amazon now has what every storefront lusts for: The knowledge of what other stores your customers are shopping at and what prices they’re being offered there,” Mr. Espinosa continued. “What’s more, Amazon is getting this not by expensive, proactive scraping the Web, like Google has to do, they’re getting it passively by offering a simple caching service.” Perhaps the data collected could be another way for Amazon to subsidize the cost of its hardware, allowing it to undercut rivals on price. Your average Internet service provider already has access to such data, and the mobile Opera Mini browser uses a similar technique. But Amazon is expected to sell as many as five million Kindle Fires right off the bat. This could make the Fire an interesting kink in Google’s plans to use Android to help it sell mobile advertising and build a dominant presence on mobile devices.</text></article>

That question was a matter of debate at Zeitgeist, a Google conference this week in Paradise Valley, Ariz., where Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and chief executive, said that Google had a responsibility to improve media. The question came up when Ted Koppel, the longtime broadcast journalist, complained that too much news was drivel, as reporters cover the Casey Anthony trial instead of life-and-death issues in Africa. People are being fed the news they want instead of the news they need because that makes news organizations money, he said. Nicholas Thompson, a senior editor at The New Yorker, then asked Mr. Koppel if Google should tweak its algorithm to deliver people the news they need instead of entertainment-as-news. “That wouldn’t be a bad idea,” Mr. Koppel said. To be clear, Google has said many times that its algorithm presents users with the most relevant search results and does not exercise editorial control, so the question is likely to remain no more than a matter of debate. It reiterated that this week, after Rick Santorum said he thought Google should remove a dirty joke that showed up in searches for his last name. Still, Mr. Page said that Google could do a better job of getting people to focus on certain issues, though he did not address Mr. Koppel’s statement directly. “I see this as our responsibility to some extent, trying to improve media,” Mr. Page said. “If you ask anyone about how that information’s going to be propagated, what you’re going to focus on, I think it could work a lot better than it does now.” “We as an Internet community, we have a responsibility to make those things work a lot better and get people focused on what are the real issues, what should you be thinking about,” he said. “And I think we as a whole are not doing a good job of that at all.” Google has taken small steps toward editing search results for content. In February, for example, it changed its algorithm to weed out Web sites that it thinks have subpar articles and videos, like content farms, a move that affected 12 percent of search queries.</text></article>

Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/world/middleeast/all-aboard-google-bus-seeks-start-up-ideas.html?ref=googleinc">All Aboard: Google Bus Seeks Start-Up Ideas<date>Published: September 28, 2011</date><text>DUBAI — A bus branded with the Google logo will be traveling across 10 governorates in Egypt starting this week, including stops at universities in Cairo and Alexandria, scouting for the next generation of technology entrepreneurs with homegrown ideas on the scale of Facebook or LinkedIn.“We will put someone’s dream through a seven-month crash course that will help turn it into a commercially viable business,” said Wael Fakharany, Google’s manager in Egypt. “We have been working on this concept for nine months. We had signed a contract with the Egyptian government in 2009 to invest in the country’s Internet ecosystem and this is part of that commitment.” Google’s new initiative, Ebda2, which means “Start” in Arabic, is the latest in a string of seed and mentorship programs designed to support the wave of entrepreneurial ventures sweeping across Egypt. The revolutionary spirit that had youth demanding job creation and speaking out about their political concerns through social media has also encouraged them to start online businesses, experts say. “We are at a very important transition point socially and culturally, and this empowering sense of throwing off the shackles will be a big driver of economic growth,” said Ahmed Al Alfi, founder and chairman of the venture capital firm Sawari Ventures, who will be a mentor at Ebda2. “Young tech graduates had three options before: work for a multinational like Microsoft, or the government, or start a business with friends. The change is that more people are now considering the last option first.” This year alone, incubators, angel-investor networks, and mentorship and seed investment programs like Alexandria Startup Weekend, Tahrir2, PlugandPlayEgypt.com and Flat6labs.com have cropped up to provide necessary support for young, local entrepreneurs. Similarly, Google’s Ebda2 plans to provide 1.2 million Egyptian pounds, or about $200,000, in seed capital to bring a winning business idea to the market. “Small entrepreneurial ventures will help create the ecosystem for entrepreneurs and investors in tech, which will lead to more jobs,” said Samih Toukan, founder of the Arabic e-mail service Maktoob.com, which was sold to Yahoo in a landmark $175 million deal in 2009 to become Yahoo!Maktoob. “Especially now in Egypt, there is a feeling of excitement and new beginnings,” Mr. Toukan said. “But what is lacking is support from investors and the government. We need to create the right framework to make it easy for people to set up businesses and secure financing.” That is what Ebda2 sets out to do. During the eight-month project, Egyptian entrepreneurs will go through a screening process based on a specific set of criteria laid out by an independent judging panel of experts from various industries. The entrepreneurs will also receive mentoring and coaching from industry professionals and executives. After designing the concept, Google has handed the program over to Science Age Society, a local nongovernmental organization, and InnoVentures, a local tech incubator, for execution in order to maintain impartiality — for example, for entrepreneurs who choose to work with domains other than Google. Entrepreneurs can submit tech business ideas in areas like cloud computing, digital advertising, e-commerce, as well as mobile applications, location based applications and Arabic content. “In the stage that we’re in, the ecosystem that endorses entrepreneurs is still being put together — everything from funding, to starting a company easily, to getting exposure,” said Hanan Abdel Meguid, chief executive of the technology company OT Ventures, who will serve as a mentor at Ebda2. “The pieces are slowly coming together and we need to create more momentum.” “We have so many brilliant people working at multinationals, why not encourage them to create their own companies that can go global?” Ms. Meguid started her first company in 1993 and failed, only to try again with a new venture in 1996 that succeeded. Her current company operates MsnArabia.com across the region and is an exclusive partner with Facebook for the Middle East and North Africa. “I go into a lot of boardrooms and find myself the only woman at the table — this is something I am particularly looking forward to discuss in this initiative,” she said. “I want to mentor women on how to create the right impressions and overcome prejudices.” Ms. Meguid is one of 112 mentors who have signed up with Ebda2, alongside 47 Google employees. Over the next month, applications will be accepted online as well as during the road show, after which judges will select 200 candidates with whom to work. Fifty candidates will develop a working business model with mentors and 20 will be selected as finalists until a winner is granted $200,000 in seed money in May. The winner will be chosen based on innovation, potential for impact and job creation, skill set, well-designed business model and potential for revenue, organizers say. “I’ve worked with a number of programs like this before and witnessed weak participation, which was always a big surprise,” Ms. Meguid said. “Somewhere was rooted the belief that this is a corrupt process, so why bother and give up my secure job? The presence of Google in the mix makes it legitimate, it is a brand that is trusted by youth.” Mr. Fakharany, the manager of Google’s Egypt office, who now spends 70 percent of his time on this initiative, is planning a follow-up program after the close of Ebda2 in May 2012. After gathering enough data and market research from this pilot program, he hopes to replicate Ebda2 in every governorate. This is the first time that Google has rolled out such a program, anywhere in the world. “What we’re seeing in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt is that power structures that we once considered immovable have proved vulnerable. Now, there is a need for economic opportunity to improve the lives of families,” said Shervin Pishevar, managing director of the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures in Silicon Valley, who frequently visits the Middle East in search of opportunities. “That’s where the movement of entrepreneurship will become a huge factor for the future of the Mideast.”DUBAI — A bus branded with the Google logo will be traveling across 10 governorates in Egypt starting this week, including stops at universities in Cairo and Alexandria, scouting for the next generation of technology entrepreneurs with homegrown ideas on the scale of Facebook or LinkedIn.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/qa-keeping-google-earth-spinning/?ref=googleinc">Q&amp;A: Keeping Google Earth Spinning<date>September 29, 2011, 6:01 am</date><text>Q. Google Earth was working fine for a while, but has been crashing a lot and showing a distorted picture on the screen lately. Is this a memory issue with Windows XP? A. Google Earth is a wonderful program for exploring the world, but it does require a certain amount of memory, network speed, hard-drive space and a compatible graphics card to run properly. On Windows XP, the bare minimum amount of memory needed to run it is 256 megabytes, but 512 megabytes or more are better. You also need a 3D-capable graphics card with at least 64 megabytes of video memory and DirectX 9; more memory is better, as Google outlines in its system requirements page for Google Earth. If Google Earth was working fine at first, the current issues may be due to a problem with the program’s own memory cache. Deleting the cache file often resolves a number of behavioral glitches, so you may want to try that step first. Google has a guide for dumping the cache on a Windows machine, on its site, as well as instructions for clearing the Google Earth cache on a Mac. Turning off the Atmosphere layer within the Google Earth program itself may also help. You can do this by going to the View menu and selecting the Atmosphere option to deactivate it. If none of that works, Google has a whole list of other suggestions to try in troubleshooting crashes and graphics issues with Google Earth on Windows, Mac and Linux systems.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/for-advertising-study-says-more-screens-are-better/?ref=googleinc">For Advertising, Study Says More Screens Are Better<date>September 28, 2011, 2:12 pm</date><text>12:59 p.m. | Updated The conventional wisdom deems that many consumers may become confused or overwhelmed when ads are aimed at them on different screens in multiple media. However, according to new research from Nielsen, which was commissioned by Google, marketers may benefit from such cross-platform exposure. As part of the research, consumers visiting the CBS TV City Media Lab at MGM Las Vegas were asked to look at content on a TV set, a computer, a smartphone and a tablet. During the test, a video ad that ran 15 seconds, pitching a premium-priced sports sedan, was shown in different permutations. Some people did not see any video ads, while others saw the video ad on various combinations of screens. According to the research report, the ability to remember the automotive brand behind the video ad – and engage with the car being advertised — increased significantly when multiple screens were involved. For instance, the report finds, in the group that saw the video only on TV, 50 percent recalled the brand being peddled. In the groups that saw the video ad on all four kinds of screens, 74 percent remembered the brand name. Twenty-two percent of the members of the group watching the video on TV were able to recall that the car was a four-door sedan, according to the research. When the video was watched on four screens, that figure increased to 39 percent. Also, according to the report, people who saw the video on four screens almost always had more positive opinions about the car compared with those who watched only TV, in categories like reliability and power. “This research demonstrates the positive incremental value of multiple exposures across multiple platforms,” says a summary of the report that Google and Nielsen plan to release on Wednesday. The report is titled “Better Together: Examining the Incremental Utility of Cross-Media Campaigns.” Three of its authors are from Nielsen and one is from Google. Google has been active lately in providing marketers with information about consumer behavior as digital media become more prevalent. For instance, a post this week on the Google Mobile Ads blog presents data about the use of tablets, PCs and mobile devices for searches during the course of a work day. According to the data, consumers use computers and smartphones for searches throughout the work day; smartphone use increases during commuting times and in the evenings. And the use of tablets for searches “spikes dramatically” in the evenings, according to the blog post. “If you are an advertiser, you might be wondering which is the best screen to reach your customers on,” the post concludes. “The answer is: All of them. These screens are better together.”</text></article>

But amid the clamor of seminars and after-hours parties, some of those same companies will also be hosting prominent events on their home turf, made possible by a recent flurry of office expansions. “This will really be our first industry opportunity to truly showcase all our space,” said Wayne Powers, senior vice president for advertising sales at Yahoo, which has just opened offices in the Viacom building in Times Square. “It’s always been a great event to connect with our clients and all the agencies, but this will be the first time where we’ll be able to use our offices to do client entertainment and to set up meetings. For us, that’s a big deal.” While Silicon Valley’s most formidable Internet behemoths have leased office space in New York since the 1990s, their rapidly shifting partnership with Madison Avenue has driven the move from back-office cubicles to elaborately designed corporate suites intended to impress advertisers. While Palo Alto, Calif., remains a hub for computer engineers, New York has surged as a location for the virtual world’s unsung marketing and sales divisions, with Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Apple all expanding in the city since 2010. Andrew Roos, a vice chairman at Colliers International who has brokered leases for a number of digital media start-ups across New York, said one thing that those large Internet giants have in common with smaller companies is an overwhelming need for advertising dollars. “The goal for all these companies will always be one of two things: either to become very profitable or to go public and monetize,” he said. “Most will lose money, of course. But no matter the goal, to even dream of being profitable, the currency they trade in will always be advertising. To be a contender, they need to be here.” Before partly relocating last month to a 50,000-square-foot three-story suite at 1540 Broadway, at West 45th Street, Yahoo’s marketing, sales and account management divisions in Manhattan operated from 111 West 40th Street, a space that, while larger, did not lend itself to receiving or wooing clients. Yahoo will keep that space. The Times Square suite has purple-hued conference rooms, a lobby with custom graphics and door pulls shaped like exclamation points, and a dynamic design that befits a high-tech company. “This gives us the ability to be forward-facing with our clients,” Mr. Powers said. “Now we’re able to bring the experience we created on the West Coast to the New York area. That’s versus having to literally take a day or two of getting our clients to the West Coast, which is what we had to do until last month.” When Facebook signed its deal for 335 Madison Avenue in late June, officials at the social network not only relocated from offices across the street, but doubled in size and moved forward with a redesign that incorporated the upstart flair of the headquarters in California. The company’s new office evokes a kind of romanticized view of a Silicon Valley start-up, including an open bar, video games and threadbare couches that reflect the dorm-room sensibilities of the roughly 100 employees who work there. “When you get to that critical point in terms of the number of employees,” said Carolyn Everson, the vice president for global direct sales, “we like to have a look and feel similar to how Facebook looks and feels in Palo Alto and Singapore and London. And with this market — where we’re all on Madison Avenue and entertaining and meeting with clients every day — we wanted to have a proper presence. And we just weren’t able to do that in the limited space that we had across the street.” 1 2 Next Page »Next week, when 60,000 people in marketing and communications are expected to descend on New York for Advertising Week, some of the world’s largest tech companies will be taking center stage.</text></article>

Israel’s national museum and Google are behind the project, which put five scrolls online on Monday. The scrolls include the biblical Book of Isaiah. Google’s technology allows surfers to search the scrolls for specific passages and translate them into English. The scrolls available online were purchased by Israeli researchers between 1947 and 1967.

    <article index="7" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/googles-biggest-threat-is-google/?ref=googleinc">Google's Biggest Threat Is Google<date>September 27, 2011, 7:59 pm</date><text>Google faces antitrust inquiries and competition from all corners. But its biggest threat is Google itself, Larry Page, its chief executive and co-founder, said Tuesday. “There are basically no companies that have good slow decisions,” Mr. Page said in a rare public appearance at Google’s Zeitgeist conference in Paradise Valley, Ariz. “There are only companies that have good fast decisions. As companies get bigger, they slow down decision making, and that’s a big problem.” It’s a problem he has tried to address since he took over as chief executive from Eric E. Schmidt in April. “He’s in there doing that, forcing the choice and forcing the resolution,” Mr. Schmidt, now Google’s chairman, said at the conference. Mr. Page is also working on integrating all of Google’s products and improving their user interfaces, he said. Google “should stand for a beauty, technological purity of innovation and things that are important to people,” he said. It should also be a trusted brand, he said. “It’s very important to us that people know we’re acting in their interest and we’re trustworthy, both as stewards of information access and for their own personal data,” he said. Mr. Page, who typically avoids public appearances, spoke to the audience of Google customers. He seemed uncomfortable at first in jeans and a sweatshirt, reading from notes on paper. He repeatedly said how “super excited” he was about Google products like Google+, Chrome, Android and YouTube. He grew more comfortable when Mr. Schmidt, who is well versed in speaking publicly, joined him, “because he knows how to really answer the hard questions,” Mr. Page said. The two seemed to have an easy relationship in which they can tease each other. Asked about Google’s biggest challenges, Mr. Page shouted, “Google.” Mr. Schmidt said more diplomatically, “The problems at a company at Google’s scale are always internal at some level.” “Yeah, that’s why I said Google,” Mr. Page said, laughing. The two executives addressed driverless cars, which Google has been working on and which Mr. Page said had been an interest of his since graduate school. “Our computers drive your car better than you do when you’re drunk,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Or when you’re 16 or when you’re old,” Mr. Page said. “You’ll get a software update and your car will be safe, which is great.” Mr. Page also spoke about the patent wars, which have been continuing in Silicon Valley as tech companies sue one another. Google, which has never sued over patents, said it bought Motorola Mobility in part to protect itself with its patents. “There’s an element in technology and software of innovating and moving quickly and trying to do new stuff rather than using the legal system to prevent people from doing things,” Mr. Page said. Mr. Page said that technology in general and particularly social networking will look entirely different in five years. “Seven years ago there were no social networking tools and five years from now it’s going to be completely different again,” he said. “What we’re trying to do is make sure we’re driving the next five years, and that’s our job.”</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/26/business/media/an-identity-hijacked-on-the-online-highway.html?ref=googleinc">Dealing With an Identity Hijacked on the Online Highway<date>Published: September 25, 2011</date><text>DESPITE his prominent position as a Republican candidate for president, Rick Santorum has lost control of his online identity. And for all the snickering online about it, his predicament stands as a chilling example of what it means to be at the mercy of the Google algorithm.For those not in on the joke, Mr. Santorum’s torment is that when you look up his last name on Google, and the Bing search engine as well, you encounter a made-up definition of “Santorum” meant to ridicule him in a way that isn’t remotely fit to be described in a family newspaper. And Mr. Santorum has responded in a way that only holds himself up to more ridicule. He has taken aim at Google, telling the Web site Politico last week: “To have a business allow that type of filth to be purveyed through their Web site or through their system is something that they say they can’t handle, but I suspect that’s not true.” • The immediate reaction to Mr. Santorum’s statement has largely been, “How quaint. He thinks he can get Google to fix the Internet for him if he asks?” Mr. Santorum could have hurt his cause more only if he had told the company’s officials to roll up their sleeves and put a plug in the tubes carrying the offensive material. Google had its own response to Mr. Santorum: “Google’s search results are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the Web,” the company explained helpfully, concluding with a summation of its philosophy: “We do not remove content from our search results, except in very limited cases such as illegal content and violations of our webmaster guidelines.” Its advice? “Users who want content removed from the Internet should contact the webmaster of the page directly,” the company wrote. “Once the webmaster takes the page down from the Web, it will be removed from Google’s search results through our usual crawling process.” That advice is particularly unhelpful in Mr. Santorum’s case, however, since the new definition of “Santorum” was explicitly created by Dan Savage — the editorial director of the Seattle alternative weekly The Stranger and inspiration for the anti-gay-bullying campaign “It Gets Better” — to punish him for his comments in 2003 on gay marriage. In an interview with The A.P., Mr. Santorum, who was then a senator from Pennsylvania, listed other types of relationships that likewise should not be recognized by the government: “That’s not to pick on homosexuality. It’s not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing.” Mr. Savage did not respond to an e-mail asking how he would react if Mr. Santorum were to ask him to remove the mocking definition, but on his paper’s blog he has shown no sign of relenting. In August, he took note of criticisms of him from the right and wrote they “can say whatever they like about us,” adding, “but we’re not allowed to challenge or mock them because that wouldn’t be civil.” But Mr. Savage’s thoughts should be beside the point. The question is best directed at the search engines. And Google’s defense — that the behavior of its ever-improving algorithm should be considered independent of the results it produces in a particular controversial case — has a particularly patronizing air, especially when it comes to hurting living, breathing people. That’s not to say that Google’s beliefs aren’t consistent. In 2004, according to a history of Google, “In the Plex,” by Steven Levy, Sergey Brin was tempted to be subjective after receiving complaints that a search for “Jew” gave an anti-Semitic Web site as its first result. He was angered by the results, but as Mr. Levy tells it: “The algorithms had spoken, and Brin’s ideals, no matter how heartfelt, could not justify intervention. ‘I feel like I shouldn’t impose my beliefs on the world,’ he said. ‘It is a bad technology practice.’ ” But there was a case similar to Mr. Santorum’s where an offensive image of Michelle Obama was dropped from the top results. A search for “Michelle Obama” led viewers to a grotesquely racist photo much reported in 2009. Google placed its own ad above those results, saying: “We assure you that the views expressed by such sites are not in any way endorsed by Google. Search engines are a reflection of the content and information that is available on the Internet.” • Again, it was the algorithm that took the hit, and washed away accountability. That the offensive Michelle Obama photo no longer shows up today is not because of specific filtering, Google said at the time the change was detected, but rather a reflection of a better algorithm. The blog Search Engine Land, which has followed the many twists and turns in offensive search results, explained the change in an August post as follows: “If you’re wondering why the offensive image doesn’t show up anymore on searches for ‘michelle obama,’ Google says it’s because of algorithmic improvements, not any specific filtering on her name. The spokesperson said that the company’s internal metrics show that they’re doing a much better job of identifying the authoritativeness of individual images — and the offensive image is not authoritative for Michelle Obama’s name.” By those lights, it is hard to understand how the current rankings for a search of Santorum are authoritative — who exactly would type in that word genuinely curious to learn about a made-up term as opposed to a controversial candidate for president? Douglas Bowman, Google’s first outside designer, wrote on his personal blog in 2009 after leaving the company of his experience trying to instill an aesthetic vision there, recounting the now legendary story of Google’s testing 41 shades of blue to see which was the best. “When a company is filled with engineers, it turns to engineering to solve problems,” he wrote candidly. “Reduce each decision to a simple logic problem. Remove all subjectivity and just look at the data.” To say that Google is losing something by neglecting the human touch isn’t to mean that the algorithm isn’t reflecting humanity — after all, a motivated person created the page that tops the results for “Santorum.” But it is putting the opportunistic and sensationalistic ahead of a rare human quality: discretion.DESPITE his prominent position as a Republican candidate for president, Rick Santorum has lost control of his online identity. And for all the snickering online about it, his predicament stands as a chilling example of what it means to be at the mercy of the Google algorithm.</text></article>

Now it wants to be a force that shapes what you watch, hear, read and buy.The company announced new features here on Thursday that could unleash a torrent of updates about what you and your Facebook friends are doing online: Frank is watching “The Hangover,” Jane is listening to Jay-Z, Mark is running a race wearing Nike sneakers, and so forth. That in turn, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies hope, will influence what Frank and Jane and Mark’s friends consume. Facebook, in short, aims not to be a Web site you spend a lot of time on, but something that defines your online — and increasingly offline — life. “We think it’s an important next step to help tell the story of your life,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, who introduced the new features at the company’s annual conference for developers. He called what Facebook was doing an effort to “rethink some industries.” Facebook’s moves sharpen the battle lines between the social networking giant and Google, the search giant, because Facebook is trying to change the way people find what they want online. Searching the Web is still the way most people discover content — whether it is news, information about wedding photographers or Swiss chard recipes. Facebook is trying to change that: in effect, friends will direct other friends to content. Google has its own social network product in Google+, but it is far behind Facebook. “This is two big rivals getting into each others’ backyards,” said Sean Corcoran, an analyst with Forrester Research. “It changes the game for what social networks have been doing. What Facebook is saying is, we are your life online, and also how you discover and share.” Facebook is not becoming a purveyor of media products, like Apple or Amazon.com. Rather, it is teaming up with companies that distribute music, movies, information and games in positioning itself to become the conduit where news and entertainment is found and consumed. Its new partners include Netflix and Hulu for video, Spotify for music, The Washington Post and Yahoo for news, Ticketmaster for concert tickets and a host of food, travel and consumer brands. For companies that distribute news and entertainment, a partnership with Facebook can draw eyeballs and subscribers, though it still remains unclear exactly how much more revenue a Facebook friend recommendation can generate. Music industry analysts said the new Facebook offerings stand to improve the prospects of new media companies like the music service Spotify, which already has two million users worldwide. But they also pose a challenge to the biggest music seller of all: iTunes from Apple, which has added social features that have gained little traction. For Facebook, the potential payoff is huge, especially as it seeks to make itself more valuable in advance of a possible public offering. A new feature called Timeline lets users post information about their past, like weddings and big vacations. And everywhere on the site, users will be able to more precisely signal what they are reading, watching, hearing or eating. This will let Facebook reap even more valuable data than it does now about its users’ habits and desires, which in turn can be used to sell more fine-tuned advertising. How users will react to the new features remains to be seen. The site’s evolution could make it easier for them to decide how to spend their time and money. But it could also potentially allow them to shut out alternative viewpoints and information that is not being shared among their set of friends. And not everyone wants to rely on their friends to shape their cultural discoveries. “Some of my friends have pretty awful taste in music,” said Alexander White, whose Colorado-based Next Big Sound tracks social media responses for artists and record labels. “It’s one filter. It's not the be-all, end-all.” 1 2 Next Page » Brooks Barnes contributed reporting from Los Angeles and Nick Bilton from San Francisco.SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook, the Web’s biggest social network, is where you go to see what your friends are up to.

    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/google-takes-the-hot-seat-in-washington.html?ref=googleinc">Google’s Competitors Square Off Against Schmidt<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON — Good Google or bad Google?Those two headline narratives competed for credibility in a three-hour hearing on Wednesday before a Senate antitrust panel, which heard testimony from Google’s chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, and competitors of the search giant. Google’s story: The company is zealously dedicated to helping people find the most useful information on the Internet, and Google’s prosperity and the economic opportunity it has created for many thousands of American businesses all flow from that high-minded mission. The rivals’ rebuttal: Google increasingly tilts search results in favor of its own online commerce offerings like travel and shopping as it bundles those services into its industry-dominant search engine, limiting choice and stifling competition. The Senate hearing has been the most prominent one yet in the debate about Google’s business practices and their effect. Antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe are investigating Google as it steadily expands its business beyond search. At the start, Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin and chairman of the Judiciary’s antitrust subcommittee, pointed to the potential conflict of interest. “Is it possible,” he asked, “for Google to be both an unbiased search engine and at the same time own a vast portfolio of Web-based products and services?” Later, he suggested that the profit motive would naturally tilt search results toward Google services. Not so, Mr. Schmidt replied. “I’m not sure Google is a rational business trying to maximize its own profits,” he said. He never mentioned Microsoft by name, but his testimony was intended to draw a distinction between his company and the last technology powerhouse that was investigated, sued and found to have violated antitrust laws. That former innovator, Mr. Schmidt said, “lost sight of what matters and Washington stepped in.” Google, he said, has studied that history. “We get it,” Mr. Schmidt said. “We get the lessons of our predecessors.” Later, circling back to that theme, he said, “One company’s past needn’t be another’s future.” Mr. Schmidt described the online economy as highly competitive, with users “one click away” from other sources of information. The many rivals include search engines like Microsoft’s Bing, specialized review and listing sites like Yelp, comparison shopping sites like Nextag, online merchants like Amazon and social networks like Facebook. “The Internet is the ultimate level playing field,” he said. There were a few testy moments. Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, showed a chart with the rankings for Google Product Search in hundreds of shopping searches, compared with the rankings of three comparison shopping sites, Nextag, Pricegrabber and Shopper. The rivals’ rankings varied widely, while Google’s service was consistently ranked third. Mr. Schmidt first replied that the chart was an “apples to oranges” analogy, because the Google service steers users to specific products and is not a shopping comparison site. Unconvinced, Mr. Lee said, “You cooked it so you are always No. 3.” Mr. Schmidt replied, his voice tightening, “Senator, I can assure we haven’t cooked anything.” Google’s competitors testified in a second panel, after Mr. Schmidt, an arrangement that Google requested and the subcommittee accepted. The competitors described a different world than Mr. Schmidt portrayed, saying Google has immense market power and uses it. Jeffrey Katz, the chief executive of Nextag, said that Google was “an outstanding partner to us for many years,” but that the relationship has become strained as the search company expanded. Google’s business interests, he said, conflict with its engineering commitment to an open-for-all Internet. “But what Google engineering giveth, Google marketing taketh away,” Mr. Katz said. “Today, Google doesn’t play fair. Google rigs its results, biasing in favor of Google Shopping and against competitors like us.” The issue, he said in a separate interview, is subtle and does not affect all Google searches, mainly ones related to buying goods or services. “When you search for ‘running shoes’ or ‘digital camera,’ Google transforms itself from an independent search engine to a commerce site,” Mr. Katz said. “But that is not what happens when you type in a search for, say, ‘kidney dialysis.’” Jeremy Stoppelman, the chief of Yelp, said sites like his have to cooperate with Google because it is the gateway to so many users. About half of Yelp’s visitors come through Google search. Google, Mr. Stoppelman said, folds the reviews of other sites into its own offerings. “Google forces review Web sites to provide their content for free to benefit Google’s own competing product — not consumers,” he said. “Google then gives its own product preferential treatment.” Under questioning, both Internet entrepreneurs were asked, given Google’s evolution, would they start their businesses today. They would not, they said. “With Google taking so much of the real estate, I wouldn’t do it today,” Mr. Stoppelman replied. Mr. Katz said Google should either give competitors in online commerce equal treatment in search results or clearly disclose its conflict of interest. He punctuated his point by using the same phrasing Mr. Schmidt did when he testified. “Level playing field, level playing field, level playing field,” Mr. Katz said.WASHINGTON — Good Google or bad Google?</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/22/technology/personaltech/googles-virtual-credit-card-can-replace-plastic.html?ref=googleinc">Visions of a Future Where Phones Replace Wallets<date>Published: September 21, 2011</date><text>Plenty of companies would love to get their hands on our wallets. But Google wants to go one step further: it wants to be our wallets.Its new phone software, called Google Wallet, is intended to replace the credit cards in our actual wallets. It does sound pretty spectacular, doesn’t it? No fishing plastic cards out of wallets, no paper slips, no signatures. Everything is handled securely, instantly, conveniently, with one tap of your phone at the register. Europeans and Asians already routinely pay for things that way. Why can’t we have that in America? Now you can. But there are enough footnotes to fill a podiatry journal. At the moment, the free Google Wallet app runs on only a single cellphone model: Sprint’s Google Nexus S, which runs Google’s Android software. That’s because Google Wallet requires a special N.F.C. chip (near-field communications), and the Nexus S is one of the few phones so equipped. Someday, Google says, many more phones will have N.F.C. chips. The company says that it’s in talks with every major Android phone maker. The next question: Where can you use Wallet to pay for things? Google had the inspired idea of teaming up with MasterCard, which has already installed N.F.C. readers at 150,000 merchants in the United States and 230,000 overseas. You can see the black MasterCard PayPass terminals all over the place. That’s 150,000 companies; the total number of physical stores is far higher. At the moment, they include CVS, Duane Reade, RadioShack, Sunoco, Sports Authority, Foot Locker and New York City taxis. In coming weeks, Google says, more stores will come along, including Subway, Macy’s, Walgreens and Bloomingdale’s. Someday, Google says, the readers will be installed at cash registers all across this great land. Think of Wallet as a copy of your actual credit card. Wherever you might swipe a credit card, you can tap your phone instead. At the moment, though, the only credit card Wallet can impersonate is a Citibank MasterCard. Someday, Google says, all kinds of credit cards from all kinds of banks will work with Wallet. If you don’t have a Citibank MasterCard, you can still use Wallet. On the screen where you select which credit card you want to use, you’ll find an imaginary one called Google Prepaid Card. It comes with $10 of credit — Google’s gift to you, O Early Adopter — but right there on the phone, you can preload it with more money from another credit card. All right. So you’re in CVS or 7-Eleven, and the cashier announces the total, “$31.24.” At the exact moment when you would ordinarily swipe your credit card, you simply turn on the phone. (You don’t have to fire up the Wallet app first.) You hold it against the PayPass terminal and enter your four-digit password. The screen says “Sent,” and the terminal’s screen says “Authorizing ... Approved ... Balance $0. Thank you!” Security, Google says, is baked into the system from the beginning. The phone’s N.F.C. chip is completely deactivated when the screen is off. That’s to prevent sneaky evildoers from “skimming” (reading) your credit card information. A shame, really; Google says that the N.F.C. chip could work even when the phone was off, meaning you could keep using it to buy things. But Google chose to emphasize security over convenience; as a result, the phone is useless as a wallet once its battery is dead. The pass code requirement is intended to prevent people from buying stuff with your phone if it’s lost or stolen, since they won’t know the code. (And if they guess wrong five times in a row, the whole Wallet becomes unusable. You have to contact Google and explain yourself.) Of course, the four-digit pass code requirement also sucks most of the fun and convenience out of the whole phone-as-wallet concept. Tapping out the pass code on small keys on a not-always-responsive touch screen is a hassle, and not demonstrably faster than signing a regular credit card slip. Why can’t we disable that requirement according to our own paranoia levels? You can’t even pick an easy-to-type pass code to save yourself effort; Wallet won’t accept codes like 1234 or 1111. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comPlenty of companies would love to get their hands on our wallets.

    <article index="2" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/line2-hd-adds-phone-features-to-the-ipad/?ref=googleinc">Line2 HD Adds Phone Features To The iPad<date>September 21, 2011, 5:48 am</date><text>Line2 HD may not be the first app to turn your iPad into a phone, but it is an easy-to-use addition that puts phone calls, texts, voicemail and e-mail on a single screen—and offers a stack of other features as well. Like Line2’s iPhone app the HD version lets you make or receive calls over a 3G or Wi-Fi connection. You get a new phone number (like Google Voice), which can also receive texts and has voicemail. Line2 HD is an easy-to-understand app that puts a phone on the iPad. A nice feature of the voicemail is that it can send an audio file to your email so you can listen over your computer, in case if you don’t have your iPad with you. You can also forward calls to another phone, such as your land line. Line2’s app also connects to your iPad contact list and features call waiting, caller ID, and conference calling for up to 20 people. Calls can be made using the iPad’s built-in microphone, so you can use it as a speakerphone for conference-room calls, or you can use a wired mic. If you have an iPad 2, you can also connect with a Bluetooth headset. Test calls over Wi-Fi sounded as good as a typical mobile phone call. The app is free, but that is just a come-on. To use the app you need to purchase an account, which is $10 a month or $100 a year, paid up front. That’s not necessarily a bad deal. Because you can make calls over Wi-Fi, you can make unlimited calls from overseas without paying international calling fees. If you use something like Skype when traveling, you’ll have to check if you spend more than $100 a year on it, in which case Line2 would be a comparative bargain. A premium service at $15 a month or $150 a year add features like call screening and caller-specific forwarding, among others.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://thequad.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/the-geography-of-college-football-fans-and-realignment-chaos/?ref=googleinc">The Geography of College Football Fans (and Realignment Chaos)<date>September 19, 2011, 2:24 pm</date><text>Surveys find that about one-quarter of the United States population, or between 75 and 80 million people, follow college football regularly. But which teams do they align themselves with? This question is not easy to answer, but we’re going to make an effort to resolve it, and then use the results to shine a light on college football’s increasingly complicated realignment picture. The premise of the study is this: take the 210 television media markets in the United States, figure out how many college football fans they have, and then allocate them between the 120 current Football Bowl Subdivision programs. The first part of the problem isn’t as easy as you might think, because enthusiasm for college football varies radically across different parts of the country — far more than for other sports. One way to estimate the regional variances is to look at Google search traffic. For instance, according to Google Insights for Search, the term “college football” is searched for about 5 times as often in Birmingham, Alabama as it is in New York City, relative to overall search traffic. In other words, on a per-capita basis, there are probably about 5 times as many football fans in Birmingham as there are in New York. So although the New York media market is about 10 times larger, it has fewer than twice as many college football fans as Birmingham. New York, because of its very large population, is still the largest market in the country for college football. But only barely: Atlanta has nearly as many college football fans, for instance, based on an extrapolation from the Google data, while Dallas (and even Birmingham) aren’t far behind. The second part of the challenge is dividing the fans in each market between the 120 F.B.S. schools. One effort to study this is through something called the CommonCensus Sports Map Project, an online survey that asked fans to pick which college football team they’re most loyal to as well as to enter their geographic coordinates. After having collected more than 30,000 responses over the past several years, this has allowed the CommonCensus folks to divide the country up between the different college teams into what looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. The CommonCensus data also allows you to zoom in on any particular region, and develop an estimate of how fan loyalties are divided in any particular part of the country. Because this survey is not quite scientific — although the CommonCensus curators have made some effort to screen out ‘spam’ responses — I’ve adjusted the results based on a comparison to the college football revenues received by each team, according to disclosure data filed with the federal government. Teams that had a significantly higher- or lower-than-expected number of fans in the CommonCensus results in comparison to their revenues had their results adjusted accordingly. (The team affected most profoundly by this is Arkansas State, which was rather popular in the CommonCensus poll but which brings in few revenues from college football and doesn’t usually sell out its small stadium.) There are a few other kinks to work out. The CommonCensus poll did not include Western Kentucky, a relatively new F.B.S. program, as one of its choices. (I assigned it half of its home market of Bowling Green, Ky., as well as small portions of Louisville and Lexington.) And it doesn’t provide data for Hawaii and Alaska (I gave most of the former to the University of Hawaii while ignoring the latter — sorry Alaskan football fans.) Nevertheless, this allows us to develop an estimate of how many fans there are for each team — and where they are located. The most popular team in New York, for instance, is Rutgers. They have about 600,000 fans in New York City. That isn’t bad, but it represents only about 20 percent of college football fans in New York (in addition to some competing teams like Syracuse, many New Yorkers are transplants and bring their football loyalties with them). It also represents only about 3 percent of New York’s overall population. The contrast might be something like Omaha, Neb. It’s a much smaller market — but it’s far more football-avid than New York, according to the Google data. And it is dominated by one team, Nebraska, which has in excess of a 70 percent market share. Thus, Nebraska has about two-thirds as many football fans in Omaha as Rutgers does in New York, even though the market is about 18 times smaller. If you add up these results across all 210 markets, the three most popular teams are the three that also usually have the largest home attendance: Ohio State, Michigan, and Penn State. (Ohio State is ranked first in the country with about 3.1 million fans.) These teams get to have their cake and eat it too, dominating a series of smaller markets while also scoring points in some relatively large ones like Philadelphia and Detroit — and having large enough alumni bases that they even have some reach in places like New York. Following these three teams are Notre Dame — and then six southern schools, led by Texas and Texas A&amp;M. Two teams from Alabama manage to make the top ten because the state’s football avidity is more than enough to make up for its mid-sized population. This approach isn’t going to be perfect — unless you were willing to spend literally hundreds of thousands of dollars on a scientific survey of college football fans, you’re going to have to resort to some educated guesses. Nevertheless, it ought to provide us with some insight. The S.E.C.’s interest in Texas A&amp;M becomes easier to understand once you recognize that the Aggies have among the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Notre Dame’s fans are dispersed throughout the country explains why they’ve been loathe to join a conference. And that the West Coast is less enthusiastic about football than other parts of the country, making the Pacific-12 a harder sale to the television networks, explains why the conference is going to great lengths to expand into football-crazy states like Texas. Let’s review the results on a conference-by-conference basis with an eye toward realignment. Conferences are listed in order of their aggregate number of fans based on their current configurations. Big Ten The Big Ten can afford to be picky. Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State are the three most popular college football teams in the country, according to our study. Seven Big Ten teams, including new addition Nebraska, rank in the top 20 nationally. And all but one Big Ten school is in the top 50, the lone exception being Northwestern, which has the Chicago market and strong academics going for it. The only plausible additions that would allow the Big Ten to improve upon its average of about 1.5 million fans per team are Notre Dame (2.3 million fans) and Texas (also 2.3 million). But good luck adding those schools. Missouri, with 1.1 million fans — about as many as Nebraska — wouldn’t be far from the league average. Kansas (0.8 million) would be more of a stretch from a football standpoint but could bring in substantial college basketball revenues. There’s also long been talk of the Big Ten expanding into the Notheast. But Rutgers (0.9 million fans) and Connecticut (0.6 million) are only middling targets on their own merits because of the relatively low enthusiasm for college football in the region (the same would have gone for Syracuse or Pittsburgh, which just decided to join the A.C.C.). Then again, we estimate that there are about 0.6 fans of the current Big Ten schools in the New York City market alone, so a lot of people might tune in hoping to see one of these schools lose. One outside-the-box target: Virginia Tech. In addition to its natural (and quite avid) fan base in western Virginia, it also has some reach into Washington, D.C. and other relatively populous markets — enough for it to rank 13th in the country with 1.3 million fans. S.E.C. The S.E.C. has few large media markets — Atlanta’s Georgia Tech is in the A.C.C., as is the University of Miami. But if it adds Texas A&amp;M, it will be up to 15.6 million fans total, just barely behind the Big Ten (17.5 million). The enthusiasm for college football in the Southeast and a lot of mid-sized markets with decent population growth adds up to a very valuable brand — as, of course, does the exceptional quality of the product on the field. Still, the S.E.C.’s average of about 1.1 million fans per team — not counting Texas A&amp;M — sets a slightly lower bar than the Big Ten’s. Clemson (1.8 million fans), Georgia Tech (1.7 million) or Virginia Tech would improve upon it, while Missouri and West Virginia (1.0 million) are aren’t far from the league average and would do more to expand the conference’s geographic footprint. A.C.C. The A.C.C. had about 900,000 fans per team prior to adding Syracuse and Pittsburgh, although with a wide range between the football-oriented schools on its southern frontier and some others that are better known for their basketball. Wake Forest, for instance, with only about 150,000 fans, has the smallest football fan base of any automatic-qualifying school. New additions Syracuse and Pittsburgh actually come in slightly below the current league average, although not by much, and the league’s move to add them is understandable. Having added those two schools, there’s no reason the A.C.C. wouldn’t be interested in Connecticut and Rutgers, which have similarly-sized fan bases. Big 12 Even with the losses of Texas A&amp;M, Nebraska and Colorado, the Big 12 — as it stands on paper today — still has some football muscle, with about 8.1 million fans between the remaining 9 schools. Football is a big deal in this part of the country. The conference’s survival would be in grave danger, of course, if Texas and Oklahoma were to leave as well. And there aren’t very many attractive expansion targets. Brigham Young, ranking 43rd in the country with about 700,000 fans, would be appealing enough from an economic standpoint. But schools like S.M.U., Houston and Rice have very small fan bases — under 200,000 each — in the extremely competitive market for Texas football. One wonders if there isn’t some second-guessing about T.C.U. — scheduled to join the Big East next year — which also has to battle against other Texas teams but does a little better with about 400,000 fans. If the Big 12 were to collapse, Iowa State, Kansas State and Baylor might have trouble latching on elsewhere: their fan bases each rank outside the top 50 nationally. Pacific-12 The Pacific-12 plays plenty of good football, but the low avidity of college football fans in the Western United States means that it’s in the second-tier as a television product: only U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. have at least 1 million decided fans each. Despite their strong performance on the field, meanwhile, Washington and Oregon rank outside the top 40 in terms of their fan footprint. And other conference schools, like Oregon State, Stanford and Washington State, do poorly by major-conference standards. As compared to these teams, new additions Colorado (0.5 million fans) and Utah (0.4 million) look tolerable — but their fan bases are likewise middling by national standards. On the other hand, the Pacific-12’s latest targets — Texas, Oklahoma, Texas Tech and Oklahoma State — have about 5.1 million fans between them, which would expand the conference’s aggregate fan base by almost 70 percent. No wonder the Pacific-12 might be willing to make some academic and geographic compromises in order to get them. Big East Even before losing Pittsburgh and Syracuse, the eight Big East teams had only about 5.3 million fans between them — well below that of the other major conferences. T.C.U., when it is added next year, won’t help matters much: it will bring only about 400,000 fans, ranking ahead of only Cincinnati and Louisville among current members. Nor does the Big East have many good options as it tries to regroup. Assuming that other major-conference programs won’t be interested in it, the league could look toward the University of Central Florida, which has a decent base of about 500,000 fans, or even East Carolina (350,000 fans), but neither are premium brands. Temple, essentially booted out of the conference in 2004 after failing to bring in enough revenue, might now seem like one of the least-worst options now. It only has about 200,000 football fans but at least brings the Philadelphia media market and good basketball. The Big East could also try to pressure Villanova, a member of the league for basketball, to upgrade its competitive football program to the F.B.S. level. Even Marshall, Memphis or the University of Buffalo, also with about 200,000 fans each, could get a look if the conference were desperate to stay intact. So in theory could the service academies: Army has a radio affiliate in New York City and a proud football heritage. Independents Here’s one of those cliches that turns out to be valid: Notre Dame has a highly nationalized fan base. Its best markets — by the total number of fans, not market share — are New York, Chicago and Boston, each of which rank ahead of its native market of South Bend. It also has decent numbers of fans in markets as far afield as Los Angeles and Washington. It’s no wonder, then, that the school has been reluctant to join a conference, which could limit its national exposure. Brigham Young, as we mentioned, would be an attractive-enough addition for a conference like the Big 12. With about 700,000 fans, it ranks behind 42 automatic-qualifier schools — but ahead of 27 of them. But it may instead be the case that the ranks of independent schools will expand rather than contract. West Virginia, for instance, was an independent for most of its history until 1990 and if it were an odd-team-out under realignment it could look toward that option again. We’ll proceed very quickly through the remaining conferences. Conference U.S.A. In theory — but possibly not in practice — the most appealing targets here might not be those schools like Memphis or Houston that play second or third fiddle in a major market, but instead those like the University of Central Florida, East Carolina or Southern Mississippi that have built up decent fan bases in rural and exurban areas. Mountain West The pending additions of Hawaii, Fresno State and Nevada will bring in a combined 700,000 fans, making up for the loss of T.C.U. (400,000 fans). As compared to the other minor conferences, the Mountain West isn’t in terrible shape, although one assumes that recent addition Boise State — now the blue-chip member of the conference both competitively and economically — would jump at any opportunity to improve its lot in life. (Boise is a small market but has become very football-avid with the success of the Broncos.) Sun Belt Two things the Sun Belt Conference has going for it: it’s in the right part of the country for college football, and its teams are sufficiently obscure that they aren’t likely to be targets of raids from other conference — although Troy has decent numbers of fans. Mid-American A couple of these teams, like Temple and Buffalo, are in reasonably-sized markets, but they lack sufficient market share to be valuable economic entities. Western Athletic If the Big East or Big 12 think they have it rough, their position is enviable as compared to that of the Western Athletic Conference. Boise State is already gone, and the three remaining W.A.C. teams with the largest fan bases — Hawaii, Fresno State and Nevada — will be following them into the Mountain West Conference next year. The 5 surviving members of the conference have an average of only about 100,000 fans each. *** Of course, the question that an analysis cannot address is whether through expansion a conference can become more than the sum of its parts — or if it instead risks becoming less. The only two conferences that can feel completely secure right now are the Big Ten and the S.E.C.. They’re the two that have taken the most conservative attitude toward expansion over the past decade or two, waiting for programs of the caliber of Penn State, Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M to become interested before increasing their ranks. They’ve been rewarded with extreme loyalty among their fan bases. In a sport where rooting interests are so highly localized, that goes a long way toward explaining their success.</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/technology/googles-to-face-congressional-antitrust-hearing.html?ref=googleinc">Google to Face Congressional Antitrust Hearing<date>Published: September 18, 2011</date><text>Google’s slogan may be don’t be evil, but a growing chorus of antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe want to know if the company has lived up to that creed.This week, those concerns — especially whether Google gives its own businesses preferred placement in search results, thwarting competition and harming consumers — will have their most public airing to date, when Google’s chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, testifies before a Senate antitrust panel. Some of Google’s competitors will also testify. The Senate proceeding is just one of an array of inquiries into Google’s behavior by various federal and state authorities in this country, as well as by regulators in Europe and Asia. And though the company and the times are different, there are echoes of a hearing before the same Senate body, the Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, 13 years ago and the last sweeping antitrust investigation of an American technology powerhouse, Microsoft. Later, the federal government, joined by 20 states, filed suit against Microsoft. “Google is a great American success story, but its size, position and power in the marketplace have raised concerns about its business practices, and raised the question of what responsibilities come with that power,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who is a member of the antitrust subcommittee and who as the attorney general of Connecticut played a leading role among the states that sued Microsoft. Today Google, like Microsoft then, is both admired and feared. Google has used the riches from its dominance in search and search advertising to expand into video distribution with YouTube, smartphone software with Android and Web browsers with Chrome. It has added online commerce offerings in local retail and restaurants, comparison shopping and travel, and folded them into its search engine, prompting complaints that Google is giving its businesses preferred placement in search results. Google executives have consistently replied that its search results are the product of extensive user testing, and do not favor its own offerings. If users become dissatisfied with Google search results, the company argues, they will go elsewhere, to rival search engines like Microsoft’s Bing, sites that focus on specific products or services like Yelp, or social networks like Facebook. “Using Google is a choice,” Amit Singhal, a senior engineering manager at Google, wrote on the company’s blog in June, after the Federal Trade Commission began its investigation. “And there are lots of other choices available to you for getting information.” Competitors disagree. Yelp, the popular Web site for user reviews and recommendations for restaurants and other businesses, has noticed a difference in search rankings since Google established its own online businesses, said Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and chief executive of Yelp, which gets half its traffic from Google searches. Two years ago, Google offered to buy Yelp, but the talks broke down. Last year, Google introduced Places, a Yelp-like service for listing businesses and collecting consumer reviews. A Google search for a restaurant often displays the Places entry — linked to a map, user reviews and other services — ahead of Yelp. “Google develops its own in-house properties and it preferences those, so it’s leveraging its dominance in Web search,” he said. Mr. Stoppelman, who is scheduled to testify at the Senate hearing on Wednesday, added, “When it comes to Web search, Google says you have great content, you rise to the top and that’s historically been true for us. But we do feel like that world is changing because Google has decided it’s not enough to own and dominate Web search.” This month, Google acquired Zagat, the restaurant listing and review service, to strengthen its local commerce offering. Yelp is Zagat’s leading online rival. Google, legal experts say, presents some challenges for the traditional doctrine of antitrust. The Microsoft case, too, required adapting antitrust principles to modern technology, and the complaint filed against the company was filled with technical computing terms like “cross-platform middleware” and “application programming interfaces.” Yet Microsoft’s dominant product — the Windows personal computer operating system — was something consumers and companies paid for, as with any conventional good. 1 2 Next Page »Google’s slogan may be don’t be evil, but a growing chorus of antitrust regulators in the United States and Europe want to know if the company has lived up to that creed.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/19/google-wallet-makes-its-debut/?ref=googleinc">Google Wallet Makes its Debut<date>September 19, 2011, 6:59 pm</date><text>Updated 8:30 p.m.: Added an interview with Google. Google introduced to the public its long-awaited solution for eventually replacing credit cards with mobile phones. The product, called Google Wallet, stores people’s credit card information, coupons and discount cards on Google Android smartphones and allows people to pay for products with a swipe of the phone. Merchants need the technology of near-field communication, or N.F.C., which enables short-range wireless communications between a phone and an N.F.C reader. But don’t throw away your credit cards and wallet just yet. Google Wallet comes with several caveats. To use the new feature you will need a Sprint Nexus S 4G phone with built-in N.F.C. technology, a Citibank account and a MasterCard credit card. Google said it hoped to eventually add Visa, Discover and American Express to its wallet software, but it is not clear when. Google introduced Google Wallet in May, but until now, only employees of Google and other companies involved with the app have been able to use it. Google will focus at first on signing up merchants and users in New York and San Francisco, but Sprint Nexus S 4G users will be able to use it in other cities at 150,000 merchants that accept MasterCard’s PayPass, Google said. Google is just one of dozens of companies competing to replace plastic credit cards with a digital alternative. Technology companies including Square, Venmo and PayPal are trying to offer similar products, and larger banks are working with phone manufactures to avoid being   pushed out of the mobile banking race. One of the hold-ups to making cellphone payments mainstream has been that people can just as easily reach into their pockets for a credit card as they can for a phone. Google will try to overcome that obstacle by offering deals like Google Offers as part of Google Wallet, said Osama Bedier, Google’s vice president of payments. Another hold-up has been the sheer number of players involved in offering mobile payments — mobile phone carriers, banks, credit card issuers, payment networks and technology companies — especially since each wants a percentage of the transactions. But Google has moved relatively quickly because it does not earn money from Google Wallet transactions. It only makes money if merchants choose to advertise to Google Wallet customers through AdWords or Google Offers. For Google, the wallet is a way to jump from the Web to the offline world and provide a way for consumers and advertisers to use Google even when they aren’t online. “We see the lines are blurring between online and offline, and our business can no longer be just about online activity,” Mr. Bedier said. “Consumers don’t see their world as online or offline, they see it as a continuum, and we think there’s a huge opportunity here to address their offline advertising needs.”</text></article>
    <article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/16/business/media/judge-sets-schedule-in-case-over-googles-digital-library.html?ref=googleinc">Judge Sets Schedule in Case Over Google’s Digital Library<date>Published: September 15, 2011</date><text>Google’s plan to build a huge digital library remained stalled on Thursday when a federal judge set a proposed schedule for a lawsuit against the giant search company that could take the case to trial next year.But Google and the publisher and author groups who are suing it all said they would continue to negotiate on an agreement. “The bottom line is, we’re making good progress toward a settlement,” Tom Allen, the president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, said after the hearing on Thursday. “We would hope to resolve the issues we have left.” In March, Judge Denny Chin of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the original $125 million proposed settlement among Google, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers, leaving the case in limbo. The case began in 2005 when publishers and authors filed lawsuits against Google over its plan to digitize millions of books. Judge Chin had given the groups all summer to revise the settlement, twice granting extensions when lawyers for the groups asked for more time, citing the complexity of the issues. In the hearing Thursday morning, Judge Chin, rubbing his face with exasperation, noted that “this means we will be litigating this case for another year, at least.” Daralyn J. Durie, a lawyer for Google, told the judge that the parties had made “substantial progress” in talks and welcomed the opportunity to continue. Michael J. Boni, a lawyer representing the authors, said that the authors “would like very much to continue a dialogue.” The publisher plaintiffs hinted that they were closer to an agreement with Google than were the authors. Bruce P. Keller, a lawyer for the publishers, said that his clients had no objection to the proposed schedule. “One of the reasons we have no objection to it is that we think we’ve made enough progress in our discussions with Google so that the schedule may not matter,” Mr. Keller said. “If we adopt the dates that are being proposed, we hope that those dates will become moot.” In his ruling in March, Judge Chin cited concerns over copyright, antitrust and other issues in Google’s plans to make millions of books available online, saying it would give Google a “de facto monopoly,” but he suggested that a revised settlement addressing the obstacles might pass legal muster. The incentive for authors and publishers to reach agreement would be to tap a new source of revenue from digitized books. Negotiations between the Authors Guild and Google were damped by the announcement on Monday that three major authors’ groups, including the Authors Guild, had filed a lawsuit against a partnership of libraries and five universities, contending that their efforts to digitize books violated copyright. Nearly all of those scanned works were provided by Google.Google’s plan to build a huge digital library remained stalled on Thursday when a federal judge set a proposed schedule for a lawsuit against the giant search company that could take the case to trial next year.</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/business/media/aol-yahoo-and-microsoft-are-said-to-reach-an-ad-deal.html?ref=googleinc">AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft Are Said to Reach an Ad Deal<date>Published: September 14, 2011</date><text>Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft, three major technology companies that have traditionally competed for digital advertising revenue, have created an unusual partnership in which they will sell ads for one another.The move represents an effort to challenge Google, which dominates the search advertising market and has increased its efforts in display advertising. The plan was discussed at a private meeting in Manhattan on Tuesday night among officials from the three companies and executives from the advertising industry, according to an agency executive who attended but who would speak only anonymously because the meeting was private. AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft declined to comment on the plan. The companies also hope to entice other online publishers to join their partnership. And by joining together and selling for one another, they hope to reduce the need for third-party ad networks that often sell some of the less desirable ad space on their sites. The plan was first reported Wednesday morning on AllThingsD, the technology Web site. The report said the deal was focused on selling remnant inventory, or the lower-priced ads that typically run at the bottom of Web pages or on secondary pages. Remnant ads are generally sold by third-party networks, usually for lower prices, and feature products or services like weight-loss or teeth-whitening treatments. The move would signal another step by online publishers to rely more heavily on so-called private exchange technology, which allows them to deal directly with ad agencies without having to use third-party networks. Selling the space could allow the publishers to earn more revenue and gain more control over the data they collect on their users. It would also give media buyers and agencies a one-stop shop for buying advertising space on each of the three companies’ sites. “What they are trying to replicate is the growth of private exchanges,” said David Hallerman, a principal analyst for eMarketer, a digital market research firm. The exchanges, he said, “offer a buyer accurate targeting, brand safety and good pricing for good reach.” The companies’ plan would most likely require them to overcome several obstacles. The technologies they use to sell and place ads on their sites are not immediately compatible. Yahoo has an ad exchange called Right Media, and AOL has Advertising.com, which makes much of its revenue from selling remnant ads. Last winter, Microsoft began selling remnant ads through AppNexus’s exchange. Other issues could include figuring out how to coordinate sales efforts and determining which sales team sells which ad space. Google dominates the search advertising marketplace, with nearly 76 percent market share, according to data from eMarketer, and the company is aggressively pushing into online display advertising as well. It accounts for about 9 percent market share in display, with projected revenue of about $1.1 billion, according to eMarketer. The projected display advertising revenues for Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft combined would total $2.7 billion, eMarketer reported.Yahoo, AOL and Microsoft, three major technology companies that have traditionally competed for digital advertising revenue, have created an unusual partnership in which they will sell ads for one another.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/15/alleged-iphone-5-images-begin-to-surface-online/?ref=googleinc">Plenty of Chatter About a New iPhone<date>September 15, 2011, 6:51 pm</date><text>photo via bgr.com Cases for an unusual iPhone model appeared briefly on the Case-Mate Web site Thursday. We’re just weeks away from the announcement of the new Apple iPhone 5, according to an Apple employee who asked not to be named because he was not allowed to speak publicly for the company. As the excitement for Apple’s latest product revs up, chatter about the phone is starting to fly around the Web at warp speeds. On Thursday the technology blog Boy Genius Report posted images of a new iPhone case from the site of a company called Case-Mate. The images were visible on the company’s site for a short period of time before they were replaced with a curiously cryptic page that says, “We’ll have your cases when you have your new iPhone.” From descriptions I’ve heard of the new iPhone from Apple employees, the images seemed potentially authentic. But it seems that Case-Mate might be sneakily trying to take advantage of the excitement over the phone by posting and then unposting the images. These things rarely happen accidentally, especially when it comes to new Apple products. Sneaky public relations tactics aside, an engineer familiar with the new iPhone said it would be fairly different from the iPhone 4 — including on the inside. The new iPhone will come with an eight-megapixel camera, this person said, an upgrade from the five-megapixel camera in the iPhone 4. Earlier this year Howard Stringer, Sony’s chief executive, let it slip that the next iPhone would be updated with an eight-megapixel camera made by Sony. The Apple engineer also said the new phone would have a faster A5 dual-core processor. Apple patents and recent new hires show that the company plans to add mobile payment functions to a future iPhone too — although it is unclear if that will happen this year. As I’ve written in the past, two people with knowledge of the inner workings of Apple’s next-generation iPhones say either the iPhone 5 or iPhone 6 will include a new chip that is made by Qualcomm. This chip will include near-field communication technology, known as N.F.C., that can be used to make mobile payments by waving the phone over an N.F.C. reader, just like swiping a credit card at a terminal. When Apple does introduce a mobile-payment-ready iPhone, the company will immediately have an advantage over its competitors, including Google and Microsoft, which are trying to push payments on mobile devices too. One person familiar with Apple’s plans said the phone’s payment information would be tied to customers’ iTunes accounts, which would make it simple for customers to set up a payment account on the iPhone by simply logging into iTunes. According to Apple, 200 million people have stored their credit card information on iTunes.</text></article>

The latest coup for the former Credit Suisse First Boston ace is persuading Google to bid against itself for Motorola Mobility. Since starting Qatalyst Partners, his boutique investment bank, Mr. Quattrone has extracted a much higher premium for clients than rival tech bankers. Silicon Valley has now been given fair warning.The $12.5 billion Motorola deal is a big part of Mr. Quattrone’s already impressive second act. He spent several years tied up in court, clearing his name of accusations linked to hot initial public offerings during the original dot-com bubble. He successfully fought off all charges by 2006, but by then the sector’s landscape had been radically altered since the days of Netscape. The technology may have changed but many of the executives and investors had not. Setting up Qatalyst in 2008, mainly to help firms sell themselves to rivals instead of the public, proved canny. Giants like Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Google increasingly invade one another’s turf, and the move to Web-based services has intensified this free-for-all. Mr. Quattrone’s job today also remains essentially the same as it was a decade ago: fetch the highest price for technology clients. He has done exactly that. Since the start of 2010, Qatalyst has advised nearly a dozen publicly listed companies. The typical tech firm sells for 37 percent more than where its shares were trading four weeks before the deal announcement, according to Thomson Reuters data; Mr. Quattrone’s clients garnered premiums of about 70 percent. It’s impossible to pin down the reasons for this success. It could be favorable client selection. 3PAR’s ability to secure nearly three times its undisturbed price may have had more to do with desperate suitors than the auctioneer’s skills. Then again, Mr. Quattrone may be better at marshaling hype and old-fashioned salesmanship. How else to explain the data storage firm Isilon fetching 100 times earnings or Google twice raising its bid for Motorola despite a lack of other bidders? Either way, it strains belief to suggest Mr. Quattrone is merely on a lucky streak. Sellers may want to make him their first call. Buyers, on the other hand, should heed the approximate Latin: Caveat Qatalyst. China’s Strings It’s no surprise that China’s pledges of support for indebted trade partners come with strings. But Premier Wen Jiabao, addressing the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, was unusually blunt about what he expects in return: to be named a market economy. That would cost Europe little, but it doesn’t mean it should agree. Chinese investment must look more appealing as stricken euro zone states like Italy, Greece and Spain face up to the possibility that investors will refuse to finance their deficits. Italy’s gouging by bond markets on Tuesday gives a taste. Just a drop of China’s $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves could give troubled countries a reprieve. Market economy status is, on the face of it, an easy thing to give in return. After all, it’s just a label. But without it, countries can accuse China of dumping goods, and then use other countries’ prices — say, India’s energy prices or Thailand’s land costs — to prove their point. Under World Trade Organization rules, China gets market status anyway in 2016, but as Mr. Wen says, bringing that forward a few years is the kind of thing one might expect “from one friend to another.” Perhaps. Except that China isn’t a market economy, it’s a “socialist market economy.” Some important hallmarks aren’t there. The exchange rate is guided more by policy than market forces. Capital is allocated by decree rather than just by price. True, China isn’t the command economy it was under Chairman Mao. But the suppressed rate on deposits, for example, or the inflated lending rates for small companies show that not everything is pure supply and demand. So while Europe could give China what it wants — and it has flexed the “market” definition before, for Russia — it’s hardly a commendable course. Far better for Europe’s leaders to get their own house in order, including planning for a Greek default and pushing Italy to cut back its debts. That’s harder work. But it would also make China’s veiled ultimatums moot. For more independent financial commentary and analysis, visit www.breakingviews.com.When Frank Quattrone comes calling, buyers should beware.

    <article index="10" href="http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/google-flight-search-vs-kayak/?ref=googleinc">Google Flight Search vs. Kayak<date>September 14, 2011, 10:47 am</date><text>On Tuesday, Google unveiled Google Flight Search—a competitor to Kayak, Travelocity, Expedia and other airfare-shopping sites. This is the first real fruit borne from Google’s purchase of ITA Software, a flight and airfare-information company that Google bought in July of 2010. Since ITA sells flight information to a number of travel sites (like Kayak, Orbitz and Hotwire), after scrutiny of the deal by the Justice Department, Google had to make assurances that it wouldn’t keep ITA’s best parts for its own uses. For a quick comparison, I ran a few searches on Google Flight Search and Kayak. Here’s what I found: Google is faster. Pages loaded about eight seconds faster on Google than they did on Kayak. This may not seem like a lot, but when you’re doing repeated searches and adjustments and reloads, it’s noticeable. Google is simpler. The default view you get when you search for a flight on Google are all the outbound flights. When you select one, you then see the return flights that are available with that outbound ticket. This is better than Kayak’s presentation, because Kayak shows pairs of flights for the destination and date you’ve selected. With that view, you get all the 9:30 a.m. flights listed with all their matching return flights. There’s a lot of redundancy. Google’s simplified view is better. One quibble with Google’s layout: The results of the return flights are in a lightly delineated box that appears amidst the departing fares. Unfortunately, the box is not marked as clearly as it could be (you can kind of see this in the example, at right) and may cause some confusion when you are staring at columns of letters and numbers. Kayak’s results are more comprehensive. Searching for a flight from Miami to Dallas in late October, Kayak showed a US Airways flight departing at 6:15 a.m. On Google Flight Search, the earliest flight was at 6:50 a.m. That earlier flight cost twice as much as the later one, but for some people, schedule may be more important than cost. Google has said that it is aware that Flight Search is limited right now (it has no international flights, for example), and that it will be adding more flights in the future. Kayak’s fare map is better. Both services offer vacationers a useful tool — a map showing how much a ticket to various destinations costs from a selected departure city. If you live in New York, for example, you can see that the lowest fare to Charleston, S.C., costs $160, while a flight to Funafuti Atol in Tuvalu will set you back no less than $2,690. But just as Google’s results are limited, so is its map at this point; Kayak’s map is densely packed with cities and other destinations, where Google’s is sparsely populated with places to go. Google’s filters and viewing tools are cooler. Kayak has the usual fare matrix, which shows number of stops on one axis and airlines on another, but Google slices up the data in two interesting and useful ways. The first is a matrix that has price on one axis and overall flight time on another, shown below. Sliding up, down and around the axes filters flights by cost and duration. The other view is a bar graph that accompanies a calendar, shown below. The graph shows prices for round-trip fares on different days. It’s an easy way to discover that, for example, if you leave one day earlier, your fare will be $100 cheaper, or if you fly out the next week it will drop $200. Google’s approach is more revealing than the ±3 day option most sites have, and while Kayak does have a fare chart showing highs and lows over an extended period of time, Google’s is interactive, making it more useful. Final verdict: Kayak (for now). Google’s brought some good thinking to sorting through airfare information, but it does have an Achilles’ heel; right now, it doesn’t have as many flights as the competition. In the end, you can dress up the data all you want (and they are very nice dresses, I must say), but if you’re looking for flights, you’re a little like Gary Oldman in The Professional: You want every one. Playing around with graphs and sliders is cool and all, but it doesn’t help you much if there’s an earlier flight you want and you’re not seeing it. But Google’s a pretty big company. They seem to have some smart people there. In all likelihood, they’ll adapt. And so will Kayak. Hopefully, the biggest winners here are travelers.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

What can data do for your daily commute? A team of energy policy consultants and software developers met in San Francisco to brainstorm how data sets could be used to make the typical urban commute shorter and greener. They participated in a high-speed coding competition last weekend called the Cleanweb Hackathon. Similar to the collaborative programming sprints used by companies like Facebook and Google to increase workers’ creativity, the Cleanweb Hackathon gave participants 24 hours to build apps from scratch in teams. The stated goal of the event, organized by the venture capitalist Sunil Paul, was to “demonstrate the impact of applying information technology to resource constraints.” One such team devised a system that would reward commercial buildings with incentives like carbon credits, for example, when occupants bike, walk and bus to work instead of driving. The team’s demo application, called Commute Score, was one of 14 tools created as part of the event. According to Kimberly Goodrich, a Commute Score team member, her group wanted to find a way to “bring your commute into the energy equation.” A downtown commercial property may not have adequate room for solar panels, but if its occupants commute by public transit, it may be greener than a solar-powered office park where workers drive a hundred miles each day. Tracking a building’s energy use isn’t enough, they argued; it also matters how people get there. For Commute Score, the developers Bryan Galusha and Andrew Aarestad “created a way to track a commute on a smartphone and then identify the transit signature (walk, bike, bus, train or car) of the commuter,” Ms. Goodrich wrote in an e-mail. “From this data, we attributed carbon kudos to various modes of transit to generate a Commute Score,” she added. Judges for the event included Mr. Paul and the industrial designer Yves Behar, as well as executives from Cisco; Tendril, a smart-grid technology company; Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich and Rosati, a Silicon Valley law firm; and Catamount Ventures, a venture capital firm. On Sunday, the judges awarded Commute Score first prize in the category of Biggest Impact. Other entries dealing with transportation included Tarzan, which integrates traffic and emissions data with a trip planner and calendar, and GreenScore, which employs traffic, fuel consumption and pollution data to rate cities and states for their green performance. Hackathon organizers collected 11 different data sets related to transportation, ranging from real-time traffic documentation from Google to development platforms provided by local transit agencies. But Commute Score ultimately based its signatures on original data collected by Ms. Goodrich and her teammate Dan Suyeyasu, who walked, biked, bused and took trains around San Francisco on Saturday carrying phones with GPS chips. Another team is planning to introduce a version of its Get Tarzan app on Oct. 1. Built using Google Maps and Google Calendar, as well as the Bing search engine and the local weather forecasting Web site WeatherUnderground.com, the tool combines a calendar and route planner, simplifying travel time and costs considerations across multiple modes of transportation. Get TarzanGet Tarzan’s mobile interface. According to Ezra Goldman, a Get Tarzan team member, some of the key features of the concept include factoring in time for parking, I.R.S. tax-deduction rates and real-time data about traffic delays. The mobile version of the app also brings in weather forecasts to help users make decisions about walking or biking. “Future versions could help you to plan your days to do efficient trip ‘chaining’ and avoid unnecessary trips,” Mr. Goldman wrote in an e-mail. The team also says that the app could eventually incorporate taxis or “emerging modes of travel, like car sharing, ride sharing and bike sharing.” Collaborations between independent software developers and transportation companies are increasingly common. On Monday, Ford Motor Company suggested at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco, that the car itself could become a platform for the kind of rapid-fire innovation inspired by the Cleanweb Hackathon. As noted by our colleagues at the Bits blog, the automaker has partnered with Bug Labs, an open-source hardware and software provider, to enable people to add electronic components to their cars. And to demonstrate what could be possible as Bug Labs’ so-called OpenXC platform makes its way into Ford’s vehicles, the companies showed off an in-car fuel monitor designed to let drivers compare their fuel consumption to other drivers.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/how-the-google-motorola-deal-went-down/?ref=googleinc">How Google-Motorola Deal Came Together<date>September 13, 2011, 7:56 pm</date><text>Tony Avelar/Bloomberg NewsFrank Quattrone, chief of Qatalyst Partners. It took less than seven weeks, but it became more expensive quickly. From the first discussions in early July to a formal announcement on Aug. 15, Google moved swiftly this summer to secure a $12.5 billion takeover of Motorola Mobility, according to a filing submitted on Tuesday. The search giant, which was eager to own Motorola’s extensive patent portfolio, was also willing to pay up. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links The S.E.C. filing Google to Buy Motorola Mobility After floating an initial bid of $30 a share on Aug. 1, Google raised its offer price to $37, before settling at $40 a share. In just weeks, the offer increased by more than $3 billion. For that, Motorola can thank Frank P. Quattrone, whose investment bank was hired on Aug. 1. The filing, which maps out the background of the merger, discloses how the deal came together in the wake of Google’s failed bid for Nortel‘s patent portfolio. In early July — mere days after Google lost out to a consortium led by Apple and Microsoft — Andrew Rubin, the company’s senior vice president of mobile, reached out to Sanjay Jha, the chief executive of Motorola Mobility, to discuss “the possible impact of and potential responses” to the Nortel purchase. Over the next several days, discussions intensified, roping in more executives, including Google’s chief, Larry Page, and Nikesh Aurora, the company’s chief business officer. And by mid-July, the parties had agreed to a confidentiality agreement, as Google began due diligence on Motorola Mobility’s patent portfolio. Although talks initially centered on Motorola’s patents, the focus quickly shifted to takeover talks. On July 28, Google said it would entertain a bid in the range of high $20s to low $30s. On Aug. 1, it came back with a formal letter and a $30 offer. Enter Mr. Quattrone. On that day, Motorola Mobility hired Mr. Quattrone’s Qatalyst Partners and Centerview Partners to serve as financial advisers. According to the filing it was Qatalyst, which has recently advised some of the largest takeover transactions in the technology sector, that prodded Google to go higher. On Aug. 5, after a telephone meeting with Motorola’s directors, an unidentified Qatalyst representative contacted Google’s chief legal officer “to reject the $30 per share offer and suggested that Google increase its proposed price to $43.50 per share.” On Aug. 9, Google came back with $40 a share. At the tail end of the process, Motorola Mobility’s board considered seeking other buyers, but ultimately concluded that it was “preferable” to negotiate on a confidential basis with a single potential acquirer, rather than to conduct a private or public auction. Six days later, the deal was done.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/google-introduces-long-awaited-flight-search/?ref=googleinc">Google Introduces Long-Awaited Flight Search<date>September 13, 2011, 2:04 pm</date><text>Updated 2:15 p.m. to add details after Google made its  announcement about the new service. Google introduced flight search on Tuesday, competing head-to-head with travel search engines like Kayak, Orbitz and Microsoft’s Bing. The service has been expected since Google announced last year its intention to buy ITA Software, which makes the flight search software used by many airlines and travel search engines like Orbitz and Bing. The deal underwent intense antitrust scrutiny, but the Department of Justice approved the acquisition, with caveats, in April. Google said its flight results were not influenced by any paid relationship; the search engine directs travelers to the airline’s own Web site to book the flight. Google has said that it wanted to buy ITA to provide a new, open-ended kind of travel search, so that, for instance, people could ask Google where they could go to find warm weather and beaches in December for under $300 round-trip. The service introduced Tuesday was not Google’s full offering but an initial step in that direction, according to the company. For now, it only shows select cities in the United States and results for economy-class, round-trip flights. When travelers search for flights on Google or visit google.com/flights, they will see flight options from a variety of airlines, which they can sort by departure or arrival time, flight duration, route, airline or price. Taking a step toward its ultimate goal, the service includes a way to filter flights by time and price to figure out where to go. Like Bing, Google’s flight search compares prices over time, and like Hipmunk, a travel search start-up, people can sort flights visually on a graph, based on duration and price. Google says its results are fast; on an initial try-out of the service,  they do seem to appear instantaneously, compared with other sites where users wait while the site compiles results. Google’s flight search joins other travel offerings, like hotel search, which it introduced in July. The Department of Justice has required Google to continue to license ITA’s software to other sites that now compete with Google, many of which vocally opposed the acquisition. On Tuesday, Robert Birge, Kayak’s chief marketing officer and a spokesman for FairSearch.org, a group of businesses that say they believe that Google has a monopoly in search and fought the acquisition, said in a statement that Kayak’s flight search was superior. “We recognize Google is a formidable competitor, but they haven’t been successful in every vertical they’ve entered,” Mr. Birge said. “We use multiple data sources and proprietary technology, all of which helps us in our efforts to provide people with comprehensive, fast and accurate answers to their flight search needs.”</text></article>
    <article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/13/opinion/protect-our-right-to-anonymity.html?ref=googleinc">Protect Our Right to Anonymity<date>Published: September 12, 2011</date><text>WashingtonIN November, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that could redefine the scope of privacy in an age of increasingly ubiquitous surveillance technologies like GPS devices and face-recognition software. The case, United States v. Jones, concerns a GPS device that the police, without a valid warrant, placed on the car of a suspected drug dealer in Washington, D.C. The police then tracked his movements for a month and used the information to convict him of conspiracy to sell cocaine. The question before the court is whether this violated the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures of our “persons, houses, papers, and effects.” It’s imperative that the court says yes. Otherwise, Americans will no longer be able to expect the same degree of anonymity in public places that they have rightfully enjoyed since the founding era. Two federal appellate courts have upheld the use of GPS devices without warrants in similar cases, on the grounds that we have no expectation of privacy when we are in public places and that tracking technology merely makes public surveillance easier and more effective. But in a visionary opinion in August 2010, Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, disagreed. No reasonable person, he argued, expects that his public movements will be tracked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and therefore we do have an expectation of privacy in the “whole” of our public movements. “Unlike one’s movements during a single journey,” Judge Ginsburg wrote, “the whole of one’s movements over the course of a month is not actually exposed to the public because the likelihood anyone will observe all those movements is effectively nil.” Judge Ginsburg realized that ubiquitous surveillance for a month is impossible, in practice, without technological enhancements like a GPS device, and that it is therefore qualitatively different than the more limited technologically enhanced public surveillance that the Supreme Court has upheld in the past (like using a beeper to help the police follow a car for a 100-mile trip). The Supreme Court case is an appeal of Judge Ginsburg’s decision. If the court rejects his logic and sides with those who maintain that we have no expectation of privacy in our public movements, surveillance is likely to expand, radically transforming our experience of both public and virtual spaces. For what’s at stake in the Supreme Court case is more than just the future of GPS tracking: there’s also online surveillance. Facebook, for example, announced in June that it was implementing face-recognition technology that scans all the photos in its database and automatically suggests identifying tags that match images of a user’s friends with their names. (After a public outcry, Facebook said that users could opt out of the tagging system.) With the help of this kind of photo tagging, law enforcement officials could post on Facebook a photo of, say, an anonymous antiwar protester and identify him. There is also the specter of video surveillance. In 2008, at a Google conference on the future of law and technology, Andrew McLaughlin, then the head of public policy at Google, said he expected that, within a few years, public agencies and private companies would be asking Google to post live feeds from public and private surveillance cameras all around the world. If the feeds were linked and archived, anyone with a Web browser would be able to click on a picture of anyone on any monitored street and follow his movements. To preserve our right to some degree of anonymity in public, we can’t rely on the courts alone. Fortunately, 15 states have enacted laws imposing criminal and civil penalties for the use of electronic tracking devices in various forms and restricting their use without a warrant. And in June, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, and Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah, introduced the Geolocation Privacy and Surveillance Act, which would provide federal protection against public surveillance. Their act would require the government to get a warrant before acquiring the geolocational information of an American citizen or legal alien; create criminal penalties for secretly using an electronic device to track someone’s movements; and prohibit commercial service providers from sharing customers’ geolocational information without their consent — a necessary restriction at a time of increasing cellphone tracking by private companies. It’s encouraging that Democrats and Republicans in Congress are coming together to preserve the expectations of anonymity in public that Americans have long taken for granted. Soon, liberal and conservative justices on the Supreme Court will have an opportunity to meet the same challenge. If they fail to rise to the occasion, our public life may be transformed in ways we can only begin to imagine. Jeffrey Rosen, a law professor at George Washington University, is an editor of the forthcoming book âConstitution 3.0: Freedom and Technological Change.â This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: September 14, 2011 An Op-Ed article on Tuesday about the implications of surveillance technologies for privacy incorrectly described a new feature on Facebook. The feature uses face-recognition technology that scans photos and automatically suggests identifying tags that match images of a userâs friends with their names. It does not match every face with a name.Washington</text></article>

He created fake credentials that could allow someone to snoop on Internet connections that appeared to be secure. He then shared that bounty with people he declines to name. The fruits of his labor are believed to have been used to tap into the online communications of as many as 300,000 unsuspecting Iranians this summer. What’s more, he punched a hole in an online security mechanism that is trusted by millions of Internet users all over the world. Comodohacker, as he calls himself, insists he acted on his own and is unperturbed by the notion that his work may have been used to spy on antigovernment compatriots. “I’m totally independent,” he said in an e-mail exchange with The New York Times. “I just share my findings with some people in Iran. They are free to do anything they want with my findings and things I share with them, but I’m not responsible.” In the annals of Internet attacks, this is likely to go down as a moment of reckoning. For activists, it shows the downside of using online tools to organize: an opponent with enough determination and resources just might find a way to track their every move. It also calls into question the reliability of a basic system of trust that global Internet brands like Google and Facebook, along with their users, rely upon. The system is intended to verify the authenticity of a particular Web site — to ensure, in effect, that Gmail is Gmail, and that the connection to the site is encrypted and difficult for an outsider to monitor. Hundreds of companies and government authorities around the world, including in the United States and China, have the power to issue the digital certificates that the system relies upon to verify a site’s identity. The same hacker is believed to be responsible for attacks on three such companies. In March, he claimed credit for a breach of Comodo, in Italy. In late August came the attack on the Dutch company DigiNotar. On Friday evening, a company called GlobalSign said it had detected an intrusion into its Web site, but not into more confidential systems. Armed with certificates stolen from companies like these, someone with control over an Internet service provider, like the Iranian authorities, could trick Internet users into thinking they were safely connected to a familiar site, while eavesdropping on their online activity. Fearing the prospect of other breaches similar to those carried out by this hacker, Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox Web browser, last week issued a warning to certificate authority companies to audit their security systems or risk being booted off Firefox. “It is a real example of a weakness in security infrastructure that many people assumed was trustworthy,” said Richard Bejtlich, the chief security officer of Mandiant Security in Alexandria, Va. “It’s a reminder that it is only as trustworthy as the companies that make up the system. There are bound to be some that can’t protect their infrastructure, and you have results like this.” Comodohacker said via e-mail that he began his explorations by scrolling through a list of certificate authority companies. DigiNotar caught his interest because it was Dutch. He said he was motivated by the failure of Dutch peacekeepers to prevent the massacres of Muslims in Srebenica in 1995. He also said he chose the Dutch company because of a Dutch legislator, Geert Wilders, who has built a political career out of criticizing Muslims in his country. DigiNotar, which is owned by an Illinois company called Vasco Data Security International, did not make the attack particularly difficult, according to a report by Fox-IT, a security company that was commissioned by the Dutch government to investigate. The company’s critical servers contained malicious software that should have been spotted by antivirus tools, the report said, and the servers related to certificates were all protected by just one weak password. DigiNotar did not respond to requests for comment last week. 1 2 Next Page » Artin Afkhami and Kevin J.

On Google’s security blog late Thursday, Eric Grosse, vice president for security engineering, said the company was “directly contacting possibly affected users.” He noted that users of the Google Chrome browser were unaffected by the malicious attack but urged “all users in Iran to take concrete steps to secure their accounts.” The company spelled out five separate steps, beginning with changing passwords and verifying account recovery options to ensure that alternate e-mail addresses and phone numbers are updated. It went on to advise users to make sure unfamiliar apps and Web sites did not have access to their accounts and that e-mails were not being automatically forwarded to suspicious, unknown addresses. Google was not the only site to be affected by the attack. The hacker produced fake certificates for other communications sites, including Skype and Facebook. The certificates could be used by a third party with control of an Internet service provider. That third party could in turn eavesdrop on supposedly secure online conversations.</text></article>
    <article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/technology/google-details-electricity-output-of-its-data-centers.html?ref=googleinc">Google Details Electricity Usage of Its Data Centers<date>Published: September 8, 2011</date><text>Google disclosed Thursday that it continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes, but it says that in doing so, it also makes the planet greener.Every time a person runs a Google search, watches a YouTube video or sends a message through Gmail, the company’s data centers full of computers use electricity. Those data centers around the world continuously draw almost 260 million watts — about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Up to now, the company has kept statistics about its energy use secret. Industry analysts speculate it was because the information was embarrassing and would also give competitors a clue to how Google runs its operations. While the electricity figures may seem large, the company asserts that the world is a greener place because people use less energy as a result of the billions of operations carried out in Google data centers. Google says people should consider things like the amount of gasoline saved when someone conducts a Google search rather than, say, drives to the library. “They look big in the small context,” Urs Hoelzle, Google’s senior vice president for technical infrastructure, said in an interview. Google says that people conduct over a billion searches a day and numerous other downloads and queries. But when it calculates that average energy consumption on the level of a typical user the amount is small, about 180 watt-hours a month, or the equivalent of running a 60-watt light bulb for three hours. The overall electricity figure includes all Google operations worldwide, like the energy required to run its campuses and office parks, Mr. Hoelzle added. Data centers, however, account for most of it. For years, Google maintained a wall of silence worthy of a government security agency on how much electricity the company used — a silence that experts speculated was used to cloak how quickly it was outstripping the competition in the scale and efficiency of its data centers. The electricity figures are no longer seen as a key to decoding the company’s operations, Mr. Hoelzle said. Unlike many data-driven companies, Google designs and builds most of its data centers from scratch, down to the servers using energy-saving chips and software. Noah Horowitz, senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council in San Francisco, applauded Google for releasing the figures but cautioned that despite the advent of increasingly powerful and energy-efficient computing tools, electricity use at data centers was still rising because every major corporation now relied on them. He said the figures did not include the electricity drawn by the personal computers, tablets and iPhones that use information from Google. “When we hit the Google search button,” Mr. Horowitz said, “it’s not for free.” Google also estimated that its total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, with most of that attributable to carbon fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. In part because of special arrangements the company has made to buy electricity from wind farms, Google says that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010, and estimates that figure will reach 30 percent in 2011. Google also released an estimate that an average search uses 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, a figure that may be difficult to understand intuitively. But when multiplied by Google’s estimate of more than a billion searches a day, the figure yields a somewhat surprising result: about 12.5 million watts of Google’s 260-million-watt total can be accounted for by searches, the company’s bread-and-butter service. The rest is used by Google’s other services, including YouTube, whose power consumption the company also depicted as very small. The announcement is likely to spur further competition in an industry where every company is already striving to appear “greener” than the next, said Dennis Symanski, a senior data center project manager at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization. At professional conferences on the topic, Mr. Symanski said, “they’re all clamoring to get on the podium to claim that they have the most efficient data center.”Google disclosed Thursday that it continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes, but it says that in doing so, it also makes the planet greener.</text></article>

But on Thursday, Zagat found an ally in the biggest online giant of all, selling itself to Google. The deal will unite Zagat, whose burgundy-covered guides were among the first examples of user-generated content, and Google, which has made local services one of its highest priorities. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but people briefed on the matter said that Google had paid $100 million to $200 million. Tim and Nina Zagat, who began the company by compiling restaurant ratings from friends into slim surveys more than three decades ago, will remain with the business. The deal will most likely mean a lucrative payout for the Zagats, as well as for the private equity firm General Atlantic, which bought a third of the company in 2000. But it also raises questions about how Google will integrate Zagat, whose main offerings include its popular paper guidebooks and a paid subscription Web site. Local online advertising is an increasingly lucrative market, one that analysts estimate to be about $140 billion a year. Google estimates that about 20 percent of its daily searches are for things that are nearby, and that percentage is even higher for queries made on mobile phones. Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Google blog post Letter from Nina and Tim Zagat New-Form Press Release, in Blog, Tweet and Haiku “All of these are users wondering where they should go, where they should spend their time, so to be able to offer accurate information is important, and that’s why we’ve been getting focused on reviews,” Marissa Mayer, Google’s vice president for local, maps and location services, said in an interview. Ms. Mayer said that Zagat’s reviews would supplement Google’s Places reviews, but that the publisher’s Web home would remain a paid site for now. “I think Marissa needs a little time to think about it,” Mr. Zagat said, “but the list of things to do here is pretty obvious.” Google said it would keep publishing the guidebooks for now. Mr. Zagat said that the print books were “very profitable.” Ms. Mayer said that Google planned to expand Zagat’s team, which now includes sales staff, fact-checkers, hundreds of contractors who conduct the surveys and, most important, the hundreds of thousands of reviewers in more than 100 cities. Two years ago, Google tried — and failed — to buy Yelp, Zagat’s biggest online competitor, for $500 million. Last year, Google introduced Places, a Yelp-like service for listing local businesses and collecting consumer reviews. But the service has not collected the same volume of reviews as Yelp and others. “It’s a little bit of a consolation prize,” Greg Sterling, an analyst with Opus Research, said of the Zagat deal. “They went after Yelp, which would have been a bigger prize for them for many reasons, including salespeople and a sexier brand. But this is a pretty strong acquisition.” The Zagats have tried to sell their company at least once before. In January 2008, they announced that they had hired Goldman Sachs to auction the publisher. But the couple called off the sales process six months later, after several buyers balked at the $200 million asking price. The Google deal will end several troubles that have restricted the Zagats’ attempt to expand an online business. Because the Zagat Web site is largely behind a subscriber pay wall, Google and other search engines did not rank the company’s reviews high on their pages of results. Instead, the company has turned to a series of alliances with the likes of Facebook, Foursquare and, yes, Google. The deal sent ripples through other local-focused Internet businesses on Thursday. Shares in OpenTable, the restaurant reservations company that has introduced diner reviews, tumbled more than 8 percent, to $57.50. Ms. Mayer and the Zagats first met at the TED technology conference in 2008. This year, at a preconference lunch session featuring Ms. Mayer, the Zagats sat in the front row. Afterward, the couple approached her and offered their business cards, jokingly wishing her luck in their competition in the local information sector. Soon after, the Zagats showed up in the front row for a presentation by Ms. Mayer, this time at the City University of New York Graduate School of Journalism. Mr. Zagat brought brochures for the Zagat wine club. Ms. Mayer subsequently urged an associate to set up a lunch meeting for the four of them, and the seeds of the deal were planted. The Zagats’ repeated front-row appearances were probably not by chance. Ms. Zagat said that the company had considered Google as a potential buyer in 2008. “I proposed Google to Goldman Sachs and to other people working with us, and they said that Google wasn’t interested,” she said. (This time, Zagat turned to the Peter J. Solomon Company and Allen &amp; Company as advisers.) For now, Zagat’s employees will remain at the company’s headquarters in Columbus Circle in Manhattan because of lease constraints. Mr. Zagat said he believed that the area had better restaurants than the Chelsea neighborhood, where Google’s New York offices are located. He added that Zagat workers would take advantage of Google’s free meals — and that they intended to rate the catering.</text></article>
    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

Press releases were created to break news, not make it. But in an era when buttoned-up corporate culture is giving way to hoodie-clad executives and job titles like “chief happiness officer,” some companies are finding that nuts-and-bolts announcements with arcane financials and canned quotes don’t send the right message. Increasingly, corporate releases about acquisitions or important hires are filled with puns, jokes and witticism — the best examples of which can be buzz-worthy items themselves. When Google announced its acquisition of the restaurant ratings guide Zagat on Thursday, the Internet company posted a blog item that read, “Google Just Got Zagat-Rated!” Zagat told visitors to its Web site about the sale via a mock review of Google, assessing the search engine giant using its 30-point system and quote-heavy style. Google got high marks in all four categories.

Groupon, a daily deals site on the forefront of corporate wackiness, said in a press release earlier this year that it had raised “like, a billion dollars” in its latest financing round. The actual total was $950 million. Zynga, the maker of popular Internet games like FarmVille and CityVille, announced that it had appointed Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, to its board, with a release that began: “What do Shrek and FarmVille have in common (besides donkeys and onions)?” The offbeat press release has its advantages. In some cases, it can help businesses cut through the clutter in reporters’ inboxes and earn plaudits for creativity. ”The old news release format died a couple of years ago, and business can now reach audiences directly, without babble or corporate-speak,” said Jeff Domansky, public relations consultant and editor of the PR Coach blog. Marissa Mayer, Google’s top executive for local and location services, initially wrote a more traditional Twitter message and Google+ post about the Zagat acquisition, jotting it down after a flight from California to New York. But when she ran the ideas past Gabriel Stricker, a Google spokesman, they got panned as boring. He recommended a more poetic approach, like a haiku. “We were slogged in traffic, so I had just enough time to write a rhyming haiku,” said Ms. Mayer, whose eventual Twitter post read: Acquisition announcement haiku: Delightful deal done; Zagat and Google now one; foodies have more fun! http://t.co/T2gZ4yC #gogooglelocalThu Sep 08 15:28:19 via webmarissamayer marissamayer Clever corporate communications can also backfire. When HubSpot, a social media analytics company, bought its competitor OneForty in August, the company announced its acquisition in a series of 13 Twitter messages, each no more than 140 characters long. While the news got attention and praise among the social networking crowd, some Twitter users complained that the company didn’t have a longer, more standard release. One user wrote that it was the “most annoying press release format ever.” So far, the trend of nonstandard press releases has been most concentrated among Silicon Valley start-ups and has not seeped into deals involving banks, utility companies or other industries where a more sober style prevails. For many companies, taking a chance on a nonstandard press release isn’t worth it. “It’s nice if you can be irreverent and get away with wearing jeans and a vintage tee, but most companies should be measured and staid in their corporate announcements,” said Richard Dukas, chief executive of Dukas Public Relations. “Kind of like wearing a navy blazer. You can’t go wrong.” Claire Cain Miller contributed reporting.</text></article>

It also has a section titled “Report a problem” and one of the problems to report is “this place is permanently closed.” If enough users click it, the business is labeled “reportedly closed” and later, pending a review by Google, “permanently closed.” Google was tight-lipped about its review methods and would not discuss them.

A small Canadian activist investor is calling on the board of Research in Motion to explore options to increase the company’s share price, including a potential sale or spinoff of its patent portfolio. In a letter to the board, Vic Albioni, head of the merchant bank Jaguar Financial, criticized RIM’s lack of innovation and challenged its governance structure, in the latest complaint from investors taking the company to task for its poor performance. “The status quo is not acceptable, the company cannot sit still,” Mr. Alboini, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, said in a statement. “It is time for transformational change. The directors need to seize the reins to maximize shareholder value before more market value is lost.” Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Blackberry Maker Subject of Takeover Talks It is unclear how many RIM shares Jaguar owns. The firm is relatively small, with reported net income of $2.1 million for the second quarter of 2011, and RIM, with a market value of about $15.8 billion, is by far its largest target to date. But Research in Motion’s share price has been battered this year, falling nearly 50 percent. The company, which has two chief executives who also serve as chairmen of the board, has already been confronted by one investor about its governance structure. Northwest and Ethical Investments dropped the proposal to split the chairman and chief executive roles from the summer investor meeting after RIM promised to form a committee to study its leadership structure. In the letter, Jaguar noted that RIM had lost significant market share in the last year, as the Apple iPhone and phones using Android, the operating system created by Google, have claimed new customers in the smartphone market. A number of product introductions, including a tablet, have not been the successes the company had hoped for. “This decline in the company’s standing can largely be attributed to significant execution delays, inadequate mobile applications and the lack of a competitive product that addresses the needs of the consumer marketplace,” the letter from Jaguar said.</text></article>

Coffee Rules Lounge was listed for a few days as “permanently closed” on Google Maps. During that time, anyone searching for a latte on a smartphone, for instance, would have assumed the store was a goner. “We’re not far from Interstate 70,” said Mr. Rule, “and I have no doubt that a lot of people running up and down that highway just skipped us.” In recent months, plenty of perfectly healthy businesses across the country have expired — sometimes for hours, other times for weeks — though only in the online realm cataloged and curated by Google. The reason is that it is surprisingly easy to report a business as closed in Google Places, the search giant’s version of the local Yellow Pages. On Google Places, a typical listing has the address of a business, a description provided by the owner and links to photos, reviews and Google Maps. It also has a section titled “Report a problem” and one of the problems to report is “this place is permanently closed.” If enough users click it, the business is labeled “reportedly closed” and later, pending a review by Google, “permanently closed.” Google was tight-lipped about its review methods and would not discuss them. Google’s rivals, like Bing and Yahoo, have versions of Places — called Bing Local and Yahoo Local — and these let users report a business as closed. But neither has anything close to Google’s traffic, which means they are the scene of far less mischief. When Google created Places it had an eminently sensible type of crowd-sourcing in mind. The site contains millions of listings, and when owners close without updating their profile, the job falls to customers to keep information current. But like any open system, this one can be abused. Search engine consultants say that “closing” a business on Google has become an increasingly common tactic among unscrupulous competitors. “I’d say that it was in June that we started to see a big uptick in complaints about this in online forums,” said Linda Buquet of Catalyst eMarketing in San Marcos, Calif. “It might be that a number of consultants are now offering services like ‘nuke your competitor’ in Google Places. But it could just be a competitor, acting alone.” Nobody is quite sure how prevalent these sham closings have become. In Google Forums, where users can pose questions about Google’s features, there are dozens of exasperated postings like this one, written in July: “Help! My business is listed ‘PERMANENTLY CLOSED’ on Google Maps even though it has always been open! Help!” But this most likely represents a fraction of viable businesses that have been cyberpadlocked. Many owners, search consultants say, have no idea that they’ve been shuttered online, and many others fix the problem without asking anyone how to solve it. A Google spokesman, Gabriel Stricker, declined to comment on whether the company kept a running tally of fraudulent closings. But he said Google was aware of the issue and was already working on changes, which will be adopted in coming days, to prevent what he called “malicious or incorrect labeling.” “We know that accurate listings on Google Maps are an important tool for many business owners,” he wrote in an e-mail. “We take reports of spam and abuse very seriously and do our best to ensure the accuracy of a listing before updating it.” If there is a historical antecedent to “closing” a company on Google, it is a dirty trick that was fairly common in 19th-century politics, wherein supporters of a candidate would spread rumors that his opponent was dead. This didn’t always work — Thomas Jefferson prevailed in the election of 1800, despite reports of his demise — but the Internet corollary can have terrible consequences. “For weeks, our bookings for September have been far lower than normal and we were wondering why,” said Charlene Cowan, who owns and operates Macadamia Meadows Farm, a bed-and-breakfast in Naalehu, Hawaii, which has been tagged as “permanently closed” for weeks.  “I can’t imagine a customer is behind this — if someone doesn’t like their visit here, they’d complain on TripAdvisor. I can’t prove it, but this seems like something a competitor did.” The owner of a closed business, and customers who know better, can click on a button marked “not true,” which appears by all “reportedly closed” and “permanently closed” listings. In some instances, owners say, a business will “open” shortly thereafter. But other owners, like Ms. Cowan, say that the button doesn’t work, or that it takes a week to have any effect. Still others say that immediately after clicking the “not true” button, their business is immediately “closed” again. “In the last four days, I’ve hit that ‘not true’ button every six to eight hours,” said Daniel Navejas of RBI Divorce Lawyers of El Paso. “It’s getting old.” In mid-August, a search consultant and blogger named Mike Blumenthal was so rankled by what he considered Google’s cavalier attitude to closings on Google that he committed an act of online disobedience: He “closed” Google’s offices in Mountain View, Calif. For a brief period, Google itself was “reportedly closed,” according to Places. “I did it to point out how annoying this is when it happens,” he said. On Aug. 15, Mr. Blumenthal posted a screen shot of Google’s Places page “reportedly closed,” noting that it took just two people — him and a friend — to pull off this stunt. It seemed to get the company’s attention. At least one change to closings on Places has already been made. Since late August, a business that is newly tagged “permanently closed,” receives an alert via e-mail from Google, informing the business owner of the change. Mr. Blumenthal describes this as a good start, but hardly enough. “The company really ought to give a heads-up when a business is tagged ‘reportedly closed,’ ” because those words alone are often enough to put off customers, he said. “Google doesn’t understand how much fear and discomfort businesses have about this. One company gets to decide if you’re open or closed in the online world.” Although they allow users to report a business as closed, Bing Local and Yahoo Local don’t yet seem to have as many problems. Case in point: Macadamia Meadows Farm, that bed-and-breakfast in Hawaii, is open for business, according to both Bing Local and Yahoo Local. But after weeks of e-mails and even a call or two to Mountain View, its owner, Ms. Cowan, can’t scrub the “permanently closed” label from Google Places. “A few days ago, I put on our Places page that we’re running a special,” she said. “I just hope people read that and think ‘Well, they must actually be open.’ ”In mid-August, Jason Rule learned some surprising news about the coffee shop that he owns and operates in Hays, Kan.: the place had closed for good.</text></article>

Your doctor prescribes an intrusive, painful and costly treatment. What she doesn’t say — because she hasn’t consulted the research — is that most studies find the treatment ineffective and fraught with negative side effects.You go through the procedure, which doesn’t work. You later find the research your doctor failed to consult. When you ask why, she answers: “Who pays attention to studies? I have years of clinical experience. Besides, the protocol seemed as if it ought to work.” Does that sound like malpractice? It does to us. Fortunately, pressures to practice evidence-based medicine are reducing preventable errors. That isn’t the case, however, in most workplaces, where failure to consider sound evidence repeatedly inflicts unnecessary damage on employee well-being and group performance. It doesn’t have to be that way. Consider the issue of incentive pay. Many people believe that paying for performance will work in virtually any organization, so it is used again and again to solve problems — even where evidence shows it is ineffective. Recently, New York City decided to end a teacher bonus program after three years and $56 million. As The New York Times reported in July, a study found that the effort to link incentive pay to student performance “had no positive effect on either student performance or teachers’ attitudes.” But that bad news could have been predicted long before spending all that time and money. After all, the failure of similar efforts to improve school performance has been documented for decades. Here is another example: Research has shown that stable membership is a hallmark of effective work teams. People with more experience, working together, typically communicate and coordinate more effectively. Although this effect is seen in studies of everything from product development teams to airplane cockpit crews, managers often can’t resist the temptation to rotate people in and out to minimize costs and make scheduling easier. For example, the National Transportation Safety Board once found that 73 percent of the safety incidents reported on commercial aircraft occur on the first day a new crew flies together. Hiring is another crucial workplace decision. Many studies show that unstructured, face-to-face interviews are biased; interviewers prefer candidates who are likeable, similar to them, and physically attractive — even if these qualities are irrelevant to performance. Many other selection methods are superior. Among the best is simply to determine whether the candidate can perform the work. Still, interviews remain the primary route to hiring. Another workplace danger is excessive self-confidence, which can help people rise to positions of power but can also render them less effective leaders. Overconfident decision-makers may acknowledge that they use a practice that is ineffective for most others — but they believe they are so talented that the usual findings don’t apply to them. Fortunately, some organizations are moving toward evidence-based management. A recent study at Google shows the power of accepting and acting on evidence, even when it clashes with ingrained beliefs. For most of its history, Google’s leaders believed that deep technical expertise was the most important quality in a manager. They thought that the best bosses pretty much left their people alone, and that their main role was to help with technical problems when people got stuck. Yet when Google examined what employees valued most in a manager, technical expertise ranked last among eight qualities. Deemed more crucial were attributes like staying even-keeled, asking good questions, taking time to meet with people and caring about employees’ careers and lives. Google found that managers who did these things led top-performing teams and had the happiest employees and least turnover. So Google is making many changes in how it selects and coaches managers, devoting particular effort to improving its worst managers. We applaud Google’s leaders for overcoming their biases. But note that the attributes of great managers were evident in hundreds of previous studies, so such improvement efforts might have started years earlier. IN medicine, the evidence-based movement arose in response to thousands of deaths and billions of wasted dollars that could have been averted by applying proven practices. Similarly, in other fields, the growing pile of studies on the human and financial costs of employee disengagement, management distrust, poor group dynamics, faulty incentive schemes and other preventable damage suggests a need for an evidence-based management movement. Some organizations are leading the way. It’s time for many more to follow suit.

And on Thursday, Fox News released details of the debate it is sponsoring with Google on Sept. 22. The two-hour debate will be held in Orlando, Fla., and will incorporate YouTube and written questions from the public. Bret Baier will be the moderator, and panelists will include Chris Wallace, host of “Fox News Sunday,” and Megyn Kelly, anchor of the network’s “America Live.” The debate’s locale highlights the importance of Florida in the nominating calendar. While the primary schedule has not been set, the state has tentatively scheduled its primary for Jan. 31, 2012, a week before the Iowa caucuses, although if it holds to that date the other nominating contests would likely be moved to earlier in the month. Either way, Florida’s place as an early battleground state with a rich trove of delegates has led the Republican candidates to spend a fair amount of time there recently. This would not be the first time that YouTube videos have played a role in presidential debates. In the 2008 campaign Billiam the Melting Snowman became a minor celebrity when he asked the Democratic candidates what they would do to combat global warming. So expect YouTube to be a presence at other debates going forward. “We’re delighted to give voters across the country this opportunity to ask their questions of the G.O.P. candidates,” said Steve Grove, head of news and politics for YouTube. “Through this joint debate with FOX News, we hope to bring more voices into the arena to create an informed and lively dialogue about the future of our country.”</text></article>
    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/opinion/tight-budget-look-to-the-cloud.html?ref=googleinc">Tight Budget? Look to the ‘Cloud’<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>Cambridge, Mass. AS the global economy struggles through a slow and painful recovery, governments around the world are wasting billions of dollars on unnecessary information technology. This problem has worsened in recent years because of what I call the “I.T. cartel.” This powerful group of private contractors encourages reliance on inefficient software and hardware that is expensive to acquire and to maintain. In one particularly egregious example of waste, the Defense Department last year pulled the plug on a personnel system devised by Northrop Grumman after spending approximately $850 million on it in 10 years.  When I joined the Obama administration as the chief information officer, we quickly discovered vast inefficiencies in the $80 billion federal I.T. budget. We also saw an opportunity to increase productivity and save costs by embracing the “cloud computing” revolution: the shift from hardware and software that individuals, businesses and governments buy and then maintain themselves, to low-cost, maintenance-free services that are based on the Internet and run by private companies. Examples of cloud computing companies include Web behemoths like Amazon and Google, which offer a variety of services (data storage or e-mail, for example), as well as companies like salesforce.com, which helps businesses manage customer relationships via social networks. Other services and applications include health care access, mobile energy management and storm recovery assistance. Most cloud-based services are either free for consumers or delivered via a monthly subscription service for businesses. According to the research firm Gartner, cloud computing will be a $149 billion industry by 2015. Like a large office building, cloud data centers are efficient: many different tenants occupy the same space, sharing the same critical infrastructure, yet each tenant still has its own secure, customizable space. For example, in preparation for the 2010 census, the Census Bureau used the cloud computing services of salesforce.com to expand its I.T. capabilities, saving the cost and time of purchasing, designing and installing a brand-new I.T. infrastructure.  Shortly after the Obama administration took office, we instituted a “Cloud First” policy, which advocates the adoption of cloud services by government agencies and mandates the transition of at least three projects for every agency to the cloud by next summer. Some agencies, like the General Services Administration, have embraced cloud computing; the agency has cut the I.T. costs on things as simple as its e-mail system by over 50 percent. But other agencies have balked. The State Department, for instance, has raised concerns about whether the cloud approach introduces security risks, since data is stored off site by private contractors. But cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing, because companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies. And government employees are so accustomed to using cloud services like Dropbox and Gmail in their personal lives that, even if their agencies don’t formally permit cloud computing, they use it for work purposes anyway, creating a “shadow I.T.” that leads to a more vulnerable organization than would a properly overseen cloud computing system.  The United States cannot afford to be left behind in the cloud computing revolution. In health care alone, a productivity increase of 1 percent in the next 10 years — much of which could be achieved with cloud-based services — represents a $300 billion value. Similar efficiencies could be realized in sectors like financial services, education and manufacturing. Consider the example of Japan, which has faced significant economic challenges for two decades. The government’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry estimates that the Japanese cloud computing market is likely to reach $20.1 billion by 2015 and is implementing a cloud initiative as a key tenet of its national economic strategy. Similar growth is predicted for India, where the cloud market is projected to grow to $3 billion by 2015 and create 100,000 jobs. As foreign governments prioritize investment in the cloud, the United States cannot hesitate because of hypothetical security threats that serve the entrenched interests of the I.T. cartel. One of the critical remaining issues concerning cloud computing is whether cloud data can and should flow between nations and what restrictions should be placed upon it. The next step should be the creation of a global Cloud First policy that forces nations to work together and resolve these critical issues. The United States, along with leading nations in Europe and Asia, has an opportunity to announce such an initiative at the World Economic Forum meeting in January.  The budget crisis will accelerate the move toward cloud services. Governments, businesses and consumers all have a lot to gain, but not everyone will have an equal say at the table. Public and private organizations that preserve the status quo of wasteful spending will be punished, while those that embrace the cloud will be rewarded with substantial savings and 21st-century jobs.

I like Gmail, but when I send out messages to a group, all the replies all get funneled into one continuous inbox response. Is there a way — short of sending separate emails to each person – to unlink these? A. By default, Gmail was originally designed to keep all the messages and replies with the same subject line grouped together in one convenient place. While this “conversation view” was intended to spare users the chore of rooting around the In box for a particular message in the thread, it can be unwieldy when a lot of people are contributing to the conversation. Google realized that not everybody likes having the messages clumped together, so Gmail now makes it optional. To ungroup your messages, log into your Gmail account on the Web, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner and choose Mail Settings. On the General tab, in the Conversation View area, click the button next to “Conversation view off” and then click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the settings page.</text></article>

The Justice Department’s settlement of a criminal investigation of Google for allowing Canadian pharmacies to advertise drugs for distribution in the United States reflected an effort by prosecutors to extend the reach of federal drug laws. This may present future challenges to Internet search companies over their advertisements. Google entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the government last week over the use of its AdWords program by Canadian pharmacies that helped them sell prescription drugs in the United States in violation of a federal law, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). That law prohibits causing the “introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, tobacco product, or cosmetic that is adulterated or misbranded.” Google agreed to forfeit $500 million, representing both its advertising revenue from the Canadian pharmacies and the revenue the pharmacies received from American customers buying controlled drugs. The company also agreed to enhance its compliance program for drug advertising. White Collar Watch View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Google Reaches $500 Million Settlement With Government Google's nonprosecution agreement For Google, the settlement puts an embarrassing investigation to rest and eliminates a distraction while it pursues its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility. By styling the settlement as a nonprosecution agreement, the company will not have a criminal record once it complies with the terms. The Canadian prescriptions sold to American customers were considered “misbranded” under the statute because they were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. In some cases, the drugs were obtained from countries other than Canada that lacked adequate regulation of pharmacies. Mario Anzuoni/ReutersLarry Page, chief executive of Google. The United States attorney for Rhode Island, Peter F. Neronha, whose office was responsible for the investigation, said Google’s conduct was not the result of a few rogue employees, according to The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Neronha said the company’s chief executive, Larry Page, “knew what was going on.” The statute prohibits the “introduction or delivery” of the drugs, but Google was not involved in any way in their actual transfer into the United States, which is the usual means of proving a violation of the statute. Instead, the Justice Department viewed Google as an accomplice to the crime by enhancing the ability of the Canadian pharmacies to reach American consumers. Can a search engine be held responsible for how consumers use the products or services allowed to be advertised on it? That question goes to a core issue in the criminal law regarding the responsibility of suppliers for the use of products they sell. There were negligence lawsuits in the early 1990s against Soldier of Fortune magazine for advertisements it ran for people willing to engage in criminal acts, including murder. These cases were brought by victims of attacks and involved a question about whether the magazine published ads that were a “clear and present danger” to the public, and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment. Unlike a private lawsuit alleging negligence, the Justice Department’s nonprosecution agreement with Google involved an assertion that the company aided a criminal violation — i.e., that it was an active participant in a crime. To prove accomplice liability, the prosecution must show the defendant provided some assistance in the commission of the crime, which can include counseling or encouraging the offense. There is a fine line between supplying goods that are later used for the commission of a crime and actually assisting in its completion. Even if one does furnish some measure of assistance, the law further requires that the accomplice be aware of the user’s intention to commit a crime and intend to give some assistance or encouragement in its completion. The Justice Department’s position in the Google case emphasizing the awareness of its chief executive shows it took an aggressive approach about what can constitute aiding a violation of the drug importation laws. Google was not involved in the actual movement of the prescriptions, but the government viewed its role as sufficiently important to the success of the Canadian pharmacy sales that it was similar to someone who actually supplied or shipped misbranded drugs. The fact that the case was resolved by a nonprosecution agreement can be seen as an indication that the Justice Department understood its position on accomplice liability could be open to challenge if criminal charges were filed in court. Unlike a guilty plea, this type of resolution does not require any judicial approval, so a judge will not question whether the conduct rose to the level of aiding and abetting a crime. Google’s $500 million payment was labeled as a forfeiture of the revenue that both the company and the Canadian pharmacies received, not a criminal fine or civil monetary penalty. While Google paid out that money, it did not experience any additional monetary punishment for its conduct. The Internet allows messages to be better focused on particular groups of potential customers. With that ability comes the growing possibility that the Justice Department will view search engines as more than mere passive conduits of information, and instead as potentially active participants in conduct that may violate the law. Peter J. Henning, who writes White Collar Watch for DealBook, is a professor at Wayne State University Law School. This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 31, 2011 An earlier version of this post misstated what Google's $500 million settlement represented. The company forfeited money that represented both its advertising revenue from Canadian pharmacies and the revenue the pharmacies received from American customers buying controlled drugs, not just Google's ad revenue.</text></article>

Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

Look to the ‘Cloud’<date>Published: August 30, 2011</date><text>Cambridge, Mass. AS the global economy struggles through a slow and painful recovery, governments around the world are wasting billions of dollars on unnecessary information technology. This problem has worsened in recent years because of what I call the “I.T. cartel.” This powerful group of private contractors encourages reliance on inefficient software and hardware that is expensive to acquire and to maintain. In one particularly egregious example of waste, the Defense Department last year pulled the plug on a personnel system devised by Northrop Grumman after spending approximately $850 million on it in 10 years.  When I joined the Obama administration as the chief information officer, we quickly discovered vast inefficiencies in the $80 billion federal I.T. budget. We also saw an opportunity to increase productivity and save costs by embracing the “cloud computing” revolution: the shift from hardware and software that individuals, businesses and governments buy and then maintain themselves, to low-cost, maintenance-free services that are based on the Internet and run by private companies. Examples of cloud computing companies include Web behemoths like Amazon and Google, which offer a variety of services (data storage or e-mail, for example), as well as companies like salesforce.com, which helps businesses manage customer relationships via social networks. Other services and applications include health care access, mobile energy management and storm recovery assistance. Most cloud-based services are either free for consumers or delivered via a monthly subscription service for businesses. According to the research firm Gartner, cloud computing will be a $149 billion industry by 2015. Like a large office building, cloud data centers are efficient: many different tenants occupy the same space, sharing the same critical infrastructure, yet each tenant still has its own secure, customizable space. For example, in preparation for the 2010 census, the Census Bureau used the cloud computing services of salesforce.com to expand its I.T. capabilities, saving the cost and time of purchasing, designing and installing a brand-new I.T. infrastructure.  Shortly after the Obama administration took office, we instituted a “Cloud First” policy, which advocates the adoption of cloud services by government agencies and mandates the transition of at least three projects for every agency to the cloud by next summer. Some agencies, like the General Services Administration, have embraced cloud computing; the agency has cut the I.T. costs on things as simple as its e-mail system by over 50 percent. But other agencies have balked. The State Department, for instance, has raised concerns about whether the cloud approach introduces security risks, since data is stored off site by private contractors. But cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing, because companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies. And government employees are so accustomed to using cloud services like Dropbox and Gmail in their personal lives that, even if their agencies don’t formally permit cloud computing, they use it for work purposes anyway, creating a “shadow I.T.” that leads to a more vulnerable organization than would a properly overseen cloud computing system.  The United States cannot afford to be left behind in the cloud computing revolution. In health care alone, a productivity increase of 1 percent in the next 10 years — much of which could be achieved with cloud-based services — represents a $300 billion value. Similar efficiencies could be realized in sectors like financial services, education and manufacturing. Consider the example of Japan, which has faced significant economic challenges for two decades. The government’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry estimates that the Japanese cloud computing market is likely to reach $20.1 billion by 2015 and is implementing a cloud initiative as a key tenet of its national economic strategy. Similar growth is predicted for India, where the cloud market is projected to grow to $3 billion by 2015 and create 100,000 jobs. As foreign governments prioritize investment in the cloud, the United States cannot hesitate because of hypothetical security threats that serve the entrenched interests of the I.T. cartel. One of the critical remaining issues concerning cloud computing is whether cloud data can and should flow between nations and what restrictions should be placed upon it. The next step should be the creation of a global Cloud First policy that forces nations to work together and resolve these critical issues. The United States, along with leading nations in Europe and Asia, has an opportunity to announce such an initiative at the World Economic Forum meeting in January.  The budget crisis will accelerate the move toward cloud services. Governments, businesses and consumers all have a lot to gain, but not everyone will have an equal say at the table. Public and private organizations that preserve the status quo of wasteful spending will be punished, while those that embrace the cloud will be rewarded with substantial savings and 21st-century jobs. Vivek Kundra, the Obama administrationâs chief information officer from 2009 until this month, is a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society and the Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, both at Harvard.Cambridge, Mass.

It was the latest in a string of breaches that call into question the reliability of certificates that are supposed to verify the authenticity of Web sites. Such breaches make dissidents and human rights workers particularly vulnerable because they can allow repressive regimes, or supporters of those regimes, to spy on their online activities. In this case, the attackers hacked into the site of a Dutch company, one of many that have the authority to issue the digital certificates, and obtained one that they used to impersonate Google. When users in Iran went to a Google site, including Gmail and Google Docs, they could be intercepted by the impostors in what is known as a man-in-the-middle attack. In a statement posted late Monday night on its security blog, Google said those affected “were primarily located in Iran.” It did not offer further details. The Web site certification firm, DigiNotar, revoked the fraudulent certificate as soon as the attack came to light, Google said. F-Secure, a security firm, said on Tuesday that it had found evidence that hackers had left their mark on DigiNotar’s Web site, scrawling the digital equivalent of graffiti and calling themselves “Iranian Hacker.” But it said the pages in question had been on the site for years and were probably unrelated to the certificate problem. Companies like Google are keen to reassure their customers that their online communications are secure, but breaches like this highlight the vulnerability of the certificate system. Similar man-in-the-middle attacks have been used to get between e-commerce sites and their customers to steal credit card numbers and other personal information. A range of government entities and private companies worldwide are authorized to issue authentication certificates. Another issuer was attacked earlier this year by a hacker who said he was a patriotic Iranian. Security experts have been calling for an overhaul of the system.

Such works account for the vast majority of the world’s books, and they are central to Google’s ambitions of creating a universal digital information repository. But its digitization project has prompted numerous lawsuits by publishers seeking to enforce their copyrights. On Thursday, the French publisher La Martinière said that it had agreed to split revenue from digital sales of these books with Google. The accord comes after a similar agreement between Google and Hachette Livre, the largest French publisher. In 2009, La Martinière won a ruling against Google in a Paris court that awarded the publisher 300,000 euros ($420,000), and ordered Google to stop scanning its books. Google appealed that decision, but the two companies said Thursday that they had agreed to end the litigation. Philippe Colombet, director of Google Books in France, said that the deal would allow the company to move forward “in a constructive fashion, to the benefit of French authors and readers.” “This collaboration is an important step in our relations with French publishers and contributes to the preservation and the flourishing of French culture,” he said in a statement. The settlement comes as Google struggles to reach an agreement with United States publishers and authors on out-of-print, copyright-protected works. Last winter, the judge overseeing the case, Denny Chin, rejected a settlement proposal that had already been revised, and talks have bogged down since then. Like the Hachette deal, the agreement with La Martinière is different from the proposed settlement in the United States that Judge Chin rejected in at least one important way: it lets the publisher choose which works can be scanned or sold. Under the American proposal, Google was free to digitize and sell any works unless the copyright holders opted out. “This agreement is very important, it seems to me, because it reaffirms respect for authors and, more broadly, for intellectual property,” said Hervé de la Martinière, president of the publishing house. Google had said it hoped that the Hachette deal would be a model for other agreements with European publishers. But it still faces a lawsuit by three French publishers, Albin Michel, Flammarion and Gallimard, that say that Google scanned thousands of their works without permission.PARIS — A second French publisher has reached a deal on digital books with Google to settle a copyright lawsuit in exchange for control over how its out-of-print, copyright-protected works are scanned and sold.

    <article index="4" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/app-makers-like-the-sound-of-googorola/?ref=googleinc">App Makers Like the Sound of Googorola<date>August 26, 2011, 6:34 pm</date><text>What do app developers think of Google’s union with Motorola? Boink. That’s the name of a mobile dating app developed by Medl Mobile in Orange County, Calif. The app allows two people who each have downloaded Boink to tap their phones together and share personal information about their dating preferences. But Boink has its challenges — at least when it comes to making the app work on Android phones. That’s because Android runs on many kinds of phones, from companies like HTC, Samsung and Motorola, that in many instances must be programmed slightly differently. In an extreme case, Boink’s developers said, HTC phones — which represent a big part of the market — can’t be easily programmed to allow Boink users to bonk their phones and share data. With HTC, there’s no cross-platform Boinking. Earlier this week, my colleague Jenna Wortham and I wrote about Google’s $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility. We heard versions of the Boink story from app developers across the country. They express frustration that apps for Android phones can take longer to build and can be buggier than apps they build for Apple’s iPhone. And some hope that the problem will be alleviated if Google gets more intimate with Motorola. “This is a great move for Google to get into the hardware side. It stands to help developers a lot,” said Dave Swartz, co-founder of Medl Mobile, which has 55 employees and has built apps for, among others, Monster.com, Kaiser Permanente and Emirates Airlines. He and others said that working with Motorola might help Google understand how to make Android work better with all kinds of hardware. But Mr. Swartz said some engineers at his company didn’t agree because they worried that Android would still suffer from glitches on non-Motorola phones. And even if Motorola and Google come up with a smoother way to integrate hardware and software, manufacturers like HTC and Samsung may not want to switch to a new way of doing things. Mike Novak, an Android engineer at GroupMe, a group messaging service, who also organizes Android meetups in New York, is optimistic that if Google poured its energies into buffing its software, consumers would be more eager to buy  apps and games from the Android store, which has been lagging Apple’s in both selection and sales. “I’m hoping that this is the push that really changes the whole game,” he said. “It would be a huge advantage if the software was more consistent. It would help with their competitiveness with Apple.”</text></article>

Just a year after Google bought Slide for more than $200 million, it is shutting all but one of Slide’s social networking apps and saying goodbye to two of its leaders, including its founder, Max Levchin. Slide makes tools, virtual goods and games that people use on social networking sites. Google acquired the company as part of its push into social networking. But when it introduced Google+, its social network, in June, Slide’s apps and team members were not part of it. Slide’s apps join other Google products, including Google Health, Google PowerMeter and Google Labs, that have recently joined the Google cemetery. On the company’s earnings call last month, Larry Page, its chief executive, said that one of his priorities was to simplify product areas and shut down underperforming products. “Greater focus has also been another big feature for me this quarter, more wood behind fewer arrows,” Mr. Page said then. “We’ve done substantial internal work simplifying and streamlining the product line.” Slide was also an example of a team that operated independently within Google. The company had been encouraging such teams, to foster a start-up ethos and satisfy employees who wanted more control over their projects. Max Levchin, Slide’s founder, who was also a founder of PayPal, will leave Google, the company confirmed on Friday. He has not announced what he will do next, but he will first take paternity leave, according to a person briefed on the move who was not authorized to speak publicly. “We wish him the best,” Google said in a statement. “Most of the team from Slide will remain at Google to work on other opportunities.” Many of them will join YouTube, the person said. Jared Fliesler, who was the product director for Slide, will also leave. He is joining Square, the mobile payment start-up, according to another person briefed on the developments. Google will begin to shut all but one of Slide’s products, including Slideshow, SuperPoke! Pets, Video Inbox, Pool Party and Photovine, a mobile photo-sharing app that was released to the public just last week. “While we are incredibly grateful to our users and for all of the wonderful feedback over the years, many of these products are no longer as active or haven’t caught on as we originally hoped,” Slide said in a blog post. One Slide app’s life will be saved: Prizes.org. It is for crowdsourcing tasks, like writing a wedding speech or designing a logo, in exchange for money. Unlike other Slide apps, is operated out of Google’s China office.

For more information, go to fringenyc.org. “Are you there Google? It’s me, Riley.” That prayer — and opening scene — is created not by Judy Blume but by a pack of Fordham University undergraduates. Their new play “Technodoulia Dot Com,” whose title comes from a Greek word meaning “enslavement to technology,” casts Google as the almighty overlord that oversees us all. The show is culled from the real-life e-mails, Twitter messages and blog posts of its five energetic performers, who researched their own digital footsteps. Kate Gagnon, the director, has spun these findings into a series of autobiographical and goofy, if sometimes derivative, sketches. In one, flashing lights and frenetic dancing represent a locked MySpace page (if only Tom Feeney could remember the password for that embarrassing profile he created when he was 14!). In another, pulsating orgy tableaux represent porn pop-ups. Perhaps most amusingly, at one point the actors burst into a chorus of meows and chants of “I can haz cheezburger?” In addition to bringing online memes to life, much of the show consists of gentle, “Seinfeld”-esque observational humor about all the annoying things people do on their cellphones when they’re supposed to be paying attention, yada yada yada. The darker segments — pontifications on the alienation enabled by telecommunications and the true nature of friendship and love — sometimes fall a little flat, since the troupe doesn’t have much original (or particularly eloquent) commentary to add to the societal discussion about such subjects.

More on ArtsBeat » Still, the show is spunky and fun, and some of the design elements are very clever. Tara De Vincenzo’s neofuturistic costumes, for example, include a sort of necklace made of clip-on book lights, which illuminate the actors’ faces from below to mimic the glow of a cellphone. There’s also something intriguing about a play that frequently demonizes technology and its decimation of the human attention span, but whose program still encourages audience members to send out live Twitter messages during the show.

The question is: Does anybody care?The competitive landscape looks absolutely brutal. There’s the iPhone, whose 29 percent of the app phone market is the result of 110 million slavering fans and a bottomless app store. Rumor has it that Apple is readying a new iPhone for release this fall. Nobody will ask, “Does anybody care?” about that one. Then there’s Google. Its Android phone operating system now has 52 percent of the market. About the only thing that could make Google more powerful now is a book of Hogwarts spells. Is RIM up to this battle? It’s not looking good. Its market share is sinking because it is giving up customers to Apple and Google. The company is laying off 11 percent of its work force (2,000 people). Its shares recently hit their lowest point since 2006. A series of anonymous letters posted at bgr.com report chaos and flagging morale among the workers. One product after another is delayed. In April, one of RIM’s two chief executives, clearly stressed out, stormed out of a BBC television interview. That was just about the same time that RIM released its iPad clone, called the PlayBook — filled with bugs and enormous feature holes (for example, no built-in e-mail program or calendar). But listen: for the sake of argument, let’s pretend that nobody knew any of that. Let’s pretend that the new BlackBerry Bold 9900 existed in a vacuum. How is it? Gorgeous, for one thing. Stainless steel makes its first appearance on a BlackBerry — a classy rim around the sides, making a nice complement to the shiny front and holographic-patterned back. The keys, buttons and tiny trackpad glow white, which is handy in both dim and bright lighting. It’s also the thinnest BlackBerry ever. It’s substantially wider than the iPhone, but at only 0.41 inches thick, it’s nearly iPhone thin (0.37 inches). And it’s fast, thanks to a high-octane processor inside. Yet its battery can still get you easily through a day, maybe even two, on a single charge. The 9900 has a spectacularly comfortable physical keyboard, with exactly the right amount of clickiness. The iPhone approach — typing on glass — is more efficient when you want to type accent marks or change languages. But the rest of the time, no question: the BlackBerry keyboard rules. Especially this one. Yet, for the first time on a slab-style BlackBerry, the keyboard is accompanied by a beautiful, responsive touch screen. It’s only half height, like BlackBerry Bolds of yore, which gets claustrophobic when you’re trying to use the GPS or the Web browser. But it’s sharp and bright and fluid. Two other new BlackBerry models are also appearing this month: one all-touch screen model, and one with a slide-out keyboard. Along with the 9900, they’re the first phones to come with the BlackBerry 7 operating system. It’s not a huge leap ahead of BlackBerry 6, and it’s certainly not the complete overhaul (based on something called QNX) that the company promises on new phones next year. But it’s perfectly lovely, modern and efficient. And, apart from the baffling Apps screen (which displays only the icons but no text or labels for your apps), it’s easy to figure out. The scrolling strip of app icons just above the keyboard is especially useful. With each swipe of your thumb, you bring another set of six icons into view: Frequent, Favorites, Downloads and Media, for example, which greatly reduces the number of steps you need to get to the stuff you’re most likely to want. A tap at the top of the screen gives you instant access to your settings for cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the alarm clock; a tap on the strip just below that opens up the summary of notifications, like new e-mail messages and text messages. BlackBerry 7 also offers much faster Web browsing (you can pinch and zoom with two fingers to zoom in and out, as on the iPhone) and a digital compass. There’s a dedicated shutter button for the five-megapixel camera, which can also capture 720p high-definition video. It has a flash, but no autofocus. The pictures and videos look very good, and it’s easy to send them to your friends. But here’s another spot where that half-height screen really feels confining if you’re used to a full-face iPhone or Android screen. There are eight gigabytes of built-in storage, and a memory-card slot that can give you up to 32 more gigabytes. 1 2 Next Page » E-mail: pogue@nytimes.comResearch in Motion just unveiled a new smartphone, the BlackBerry Bold 9900.

The “McAfee Threats Report” said that a rise in “hacktivism” from groups like Lulz Security, or LulzSec, and Anonymous, helped drive a drastic increase in online attacks in recent months. McAfee also found that Google Android is now the most targeted mobile platform by hackers. Over the past several months LulzSec caused havoc online when it began hacking dozens of Web sites belonging to government agencies and corporations. McAfee said in its report that LulzSec’s brazen hacks were done with the hope of bringing turmoil to the Web, mostly for fun, rather than a monetary goal. Although some suspected members of LulzSec have been arrested by police, there are new threats that have emerged by hackers who are targeting Android users. “There is malware ending up on Android phones that is coming out of China and is being used to steal the identity of Android users,” said Dave Marcus, director of security research at McAfee Labs, in a phone interview. “Once hackers take control of an Android device, they have access to any kind of information on there including personal data, GPS logs and carrier and billing code information.” McAfee said in its report that Android was previously the third most targeted mobile device by hackers; it is is now No. 1 — not a title Google will likely be proud of. Google did not respond to a request for comment about the McAfee report. Mr. Marcus said Android users have become the top target for malware developers because Google does not use a vetting process to monitor the distribution of new mobile apps. Anyone can share an app on the Google Marketplace, including hackers who hide malware inside free mobile software and games. In comparison, Apple monitors and approves each application it allows into the iTunes App Store. “We certainly see this trend to hack mobile phones as something that is going to continue to grow over the next year,” Mr. Marcus said. “These cyber criminals are having some success when it comes to stealing information through Trojan viruses on Android phones. Why would they stop if it’s working?”</text></article>
    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/technology/technology-devices-either-sell-big-or-die-fast.html?ref=googleinc">Technology Devices Either Sell Big or Die Fast<date>Published: August 23, 2011</date><text>Seven weeks after it was put on sale, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, the company’s competitor to Apple’s iPad.Last year, Microsoft pulled the plug on its Kin mobile phones only 48 days after they went on sale. In recent years, technology companies have been cutting their losses with increasing speed. Google proudly released Wave, its platform of collaborative work tools, to the general public in May 2010. It canceled Wave 77 days later. Palm announced its first tablet, the Foleo, on May 30, 2007. By Sept. 4, the company halted development and the product was never sold. Pure Digital, maker of the Flip camcorder, had planned to release the Flip-Live on April 13, but Cisco, which had acquired Pure Digital in 2009, shut the entire division on April 12. These days, big technology companies — particularly those in the hypercompetitive smartphone and tablet industries — are starting to resemble Hollywood film studios. Every release needs to be a blockbuster, and the only measure of success is the opening-weekend gross. There is little to no room for the sleeper indie hit that builds good word of mouth to become a solid performer over time. When Microsoft released the Xbox 360 in 2005, there were widespread reliability issues and the console faced serious competition from the Nintendo Wii, yet the company stayed the course, and now the Xbox is one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time. That kind of tenacity seems to be in diminishing supply. Some analysts trace the origin of this blockbuster-or-bust mentality to Apple. Each release of the company’s popular iPads and iPhones crosses over into being a mainstream media event. Al Hilwa, an analyst at the research firm IDC, described the accelerated lifecycle of high-end hardware as “Darwinian.” “There’s a level of desperation from anyone whose name is not Apple,” said Mr. Hilwa. The crush of tech bloggers and Twitter-using early adopters who chronicle every bit of news — good and bad — about new phones and tablets also raises the stakes around how well new products perform in the marketplace. “You know pretty quickly, and in a very public way, whether a product is successful or not,” said Mr. Hilwa. Similar to opening week at the movies, early reviews on the Web panning a new tablet or phone can be disastrous for its makers. “Once you lose momentum, it's hard to regain it,” said Chris Jones, an analyst at Canalys. The rapid life cycles of products can play with the affections of consumers, who may rush out to be the first on their block with a new product, only to find that the manufacturer has canceled any future support or development weeks after it went on sale. Neal LoCurto, the owner of TeamLogic IT, an information technology consulting company in Syosset, N.Y., said he bought his TouchPad the morning it went on sale. “On release day I went to Best Buy that morning and waited at the door,” Mr. LoCurto said. “I was the first one in and the first one out.” Mr. LoCurto, who ultimately grew unhappy with the TouchPad because of the lack of apps, received a refund for his TouchPad, but he says he no longer trusts H.P. “I feel like they lied to us,” Mr. LoCurto said. “They didn’t give it a chance.” Companies kill new products more quickly now because of the higher cost of staying competitive, said Jim McGregor, research director for In-Stat, a market research firm. Quickly pulling the plug on an obvious failure makes sense, although it can be embarrassing. “The life cycles are very short because there is obviously huge competition,” Mr. McGregor said. “Even if you do have a blockbuster, you know you’re going to get leapfrogged in six months. You have to come out with something that really knocks off the pants and then follow it up. You can’t just sit there and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got a success.’ ” In the case of the TouchPad, analysts agree it failed because its operating system, webOS, had few of the apps that made Apple’s iPad a runaway hit, he said. Microsoft’s Kin had a similar problem. Mr. McGregor said that Google TV, Google’s Internet-connected television accessory, faded into obscurity because of content providers declined to make their content available. Google had lined up various manufacturers as partners, including LG, Toshiba and Sharp, only to tell many of them last December to delay the release of their Google TV products. While Google’s strategy for Google TV remains unclear, none of those partners have come out with a Google TV product. “The content is worth more than the device,” said Mr. McGregor. “If you don’t have everything — the content, the applications and the experience — you might as well drop your anchor and jump off the ship.” Even mighty Apple was not always so skilled. Like other companies today, Apple suffered a streak of bad luck with new products more than a decade ago and, like them, it cut its losses. The company killed the Power Mac G4 Cube, a desktop computer, in 2001 after only 11 months because consumers believed the price was too high and balked at having to buy a monitor separately. Two days after announcing it would kill the TouchPad, H.P. started unloading its inventory through a fire sale. The steep discount — 80 percent off the original price — succeeded in setting off a buying frenzy that H.P.’s executives had hoped for when they introduced the device. H.P.’s online store, along with Best Buy, Target and Wal-Mart, quickly ran out of TouchPads after putting them on sale for $100 for the 16G version and $150 for the 32G version. When originally available in July, they were listed at $500 and $600. People strategized on online message boards about how to find a TouchPad. H.P.’s call center was overwhelmed. “All this clamoring for the TouchPad, kind of bittersweet,” H.P.’s customer service arm said in a post on Twitter.Seven weeks after it was put on sale, Hewlett-Packard killed its TouchPad tablet, the company’s competitor to Apple’s iPad.</text></article>
    <article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/technology/facebook-aims-to-simplify-its-privacy-settings.html?ref=googleinc">Facebook Aims to Simplify Its Privacy Settings<date>Published: August 23, 2011</date><text>Privacy worries have bedeviled Facebook since its early days, from the introduction of the endless scroll of data known as the news feed to, most recently, the use of facial recognition technology to identify people in photographs. At the nub of all those worries, of course, is how much people share on Facebook, with whom and — perhaps most important — how well they understand the potential consequences. The company has struggled to find a balance between giving users too little control over privacy and giving them too much, for fear they won’t share much at all. Seeking a happy medium, Facebook announced changes on Tuesday that it says will help users get a grip on what they share. When the changes are introduced on Thursday, every time Facebook users add a picture, comment or any other content to their profile pages, they can specify who can see it: all of their so-called Facebook friends, a specific group of friends, or everyone who has access to the Internet. These will be indicated by icons that replace the current, more complicated padlock menu. Similar controls will apply to information like users’ phone numbers and hometowns and whether they like, say, death metal bands, on their profile pages. Users will no longer have to seek out a separate privacy page to tweak who sees how much of that personal information. Nor will they have to bother to remember what those settings were. Company officials say they hope the changes will simplify the process of establishing who knows what about your life on the Internet — and hopefully, save a few people the embarrassment of unwittingly sharing too much. “We want to make this stuff unmistakably clear,” Chris Cox, vice president for product at Facebook, said in an interview. “It has to be clear that Facebook is a leader in how people control who sees what.” Implicit in these changes is the challenge brought on by Facebook’s own success. It is used by 750 million people worldwide, with varying degrees of knowledge about what it means to have a life online. There is the looming prospect that the company will go public, along with the abiding concern about potential government regulation or litigation stemming from privacy issues. Not least, there is the need for Facebook to cultivate the trust of its users, amid growing competition from Google’s nascent social networking service, Google Plus, which emphasizes more compartmentalized communications with different sets of friends and acquaintances. Facebook dismissed the notion that the changes were fueled by competition. Company officials took pains to tell reporters that they had briefed privacy advocates on the changes — including those who have been critical of Facebook — and solicited their feedback. It is too early to tell whether users will find the changes more inviting or simpler, or whether they will reduce what Kurt Opsahl, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, called “the amount of unintentional oversharing on Facebook.” Privacy advocates warned that the new tools did not address a concern about sharing location. One Facebook user can publish information about another user’s whereabouts without his or her consent — whether it’s an employee at the beach on the day he or she called in sick or a husband at a strip club without his wife’s knowledge. Other privacy experts say that if users believe they have control over who sees what, they are more likely to share. “I think it’s part of an evolution to push back at the notion that Facebook is trying to trick you into sharing,” said Jules Polonetsky of the Future of Privacy Forum, which is based in Washington. “You’re more likely to do so when you know what you’re doing.” The new tools represent a departure from Facebook’s more recent approach, in which users found much of what they posted — tags, photos and so on — to be widely accessible unless they explicitly specified otherwise. The default position, in other words, was to opt for sharing. Mr. Cox said the new tools were meant to demystify privacy controls and ensure that Facebook users were never “surprised” by what others could see about them. That includes pictures in which they have been “tagged.” No longer will an unflattering or compromising photograph appear on your profile page without your consent, though the publisher of the photograph can still keep it up on his or her own page. Users will be able to approve every picture in which they are tagged before it appears on their profile pages. Additionally, the privacy option that is now called “everyone” will instead be called “public.” Facebook executives say they want to dispel any doubts about what the setting means. If you click “public,” that means anyone who is online can see what you are posting, including perfect strangers — or, worse, parents, prospective employers and your ex-wife’s divorce lawyers. “We need to offer fine granularity in order to be a universally usable tool,” Mr. Cox said. With the new settings, “it’s more visual and prominent who the audience is.” Indeed, company officials say feedback from users suggest that pictures work better than words. So now, icons guide the way. “Public” is represented by a globe; “friends” by a pair of heads.Privacy worries have bedeviled Facebook since its early days, from the introduction of the endless scroll of data known as the news feed to, most recently, the use of facial recognition technology to identify people in photographs.

    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

Competition benefits consumers. This is not a ideological screed, just a simple observation about what happens to goods and services when there is more than one provider of that product. I’m ultimately talking about the state of the tablet industry, but let’s start by talking about cars. Let’s say you were going to buy a family sedan today. You would have several options to choose from: the Toyota Camry, the Honda Accord, the Ford Fusion and the Hyundai Sonata are just a few that leap to mind. If you were researching these cars, you would discover a couple of things: Each model has won some magazine’s multicar comparison or another, and the overall opinion would be that these cars, as a group, are all quite good. Personal preferences and the availabilities of certain pricing deals may sway your opinion one way or another, but nobody could reasonably say that the car you picked was materially worse than another. And that’s because competition breeds excellence. Ask anyone who pays attention to the car industry and they will tell you that the family-sedan segment is just brutal, with manufacturers fighting tooth and nail over every sale. In fact, that market has become more competitive in recent years. It used to just be the Camry and the Accord fighting for supremacy, but now you have new (Hyundai) and old (Ford) competitors, among others, joining the fight with interesting, well-made, compelling products. It’s a great time to be shopping for a new family sedan. Compare that with the state of the tablet market today. Hewlett-Packard is in retreat. Research in Motion is in a holding pattern. Motorola has been sold and its tablet is now an afterthought. Samsung fights the good fight, but it trails Apple’s market share by 50 percentage points. Apple is not just ahead of the pack, it almost is the pack. Now, some would say that this is also a simple result of economic laws at work: Apple makes a superior product, therefore it gets most of the sales. Great. But you know what would be really great? Apple and Google/Microsoft/H.P./Anyone locked in an epic battle for tablet supremacy, each side releasing new and better products at a furious pace, each dropping prices substantially at a steady clip. Now, some would argue that this is already happening — that Apple is driving innovation and creativity with each upgrade of the iPad it releases. But think what it would be like if you had two companies doing that — or three. This isn’t about whether you prefer Apple or Android for your tablet. This isn’t about picking sides. As a consumer, I want there to be robust competition across the board. I want Coke and Pepsi. Target and Wal-Mart. Engadget and Gizmodo. If you’re a fan of Apple, you want there to be a worthy rival to push it, to keep its feet to the fire. If you don’t like Apple, you want someone else in the game so that Apple doesn’t suck all the air out of the room. And you want Apple to do the same pushing and foot-scorching to its competitor that another company would do to it. In any market, as far as the consumer is concerned, there should be blood.</text></article>
    <article index="2" href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/24/google-reaches-500-million-settlement-with-government/?ref=googleinc">Google Reaches $500 Million Settlement With Government<date>August 24, 2011, 10:23 am</date><text>10:42 p.m. | Updated Google will pay $500 million to settle federal government charges that it has knowingly shown illegal ads for fraudulent Canadian pharmacies in the United States, the Justice Department announced on Wednesday. The federal investigation, which was first revealed in May, found that Google was aware that some Canadian pharmacies that advertised on its site failed to require a prescription for substances like the painkiller Oxycontin and the stimulant Ritalin. Google continued to accept their money and assisted the pharmacies in placing ads and improving their Web sites, according to the Justice Department. Illegal online pharmacies have been a challenge for regulators, because the Internet makes it easy for them to operate under the radar and emerge under different names when they get shut down. Search engines like Google drive much of the traffic to these sites, say researchers who study online pharmacies. Web sites are liable for advertising that breaks federal criminal law. Since 2009, when it became aware of the investigation, Google has taken significant steps to chase illegal pharmacies from its site. “Google does have a responsibility in this regard,” said Susan E. Foster, director of policy research and analysis at Columbia University’s National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. “To the extent that they continue to allow ads for illegal pharmacies, they’re aiding and abetting the problem and profiting from it as well.” In a statement Wednesday, Google said that it banned advertising of prescription drugs in the United States by Canadian pharmacies “some time ago.” The statement continued, “However, it’s obvious with hindsight that we shouldn’t have allowed these ads on Google in the first place.” In a statement issued by the Justice Department, James M. Cole, a deputy attorney general, said, “This settlement ensures that Google will reform its improper advertising practices with regard to these pharmacies while paying one of the largest financial forfeiture penalties in history.” The $500 million fine covers both revenue that Google earned from the illegal advertisers and revenue that the rogue Canadian pharmacies received from American customers buying controlled drugs. Google had said in May that the fine decreased its quarterly profit by 22 percent. Under the settlement, Google also acknowledged that it had improperly aided the rogue pharmacies, and it agreed to strict compliance measures. The online ad business for health care and pharmaceutical companies is expected to be $1.6 billion this year, up 24 percent from $1.3 billion last year, according to eMarketer, a digital marketing research firm. Google has been fighting rogue online pharmacies since 2003, and Sheryl Sandberg, former vice president for global online sales at Google and currently the chief operating officer at Facebook, testified before the Senate in 2004 that Google had the problem under control. According to a former Google executive, who would speak only anonymously because the person was not authorized to discuss the business, said Google did not turn a blind eye to the pharmaceutical advertising, but rather played a game of Whac-A-Mole with the rogue pharmacies. Over the last two years, Google has made changes to crack down on rogue pharmacy advertisers. After Google became aware of the investigation, it has required that all Canadian pharmacy advertisers be certified by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association and has specified that they can advertise to Canadian customers only. American pharmacy advertisers must be certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy. Google had previously relied on the private firms Square Trade and PharmacyChecker.com to certify pharmacy advertisers, but according to PharmacyChecker.com and the Justice Department, advertisers that never applied nonetheless appeared on Google. Google has also always monitored ads shown for drug-related keywords, like “painkiller” or “Ritalin.” But Michael Zwibelman, litigation counsel for Google, has described its policing efforts as “an ongoing, escalating cat-and-mouse game.” “As we and others build new safeguards and guidelines, rogue online pharmacies always try new tactics to get around those protections and illegally sell drugs on the Web,” Mr. Zwibelman wrote in a company blog post last year. The investigation, which was led by officials from the United States attorney’s office for the District of Rhode Island, headed by Peter Neronha, and the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, began during an unrelated financial fraud investigation, the Justice Department said. The target of that inquiry fled to Mexico and began illegally advertising drugs through Google’s AdWords program. After he was apprehended, he began cooperating with the government, which created undercover Web sites to advertise the illegal sale of drugs on Google. Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said the settlement showed that the United States government was taking an increasingly active role in regulating the Web. “They’re going out of their way to cut off these bad actors internationally and enlisting U.S. enterprises to help them in that fight,” he said.</text></article>

As with the rebel advance into Tripoli, Libyan supplies to the global market could come sooner than expected. Brent crude prices slipped by as much as $3 to almost $106 a barrel at one point on Monday, before rebounding later in the day. A resolution in Libya, coupled with concerns over global growth, means tight markets could soon look oversupplied. A return of Libyan oil production to levels before the unrest, 1.7 million barrels a day, or 2 percent of global supply, would take until 2015, according to a June estimate from the International Energy Agency. The forecast may now look too pessimistic, with the rebel-controlled Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Repsol of Spain, and Eni of Italy all suggesting that normal supply could resume much faster once the crisis is resolved. Analysts estimate that daily production could reach up to a million barrels within a year. Oil prices have eased almost $20 a barrel in four months. A supply increase, just as the American and European economies look vulnerable to a new recession, will further weigh on prices. And Saudi Arabia’s recent effort to offset the disruption from Libya, taking production to a record high of almost 10 million barrels a day, will act to compound any supply glut, as will the International Energy Agency’s release of reserves. Yet any price slump is likely to be less severe than in 2008, when oil prices crashed by more than $100 a barrel in six months. This time around, credit lines remain open to businesses. And oil demand remains strong from certain rapidly growing countries like China, which account for almost 50 percent of total global consumption, compared with 44 percent in 2008, according to Barclays Capital. Politics will further support prices. Investors remain alert for signs that the protest movement could spread to larger oil producers like Iran. And even if prices do continue to fall, high-spending gulf countries have an incentive to cut production quickly. Saudi Arabia’s budget needs roughly $84 a barrel to break even, compared with around $50 a barrel three years ago. But with Brent prices some way off the pain threshold for producers, there’s still room for adjustment. A Murky Patent War Today’s costly technology patent wars in many ways can be pinned on the courts. Google, Apple, Microsoft and others are spending billions of dollars for the rights to the ideas powering devices like smartphones. But what they’re actually buying is legal protection. The next wave of rulings ought to sync up the law with the real world. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is the exclusive forum for patent appeals, created in 1982 to keep the law consistent. But that consistency produced decisions upholding patents so broadly it was hard to tell exactly what they covered. In the 1990s, for example, software patent approvals began. Unlike with other inventions, they required only general descriptions — not code or other information specifying how concepts worked. The court used similarly loose standards to approve patents for business methods and certain technology. Judges may have been trying to promote innovation. But the practical result has been overlapping claims to some of tech’s most valuable ideas. It means firms like Google cannot identify all the patents that may cover, say, the Android mobile operating system. The company’s chief legal officer says as many as 250,000 patents might apply to a smartphone. That has led companies to introduce their products first and face consequences later. In the case of Android, Microsoft has asked Samsung to pay as much as $15 for each device using the software because of accusations of infringement. Microsoft is also suing in federal court to ban Motorola’s Android phones. The latest tack, though, is to deter lawsuits and royalty demands by acquiring patent portfolios. By doing so, companies can counter infringement threats with claims of their own. It is also a way to establish détente. A more reasonable approach would be stricter approval standards. The Supreme Court seemed to agree last year when it affirmed the rejection of a proposed business-method patent. The decision comes too late for companies that have spent freely for infringement fights. But it bodes well for those that would rather use patents to promote innovation than squelch it.

They testify to the pride in innovation at Motorola, a luminary of American business that has survived corporate crises and enormous technological change.But the company has never grappled with something like this: a murky future governed by Google, a powerful master with unclear intentions. In announcing its planned $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility last week, Google emphasized its interest in the company’s rich trove of 17,000 patents. That portfolio would allow Google to defend itself against foes like Apple and Microsoft in the legal arena, where billions of dollars in patent licensing fees can be indirectly negotiated through lawsuits and countersuits. But while industry analysts and insiders say the rationale makes sense, they also say it leaves Motorola in an unusual position. Many acquisitions are aimed at creating some well-articulated synergy between the two companies, but Motorola’s future role in this union — beyond patent warehouse — is unclear. Heightening the uncertainty is that the companies involved, both of which declined to comment, are in some ways as different as two technology companies can be. Google makes Internet services and software, thrives on high profit margins and distributes its product using giant data centers. Motorola makes hardware, has modest margins on a good day and moves its products on trucks and airplanes and through brick-and-mortar stores. Some hope the cultures will fuse and lead Motorola to a future as storied as its past. Martin Cooper, 82, who worked at Motorola for 30 years and developed the first hand-held cellphones there, said he hoped great things would come from combining Google’s momentum and confidence with Motorola’s tradition of excellence in radio technology. “The combination might make Motorola successful — again,” said Mr. Cooper, whose patent from the early 1970s for cellular phone technology is among those that hang at the company’s entrance. At the least, industry analysts said Motorola almost certainly would become a laboratory for Google to seek to perfect Android, its mobile phone software, in concert with newly acquired hardware engineers. Others say Google may wind up giving financial backing to Motorola to help it revive its flagging fortunes in Europe and Asia. But if it appears to be getting too cozy with Motorola, Google risks upsetting other mobile phone makers like HTC and Samsung, who build some of the most popular smartphones and tablets running on Android. “How do you compete with your partners and also work with them?” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Capital, who called the situation a “head-scratcher.” Google has said it will allow Motorola to run independently. But some analysts and investors think Google could markedly pare back or sell big parts of Motorola that create conflicts with partners or are not central to its goals. And that makes for uncertain times for the 19,000 employees at Motorola Mobility in Libertyville, a northern suburb of Chicago, and around the world. “It’s like, thanks for everything you did in the 20th century, but you’re being bought by a search engine,” said Roger Entner, a telecommunications industry analyst and founder of Recon Analytics, a market research firm. He added, “Nobody ever buys a company and leaves it alone.” Motorola traces its beginnings to 1928, when two brothers, Paul and Joseph Galvin, started a company making power converters for household radios. In 1947 it changed its name to Motorola, after its popular car radio brand. The company produced radio phones that helped American troops communicate in World War II, car phones in the 1980s, and the trend-setting MicroTac and Razr cellphones, among other products. But in recent years, after the Razr’s popularity faded, Motorola flirted with financial doom. It was only in the last few quarters that it surged back under the leadership of Sanjay Jha, a former executive at Qualcomm, who joined Motorola in 2008 when it was in danger of missing the rise of the smartphone. He made significant changes, cutting thousands of employees and splitting the business in two: Motorola Solutions, which sells equipment to businesses, and Motorola Mobility, which handles consumer products like phones and set-top boxes. 1 2 Next Page »Hundreds of framed patents hang on two separate walls at the headquarters of Motorola Mobility in Libertyville, Ill.

    <article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/sunday-review/google-goes-hardware-shopping.html?ref=googleinc">Google Goes Hardware Shopping<date>Published: August 20, 2011</date><text>Steve Lohr is a technology reporter for The New York Times.“MOVE bits, not atoms.” It has been the motto of the Internet age, coined by Nicholas Negroponte and popularized in his 1995 best seller, “Being Digital.” Mr. Negroponte, founder of the M.I.T. Media Lab, was saying that innovation and fortunes would increasingly be made doing imaginative things with the basic elements of computing — bits, short for binary digits — instead of working with the atoms of the physical world. No company has followed that advice more single-mindedly and lucratively than Google. The search giant is the ultimate digital company, and its most precious assets are its algorithms — software snippets of distilled mathematical intelligence. As Steven Levy writes in his book “In the Plex,” the company’s DNA is “rooted in the primacy of algorithms” and its young leaders believe “in a future guided by benevolent algorithms.” Yet Google announced last week that it would pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, a maker of smartphones. It is a big bet and a step into the messy physical world of selling products to people — and perhaps a sign of the times. Even Google, analysts say, recognizes that its prosperity will depend on mastering atoms as well as bits. That is particularly the case, they add, in the new growth markets for search advertising on smartphones and tablets, where software and hardware must knit seamlessly together for a pleasing consumer experience. The digital future, it seems, will be less a takeover of the physical world than a marriage with it. “This bits-atoms dichotomy is becoming less and less true,” said Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the M.I.T. Center for Digital Business. “And Google understands that it needs a deeper knowledge of product design and hardware to get the most value from its bits business, search and search advertising.” Google, to be sure, is buying Motorola Mobility for more than its phone-making expertise. Motorola holds more than 17,000 patents, and that portfolio could be a formidable shield against patent-infringement claims. The industry has been rife with suits and countersuits recently, as competition in the marketplace spills over into the courts. Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, in different cases, have accused Google or the companies that use its Android smartphone operating system, including Motorola, of infringing on their patents. It is possible that the patents are the prize in the Motorola deal, and that Google will sell off the phone business sometime later. But in a blog post, Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, mainly emphasized the business opportunity ahead. “Together,” Mr. Page wrote, “we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem.” Android has proved extremely popular with phone makers, and its market share of new handsets sold is now well ahead that of Apple, the pioneer and pace-setter in smartphones. But Google licenses Android to 39 handset makers worldwide, and the operating system is free and open-source, which means the manufacturers can tweak and tailor the software. Google’s openness comes at a cost; the phones vary widely, and some customers complain that Android phones are clunky and confusing to use. So Google is borrowing a page from its Silicon Valley neighbor. “In fast-changing technology product markets, there is a real advantage to controlling both the hardware and the software — that’s the genius of Apple,” said Thomas R. Eisenmann, a professor at Harvard Business School. The Motorola Mobility venture, business experts say, promises to educate Google about consumers — and just how cranky and demanding they can be. In its search and advertising business, Google deals with consumers at arm’s length, online and through software. Users type in search queries, contributing vital raw data that Google’s clever algorithms mine to produce more useful search results and more accurately directed ads. Google is a triumph of computer-automated efficiency. For the most part, the formula works to the benefit of all — people searching for information, advertisers pursuing customers online, and Web publishers seeking ad dollars. It works best of all for Google, which is collecting profits at the rate of about $10 billion a year. Still, the approach can be mechanical and brittle. When Google decides to evict a small Web publisher from its ad service, it sends a computer-generated form letter with the bad news. It says the Web site “poses a risk of generating invalid activity.” Why, the publisher might ask? You will never find out from Google. The only appeal is to fill out a Web form. Good luck. You can’t talk to an algorithm. Last year, Google tried selling its own smartphone, the Nexus One, manufactured by HTC of Taiwan, through an online store. The experiment was folded after a few months. When buying a complex gadget, most consumers want to see the product, touch it, get a little hand-holding and help. Apple certainly knows that, as any visit to its stores makes clear. Can’t figure something out? Make an appointment at the Genius Bar, and friendly, knowledgeable Apple employees will most likely solve your problem. Buy the wrong connector cord or some gizmo, and bring it back a few days after the 14-day return policy expires? No problem. It is commerce guided by human accommodation. No one expects Google to open stores or drastically change its corporate culture. But for the Motorola purchase to pay off, Google is “going to have to master new skills like customer service and industrial product design for consumer products,” said Mr. Eisenmann of Harvard Business School. “It’s going to be a challenge for Google, but it’s not impossible by any means.” Google, after all, often describes itself as a learning machine.Steve Lohr is a technology reporter for The New York Times.</text></article>

    <article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/us/19cncgreising.html?ref=googleinc">A Different Kind of Corporate Breakup<date>Published: August 18, 2011</date><text>David Greising writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.It was less than a year ago that the company now known as Motorola Mobility was just a struggling cellphone unit that its parent company, Motorola Inc., couldn’t seem to give away even if it tried. And boy, did it try. Now Google’s planned $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility — with its valuable cache of technology patents — is proof that in a world of uncertainty and economic peril, almost anything can happen. Even something good. For Chicago, it’s a lesson worth noting because Motorola is not the only local company that has taken a cleaver to its corporate structure. Kraft Foods announced early this month that it would split in two. Sara Lee is also doing so. Fortune Brands and General Growth, too. Look around, and this strategy through separation is now largely a Chicago phenomenon. In no other city are so many companies pursuing a go-it-apart tactic. Chicago is becoming the bust-up capital of the economy. As often as not, a breakup is a substitute for strategy. Motorola could no longer make its cellphone unit work or sell it, so dividing the company in two was the next best step. Kraft and Sara Lee, the two most notable bust-ups also under way, have come to the same point but for different reasons. All three became corporate giants that in the end did not hold together. What all had in common was that management at some point decided there was no way out, except splitting in half and hoping for the best. When Kraft bought Cadbury for $19.6 billion last year, it overcame resistance from Cadbury executives who had scoffed that the Cheez Whiz company had no business buying Britain’s king of confections. One of Kraft’s biggest investors, Warren Buffett, seconded that notion. Turns out the skeptics were right. And Kraft’s planned split into separate snack foods and grocery businesses all but reverses the Cadbury purchase. Likewise, Sara Lee. The company spent decades gobbling up companies with brand-name appeal: Jimmy Dean sausages, Douwe Egberts coffee, Kiwi shoe polish, Coach accessories, Hanes apparel, L’eggs hosiery. Sara Lee hoped to bring marketing know-how and corporate efficiency to this grab bag. When the plan proved too difficult to execute and Wall Street found it did not like Sara Lee, the company’s latest squad of new management chose a breakup as the only viable option. Motorola is a different case. Big mergers were never a core strategy at the company of innovators who invented the car radio and then the cellphone. If anything, Motorola over the years was too insular, and insularity made it vulnerable to a company like Nokia, which came from nowhere to steal leadership in the cellphone business. Motorola never quite recovered. The Razr phenomenon came and went, and by the time the vulture investor Carl Icahn swooped in three years ago and began agitating for radical change, it seemed Motorola would have no next, winning act. The company needed to split in two, and it did so in January. Cellphones would become somebody else’s problem — er, opportunity. The unsexy but profitable infrastructure business would be called Motorola Solutions. Goodbye, Moto. Even after the split, Motorola Mobility floundered. With management still struggling for strategic direction, the stock fell 40 percent as the broader market dropped just 10 percent. Mr. Icahn demanded that the company consider selling its patents, as the failed Nortel Networks had. Then Google comes along, pays a 63 percent premium with its $12.5 billion offer, and it’s Hello again, Moto. In Google’s hands, Motorola’s trove of patents and cellphone expertise could become the font of a new wave of innovation, and a boon for Chicago too, if Motorola’s research operation could remain in Libertyville. Sam Hamadeh, chief executive of PrivCo.com, has paid attention to Chicago lately because of Groupon. Analysts like him see in the hype over Groupon, and now in Motorola’s Google deal, mounting evidence of a divided investment mindset. “You see a larger division between winners and losers,” Mr. Hamadeh said. “I think that’s what’s going on in the economy in general.” Companies like Motorola, Kraft and Sara Lee spent years trying to convince investors that they had a winning strategy. They did not succeed. In today’s tough economy, the market had stopped listening to their pitch. A breakup, at the very least, creates a new story. And Google’s bid for Motorola Mobility shows that sometimes the story can open with a very happy start. dgreising@chicagonewscoop.orgDavid Greising writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.</text></article>

The $2.5 billion breakup fee was also probably driven by Google’s likely refusal of a “hell or high water” provision. But while Motorola may have pushed for the high fee in exchange, the company must put up with a lot in the meantime. The acquisition agreement sharply regulates how Motorola can run its business in ways beyond normal deal terms. It prohibits Motorola from: 1) terminating any employee at or above the level of corporate vice president without consulting Google 2) increasing salaries and benefits for employees at or above the level of corporate vice president by more than 5 percent in any year period 3) substantially changing Motorola’s option and other incentive plan systems no matter how many times headhunters call 4) making capital expenditures greater than $50 million individually and $225 million in the aggregate in 2012 5) making any acquisition of more than $150 million 6) incurring debt greater than $250 million These are very tight restrictions and will keep Motorola on a very short leash, dependent upon Google until this acquisition closes.

    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>

    <article index="1" href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/18/behind-googles-huge-breakup-fee-in-motorola-deal/?ref=googleinc">Behind Google's Huge Breakup Fee in Motorola Deal<date>August 18, 2011, 4:07 pm</date><text>Tim Boyle/Bloomberg News It is certainly big. But is there any chance that it will be paid? I’m talking about the $2.5 billion reverse termination fee that Google agreed to pay Motorola Mobility if its proposed takeover fails to obtain antitrust clearance. This fee is about 20 percent of the $12.5 billion deal value and is significantly higher than the $375 million Motorola Mobility must pay Google if it accepts another bid. Motorola filed a copy of the acquisition agreement between it and Google on Wednesday that spells out the exact terms when this fee is required to be paid. There are two circumstances: 1. The agreement is terminated because a government authority (e.g., a federal court or European Union antitrust authorities) issues a final, non-appealable order blocking the transaction on antitrust grounds. 2. If by Feb. 15, 2013, the transaction has not closed because it is being blocked by the authorities or has not cleared antitrust review, either party can terminate the agreement and transaction. The fee is then payable if two more conditions are met: a) The transaction could otherwise close but for the failure to obtain antitrust clearance or the government blocking the deal. b) Google willfully failed to use its reasonable best efforts to complete the deal or otherwise willfully breached the requirements in the agreement to obtain antitrust approval. Basically, these provisions can be boiled down to an agreement that if the transaction is blocked on antitrust grounds, then Google is on the hook for $2.5 billion. But as long as Google complies with the agreement, it will have to fight such a government action in court, and a final disposition of the action has to occur by Feb. 15, 2013. Deal Professor View all posts Article Tools E-mail This Print Recommend Share Close Tumblr Digg Linkedin Reddit Permalink Related Links Google-Motorola Mobility acquisition agreement Ranking Google’s Hefty Motorola Breakup Fee People close to Google have said they do not believe there are antitrust problems. So why is the fee so big? The fee’s driver is that Google has become what Microsoft was a few years ago, a natural target for European and American antitrust regulators. For the foreseeable future, any significant transaction Google engages in will really be all about antitrust in terms of getting it done. Absent this factor, the antitrust risk on this deal seems low. There is not substantial overlap between the company’s businesses. Google, the Internet search engine giant, also produces Android phone software, while Motorola Mobility manufactures cellphones and other wireless devices. Since there is virtually no horizontal overlap, the deal is known as a case of vertical integration. This is where two companies combine whose products are usually made separately but can be used in each others’. An example might be if General Motors bought a steel maker. In the case of vertical integration, the antitrust authorities would have to show that competition would be reduced to challenge the transaction. This is a hard thing to do in the case of vertical integration because the impact on competition is much harder to measure. This big fee, however, may not be a signal that there is an antitrust risk that the deal will be blocked, but a statement to the market of the opposite: that there is no such risk. By agreeing (or perhaps even proposing) such a large fee, Google is saying this is not a problem. And antitrust authorities are now put on notice that if they decide to give Google a hard time, the company is not only going to fight this but will be willing to pay for the fight to the tune of $2.5 billion. This fee may therefore be a statement by Google that the antitrust authorities should tread carefully in examining and challenging this deal. There is precedent for this. When Microsoft agreed to buy aQuantive in 2007 for $6 billion, it agreed, likely for similar reasons, to a $500 million reverse termination fee, or just over 8 percent of the deal value. Typically, merger agreements have provisions that also spell out the procedures and steps the parties will take to obtain antitrust clearance. If you look at these provisions in the Google-Motorola Mobility acquisition agreement, they support the theory that this is all about Google making a statement to the antitrust authorities. The provisions provide Google complete control over the antitrust process. In addition, the agreement does not obtain any species of a “hell or high water” provision. This provision, commonly seen in deals with antitrust risk, requires the buyer to take steps like asset divestitures or licensing of technology to satisfy antitrust regulators and obtain antitrust clearance. But there is no such provision in the Google-Motorola Mobility transaction agreement. This is a boon for Google, because regulators will look at such a provision as an easy way to force concessions. Google does not want to provide antitrust regulators any low-hanging fruit. To some extent, the high reverse termination fee functions as a form of hell-or-high-water provision, though it is different in an important way. Without this provision, Google can arguably refuse to take any steps to satisfy regulators and simply pay the fee. If there were a hell-or-high-water provision, Google would first have to offer up concessions. Again, making the fee higher benefits Google. If it were smaller, say only a couple of hundred million dollars, regulators might strong-arm the company into simple concessions, thinking this was chump change to Google. By setting it higher, Google has sent a warning: If you come after us, you better be serious and we are not going to give. Here, the actual terms specifying when Google has to pay the fee also benefit it. Because so much is at stake, Google will fight any antitrust action and is unlikely to breach the agreement. This would only leave a final order blocking the merger as the way such a fee is payable, meaning a long fight for regulators. Of course, I am sure Motorola Mobility asked for a high fee and was happy to take it. But the acquisition dynamics play to both parties agreeing to this fee. This $2.5 billion fee is therefore different than the $3 billion fee that AT&amp;T agreed to pay T-Mobile if that deal does not obtain regulatory clearance. In the case of the AT&amp;T-T-Mobile deal, the fee is all about compensating T-Mobile if the deal collapses and assuring it on the risks involved, as well as incentivizing AT&amp;T to do what is needed to obtain this clearance in terms of regulatory concessions. And for those wondering, the Microsoft-aQuantive deal closed without any significant antitrust scrutiny. Steven M.

As part of the deal, Google offered to pay a $2.5 billion reverse termination fee, according to a regulatory filing on Thursday. Just how committed is Google to the deal? Based on the sheer size of the breakup fee, Google was pretty determined to get the deal done. At $2.5 billion, the fee ranks among the five largest since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. American Online gets the prize for biggest breakup fee. As part of its deal to buy Time Warner in 2000, the Internet provider was willing to forgo $5.4 billion. The acquisition closed in 2001. Earlier this year, AT&amp;T‘s offer for T-Mobile USA included a reverse termination fee of $3 billion, plus some additional sweeteners in the form of spectrum. The deal is pending. Pharmaceutical makers nabbed the other spots in the top five. The fee in Merck‘s 2009 deal for Schering-Plough came to $2.5 billion. Pfizer was willing to give up $4.5 billion to score an agreement with Wyeth the same year. The mergers have since been completed. Google’s breakup fee also ranks high based on the percentage of the deal size. The $2.5 billion tab amounts to more than 28 percent of the total value of the transaction. It’s the second-largest reverse termination fee since 2000, based on Thomson Reuters data. Only Monsato’s bid to buy Delta &amp; Pine Land in 2006 came with a costlier one. As part of the deal, the agriculture giant agreed to pay a termination fee of $600 million, or roughly 41.5 percent of the offering price.</text></article>
    <article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/business/hp-palm-deal-looks-better-with-time.html?ref=googleinc">H.P.-Palm Deal Looks Better With Time<date>Published: August 16, 2011</date><text>Hewlett-Packard’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Palm last year suddenly looks smarter. Google’s $12.5 billion deal to buy Motorola Mobility this week, and the earlier frenzied bidding for Nortel’s patents, have revealed the riches in mobile computing intellectual property. And H.P. snatched one of the most important troves for a price that now looks cheap. Yet, it could be challenging for H.P. to cash in.A big trove of patents allows the owner to demand royalties from rivals, prevent them from incorporating particular features or at least negotiate from a position of strength. On the simplistic metric of enterprise value per patent, H.P. paid about $750,000 for each of Palm’s roughly 1,600, in line with what Apple, Microsoft and the others did for Nortel’s collection. Google, meanwhile, paid slightly more than $550,000 for each of Motorola’s 17,000-plus patents. But all patents aren’t created equal. For a time, Palm’s products dominated the market for personal digital assistants, precursors to today’s smartphones. The company also later developed an innovative operating system for handsets. So its patents sit in the mobile device sweet spot, whether related to displays, interfaces or other features. On average, those should be worth more than the wider range of Nortel’s or Motorola’s patents. Also instructive is that Palm in its heyday appeared to enjoy needling Apple, though Apple was hesitant to take Palm to court. That suggests some important intellectual property leverage compared with, say, Motorola, a company Apple has sued. It’s difficult to value patent portfolios but it seems likely the one H.P. apparently paid a full price for is now worth a good bit more. Mark V. Hurd, the H.P. chief at the time, said he was buying Palm for its intellectual property, not its smartphone business. But H.P. has yet to reap much benefit. Its underwhelming tablet device is a case in point. The operating system may yet gain traction, especially since H.P. has said it will bundle it with its computers and may license it out. But even if H.P. ends up an also-ran to Apple and Google’s Android, there’s always the option of another patent auction. High-Yield Hopes It has been a while since high-yield bonds really lived up to their name. With markets volatile, typical American junk bonds are yielding more than 8 percent. That’s tasty for investors starving on the Federal Reserve’s zero-rate diet and paranoid about getting whipsawed in volatile equities. Average risk premiums over Treasury yields for subinvestment grade credits fell as low as 4.5 percentage points in February when an economic recovery in the United States looked more assured and the European debt crisis averted. This spread is now 7.1 percentage points on average, for an American junk paper yield of more than 8.3 percent as of Aug. 15. That’s tempting when five-year Treasuries yield less than 1 percent and the overall dividend yield on stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index is around 2.2 percent. Of course, junk bond yields have risen partly because investors have been withdrawing billions of dollars from risky corporate debt markets. Euro zone debt and slowing global economic growth are legitimate concerns. But traditional signposts for high-yield bonds suggest the sell-off has gone far enough to warrant another look. The annual default rate, for one, is expected to end this year at just 1.5 percent. That’s hardly recession territory. In 2009, it surpassed 10 percent. A prolonged closing of credit markets would trip up some overleveraged companies. But the extensive amount of refinancing over the past two years means even CCC-rated companies don’t face large sums of maturing debt in the near term. Only $5.3 billion of debt from such issuers will mature by the end of 2012, according to Fitch Ratings. At the end of 2008, roughly five times more was scheduled to be repaid over a comparable period. There also isn’t a big backlog of leveraged debt deals to tax investor demand. Bankers estimate as much as $40 billion of buyout-related debt is in the pipeline. When credit markets shut down in 2007, the figure peaked at nearly $500 billion. Rising trouble in Europe could push prices still lower and yields higher. But with investors potentially stuck with the thin gruel of low official interest rates for a long time, high-yield bonds are once again looking almost nutritious.

Baird According to a report issued on Wednesday, consumers who already own or plan to buy a new tablet are only interested in one thing: the Apple iPad. The report, which was published by Robert W. Baird, a Milwaukee-based wealth management and analyst company, was conducted through a survey of 1,114 people, 98 percent of whom lived in the United States. More than 50 percent of those surveyed, who were between 22 and 60 years old, said they already owned a tablet or were interested in buying one soon, with 95 percent of these respondents choosing the Apple iPad. Although survey participants were allowed to pick multiple tablet choices, only 10 percent chose the Hewlett-Packard TouchPad as their tablet. A mere 4 percent said they would buy Research in Motion’s new BlackBerry tablet, the PlayBook. The Acer Iconia tablet, which runs Google’s Android software, barely scored 1 percent among survey participants. Jayson Noland, an analyst and an author of the report, said it was very unlikely that any iPad competitors would be able to catch Apple in the near future. “I find it hard to believe that anyone can compete with the iPad,” he said in a phone interview. “I do think there are opportunities for companies outside the personal tablet category by offering a much much lower cost product that can be used in the workplace as a productivity tool.” When asked if Google could compete with Apple by offering tablets running Android software, Mr. Noland said, “Unless a product comes out that is half the price of the iPad, and comes with good enough bells of whistles, then its highly unlikely.” The survey also found that a 83 percent of tablet owners still plan to buy a PC computer in addition to their tablet. This means that tablet cannibalization of the PC computer is taking place at a very slow pace.</text></article>
    <article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/17/technology/a-bull-market-in-tech-patents.html?ref=googleinc">A Bull Market in Tech Patents<date>Published: August 16, 2011</date><text>Google was willing on Monday to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in no small part because of its stockpile of 17,000 patents. The patent portfolio, some analysts estimate, could represent more than half of the value of the deal, or more than $400,000 a patent.If so, it was a relative bargain. In June, Apple and Microsoft teamed up with four other companies to pay $4.5 billion for the 6,000 patents held by the bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. That works out to $750,000 a patent or nearly four times the average price for computer, software and telecommunications patents over the last few years, patent experts say. In a stumbling economy, stocks languish in a skittish funk and real estate remains depressed. But technology patents look downright bubbly. This patent gold rush has a darker side. It is diverting money for innovation from industries crucial to the economic future of the United States, analysts say. Patents were created as an incentive for innovation, giving inventors a temporary right to commercialize their ideas, without others copying them. While the recent blockbuster patent deals may make sense for the companies, analysts say, they are fed largely by legal considerations — asserting patent claims or defending against claims — rather than economic ones. So the very innovation patents were intended to encourage, they say, suffers in the patent wars. “You’d much rather see Apple spend some of that $4 billion on new inventions, and Google invest that $12 billion to generate new knowledge,” said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. “It’s a transfer of wealth from innovators to bondholders and stockholders who have no motivation to innovate. It’s disturbing.” Patent investment firms, lawsuits, weakened patent overhaul legislation and the fierce competition among well-heeled rivals have also fanned this inflation. The patent legislation that emerged from the House and Senate, and which may well be enacted in the new session of Congress, has been scaled back. It no longer includes proposals that would have sharply curbed damage awards and the freedom of patent-holding companies to file patent infringement lawsuits. Another provision that was dropped would have limited the ability to file patent claims in known plaintiff-friendly courts, notably those in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which includes Tyler, Texarkana and Marshall. Large technology companies championed those patent suit restrictions. But they were cut from the legislation after resistance from interests that rely on strong patent protection, like pharmaceutical companies, individual inventors and patent-buying firms like Intellectual Ventures, a multibillion-dollar fund run by Nathan Myhrvold that owns more than 35,000 patents. Without tougher legislation, said Mr. Lerner of Harvard, companies are left to settle disputes on their own in the courts and at the bargaining table, which tends to lift prices. The result is that it now pays to sue over patents as a routine business practice. The smartphone business, for one, is rife with suit and countersuit. The better-known cases involve large companies. Apple, Microsoft and Oracle, in different cases, have accused Google or the companies that use its Android smartphone operating system, like Motorola and HTC, a Taiwan handset maker, of infringing on their patents. But there are other suits by small patent-holding companies that have aimed at developers of software applications that run on Google’s Android operating system and Apple’s iOS, which powers its iPhones. So the larger companies, like Google and Apple, are often forced to step in with legal assistance to help their business partners, even single-person applications developers. The result, said Brian Kahin, a senior fellow at the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group, and a White House technology policy adviser in the Clinton administration, is “a huge surge in the monetization of these patents.” Some industry executives doubt whether the recent high prices amount to a patent bubble. John A. Amster, chief executive of RPX, a start-up founded in 2008, which has bought more than 1,600 patents, said the Nortel and Motorola deals were mainly special cases. The high prices, he said, reflected not only an assessment of the value of the patents, but the much larger objective of trying to gain the upper hand in the smartphone business. 1 2 Next Page »Google was willing on Monday to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility in no small part because of its stockpile of 17,000 patents.

The Silicon Valley giant, known for its search engine and Android phone software, rattled the tech world with its announcement that it would acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings, allowing it to get into the business of making cellphones and tablets. The acquisition, Google's largest to date and an all-cash deal, would put the company in head-to-head competition with its own business partners, the many phone makers that use Android software, as well as with Apple. The deal, which requires regulatory approval, would also give Google a valuable war chest of more than 17,000 patents that would help it defend Android from a barrage of patent lawsuits. ''Computing is moving onto mobile,'' Larry Page, Google's chief executive, said in an interview. ''Even if I have a computer next to me, I'll still be on my mobile device.'' The effect of a Google-Motorola Mobility merger on consumers is unclear. But in the past, Google has shaken up the mobile industry by pushing cellphone carriers to open up their networks, and by licensing its Android system at no charge, increasing competition. With the Motorola deal, analysts said, Google may be able to accelerate innovation in smartphones and tablets. ''For Google, it's important for them to make sure that the mobile space is not dominated by one company, that being Apple,'' said Steve Weinstein, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. By acquiring Motorola, he said, they ''can drive down costs and create a product that is pioneering with Google services around it.'' The proposed deal would have ramifications across the tech industry, giving strength to Motorola at a time when Research in Motion and Nokia are faltering. Google said it would continue to license its Android system to other smartphone makers, like HTC, Samsung and LG. ''Many hardware partners have contributed to Android's success, and we look forward to continuing to work with all of them,'' wrote Mr. Page in a company blog post announcing the deal. Nonetheless, while many of Google's partners issued positive statements on Monday, analysts suggested that the acquisition would create tension because Motorola would be in an obviously favored position. That could push other phone makers into the arms of Microsoft, which offers a rival operating system. ''If you woke up today and you are one of Google's hardware partners, the hair just set up on the back of your neck,'' said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. ''If you're an Android partner, you may start considering the Windows platform.'' Mr. Page addressed those concerns by saying that Motorola would effectively operate as a stand-alone business. Sanjay Jha, the chief executive of Motorola Mobility, who has been responsible for turning the company around, will remain as the unit's top executive. Federal regulators are already investigating Google's dominance in several areas of its business, and the planned merger will prompt additional antitrust review. But legal experts said it seemed unlikely that the deal would be blocked because the two companies are in separate, if related, businesses so a combination would not increase Google's share of either market. Phones running the Android system have become increasingly popular, accounting for 43.4 percent of smartphones sold in the second quarter, according to Gartner research. But many customers have complained that the phones can be confusing to use. That is because Google works with 39 phone makers that use different versions of Android across their platforms, resulting in variable performances, said Richard Doherty, research director for Envisioneering Group, a market research and consulting firm. Apple, by contrast, controls its entire product - device and software. With the Motorola acquisition, Google, too, could exert greater control over its products.</text></article>

Schmidt, then Google's chief executive, proclaimed, ''We're not going into the phone business, but we're going to make sure Google is on those phones.'' Less than a year later, however, Google did the opposite. As Steven Levy described in his book ''In the Plex,'' Google soon acquired Android, the mobile phone operating system, and began building a phone business that it has since developed into a juggernaut. Even after Google acquired Android in 2005, it continued to play down plans to enter the phone business for several more years. It wasn't until the summer of 2008 that Steven P. Jobs at Apple actually took notice and went to Google's headquarters to inspect one of its prototype handsets. Google's diversionary tactics made sense: by 2006, Mr. Schmidt, now Google's chairman, was an Apple board member and Google was considered an important partner to Apple. But when Mr. Jobs finally saw Google's phone he was ''furious'' and ''concluded he was a victim of deceit,'' according to Mr. Levy's account. (Mr. Schmidt has said he never misguided Mr. Jobs.) That history may be instructive to consider when judging Google's $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility, which makes Android phone handsets and TV set-top boxes. Google is actively positioning the deal not as a means to buy its way into the handset market, but as an opportunity to buy Motorola's portfolio of patents - some 17,000 of them. During the company's conference call with analysts and the news media, Google executives peppered the call with talk about the enormous value of Motorola's patents (it mentioned this 24 times); yet they talked about its handset business almost as an afterthought. Google's focus on the patents rather than the handset business makes almost too much sense: Google's Android operating system has long been ''open'' and is used by a large ecosystem of handset makers, including Samsung and HTC. These companies have invested billions of dollars in its Android-based operations and helped make Android more popular than Apple's mobile operating system. Those handset makers will now have to compete against Google. ''Google can't admit in public that what they intend to do is eventually make Android proprietary,'' said Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Morgan Keegan Equity Research. Despite Google's protestations, Mr. McCourt says he believes that in two to three years - after Motorola increases its distribution channels in Europe, where it is weak compared to Samsung and others - Google will seek to start closing Android's platform or begin building special features on its own phones that are not available to its ''partners.'' And even though Google could keep Android as an ''open'' platform, a special phone with bells and whistles could still infuriate its current manufacturing partners. For consumers, however, a proprietary phone would finally make Google's Android system vertically integrated, creating an end-to-end system that may allow it to better compete against the iPhone, which has long been heralded because Apple has been able to control all aspects of the phone, from software to hardware. Indeed, Google's main P.R. message in its takeover of Motorola Mobility may follow that playbook of Research in Motion, the maker of BlackBerry, when it acquired QNX Software Systems, a software unit of Harmon International, a little more than a year ago. At the time of the deal, RIM said it was buying QNX to enter the automobile and infotainment business, which was a strength of QNX. RIM played down any talk that QNX might be used as RIM's next-generation operating system. Of course, the messaging was a bit disingenuous: QNX is now building RIM's operating system. ''They couldn't say it because RIM's developers would have stopped developing for BlackBerry's current operating system,'' Mr. McCourt said. Google's message may also be needed to win approval from regulators who could seek to block the acquisition if any number of handset makers came out against the deal. On Monday, all of Android's handset makers came out in support of the deal on the basis that it would protect Android from potential patent litigation. None of this is meant to suggest that Google's stated desire to own Motorola Mobility, in part, for its patents is untrue. Google clearly has been involved in an effort to buy mobile phone-related patents for the last year: it lost a bidding war last month to buy about 6,000 patents from the bankrupt telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. (Apple and Microsoft led a group that outbid it.) But it is undeniable that Google's new chief executive, Larry Page, has long had a hankering for the mobile phone business, and this acquisition may be the culmination of his ambitions. Mr. Page, after all, was the executive who personally pursued the acquisition of Android and has been its biggest proponent. And he pressed Google to compete in federal auctions for wireless spectrum in recent years at a time when others were more hesitant - and in some cases was willing to overpay for spectrum. ''He was the guy behind Android,'' Mr. Levy said in an interview. ''Larry is a big ambitious guy; he will roll big dice.'' If there's any question about Google's motivation to own a handset maker rather than just a portfolio of patents, consider this: InterDigital, a licensing company that owns some 8,000 wireless patents and has another 10,000 patent applications being processed, has been up for auction. Many industry insiders were sure that if Google were serious about acquiring a portfolio of patents, InterDigital would be its target. The company's market value is only about $3 billion and it doesn't come with all the baggage of Motorola's handset business. ''If this deal was just about patents, Google would have bought IDCC,'' Mr. McCourt said, referring to InterDigital's stock ticker. Guess what happened to shares of InterDigital on Monday? They fell 14 percent now that Google is unlikely to be a buyer. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

But will they still feel that way in a year?Those companies have made plenty of money selling millions of devices powered by Android, Google’s mobile operating system. Analysts and industry specialists say the deal could sour relations between Google and its partners, who have helped Google beat Nokia and Apple to win the biggest share of the mobile software market. “They can’t be too thrilled to find that suddenly, these companies are no longer partnering with Google — they’re competing with Google,” Michael Gartenberg, director of research at Gartner, an information technology research and advisory company, said referring to the telephone makers. “No matter how Google tries to spin it, they’re competing.” Larry Page, one of the founders of Google who recently became chief executive, provided reassurance in a company blog post, saying that the acquisition would “not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform,” meaning that any manufacturer will continue to be able to use it. He added that Google would run Motorola Mobility as a separate business. Analysts, however, warned that it is exceedingly difficult for a company to both license its products and compete with those licensees at the same time. They pointed to Apple’s attempt to license its Mac operating system in the mid-’90s, and to Palm’s unsuccessful effort to split itself into separate software and hardware companies. Google previously tried to enter the hardware business with its Google-branded Nexus One smartphone that it designed and sold through its Web site, rather than stores. But the phones were met with a lukewarm reception as customers were unaccustomed to buying phones without handling them first. The Motorola deal will help cement Google’s status as a mobile player, not only among competitors but also among consumers, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “It changes Google from being just the company they turn to for search,” he said referring to consumers. “It makes them the company delivering their mobile experience in a post-PC world.” The deal will only add to the flux in the market for mobile telephone software, where Android has surged recently. It had a 43.4 percent global share in the second quarter of this year, up from 17.2 percent a year ago, according to Gartner. Apple’s iOS devices captured an 18.2 percent share, up from 14.1 last year, while the former heavyweight Research in Motion, which makes BlackBerry devices, slipped to 11.7 percent from 18.7 percent. The acquisition may lead some hardware makers to cast their lot with Microsoft, which is pouring resources into becoming a serious mobile competitor. Nokia has already done just that, betting on Microsoft and abandoning its own mobile operating system. Others may try to strike out on their own and create operating systems, rather than risk becoming dependent on Google. Samsung has dipped a toe in those waters, releasing phones that run on an in-house system called Bada. HTC already had a team of engineers dedicated to customizing the version of Android that it uses on its phones, called HTC Sense. Meanwhile RIM is struggling to move to a new operating system, QNX, to try to revive its smartphone and tablet offerings. A statement by Peter Chou, chief executive of HTC, the Taiwanese phone and tablet manufacturer, was typical of the partners’ reactions. “We welcome the news of today’s acquisition, which demonstrates that Google is deeply committed to defending Android, its partners, and the entire ecosystem,” he said. Google stands to gain much from Motorola. Owning a hardware manufacturer could help Google better integrate its software with tablets, where it has struggled to gain footing against the iPad. Google also may be able to better integrate its services — books, music, games — into Android devices. Analysts say that the move could bolster Google TV, Google’s poorly received attempt to wed the Web with home television sets. Motorola has a strong presence in the set-top box market, which Google could leverage.Major telephone makers like Samsung, HTC, Sony Ericsson and LG said on Monday that they supported Google’s planned purchase of Motorola.

That intellectual property portfolio is a treasure trove for Google because the battle in wireless is one that is increasingly being fought in court. Corporate warfare over patents is not new. Companies historically preferred to reach truces, choosing to cross-license their intellectual property rather than risking bigger losses in court. But patent battles are no longer waged between just two competitors, like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Platforms like Android and Windows Phone 7 are built upon a handful of device makers, adding more players with different stakes at risk. That has changed the calculus of settling, as product makers have become increasingly willing to sue rather than reach peaceful settlements. ''Now you're seeing more suits being brought by product companies willing to step up and say we will defend our patents,'' said Colleen Chien, an assistant professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law. Apple has sued important Android phone makers like HTC and Samsung, while Oracle has taken Google to court. The fighting has been likened to a ''patent arms race.'' ''The best way to fight a big portfolio of patents is to have your own big portfolio of patents,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a law professor at the University of Iowa. ''That appears to be what Google is doing here, arming itself with patents to be able to defend itself in this fast-growing market.'' Large sums hang in the balance, especially if phone makers are forced to pay out royalties for each handset they make. Microsoft has already persuaded HTC to pay a fee for every Android phone manufactured, and is seeking to extract similar royalties from Samsung. If left unchecked, such payments could make creating new devices for Android prohibitively expensive for manufacturers, forcing them to turn to alternative platforms like Windows Phone 7. ''With a slim patent portfolio, Google is especially vulnerable to lawsuits against its Android licensees, if not itself,'' Charlie Wolf, an analyst with Needham, wrote. By acquiring Motorola Mobility, Google is seeking to ensure that growth in the Android market will not be choked by the burden of royalties. The importance of bulging patent portfolios became clear this summer after a consortium led by Apple, Microsoft and Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, paid $4.5 billion for some 6,000 patents held by Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications maker that filed for bankruptcy. Google, which initially offered $900 million for the collection, fell short after several bids. Shortly afterward, Google executives complained that the company's rivals had banded together to smother its Android system with patents. ''We're determined to preserve Android as a competitive choice for consumers, by stopping those who are trying to strangle it,'' David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. In a sign of how badly it appeared to want Motorola Mobility's patents, Google offered $40 a share, a rich 63 percent premium to Motorola's closing price on Friday. Analysts at Jefferies calculated that, of the $12.5 billion offer price, Google was essentially paying $9.5 billion for the patents. And analysts at Canaccord Genuity estimated that the price per patent was higher than the $4.5 billion total that bidders paid for the Nortel patents. Though companies like Google may be snapping up thousands of patents at a time, they are looking for the few that cover their competitors' products. Among the most valuable components of the Motorola collection, according to analysts, are those that cover cellular radio technologies like 4G data speeds. It was the high price fetched by Nortel's patents that opened the eyes of Motorola's directors, people briefed on the matter said. By the end of the Nortel sales process, Motorola had begun holding talks with a number of potential partners about how to reap value from its larger collection of patents. Some of the offers focused on simply licensing Motorola's patents. Of Motorola's suitors, Google had the benefit of having worked closely with the handset maker on the first truly popular Android phone, the original Droid for Verizon Wireless. Over a matter of weeks, Google's bid evolved into a takeover of the entire company. Late last month, one of Motorola's biggest shareholders, the activist investor Carl C. Icahn, specifically called upon the company to ''explore alternatives'' for its patent portfolio. Mr. Icahn said that there were ''multiple ways'' to realize such value, suggesting even then that he was open to a sale. The investor was not a catalyst for any decision by Motorola's board, though his support for a range of possible actions was helpful, the people briefed on the matter said. By the beginning of last week, the search engine giant emerged as a front-runner, and by Sunday evening clinched the deal at a vote by Motorola's board. Mr. Icahn, a longtime gadfly who once sued Motorola to jolt it into action, praised the deal on Monday as ''a great outcome for all shareholders.'' Motorola's sale left many investors looking for the next company that could be acquired for its intellectual property, especially other struggling phone makers. Shares of Research in Motion jumped 10.4 percent on Monday, while American depositary receipts of Nokia leaped 17.4 percent. In January, Motorola split itself into two separate companies: Mobility, which makes cellphones and set-top TV boxes, and Solutions, which makes radio equipment for corporations and governments.

    <article index="11" href="http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/where-google-goes-from-here-part-1/?ref=googleinc">Where Google Goes From Here<date>December 2, 2009, 10:30 am</date><text>Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Google’s dominance in Internet search has earned it billions in profits and has allowed it to expand its ambitions far beyond search and advertising to all other aspects of the online world, including publishing. Next year, it will challenge Microsoft Windows by unveiling its Chrome operating system, a browser-based technology. We asked two observers of Google to discuss its effect on the Internet and new and old media: Ken Auletta has written for The New Yorker magazine since 1992. He is the author, mostly recently, of “Googled: The End of the World as We Know It.” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist at Union Square Ventures and an early-stage investor in many Web companies, including Twitter. Moderating the conversation: John Markoff, a reporter for The Times, has been writing about technology since 1976. He is the author of “What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.” John starts off the discussion with some questions for Ken and Fred. Read their answers to the first two questions below, along with follow-up questions, answers and comments, which we’ll add throughout the day. Read the second half of this discussion here. What Should Google Fear? Markoff:Google executives have said that their industry position is vulnerable to new technology advances. How robust is Google’s near-monopoly over Internet search? If there is a threat to Google’s search domination, from which direction will it come? Auletta: With a single click, users can switch to another search engine. Google worries, as it should, about Microsoft’s deep pockets and its fervent support of Bing. But Google knows that as good as its search engine and Bing are, both are inefficient. They produce a blizzard of too many answers. A potentially more efficient threat will come from a vertical search, which social networks like Facebook and Twitter might provide. Imagine you want to buy a camera. Would you rather have the advice of 20 friends whom you know and trust and who share their experience with cameras, or 20,000 or so links from a Google search? Google knows the answer to that question, which is why it tried — and failed — to acquire Twitter last spring. Wilson: Google’s near-monopoly over the current form of Internet search seems very robust. Since the launch of Bing almost six months ago, Google’s share of U.S. searches has risen from 65 percent to 65.4 percent, according to comScore. I don’t believe Google is particularly vulnerable to frontal assaults on its search franchise. But Google is very vulnerable to changes in the current Internet search paradigm. You can already see this effect in social media. Earlier this year, Hitwise reported that Facebook drove more traffic to Perez Hilton than Google. In the same report, Hitwise said 3.3 percent of all traffic to Web video sites was coming from Facebook. Similarly, my blog, AVC.com, gets more traffic from Twitter than Google. The mobile Web represents another similar shift in user behavior. The use of apps on mobile devices is, at least for now, becoming the dominant form of content discovery and use on the mobile Web. If you want a sports score on your iPhone, you are less likely to go to Google and more likely to fire up your ESPN app. Google is well aware of these threats and is working to address them, but it is not the dominant technology provider in social media (Facebook) or mobile (Apple). And even as its leaders invest and acquire businesses to address shortcomings in these areas, new ones will crop up. Just look at how Microsoft’s monopoly in a number of important markets has withered over the past decade to see how quickly technology can change things. Read Markoff’s follow-up question to Auletta and his answer. Updated, 11:15 a.m. Markoff: Ken, do you think social search is a threat to Google, or does it simply expand the universe of search options? Also, will the various strategies that Microsoft, et al are employing (alliances with Murdoch, etc.) Balkanize the Web? Auletta: John, at Google, social networks like Facebook are seen as a threat for several reasons: They can offer social search or expand search options, both of which siphon users from Google. They hog attention, capturing their users in an alternate universe. And Facebook is allied with Microsoft, one of its primary investors. Yes, a Murdoch-Microsoft alliance could Balkanize the Web. One could also argue that as Facebook becomes an alternate universe, its community of users will, in effect, drop out of the World Wide Web. Or as I reported in my book, there is a shift away from “free” or a reliance on just advertising, with former proponents like Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt, conceding they will introduce pay models to such sites as YouTube. As sites begin to charge, pay walls will “Balkanize” in the sense that some content will be available only to those who pay. Read Markoff’s follow-up to Wilson and his answer. Updated, 11:25 a.m. Markoff: Fred, if mobile search and social search are competitive threats to Google, will that play out as an expansion of the search market or will it break up the Web into disconnected islands? Wilson: I see the Internet as one big operating system (I got this way of thinking from Tim O’Reilly). Search is one function. Social is another. So I don’t see search and social as disconnected islands. I see them as connected important features that complement each other. Mobile is a more complicated issue. Today, the dominant form of mobile engagement is via apps and they are not true Web services. Ideally services would be deployed on mobile devices via a browser, but that won’t work as well as apps do for a while. We are just now seeing most apps move from desktop to the Web on the PC. I think it will be at least five years and maybe a decade before that happens on mobile. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:30 p.m. Auletta: In 1998 I asked Bill Gates what he envisioned as the biggest future threat to Microsoft? I expected that he would name a rival company — Netscape, Oracle, Apple, Sun. Instead he said he most worried about someone in a garage working on a new technology that would disrupt his business. Google’s two founders were in a garage that year, and they became Microsoft’s worst nightmare. As Fred suggests, the new technology platforms that could threaten Google’s dominance could be social networks (Facebook), or mobile networks (Apple), or some new, unanticipated technology. Google vs. Government Markoff: During the past four decades first I.B.M. and then Microsoft dominated the computing industry. Both faced extended antitrust battles with the government. Now, despite its “do no evil,” motto, Google is increasingly seen as the dominant force in computing. Is it heading for an antitrust collision? Auletta: As was true of Microsoft, Google’s engineers have trouble gauging things they can’t quantify — like public fears or politics. The government bear is a greater threat to Google than it is to Microsoft or Amazon, and not just the U.S. government. Google juggles three atomic issues: concentration of power, privacy and copyright. Americans have long been fearful of corporate power, and companies with clout in Washington have assembled to urge elected officials to circumscribe Google’s power. The mountain of data Google collects is a source of worry, particularly in Europe where privacy laws are more stringent. And every powerful media industry — from newspapers and magazines to books to television to movies to music — has rung the alarm bell to protect their copyrights. Although Google has become more aware of these threats and has better armed itself to deal with governments, its executives also believe they have powerful Democratic friends in Washington. They would forget, at their peril, that Democrats traditionally warn of Bigness (except big government) and believe in government regulation. Wilson: Google may well be headed for its own antitrust collision. It is very dominant in search and even more so in search monetization. There are other markets like mapping and related technologies where it appears to be developing a dominant position. However, I am not big fan of governmental intervention in technology markets. Technology moves very rapidly and one decade’s dominant monopoly is the next decade’s fading giant. I would prefer our government focus on creating the right environment for innovation and new technology development so that the next Google can come along and change the game again. Things like immigration reform (the start-up visa movement), patent reform (elimination of software patents), net neutrality and open spectrum are all much more important than filing an antitrust case against Google. Read Markoff’s comment for Auletta. Updated, 11:50 a.m. Markoff: In alluding to Google’s engineering mindset, I wonder if you consider it to be the company’s Achilles’ heel? Auletta: This vice is the flip side of Google’s engineering virtue: A passionate focus on eradicating inefficiencies. This blind spot to things it can’t measure — like fear, politics, concerns about Google’s dominance, or privacy and copyright protections — is one threat to Google, but not the only one. Read Markoff’s comment for Wilson. Updated, 11:55 a.m. Markoff: To date do you think that Google has proved more adroit at managing the government than Microsoft was in 1995? Wilson: Yes. It is more politically savvy. It learned from the mistakes that Microsoft made. Read Auletta’s response to Wilson. Updated, 1:35 p.m. Auletta: An anti-trust case against Google makes no sense. It is much easier to escape Google, whose market share is 65 percent, than it was Microsoft’s dominant operating system (95 percent). Just click once to make Bing or Yahoo or Ask.com your search engine. But what was absent as the economy and the banking system and Wall Street derivatives melted was a government referee. You wouldn’t play a professional game without a referee. The trick is for the referee to understand that its role is to blow the whistle on infractions, not become a participant.</text></article>
