The device was recalled by the company last year. The British registry also found that the early failure rate of some other “metal-on-metal” hips — ones in which both the ball and the socket components of an artificial joint are made of metal — was significantly higher than for those made from other materials, including a combination of metal and plastic. While the patients tracked by the British registry are not in the United States, doctors and patients here pay close attention to the registry’s findings because no such body exists in this country, where there is far greater use of artificial hips and knees. Australia also keeps a registry. There was already heightened concern in the United States about the all-metal hips. In the first six months of this year, the Food and Drug Administration received more reports about problems with the all-metal hips than it had in the previous four years combined, according to an analysis by The New York Times. In May, the F.D.A. took the unusual step of ordering producers of the devices to study how frequently they were failing and to examine the health implications for patients. While traditional artificial hips typically last 15 years or more before they need to replaced, some of the all-metal models are failing in large numbers of patients within just a few years. Early failure rates for all-metal devices were far higher in women than in men, the British report found. According to the report, the highest failure rates involved the Johnson &amp; Johnson device, which is known as the Articular Surface Replacement, or the A.S.R. The registry is following about 2,100 patients who received a version of the device that is used as a traditional hip implant. That is also how the A.S.R. was used in this country. Of those patients in the British group who received the device six years ago, about 29 percent have since had it replaced. The percentage is slightly lower, about 17 percent, in patients who got the device five years ago, but that number could rise over the next year. Asked for a comment about the report, Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy, the division of Johnson &amp; Johnson that made the device, said in an e-mail that the six-year replacement rate “should be interpreted with caution because it is based on a small number of cases.” DePuy officials recalled the A.S.R. last year around the time that the previous report of the British registry was released. Along with a traditional hip model, another version of the device was sold outside this country for use in an alternative hip replacement technique known as “resurfacing.” It was also recalled. While it is difficult to draw direct comparisons between device failure rates in Britain and in the United States, the new registry findings appear to bode ill for patients here who received an A.S.R. About 40,000 of the 90,000 units sold worldwide were used in this country. The British data suggests that complaints will continue to grow in the United States in coming years because the A.S.R. was used overseas before its adoption here. The British data also shows that the failure rate for all-metal devices as a group, even when the A.S.R. is excluded, is accelerating faster than for traditional hip replacements. Though immediate problems with the hip implants are not life-threatening, some patients have suffered crippling injuries caused by tiny particles of cobalt and chromium that were shed by the metal devices as they wore. Such debris generation is also believed to be a cause of earlier device failure. Until a recent sharp decline in their use, all-metal hip implants accounted for nearly one-third of the estimated 250,000 replacements performed in this country each year. According to one estimate, some 500,000 patients in this country have received an all-metal replacement hip. In the case of devices used for hip resurfacing, which is popular among younger patients, a model known as the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing device had the lowest replacement rate at five years, the registry found. However, the report noted that further studies needed to be performed to determine whether hip resurfacing conferred true advantages over standard hip replacement.In a troubling development for people with all-metal artificial hips, a registry that tracks orthopedic implants in Britain reported on Thursday that the failure rate of the devices was increasing.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/business/28drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. to Buy Synthes for $21.3 Billion<date>Published: April 27, 2011</date><text>In announcing on Wednesday Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biggest acquisition ever, on the eve of its annual shareholder meeting, the company’s chief executive tried to pivot from a year of manufacturing lapses, product recalls and a disappointing share price.The $21.3 billion deal for Synthes, a Swiss-American medical device maker, would make Johnson &amp; Johnson the largest player in the market for surgical tools and implants to treat trauma patients, and would make it a more powerful competitor in the $37 billion worldwide market for orthopedic medical devices. Synthes is a leading maker of screws, plates and surgical tools used to stabilize traumatic injuries. The deal is a move aimed at appealing to investors who have been troubled by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s failure to quickly resolve significant and apparently systemic problems in the company’s consumer products division, which have tarnished once-golden brands like Tylenol. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s chief executive, William C. Weldon, championed the new deal in an interview on Wednesday, citing what he hoped would be cooperation between the company’s existing orthopedic and spinal implant division, DePuy, and Synthes. “We’ve got the opportunity to create the most innovative and comprehensive orthopedic business in the world,” Mr. Weldon said. Trauma products are more profitable and less vulnerable than other kinds of medical devices to changes in broad economic trends, he said. The combination of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s global presence and Synthes’s products, he said, created a new opening in emerging markets for the combined company. Many Wall Street analysts praised the deal, even as some groused that it would not immediately add to earnings. “J.&amp; J. will be able to offer hospitals an inescapable breadth and depth of products that will offer one-stop shopping in reconstructive implants and trauma repair,” said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann. “You are going to have to do business with J.&amp; J.” Johnson &amp; Johnson is offering 159 Swiss francs (about $181) a share for Synthes — of which 55.65 francs is cash and 103.35 francs is Johnson &amp; Johnson common stock. Derrick Sung, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said some investors were disappointed that the company was not planning to make use of its stockpile of foreign cash for the deal. “It’s dilutive, at least for the first year,” he said. “There was an expectation that it would be accretive in the first year.” At the annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, some investors are expected to raise concerns about Mr. Weldon’s management and his compensation. “I don’t think they would have done the deal if they didn’t need a distraction,” said Erik Gordon, an assistant business professor at the University of Michigan who has been a frequent critic of Mr. Weldon’s leadership. The company stands at a crossroads as Mr. Weldon nears the end of his tenure. Even as Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to use the Synthes acquisition to improve its position in the device sector and its performance, the company must still resolve major manufacturing problems in its consumer division and work to regain consumer trust. During a conference call with investors on Wednesday morning, some analysts asked whether the company was equipped to handle both a substantial acquisition and significant remediation. Some investors fault a lack of management oversight for major problems, like last year’s manufacturing lapses at the company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which was responsible for the recalls of nearly 300 million items in 2010, including for popular brands like Motrin and Rolaids. McNeil closed its Fort Washington, Pa., manufacturing plant to overhaul it, and is now operating under a consent decree with federal regulators. Johnson &amp; Johnson bought Pfizer’s consumer business, including brands like Listerine, for $16.6 billion in 2006, and some analysts have speculated that the unwieldy acquisition, along with cost-cutting measures, may have contributed to the problems that developed at McNeil. 1 2 Next Page »In announcing on Wednesday Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biggest acquisition ever, on the eve of its annual shareholder meeting, the company’s chief executive tried to pivot from a year of manufacturing lapses, product recalls and a disappointing share price.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/11/business/11drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Regulators Reach Agreement With J.&amp;J. Unit<date>Published: March 10, 2011</date><text>Federal regulators reached an agreement on Thursday with a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson that would impose greater federal oversight at three manufacturing plants responsible for recalls of children’s Tylenol and many other popular over-the-counter medicines.The regulators say that the manufacturing practices failed to comply with federal law. The proposed consent decree with the Food and Drug Administration stems from recurring problems for over a year with products made by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare division at sites in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. Lawmakers and regulators have repeatedly criticized the company for its inability to manage production at these plants. “We’ve had a long engagement with McNeil over the last year with regard to their quality system,” Douglas Stearn, an F.D.A. official who helps oversee compliance by drug makers, said in an interview on Thursday. “We think this represents necessary important steps to assuring quality across the board.” Under the agreement, which needs approval from a federal judge, Johnson &amp; Johnson would be required to hire an independent expert to determine whether operations at all three plants met federal standards and to ensure that quality systems were in place. The agreement covers a plant in Fort Washington, Pa., that the company closed last year for an overhaul amid a nationwide recall of children’s medicines; a plant in Las Piedras, P.R., that was the subject of an agency warning letter last year; and a plant in Lancaster, Pa., that makes products like Pepcid for a joint venture with Merck. McNeil cannot reopen the Fort Washington plant until an independent expert determines that the plant meets all federal standards and passes an agency inspection, according to the agreement. The agreement would also give the F.D.A. the authority to require McNeil to stop manufacturing or to institute recalls. While the agency did not levy a fine in this case, McNeil could face fines of $15,000 a day for violating the decree, up to $10 million a year. While the proposed consent decree covers a civil complaint, the F.D.A. would not comment on the status of any related criminal investigations. Last year, an F.D.A. official testified at a Congressional hearing that the agency had referred the McNeil case to its Office of Criminal Investigations. A spokeswoman for McNeil confirmed that other federal investigations were under way. Last July, McNeil filed a plan with the F.D.A. that detailed how it expected to upgrade its manufacturing and quality processes. But the terms of the proposed decree indicate that federal regulators thought the company needed outside oversight, said Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. He likened the consent decree to a trusteeship or a receivership. Professor Gordon estimated that the agreement could be costly because of the need to hire independent consultants, who would have to inspect and certify the company’s corrective actions. “It’s a big embarrassment, and it is going to be expensive,” he said. In a statement issued on Thursday to the company’s employees, William C. Weldon, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s chief executive, said executives were committed to addressing the manufacturing problems at the plants. While he emphasized that the company “has made important progress toward improving quality and compliance,” he said the agreement “requires additional quality assurance measures, and is a reminder that important work remains to be done.” A McNeil spokeswoman said she could not comment on how much the agreement might cost the company to put in place. Other units of Johnson &amp; Johnson have also been experiencing problems, leading some industry analysts to raise broader questions about oversight. Last year, the company’s DePuy unit recalled two different hip implants, affecting tens of thousands of patients worldwide. Its Animas unit recalled tens of thousands of insulin pump cartridges last month because they had the potential to leak and deliver too little insulin, the company said. Also last month, the F.D.A. sent a letter to Cordis, a company device unit, warning about problems at a plant in Puerto Rico that makes heart stents. A spokeswoman for Cordis said the company was working to address the agency’s concerns. “We do not believe this issue impacts product safety and efficacy and we are confident our product remains safe and effective for use,” she said. Les Funtleyder, a fund manager at Miller Tabak &amp; Company, which owns shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the agreement underscored concerns about the company’s ability to resolve persistent manufacturing problems. “We’re having a hard time reconciling how Johnson &amp; Johnson got to this point,” he said. “The board has to be asking questions. If not, investors will be.”Federal regulators reached an agreement on Thursday with a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson that would impose greater federal oversight at three manufacturing plants responsible for recalls of children’s Tylenol and many other popular over-the-counter medicines.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/05/business/05bizbriefs-JOHNSONJOHNS_BRF.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson Implant Unit Executive Resigns<date>Published: March 4, 2011</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson said Friday that the worldwide president of its DePuy Orthopaedics division, a maker of artificial hips and knees that has struggled with product recalls and lawsuits over faulty implants, is leaving the company. The executive, David Floyd, submitted his resignation last week and will leave at the end of March, a spokeswoman said. He had been president of the unit since 2007. He is leaving to pursue interests outside the company, the spokesman, Lorie Gawreluk, said, declining to be more specific. DePuy recalled the ASR XL Acetabular hip system last August, after researchers found 13 percent of patients needed a repeat operation to fix problems with the implant. The company took a $280 million charge in the fourth quarter to pay for the recall. The company faces more than 500 lawsuits by patients who had the hip implants.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/business/24drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Parent Ruling on the Drug Humira Is Reversed<date>Published: February 23, 2011</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) — Abbott Laboratories said a federal court of appeals overturned a $1.67 billion judgment against the company related to patents on its best-selling drug Humira, which were challenged by Johnson &amp; Johnson.The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Johnson &amp; Johnson had not provided sufficient written evidence of its claim to Humira, the first biotech drug to treat arthritis and other immune disorders. The judgment overturns a June 2009 ruling in favor of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biotech unit Centocor. “Centocor’s argument that an inventor need not physically make an invention to claim it misses the mark,” a panel of three circuit judges concluded. The president of Centocor, Robert Bazemore, said the company was “disappointed by the decision” and might appeal. “We are considering whether to ask for reconsideration by the panel or by the court of appeals as a whole,” he said in a statement. Humira posted global sales of $6.5 billion last year, and has long been Abbott’s best-selling product. It is approved to treat several serious immune system disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Johnson &amp; Johnson markets the rival treatments Simponi and Remicade, which are also injectable biotech drugs used to treat the conditions. The company claimed that Abbott had infringed a patent on a genetically engineered antibody that blocks an immune system response that stimulates inflammation. But the judges were not persuaded by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s claim to the technology, citing an earlier drug patent decision: “A ‘mere wish or plan’ for obtaining the claimed invention is not adequate to written description.” “We are very pleased with the appeals court’s decision,” Abbott said in a statement.WASHINGTON (AP) — Abbott Laboratories said a federal court of appeals overturned a $1.67 billion judgment against the company related to patents on its best-selling drug Humira, which were challenged by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/business/29stent.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson Told to Pay $482 Million in Cordis Patent Case<date>Published: January 28, 2011</date><text>A jury told Johnson &amp; Johnson on Friday to pay $482 million to a New Jersey radiologist for infringing on a patent on devices to prop open heart arteries.The jury, in Federal District Court in Texas, ruled that Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Cordis unit had infringed on a patent for a device used to treat damaged heart tissue and awarded the damages to the patent holder, Dr. Bruce Saffran, of Princeton, N.J. “We’ve been fighting this battle since 2003,” said Dr. Saffran’s lawyer, Paul Taskier of Dickstein Shapiro in Washington. “Today we proved they were infringing, and the jury understood.” The Cordis unit said it would challenge the verdict. “This is contrary to both the law and the facts set forward in the case,” said Sandy Pound, a spokeswoman for Cordis. “We will ask the judge to overturn this verdict and if unsuccessful, we plan to appeal the verdict.” The verdict is the second to uphold Dr. Saffran’s patent. He won a similar case in 2008 against the Boston Scientific Corporation. In that case, Dr. Saffran was awarded $501 million but settled for $50 million while the case was being appealed. He also has an infringement case against Abbott Laboratories, in which a trial is scheduled for August 2012.A jury told Johnson &amp; Johnson on Friday to pay $482 million to a New Jersey radiologist for infringing on a patent on devices to prop open heart arteries.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/business/26drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Recalls Depress Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Quarterly Profit 12%<date>Published: January 25, 2011</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson, hurt by product recalls and a weak economy, posted a 12 percent decline in profit and a 5.5 percent decline in sales for the fourth quarter on Tuesday.The company reported net income of $1.94 billion, or 70 cents a share, down from $2.21 billion, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings would have been $1.03 a share, matching analysts’ expectations. The company took an after-tax charge of $922 million for litigation settlements, a recall of poorly fitting DePuy hip implants and an increase in its product liability reserve. The company’s revenue fell to $15.64 billion from $16.6 billion a year earlier. It was also below the $16 billion expected by analysts polled by FactSet. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been hurt by 17 recalls since September 2009, covering multiple McNeil Consumer Healthcare products, plus contact lenses and hip replacements, and the lengthy shutdown of one of the factories involved. Lost revenue from the recalled products reduced 2010 sales by $900 million, 50 percent more than Johnson &amp; Johnson predicted last year. The chief executive, William C. Weldon, tried in a conference call to reassure analysts and investors that the company had its manufacturing and other problems under control. But shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., fell $1.14, or 1.8 percent, to $61.08. Johnson &amp; Johnson also forecast a full-year profit of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, below the $4.99 expected by analysts. Results also were affected by the weak global economy squeezing consumer health spending, the impact of the health care overhaul in the United States and European government demands for lower prices. During a conference call Tuesday, Mr. Weldon said pricing pressures from hospitals and governments would not go away soon, if ever, but that expected continued sales growth in emerging markets, and several important new drugs awaiting approval, would help J.&amp; J. recover. Mr. Weldon, 62, also said the company was committed to restoring its over-the-counter medicines to the quality level consumers expected. Sales of consumer products like Tylenol, Benadryl and Rolaids, all the subject of recalls over product contamination and other problems, were down the most. Sales in that division fell 15 percent to $3.6 billion, with a 29 percent decline in the United States. Sales of prescription drugs, which include Remicade for immune disorders and Concerta for attention deficit disorder, fell nearly 5 percent to $5.71 billion. The medical device division, now J.&amp; J.’s largest, did best with sales up 0.2 percent to $6.32 billion.Johnson &amp; Johnson, hurt by product recalls and a weak economy, posted a 12 percent decline in profit and a 5.5 percent decline in sales for the fourth quarter on Tuesday.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/16/business/16johnson-and-johnson.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Will Johnson &amp; Johnson Recalls Change the Firm’s Reputation?<date>Published: January 15, 2011</date><text>LITTLE red flags jut out from the shelves at a CVS drugstore in suburban Boston, alerting shoppers to shortages of nearly a dozen Johnson &amp; Johnson products. Among them are Motrin, Rolaids, children’s Tylenol liquid and adult Tylenol, Mylanta, Pepcid AC and even some Neutrogena skin care products.“Looking for Tylenol pain relief products?” asks one of the signs. The notices at CVS serve as a stark reproof to Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose brands have for more than a century been synonymous with quality. Some of its products are in short supply at drugstores and supermarkets because the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of J.&amp; J. last year recalled about 288 million items, including about 136 million bottles of liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl for infants and children. Johnson &amp; Johnson has had to recall such a variety of products because of quality-control problems across product lines, in multiple factories and in several units last year. Some of its consumer products, for instance, may have contained bits of metal. Others came in bottles with a moldy smell. And some products have gone missing from stores with hardly an explanation. All of this has put the company and its manufacturing under the intense scrutiny of lawmakers and officials at the Food and Drug Administration. “It looks like a plane spinning out of control,” says David Vinjamuri, a former J.&amp; J. marketing employee who now trains brand managers at his company, ThirdWay Brand Trainers. While the drugstore signs that helpfully suggest “Try CVS/pharmacy brand” are intended to assist frustrated shoppers in identifying alternatives to missing brand-name products, they also serve as constant reminders of another of J.&amp; J.’s continuing problems: It must persuade millions of disappointed customers to once again pay a premium for products that may no longer seem to be of any higher quality than the less expensive store brand. “I don’t even consider buying them any more,” says Thien-Kim Lam, a mother of two and a blogger in Silver Spring, Md. In a post last spring titled “Makers of Tylenol, I’m Disappointed in You” on the blog DC Metro Moms, Ms. Lam wrote about the huge recall of J.&amp; J. infants’ and children’s medicines. Now, she says, the frequent recalls have prompted her to switch to generic cold and cough medicines for her children. “It’s like a breakup,” she says. “I’m done. I’ve moved on.” Bonnie Jacobs, a McNeil spokeswoman, says the company is committed to restoring McNeil’s reputation as a world-class manufacturer of over-the-counter medicines. “We will invest the necessary resources and make whatever changes are needed to do so, and we will take the time to do it right,” she wrote in an e-mail last Thursday. If Queen Elizabeth II had been the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson, she might have called 2010 an “annus horribilis.” J.&amp; J.’s troubles with some of its consumer products began in earnest last January, when McNeil recalled millions of pill bottles after some consumers complained that they smelled like mold. By December, when it recalled 13 million packages of Rolaids soft chews that may have been contaminated with metal or wood particles, the company had closed one plant in Fort Washington, Pa., for an overhaul and had yet to solve the quality problems at another, in Puerto Rico. The response of J.&amp; J.’s chief executive, William C. Weldon, has been to allocate more than $100 million to upgrade McNeil’s plants and equipment, appoint new manufacturing executives, hire a third-party consulting firm to improve procedures and systems at McNeil and shore up quality control companywide. In Congressional testimony last fall, he promised that when the Pennsylvania plant reopened, it would “represent the state of the art in medicine production.” And he has repeatedly tried to reassure consumers, as he did when he promised that J.&amp; J. had “no higher concern than providing parents with the highest-quality products for their children.” Those reassurances, however, have been followed by yet more recalls. What is most perplexing is the seeming inability of executives to solve — and satisfactorily explain — the manufacturing issues that dog the company. Federal regulators have continued to fault the McNeil unit for failing to identify and address systemic problems at its plants, and consumers remain mystified about why simple products like O.B. tampons can disappear from drugstore shelves. In July, McNeil submitted a plan to the F.D.A. detailing how it intends to overhaul its operations. To comply with regulatory standards, McNeil is undertaking thorough manufacturing and quality-control reviews for all its products, Ms. Jacobs says. That means the recalls may continue. Last Thursday, Ms. Jacobs said the company would “take whatever steps are needed to ensure our products meet quality standards, including further recalls if warranted.” Only a day later, McNeil recalled 47 million units of Sudafed, Sinutab, Benadryl and other drugs from wholesalers because of issues like inadequate equipment cleaning practices. The company said that the recalls were not a result of health problems and that consumers could continue to use the products. JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON, with about $62 billion in sales in 2009, makes thousands of different kinds of products, including Band-Aids, baby shampoo, cardiac stents and advanced drug treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. It solidified a reputation for product quality with a company credo, dating from 1943, saying that the company owed its first responsibility to the mothers and fathers, doctors, nurses and patients who use its products. With such a diversity of products and operating companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s overall business has not suffered significantly. But the string of recent recalls at McNeil threatens to weaken the kind of trust that made many people willing to pay more for J.&amp; J. brands. 1 2 3 4 Next Page »LITTLE red flags jut out from the shelves at a CVS drugstore in suburban Boston, alerting shoppers to shortages of nearly a dozen Johnson &amp; Johnson products.

McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the consumer products unit of the company, also was recalling about 4 million packages of Rolaids Multi-Symptom Berry tablets because of incomplete labels. The company said it was recalling the products as a precautionary measure and not because of any reports of health problems. Consumers can continue to use the products, the firm said. McNeil has been plagued by manufacturing and quality control problems, leading to recalls last year of about 225 million bottles of over-the-counter drugs, according to company estimates. And the total number for McNeil products recalled last year is even higher when other kinds of packages are included. The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that McNeil had recalled ''approximately 288 million drug product units'' in 2010 - including bottles, blister packs, vials, boxes and other objects. Johnson and Johnson said in a statement Friday that the latest recalls were the result of a comprehensive action plan, submitted to the F.D.A. last summer, to bring its manufacturing operations into compliance with federal standards. As part of that effort, McNeil has temporarily closed a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa., for an overhaul and has hired outside consultants to assess its manufacturing and quality control practices. The company said it had also conducted an extensive review to evaluate whether each product made by McNeil's own plants and sold in the United States had been made correctly. For example, the statement said, McNeil identified instances of insufficient equipment cleaning procedures and inadequately documented cleaning. The manufacturing lapses occurred at the Fort Washington plant prior to April, 2010, when the company stopped production there. Last spring, the F.D.A. cited that plant for numerous manufacturing violations, leading McNeil last April 30th to recall some 136 million bottles of liquid children's Tylenol and other children's medicines made there. Friday's recall involves lots of Tylenol 8 Hour, Tylenol Arthritis Pain, Tylenol upper respiratory products, Benadryl, Sudafed PE and Sinutab, as well as the mislabeled Rolaids. McNeil said that it was very unlikely that past production processes had impacted the quality of these products. William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson and Johnson, said in the statement said that steps like the historical product reviews ''help us assure that moving forward, any of our products in the marketplace live up to the trusted standards and expectations that consumers have for all products coming from a Johnson &amp; Johnson company, anywhere in the world.'' Friday's recalls come after Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs recently downgraded shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson in part because analysts predicted that McNeil's recovery could be slow. This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/business/13drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Motrin Buyback Draws Oregon Suit Against Johnson &amp; Johnson<date>Published: January 12, 2011</date><text>An effort by Johnson &amp; Johnson to buy back defective Motrin pills from store shelves — described as a “phantom recall” by some members of Congress — has come under fire in a lawsuit filed by the state of Oregon against the company.McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit involved in several product recalls, had hired outside contractors to buy back vials of Motrin in early 2009 because the pills failed to dissolve properly, a problem that could diminish the product’s effectiveness. The Oregon lawsuit suggests that the problems with those Motrin pills were wider than previously known to the public, extending to certain 24-count packages of Motrin as well as those containing eight-count vials. In a phone interview on Wednesday, John R. Kroger, the attorney general of Oregon, criticized the company’s use of outside contractors to purchase Motrin from retailers, saying it was an effort to avoid the negative publicity that would have accompanied a formal recall from store shelves. “It would be a disaster if these kinds of phantom recalls became an acceptable business practice,” Mr. Kroger said. “The real significance is to send a message to pharmaceutical companies and other companies that make medical products that they have to do proper recalls that give consumers real notice.” In response to a question from a reporter, Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for McNeil, wrote in an e-mail message: “McNeil’s actions were consistent with applicable law and there was no health or safety risk to consumers associated with this limited recall.” After the Food and Drug Administration inquired about the issue in July 2009, McNeil completed a recall of the eight-count vials of Motrin. On Feb. 17, 2010, McNeil announced a recall of the 24-count vials from wholesalers and retailers, according to the Oregon complaint. The Motrin buyback program came to light last year during an investigation into recent recalls of over-the-counter McNeil drugs by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. McNeil recalled more than 200 million product units last year, including different kinds of Tylenol, Motrin and Rolaids. After a hearing into the recalls last May, several members of the House committee began referring to the Motrin buyback program as a phantom recall. The legislators said they found it highly unusual — even suspect — for a drug company to resort to such methods to buy back defective products rather than initiate an official recall. The Oregon complaint, for example, cited a repurchase form, developed by employees at Johnson &amp; Johnson and McNeil, that instructed contractors involved in the Motrin buyback program: “Do not communicate to store personnel any information about this product. Just purchase all available product. If you are questioned by store personnel, simply advise that you have been asked to perform an audit.” But, in public testimony before the House committee last year, Colleen Goggins, a Johnson &amp; Johnson executive then in charge of the company’s consumer products division, said that McNeil had hired a third-party contractor simply to determine how much of the defective Motrin remained on the market. McNeil, she said, had alerted the F.D.A. about the buyback effort. The Oregon lawsuit accuses Johnson &amp; Johnson and McNeil of violating the state’s unlawful trade practices act by misrepresenting the effectiveness and quality of the Motrin in question. It also accused the company of failing to disclose to consumers that the Motrin might have been ineffective. If the company were found liable, it could be fined up to $25,000 for each container of defective Motrin sold to a consumer in Oregon. Ms. Jacobs, the McNeil spokeswoman, said that the company would seek to have the lawsuit dismissed. “There is no legal basis for the claims advanced by Oregon,” she wrote in the e-mail.An effort by Johnson &amp; Johnson to buy back defective Motrin pills from store shelves — described as a “phantom recall” by some members of Congress — has come under fire in a lawsuit filed by the state of Oregon against the company.</text></article></page><page index="2"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/business/11views.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">DuPont's Muscle Is Revealed in Bid<date>Published: January 10, 2011</date><text> Merger activity has resumed in 2011 with a textbook deal: DuPont’s $5.8 billion cash offer for the Danish company Danisco, disclosed on Monday. Initially, the market got carried away with the transaction, pushing Danisco stock above DuPont’s offer of 665 kroner ($115.42) a share. But expectations of a counterbid proved short-lived. DuPont’s accepted offer values Danisco at 12.8 times Danisco’s trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That’s rich for the sector, though justified largely by the target’s above-average growth and profitability. The offer is also at a 90 percent premium to Danisco’s market value a year ago. Meanwhile, the cost-cutting benefits are unclear. While earnings are forecast to grow rapidly, DuPont’s likely return on the acquisition, worth $6.3 billion in all, would be less than 5 percent in Year 1. That means the American company hasn’t found a bargain, though there are strategic reasons for expanding into food science at a time when feeding the world is an increasing challenge. As for Danisco, a maker of food ingredients and additives like artificial sweeteners and cellulose gum, it’s easy to see why its board has recommended the offer, having run an auction which, astonishingly, did not leak to the media. For the same reason, it is hard to see any counterbidding action. There is always a chance that a new buyer will emerge, or that this deal will galvanize a failed suitor to return to the table. But any potential interloper is likely to be intimidated by DuPont’s show of commitment and its firepower. The deal is financed by $3 billion cash on DuPont’s balance sheet and a supporting facility from Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. DuPont was not the first bidder to signal interest in a deal. This transaction, therefore, provides evidence that corporate chieftains are ready to exploit favorable debt markets to pounce on targets that come into play — even when that means being dragged into an auction and having to pay a full “strategic price.” Expect deal flow to pick up. J.&amp;.J.’s Smart Move Smith &amp; Nephew looks nice, but not necessary for Johnson &amp; Johnson. News reports on the first meaningful Merger Monday of 2011 suggested that Johnson &amp; Johnson might be interested in buying Smith &amp; Nephew, a $10 billion-plus orthopedic group based in Britain. A deal could add to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s scale and provide a way to deploy cash stuck overseas. But there would be potential antitrust concerns as well as questions of valuation. An acquisition of Smith &amp; Nephew could give Johnson &amp; Johnson a needed bump. Sales at the health care products company are expected to rise less than 5 percent this year. Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s consumer and pharmaceuticals divisions aren’t likely to make many acquisitions anytime soon. The company has said it preferred co-licensing agreements to expand its drug business. And it is still reeling from a series of embarrassing recalls of Tylenol, Benadryl and other products. Buying Smith &amp; Nephew, on the other hand, would increase Johnson &amp; Johnson’s already dominant position in orthopedics. American hospital chains and governments globally are increasingly looking to hold down implant prices. The fewer suppliers there are, the less likely they are to succeed. Moreover, the price, for now, looks right. Suppose Johnson &amp; Johnson were to pay $11 billion for Smith &amp; Nephew. That would be three times trailing annual sales, which would make it below the average multiple of 3.7 times for similar deals, according to research by Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Furthermore, a large piece of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s $22 billion in cash and short-term investments is overseas. Bringing it home would generate a tax hit. Buying an overseas rival is a relatively more efficient use of the assets. Yet the concentrated orthopedic implant industry has run into problems with regulators before. Limited competition already means that surgeons grow accustomed to certain suppliers and tend not to switch. Greater consolidation might lead to antitrust objections. Moreover, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a history of walking away from deals over price. For example, it let Boston Scientific win Guidant in 2006 rather than outbid its rival. That was probably a smart decision, because the deal nearly pushed Boston Scientific into bankruptcy. So Johnson &amp; Johnson might not put forward an attractive enough offer to woo Smith &amp; Nephew. That would leave Johnson &amp; Johnson as the staid, low-growth company its investors have come to expect.

But McNeil declined last week to identify the Rolaids contractor. Mr. Issa, the chairman-designate of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which has been investigating McNeil for its conduct in previous recalls, disclosed Best Sweet as the Rolaids manufacturer in a letter sent Friday to the Food and Drug Administration. Since Best Sweet’s “facility produces more than four billion products each year, I am concerned about F.D.A.’s knowledge of Best Sweet’s contractual relationship with Johnson &amp; Johnson in manufacturing Rolaids and whether or not the F.D.A. is acting appropriately to determine if there are other similar public safety concerns about products manufactured by Best Sweet,” Mr. Issa wrote in the letter to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the commissioner of the F.D.A. A McNeil spokesman, Marc Boston, confirmed on Friday that Best Sweet had made the Rolaids and said that McNeil had shared the contractor’s name with the F.D.A. In response to a reporter’s query, Rhonda Barnat, a spokeswoman for Best Sweet who works for the Abernathy MacGregor Group, a firm that specializes in crisis communication, wrote in an e-mail: “We have an excellent safety track record. We are cooperating with all parties.” According to the Best Sweet Web site, the company makes nearly a billion soft chews like antacids and calcium supplements each year, as well as more than three billion cough and throat drops, most as private label products for leading retailers like CVS. Best Sweet also makes hard candy for Baskin-Robbins, according to the site. The revelation increases the risk of reputational damage to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which some legislators and industry analysts have faulted previously for failing to be forthcoming with government officials and consumers about the circumstances surrounding recent recalls of Tylenol, Motrin and other products. At the time of last week’s recall, both McNeil and F.D.A. spokesmen declined to provide specific information about the producer of the Rolaids. “The product was manufactured for McNeil Consumer Healthcare division of McNeil-PPC by a third-party manufacturer,” Mr. Boston wrote in an e-mail on Dec. 9. “We’re not providing further details.” Christopher Kelly, an F.D.A. spokesman, said last week that “the identity of a subcontractor is considered confidential, commercial information, and is not releasable by F.D.A. pursuant to federal law. McNeil is responsible for the quality of its products even if they contract out the manufacturing.” In the letter, Mr. Issa asked Dr. Hamburg for more information about the recall, including any inspection reports or warning letters the agency may have issued to Best Sweet. A search of the F.D.A.’s Web site showed no agency warning letters to Best Sweet. “Does the Rolaids recall raise concerns for the F.D.A. about the safety of other products manufactured by Best Sweet?” Mr. Issa asked in the letter. He asked for a reply by Jan. 5.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/business/16drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Puts 2 in Line to Succeed Weldon<date>Published: December 15, 2010</date><text>After a year marked by embarrassing consumer product calls, Johnson and Johnson on Wednesday set in motion a horse race between two longtime executives to succeed William C. Weldon, 62, the chief executive and chairman.The company said in a statement on Wednesday morning that it was promoting Alex Gorsky, 50, the worldwide chairman of the company’s medical device and diagnostics group, and Sheri S. McCoy, 52, the worldwide chairwoman of the pharmaceuticals group, to vice chairman and vice chairwoman of the executive committee. In their new positions, effective Jan. 3, they will join Mr. Weldon, in expanded roles as junior partners. “The changes are an appropriate step in furthering our long-term succession plans, and assuring talented, experienced leaders at all levels of the organization,” Mr. Weldon said in the statement. Mr. Weldon, who joined the company in 1971, oversaw its pharmaceutical group from 1998 until 2002, the year he became chief executive. The announcement caps the ending of an unusually troubled year for Johnson &amp; Johnson, during which its McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit has been buffeted by manufacturing problems, leading to recalls of millions of packages of popular over-the-counter drugs, including Tylenol and Rolaids. Some industry observers have criticized Mr. Weldon’s handling of the problems and the ensuing public relations fallout. They have said the chief executive acted too slowly to rectify quality control problems at McNeil and, more generally, was too slow to put a succession plan in place. But a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail that Mr. Weldon “has no plans to retire.” The appointments on Wednesday suggest that Johnson and Johnson may continue its tradition of promoting its chief executive from within, which it has done six times since becoming a publicly traded company in 1944. Ms. McCoy and Mr. Gorsky have been viewed as likely candidates to succeed Mr. Weldon since their appointments as group leaders last year, and they will join him in adjunct leadership roles. Additionally, Ms. McCoy is to supervise the pharmaceuticals group; the consumer group, which includes the McNeil unit; and corporate affairs. (This year, after federal regulators and lawmakers began investigating McNeil’s problems, the company announced that Colleen A. Goggins, a longtime executive who was head of the consumer products division including McNeil, would be retiring.) Under the new structure, Mr. Gorsky will oversee the medical device group, the global supply chain and government affairs. “Without question, it signals that the transition process is under way in terms of the era of Bill Weldon ending and setting the stage for a new chairman and chief executive,” said Rick Wise, an analyst with Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. “As always,” he said, “the preference and desire at Johnson &amp; Johnson is to appoint someone who has come up through the system, who has broad experience in various markets and probably has developed an internal constituency that would enable them to lead.” The appointments, he said, set up a two-way race between respected industry veterans with different career paths. Mr. Gorsky started at Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1988 as a sales representative with the company’s Janssen unit, becoming president of Janssen in 2001, according to a company biography. In 2003, he became company group chairman of J.&amp; J.’s pharmaceutical business in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In 2004, Mr. Gorsky left the company to become the head of pharmaceuticals in North America for Novartis, the Swiss drug maker. In 2008, he returned to Johnson &amp; Johnson as company group chairman for Ethicon, the unit that makes sutures and other surgical products. In 2009, he became worldwide chairman of the surgical care group and joined the company’s executive committee. Ms. McCoy, meanwhile, started her career in 1982 at Johnson &amp; Johnson as a scientist in research and development for consumer products. In 2000, she became vice president for marketing of skin-care products and, in 2002, she became global president for baby products and wound care products. In 2005, she became company group chairwoman of Ethicon, a position that included oversight of the medical device business in Latin America. In 2008, she became worldwide chairwoman of the surgical care group and joined the executive committee. The race to become the next chief executive may be difficult to handicap because each candidate has experience in the drug and medical device groups, divisions that both play a significant role in company earnings. Johnson &amp; Johnson reported sales in 2009 of nearly $62 billion, including about $15.8 billion in consumer products; $22.5 billion in pharmaceuticals; and about $23.6 billion in medical devices, according to a company earnings statement. Even so, the promotions of Mr. Gorsky and Ms. McCoy may improve morale among the ranks of employees dispirited by a year of product recalls. With the new appointments, said Mr. Wise of Leerink Swann, the company is saying, “Hey, you can start as a sales rep and carry a badge, or you can start as a scientist, but you, too, if you work hard and are consistent and excellent, you, too, have a chance of rising to the top.”</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/10/business/10recall.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Unit Issues Recall of Rolaids<date>Published: December 9, 2010</date><text>A unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson announced a nationwide recall on Thursday of all lots — more than 13 million packages — of the soft chewable versions of Rolaids, its popular antacid drug, after reports of consumers finding metal and wood particles in the products.The unit, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has been troubled by manufacturing deficiencies over the last year, which has led to a series of recalls of some of the country’s most popular over-the-counter brands. A recall in April alone involved about 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other pediatric products. Although McNeil said early this year that it was instituting a comprehensive plan to improve its manufacturing and quality control systems — including the temporary closure of a plant in Pennsylvania for an upgrade — some manufacturing problems have continued. The foreign particles found in the Rolaids were potentially introduced during production at a third-party manufacturer, McNeil said in a statement. McNeil declined to identify the manufacturer. The recall involves all lots of Rolaids Extra Strength Softchews, all lots of Rolaids Extra Strength Plus Gas Softchews and Rolaids Multi-Symptom Plus Anti-Gas Softchews sold in the United States. While the risk of health problems is remote, McNeil said consumers should stop using the Rolaids involved. Also on Thursday, Wells Fargo downgraded shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson to market perform, citing risks associated with McNeil’s problems. Last month, for example, the Food and Drug Administration posted a report on its Web site citing a McNeil plant in Puerto Rico that was inspected this fall for manufacturing problems. The report cited the facility for, among other issues, distributing products that failed quality requirements, failing to identify product defects during routine testing, failing to adequately investigate product problems and inadequate training of laboratory staff. In an interview last month, Karen Riley, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the report indicated that McNeil “continues to have serious quality control issues at its plant and that it is not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices required by federal law.” Earlier this year, the agency said its office of criminal investigations had opened an inquiry into the company’s conduct surrounding the recent recalls. Separately, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has held two hearings in which legislators questioned company executives and F.D.A. officials about their conduct in the recalls. The Rolaids recall “reinforces the committee’s ongoing investigation surrounding the safety protocols in place at J.&amp; J.’s facilities and how the F.D.A. is managing food and drug safety,” Kurt Bardella, a spokesman for the committee chairman-designate, Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, said. “The committee is in the process of and will continue to seek answers from J.&amp; J. and the F.D.A.” Johnson &amp; Johnson executives estimated earlier that the recalls and closure of the Pennsylvania plant would reduce sales by about $600 million this year. In a note to investors on Thursday, Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo, estimated that there was a 25 to 50 percent chance that McNeil would close the plant in Puerto Rico because of the latest F.D.A. report. “We believe there is risk to JNJ’s McNeil” over-the-counter business in 2011, he wrote, “and see few potential offsets and prefer to stay on the sidelines until there is some clarity.” In September, Johnson &amp; Johnson said that the executive in charge of the consumer business, including McNeil, would retire in March, a move analysts interpreted to mean that she was taking the blame for the problems. In the latest recall, McNeil said it had suspended production of the Rolaids products and would not restart production until it had taken corrective actions. Consumers who bought the products may call 1-888-222-6036 or go to www.rolaids.com for instructions about a refund, McNeil said. Since the problems with Tylenol and other children’s liquid medicines this spring, the company has heightened its vigilance in recalling products that may not meet manufacturing standards. Last month, for example, after a review identified manufacturing problems, McNeil recalled nine million bottles of liquid Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom to update labels, 71,000 packages of soft chewable Rolaids because of an unusual texture caused by crystallized sugar, four million packages of Benadryl and 850,000 bottles of Motrin. Unlike Thursday’s consumer recall, the November recalls were at the wholesale and retail levels. That meant stores stopped selling the products, but people could continue to use them, McNeil said. Other Johnson &amp; Johnson units have experienced problems this year. In August, for example, the DePuy Orthopaedics unit recalled two kinds of hip implants because many patients required a second replacement after the implants failed.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/business/27drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson Unit Falls Short of Standards, F.D.A. Says<date>Published: November 26, 2010</date><text>Months after McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, recalled millions of bottles of Tylenol and other over-the-counter drugs, the division is still plagued with manufacturing flaws, according to the Food and Drug Administration.Agency officials who filed an inspection report, posted on the agency’s Web site this month, about a McNeil plant in Puerto Rico cited a variety of problems: distribution of drugs that failed quality requirements, a failure to identify product defects during routine testing, failure to detect incorrect expiration dates on drug labels, failure to adequately investigate product problems, failure to follow laboratory controls and inadequate training of lab staff. Last January, the agency sent a warning letter to Peter Luther, the president of McNeil, about significant manufacturing violations at the same plant. The new inspection report indicates that some problems have not been corrected, said Karen Riley, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. “Clearly, this inspection shows that the company continues to have serious quality control issues at its plant and that it is not in compliance with current good manufacturing practices required by federal law,” Ms. Riley said Friday. The agency, she added, was not aware of any harm to consumers associated with the latest problems at that plant. Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for McNeil, said on Friday that the company had responded in detail to the F.D.A.’s concerns. The inspection report represents a setback for Johnson &amp; Johnson as it tries to rebuild public trust in its drug brands after a series of recalls involving millions of products for more than a year. These included a recall in April of an estimated 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other pediatric products, made at a plant in Fort Washington, Pa., and a recall in January of millions of bottles of Tylenol, Motrin and other products made at the Puerto Rico site. A Congressional committee and the F.D.A. office of criminal investigations are separately investigating conduct surrounding McNeil’s recalls. In July, McNeil submitted a plan to the F.D.A. describing the steps the company planned to take to comply with manufacturing standards. McNeil temporarily closed the Pennsylvania plant this year for an overhaul and replaced some employees. In September, Colleen A. Goggins, a Johnson &amp; Johnson executive in charge of the company’s consumer product division, said she planned to retire next year, an announcement that some Wall Street analysts interpreted to mean she was taking the fall for McNeil’s problems. The company has also heightened its vigilance in recalling products that might not meet manufacturing standards. This month, for example, after a review identified manufacturing problems, McNeil recalled nine million bottles of liquid Tylenol Cold Multi-Symptom to update labels, 71,000 packages of Rolaids soft chews because of an unusual texture caused by crystallized sugar, four million packages of Benadryl and 850,000 bottles of Motrin, the company said. These were wholesale and retail — not consumer —recalls and were not undertaken because of potential health risks, the company said. People can continue to use the products, McNeil said. But the latest F.D.A. report, a 10-page document covering inspections from late September through early November, noted some recurrent problems at the plant, including inadequate quality control and incomplete investigations of product deficiencies. For example, the report said that laboratory staff members who tested product quality had made a number of errors and that the company had not yet improved their training. The report concluded that there was no assurance at the Puerto Rico plant “that the current laboratory controls are adequate to assure that drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and purity.” Officials also noted problems with equipment cleaning and drug mix-ups. “The established procedures and controls for cleaning and maintenance may not be sufficient to prevent mix-ups and/or contamination during the manufacturing and packaging process as evidenced by the mix-up deviations and incidents involving manufacturing and packaging operations,” the report said. The F.D.A. warning letter issued in January about the same plant included similar concerns. On the same day as the warning, McNeil recalled millions of bottles of Tylenol, Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep and St. Joseph aspirin because some consumers had earlier complained about moldy odors emanating from some bottles. The company later determined that a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets had caused the odor. In a statement, McNeil said that it had been working diligently since January to ensure that its manufacturing operations met F.D.A. standards. “While the company has made progress toward that goal, this is an ongoing commitment and we will invest all necessary resources in order to achieve it,” the statement said. Over the last 10 months, the statement said, McNeil has taken a number of significant steps to improve its manufacturing.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/23/business/23drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Children’s Benadryl Tablets Recalled by Johnson &amp; Johnson<date>Published: November 23, 2010</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the maker of health care products, has recalled about four million packages of cherry- and grape-flavored Children’s Benadryl allergy tablets and about 800,000 bottles of junior-strength Motrin caplets.The recall was necessary because of “insufficiencies in the development of the manufacturing process,” Bonnie Jacobs, a company spokeswoman, said Monday. The recalls are taking place at wholesale and retail locations and do not require any action by consumers, she said. “Consumers can continue to use the product; they don’t have to take any action,” Ms. Jacobs said of the Benadryl and Motrin recalls. The action “is not being taken on the basis of adverse events” or safety issues, she said. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s McNeil unit withdrew more than 40 types of children’s over-the-counter liquid medicines in April, forcing a suspension of production at a manufacturing plant and reducing 2010 sales by about $600 million. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been investigating the company’s handling of the recall and a separate incident involving Motrin tablets. The products being recalled are Children’s Benadryl allergy Fastmelt tablets, in cherry and grape flavors, and junior-strength Motrin caplets, 24 count, according to the McNeil Web site.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/business/20drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp; J.’s Earnings Rise Despite Sales Decline<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>A series of recalls of Tylenol and other popular brand-name medicines this year is largely to blame for a decline in third-quarter sales at Johnson &amp; Johnson to $15 billion, a decrease of 0.7 percent, the company said on Tuesday.Even so, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s earnings in the third quarter rose 2.2 percent to $3.4 billion, the company said, because of a lower tax rate and nonoperating income. Johnson &amp; Johnson reported earnings for the third quarter of $1.23 a share — representing a 2.5 percent increase compared with the same quarter of last year — beating consensus estimates of $1.15. In light of the third-quarter earnings, the company raised full-year 2010 earnings guidance to $4.70 to $4.80 a share, from $4.65 to $4.75. Although worldwide consumer sales for Johnson &amp; Johnson declined to $3.6 billion in the third quarter, a decrease of 10.6 percent compared to the same period last year, pharmaceutical sales grew to $5.5 billion, an increase of 4.7 percent compared with the previous year, the company said. But some industry analysts described Johnson &amp; Johnson’s performance this quarter as weak, given the overall decline in sales. “The low quality of the beat will likely be viewed negatively by investors,” Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in an note to investors on Tuesday, “although there may be some relief that consumer sales did not fall even further than they did given the issues that J.&amp; J. is dealing with in that business.” McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, has been troubled over the last year by a series of recalls of popular products, including infants’ and children’s liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl as well as different kinds of Tylenol and other products for adults. As a result, the company’s consumer division posted sales in the United States of about $1.3 billion in the third quarter of this year, down from about $1.7 billion in the same quarter of 2009. Within that consumer division, sales of over-the-counter drugs and nutritional products in the United States plummeted to $438 million in the third quarter from $732 million in the same time period last year, a decrease of about 40 percent, the company said. Although Johnson &amp; Johnson’s chief executive, William C. Weldon, has been making a public effort of late to rebuild consumers’ confidence in the company’s over-the-counter drugs, some analysts said the string of problems at McNeil may do long-term damage to the brand’s image. The office of criminal investigation of the Food and Drug Administration and, separately, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, have been investigating the company’s conduct surrounding the recalls. The company’s weak sales of consumer products in the United States “could potentially signal some systemic damage to J.&amp; J.’s brand name in light of the recent McNeil recalls and negative publicity,” Rick Wise, an analyst with Leerink Swann, wrote in a note Tuesday to investors. Even so, he is rating Johnson &amp; Johnson’s stock as outperform. McNeil has temporarily closed its plant in Fort Washington, Pa., for an upgrade and is putting in place a companywide plan to strengthen manufacturing and quality control, company executives said earlier this year. But the shutdown has led to a dearth of popular products in many drugstores. McNeil expects to return to full production by the middle of next year, at first by making the products at other company plants, Dominic J. Caruso, the chief financial officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said in a conference call with investors on Tuesday morning. The Fort Washington plant should be operational by the end of next year, he said. In the meantime, Perrigo, a generic maker of drugstore-branded over-the-counter drugs, has increased its market share. Even when Tylenol and other McNeil products fully return to the market, Perrigo should be able to maintain about half of its gain in market share, Christopher Schott, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote to investors on Tuesday.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07EEDD1739F93AA25753C1A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">PRESCRIPTIONS; McNeil Recalls Tylenol Caplets<date>Published: October 19, 2010</date><text>The troubled McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Monday evening that it was voluntarily recalling nearly 128,000 bottles of Tylenol eight-hour caplets. McNeil said it had taken the action after some consumers complained of a musty or moldy odor in the products which are sold in the United States and Puerto Rico. In a statement, the company said that even though the risk of problems is remote, people should stop using the Tylenol caplets involved in the recall. The announcement is the latest in a series of recalls - involving more than 150 million units of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec for adults, infants and children - by McNeil over the last year. The products were made at McNeil plants in Puerto Rico and Fort Washington, Pa. The company has temporarily closed the Fort Washington plant for an upgrade. The latest recall by McNeil comes the night before Johnson &amp; Johnson is scheduled to present its third quarter earnings results. Company executives estimated, in a previous earnings conference call with investors in July, that the recalls and plant closure would reduce sales by about $600 million this year. The news of the recall coincides with a public relations effort by the company's chief executive, William C. Weldon, over the past few months to reassure investors and regain the trust of consumers in the products. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and, separately, the office of criminal investigation of the Food and Drug Administration, have been investigating the company's conduct surrounding the recalls. The current recall is not the first time that McNeil has withdrawn medicines from store shelves after consumers complained about a moldy or mildewy smell emanating from the products. McNeil recalled products in January, June and July of this year, made at its Puerto Rico plant, because of such complaints. The company said at the time that chemical contamination, caused by a substance used to treat wooden transport pallets that had leached into the products, was to blame for the odor. A few consumers complained of stomach problems like nausea, stomach pain and vomiting, the company said, but the problems were temporary and non-serious. The current recall involves 50-count bottles of Tylenol eight-hour caplets made at the Fort Washington plant in March, before the facility was closed, Carol Goodrich, a company spokeswoman said. The company believes the uncharacteristic odor in these products was caused by trace amounts of the same chemical that was to blame for the product contamination at the Puerto Rico plant, she said.

The suit said Johnson &amp; Johnson and Janssen sent letters to more than 7,500 doctors and made more than 27,000 phone calls that improperly claimed its schizophrenia drug Risperdal was safer than competing medications and minimized its link to diabetes. Michael Heinley, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Ortho-McNeil Janssen Pharmaceuticals division, said the company would appeal. “We believe the jury was not appropriately instructed on applicable legal standards and that critical and highly relevant evidence was excluded,” he said Friday.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/business/01drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">F.D.A. Official Cites Failures at Multiple J.&amp;J. Plants<date>Published: September 30, 2010</date><text>A top official at the Food and Drug Administration told lawmakers on Thursday that quality control failures at the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit involved in the recalls of popular medications like children’s liquid Tylenol were not isolated to one plant, but were far more widespread.At a Congressional hearing, Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the agency’s principal deputy commissioner, contradicted company executives’ assertions that the kinds of lapses causing the recall were limited to a site in Fort Washington, Pa., that has since been shut down for an overhaul. Dr. Sharfstein said the F.D.A. “has found inspectional deficiencies of varying degrees of seriousness at all of these facilities” under the umbrella of McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson that manufactures the popular products. “The company had an inadequate quality system, and you can see that in a number of facilities,” he said. At those sites, Dr. Sharfstein said, there was “the failure to investigate and correct product problems in a prompt and thorough manner.” The company has responded by making several changes to its quality and manufacturing operations, he said, and the agency is evaluating those steps. Johnson &amp; Johnson has said that the company undertook a sweeping reorganization of its operations after the recalls and that it has invested more than $100 million in McNeil facilities. Lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform did not spare the F.D.A. in their criticisms of how the company and federal regulators handled the recalls of 136 million bottles of liquid infants’ and children’s medicines in April and a controversial recall of adult Motrin pills last year. “That failure will mar Johnson &amp; Johnson’s image for many, many years,” said Representative Darrell Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the committee, who also singled out the F.D.A. for what he called its “carelessness” and “deficiencies.” He criticized the agency for not being clear about what it knew about the recalls, and about its role in causing delays in getting some of these products off the market and in recognizing the extent of the problems. Thursday’s hearing was the second one held on the recalls, and the stakes were particularly high for Johnson &amp; Johnson and William C. Weldon, its chief executive. Mr. Weldon, who did not appear at the first hearing because of back surgery, was quick to acknowledge to lawmakers that the company had made mistakes. “I know that we let the public down,” he said. “We did not maintain our high-quality standards, and as a result, children do not have access to our important medicines.” He said consumers would start seeing the liquid children’s products made by the company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit within a few weeks. (The recalls led to shortages of certain medications, frustrating many parents.) In response to repeated questions by lawmakers about whether the executives responsible for the issues had been replaced, Mr. Weldon said personnel changes had been made. “The players we needed to replace we replaced,” he said. “I can only assure you that we will not let this happen again,” Mr. Weldon said. The hearing also focused on a second recall, the so-called phantom recall, which happened when the company tried to remove certain vials of Motrin from store shelves without alerting the public. “McNeil should have handled this differently,” Mr. Weldon said, and he did not defend its decision to buy back the products without fully informing the agency. “We made a mistake,” he said. Dr. Sharfstein also said that the agency should have done more, but he insisted that it had not known that Johnson &amp; Johnson was buying back or removing medicine from store shelves without alerting retailers about its reasons. The person overseeing the agency’s district office who had been involved in those discussions could not testify at the hearing because of a criminal investigation into the related events, he said.</text></article></page><page index="3"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/29/business/29tylenol.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Weldon, J.&amp;J.’s Chief, Set to Testify Before Congress<date>Published: September 28, 2010</date><text>In recent weeks, the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson has gone on the offensive in a very public way, trying to assure customers and company employees that the recalls of popular over-the-counter drugs like children’s liquid Tylenol did not reflect systemic problems across the corporation.And on Thursday, the executive, William C. Weldon, is expected to appear at a Congressional hearing, for the first time providing his own account to lawmakers of the manufacturing problems that led to the recalls. Mr. Weldon has asserted that missteps at the company’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which was responsible for the withdrawal of certain products from the marketplace, have been contained. “From Johnson &amp; Johnson’s perspective, our response to this issue was the most responsible it could possibly be,” Mr. Weldon said in a recent telephone interview. After months of silence, he has also appeared on CNBC and has toured the company’s own sites to talk about McNeil. “We want to ensure nothing like this happens again,” he said. His testimony before Congress comes as the company confronts other highly publicized problems that have swirled around Mr. Weldon’s stewardship and the once unassailable integrity of one of the world’s most respected companies. In recent months, the company has recalled tens of thousands of artificial hips as well as several million contact lenses, made by distinct units. The company is also the subject of numerous government inquiries and a spate of consumer lawsuits. In McNeil’s case, the unit recalled about 136 million bottles of liquid infants’ and children’s medicines in April, and millions of bottles of Tylenol and other pills for adults earlier in the year. “These problems are accumulating,” said Les Funtleyder, who invests in health care stocks for Miller Tabak &amp; Company in New York. “At some point, investors are going to start to question J.&amp; J.’s management.” Representative Darrell Issa, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which is holding Thursday’s hearing, said in a telephone interview that the company had failed to adequately oversee the McNeil unit and did not correct the manufacturing problems there quickly. “Does Johnson &amp; Johnson oversee its divisions properly, or do they have too much autonomy?” Mr. Issa asked. “Does the big name — Johnson &amp; Johnson — mean quality, or do you have to judge each division separately?” Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers plan to delve into communications between corporate executives and the Food and Drug Administration as recalls were considered or taking place, including attempts by the company to buy back certain vials of Motrin pills rather than formally recall them from the shelves. Mr. Weldon said in the interview earlier this month that the company had acted quickly to recall the products, inform consumers and explain that the medicines posed no serious health hazard. While the company has temporarily shut the plant in Fort Washington, Pa., that manufactured the children’s over-the-counter products for an overhaul, Mr. Weldon said the company planned to reintroduce certain products later this year. “We have a standard and we hold all our companies to that standard,” Mr. Weldon said, adding that he took full responsibility for McNeil’s problems. Johnson &amp; Johnson has also announced a series of moves meant to address the concerns over the quality of its products. In addition to a systemic review of the manufacturing operations at all of its units, the company has overhauled and centralized its quality control operations. This month, it also said Colleen A. Goggins, the senior executive who was in charge of all of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s consumer businesses, would leave. Ms. Goggins also is expected to testify at Thursday’s hearing, her second appearance before the committee on these issues. To date, some people fault the company’s response as inadequate. “It’s too little, too late,” said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan. Mr. Weldon had an obligation to address the concerns about McNeil and the decentralized nature of the company earlier this year, he said. The company has long prided itself on, and derived strong yearly profit growth from, its decentralized management structure. By having a diverse array of companies, with more than 250 separate units, the company has managed to innovate and prosper despite its size. “J.&amp; J. has been a master of that,” said Richard N. Foster, a former McKinsey partner who has written about Johnson &amp; Johnson. “There are very few companies in J.&amp; J.’s class.” Until the first quarter of 2009, for example, Johnson &amp; Johnson had managed to increase its earnings, adjusted for special items, for 94 consecutive quarters.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E6DA103DF93BA2575AC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">DEALBOOK; BUSINESS BRIEFING | COMPANY NEWS: Johnson &amp; Johnson in Talks to Buy Dutch Firm<date>Published: September 18, 2010</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the American health products company, said Friday that it was in advanced talks to bid for the 82 percent of Crucell, a Dutch biopharmaceutical firm, that it does not already own, in what would be a 1.75 billion euro ($2.3 billion) deal. The all-cash bid would give Crucell stakeholders 24.75 euros a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson would acquire a company known for its research, manufacture and marketing of vaccines and antibodies. It bought its initial stake in Crucell for 300 million euros last year. Crucell shares rose 8.51 euros, or 54.19 percent, to 24.20 euros in Amsterdam on Friday, giving the company a market cap of nearly 2 billion euros. Fabian Smeets, an analyst at Rabo Securities, said he thought the bid might go higher. ''Johnson &amp; Johnson could add a couple euros,'' Mr. Smeets said, citing Crucell's 500 million euros in cash. While other bidders may be in the wings, Crucell is bound by change-of-control clauses for certain products it makes and markets, including Quinvaxem, a vaccine against childhood diseases that it co-developed with Novartis and which is now a major revenue source for the Dutch company. Crucell could lose rights to the drug if it were sold to certain pharmaceutical competitors. Should the deal go through, Johnson &amp; Johnson would maintain Crucell's management, staff levels and headquarters in Leiden, the Netherlands, the company said. The expectation of such a limited restructuring in the event of a takeover is one reason why Crucell prefers Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mr. Smeets said, adding that it would occupy a special place in a company that allows for entrepreneurship, unlike some other drug makers. The last time Crucell was in play was just last year, but the bid from Wyeth fell through after it was taken over by Pfizer. --Chris V.

Goggins, who testified this spring before a Congressional committee investigating the recalls, would retire in March. Ms. Goggins, 56, has worked at Johnson &amp; Johnson since 1981 and was a member of the company’s senior leadership. Her departure shuffles the lineup of successors to William C. Weldon, who has served as the company’s chairman and chief executive since 2002. In an interview before the announcement on Thursday, Mr. Weldon said the company had a strong history of choosing an internal candidate to lead it. Ms. Goggins has been overseeing one of the company’s three major divisions. Her portfolio includes the company’s most famous family brands: Johnson’s baby shampoo and Band-Aids. She is responsible not only for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the unit that recalled Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec earlier this year, but also popular and lucrative products like Listerine, Rembrandt, Neutrogena, Aveeno, Rogaine, Visine and the sweetener Splenda. In the earlier interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Weldon gave no clue that Ms. Goggins would be retiring. But he said the company had taken steps to address the problems at McNeil and to ensure quality control companywide. “What we want to instill in people is that quality is the most important thing at Johnson &amp; Johnson,” Mr. Weldon said. “We have to ensure that this never happens again.” Despite the company’s recent woes, investors say they still have confidence in Mr. Weldon’s stewardship. Ms. Goggins could not be reached for comment. News of the retirement of Ms. Goggins came on the same day that the House committee looking into the recall of about 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other products made by McNeil, scheduled another hearing, on Sept. 30, about the company’s problems. The chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, said that he had called a second hearing because of lingering questions related to the company’s conduct in the Tylenol recall and another involving Motrin. Mr. Weldon, who did not testify at the first hearing because he was recovering from back surgery, said he would appear for the next round. “I will definitely testify,” Mr. Weldon said. “I wanted to testify at the last one.” After the first hearing, Mr. Weldon met with Mr. Towns and the ranking Republican member of the committee, Representative Darrell Issa of California, he said. “I told them that I accepted full accountability and responsibility for what had happened and that I was committed to remedying the situation,” Mr. Weldon said. The children’s Tylenol recall led to a shortage of such medicines on the market, frustrating many parents, and prompted Johnson &amp; Johnson to close a McNeil plant in Pennsylvania this summer, laying off its employees, to upgrade the site. During the first Congressional hearing, committee members questioned Ms. Goggins, the worldwide chairwoman of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s consumer group, about the company’s actions in what Mr. Towns termed a “phantom recall.” In that instance, the company hired outside contractors to buy certain kinds of Motrin from several thousand convenience stores — without instituting a formal recall in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration. The F.D.A. later insisted that the company conduct a formal recall, an agency official testified during the hearing. During the hearing, Ms. Goggins acknowledged the problems at McNeil but defended the company’s integrity. “There was never any intent to deceive or hide anything,” Ms. Goggins said. According to the company’s proxy filing, Ms. Goggins received compensation of $8.3 million in fiscal year 2009. A separate regulatory filing indicated that she sold nearly $3 million in company stock a week ago. In a statement, Mr. Weldon praised Ms. Goggins and said she had helped put a plan in place for remedying the issues at McNeil. The company said it would make an announcement soon about a successor.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/01drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">New Drugs Rival Warfarin as Blood Clot Preventer<date>Published: August 31, 2010</date><text>For investors who have been asking themselves whether medium-size pharmaceutical companies can survive in an industry that has had recent mega-mergers, the answer seems to be yes. At least for Bristol-Myers Squibb.The company’s experimental anticoagulant drug apixaban worked better than aspirin in preventing stroke and systemic blood clots for patients who have an irregular heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation, according to new study data presented on Tuesday at a cardiology conference in Stockholm. Investment bank analysts have estimated that a new generation of stroke prevention drugs like apixaban, if approved by the Food and Drug Administration, could generate $10 billion or more in annual global sales. Patients taking apixaban had a rate of stroke or systemic blood clots of 1.6 percent a year, while those on aspirin had a rate of 3.6 percent a year, a statistically significant difference, according to a preliminary analysis of the new data. The rate of major bleeding was 1.2 percent a year for the apixaban group and 1.4 percent on aspirin — not a significant difference, researchers reported. Atrial fibrillation affects about 2.2 million people in the United States, and that number is expected to double in the next 10 years, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Bristol-Myers discovered apixaban and is developing the drug jointly with Pfizer. The study involved 5,600 patients who were unsuited for the standard treatment for atrial fibrillation, warfarin. In a note to investors on Tuesday, Christopher Schott, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, wrote that positive responses to the study data among leading cardiologists “suggest that apixaban will likely capture a disproportionate share,” by some estimates up to 50 percent, of patients who cannot tolerate warfarin. The companies are also conducting a head-to-head trial of apixaban and warfarin in more than 18,000 patients with atrial fibrillation. The companies expect to report data from that study next year, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb said. Indeed, apixaban is one of several drugs that pharmaceutical companies are developing in an effort to replace warfarin, a decades-old drug for atrial fibrillation. Prescription drugs like antibiotics, as well as foods rich in vitamin K, can affect the potency of warfarin. Also, patients on warfarin need regular blood tests to evaluate their clotting rate. Other warfarin alternatives in the pharmaceutical pipeline include rivaroxaban, discovered by Bayer HealthCare and under development jointly with Johnson &amp; Johnson, and dabigatran from Boehringer Ingelheim. A new study presented Tuesday at the cardiology conference in Stockholm said rivaroxaban worked about as well as standard treatments at preventing recurrent blood clots in the veins for people with deep vein thrombosis. The rate of risky blood clots in the veins or lungs was 2.1 percent for the rivaroxaban group compared with 3 percent for the standard treatment group, according to a statement Tuesday from Johnson &amp; Johnson. A side effect, bleeding, occurred in about 8 percent of patients in each group, the release said. Johnson &amp; Johnson has submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration for rivaroxaban as a treatment to reduce the risk of dangerous blood clots in people undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery. Rivaroxaban is already marketed for that purpose in 75 countries outside of the United States, including Canada. Meanwhile, Boehringer Ingelheim, the German drug maker, has developed dabigatran, a drug to prevent stroke and systemic blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation. The drug is already approved for use in Canada. An F.D.A. panel is to review the drug on Sept. 20. Trading in Bristol-Myers closed at $26.08 a share on Tuesday, up 23 cents.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/27/business/27hip.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Recalls Hip Implants<date>Published: August 26, 2010</date><text>More than two years after the Food and Drug Administration began receiving complaints about the failure of a hip replacement implant made by the DePuy Orthopaedics unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, the company said Thursday that it was recalling two kinds of hip implants.DePuy said that it had made the decision to withdraw the products because many patients required a second hip replacement after the company’s implants had failed. The news compounded problems for Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has recalled a succession of some of its best-selling and best-known products, including liquid children’s Tylenol in the United States and, just this week, Acuvue contact lenses in Japan and other countries in Asia and Europe. The Tylenol recall led to the temporary closing of a plant owned by the McNeil Consumer Health Care unit, which is the subject of a federal inquiry over its handling of recent recalls of over-the-counter products. In addition to DePuy’s recall, the F.D.A. this week criticized the company in a warning letter, contending that it had illegally marketed an unapproved knee device and had also sold a hip implant for an unapproved use. (A spokeswoman for DePuy said that the company was examining the F.D.A.’s concerns.) “All this makes it seem like it’s pile-on time for J.&amp; J.,” said William Trombetta, a professor of pharmaceutical marketing at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia. “This is a company that was purer than Caesar’s wife, this was the gold standard, and all of a sudden it just seems like things are breaking down.” In the latest Johnson &amp; Johnson case, DePuy said in a statement that it was recalling two products: the ASR XL Acetabular System, a hip socket used in traditional hip replacement, and the ASR Hip Resurfacing System, a partial hip replacement that involves placing a metal cap on the ball of the femur, a method intended to preserve more bone. The traditional implant has been available worldwide, and the resurfacing implant was approved for use in countries outside the United States. About 93,000 of these devices have been implanted worldwide, said Lorie Gawreluk, a DePuy spokeswoman. The New York Times reported in March that for more than two years, the F.D.A. had been receiving complaints that the devices failed early in some patients, requiring expensive and painful operations to put in new hip replacements. Since the start of 2008, the F.D.A. has received about 400 complaints involving patients in the United States who received the devices, an agency spokeswoman said Thursday. DePuy said that the majority of hip replacements using the ASR devices had been successful. But the company advised patients who had had hip replacements with the recalled products to visit their surgeons for an evaluation and annual monitoring. The company said it would pay reasonable and customary medical costs associated with the recalled products, including new hip replacement operations. DePuy had sales last year of about $5.4 billion, according to a Johnson &amp; Johnson earnings report. The high early failure rate of the ASR implants was reported this year in severalarticles in The New York Times. These devices have come under scrutiny over the last few years because they are part of a category of implants called metal-on-metal bearings, which can generate debris from wear, causing inflammation and tissue damage in certain patients. In March, the British agency that regulates medical devices issued an advisory on metal debris generated by hip implants. A spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency was planning to meet soon with professional medical groups to discuss the British advisory. Late last year, DePuy said it was phasing out the implants because of slowing sales. In March, the company warned doctors that the implants might have a high failure rate in some patients. In one New York Times article, some orthopedic experts expressed dismay that DePuy had not halted sales of the devices earlier. About 12 to 13 percent of patients needed a second hip replacement within five years of receiving an ASR implant, the statement from DePuy said, citing new unpublished data from a national registry in Britain. Previously reported follow-up data, including internal company information and clinical trials, had reported lower rates of second hip replacement comparable to similar devices by other companies, the statement said. But many medical centers in the United States that specialize in joint replacement surgery had already noticed a higher failure rate with the DePuy hip implants, said Dr. Joshua J. Jacobs, the chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “Most major medical centers have seen issues with this device,” Dr. Jacobs said. “This does not come as a surprise.” Dr. Jacobs added that the DePuy recall pointed to the importance of having a national registry for joint implants that can serve as an early warning system for product problems. Britain, Australia and some other countries have such national registries, he said, but the reporting system currently used by the F.D.A. does not necessarily capture every device failure. David Floyd, president of DePuy, said in a statement that the recall would be a concern for patients and their family members and for surgeons. “We are committed to assisting patients and health care providers by providing information through multiple channels and paying for the costs of doctor visits, tests and procedures associated with the recall,” he said. Johnson &amp; Johnson comprises more than 250 different operating companies in 60 countries. But the recent recalls and F.D.A. warning letters to several units at Johnson &amp; Johnson raise questions about whether there may be companywide problems, industry analysts said. “No. 1, is there a systemic issue at J.&amp; J.?” said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. “No. 2, is this” hip implant recall “reflective of that systemic issue? And, No. 3, is there more to come?” Mr. Wise added that F.D.A. warnings and J.&amp; J. recalls had come at a time of increased vigilance about product safety by the agency and health care companies. He said that he believed the various problems at J&amp;J were separate and not part of a systemic issue. Dr. Trombetta, the pharmaceutical marketing professor, compared Johnson &amp; Johnson to Toyota, another multinational firm whose reputation has suffered this year during a series of recalls. The recalls may be tarnishing Johnson &amp; Johnson’s apple-pie image, Dr. Trombetta said, but he predicted that the company would eventually recover public trust as Toyota largely had. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson closed at $57.80 on Thursday, down 18 cents.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/24/business/24lens.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Acuvue Contact Lenses Are Recalled in Asia and Europe<date>Published: August 23, 2010</date><text>The eye care unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Monday that it was recalling several million disposable soft contact lenses sold primarily in Japan, but also in five other countries in Asia and 19 counties in Europe.The recall of 1-Day Acuvue TruEye does not include soft disposable lenses sold in the United States or other countries under the same brand name, the company said. Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care made the recall in some countries in Asia and Europe after some consumers in Japan complained that they developed unusual stinging or pain after inserting certain lots of 1-Day Acuvue TruEye lenses, the company said Monday in a statement. A company investigation identified an isolated issue in one part of the lens rinsing process on a particular manufacturing line, the statement said. The action takes place amid a Food and Drug Administration investigation of another Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, for its conduct during several recent recalls of millions of bottles of over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl. McNeil is also the subject of a Congressional investigation into the recalls by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Last year, for example, McNeil announced recalls of certain children’s Tylenol products in September, a limited recall of certain adult Tylenol caplets for arthritis in November and an expanded Tylenol arthritis recall in December. This year, McNeil has recalled at least 150 million bottles for adults and children — in January, March, April, June and July. McNeil has temporarily closed a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa., which made liquid children’s and infants’ medicines involved in a recall in April, while it upgrades equipment and reorganizes quality control there. In an interview last week with The Wall Street Journal, William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson, described the McNeil unit as an “outlier” in the company and said the quality control problems that led to the recalls were localized to that unit. But the new contact lens recall at a separate eye care division broadens the scope of the company’s problems. Bill Price, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said that the McNeil and Vision Care recalls were unrelated. A spokesman for the vision care unit said the contact lens recall was relatively small. The vision care unit recalled about 100,000 boxes of the product containing 30 to 90 lenses each, said Gary Esterow, a company spokesman. That represents less than 1 percent of all the lenses made by the unit, he said. J.&amp;J. Vision Care had worldwide sales of about $2.5 billion last year, according to a company earnings statement. The recall involves one-day disposable lenses sold mainly in Japan, as well as in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, he said. The 1-Day Acuvue TruEye lenses involved in the recall are made with a pliable silicon hydrogel material called narafilcon A, Mr. Esterow said. This year, Johnson &amp; Johnson introduced a similar Acuvue product in the United States under the same brand name. But the product sold here is made with a different material, narafilcon B, he said, and is not affected by the recall.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9900E2D61E31F931A1575BC0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">PULSE; For Fashion Boo-Boos<date>Published: August 22, 2010</date><text>FROM diapers to shapewear, Cynthia Rowley has been busy jazzing up one unseemly necessity after another.

Weldon, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s chief executive. The company said it also planned to appoint chief quality officers for each of its three major divisions. Mr. Weldon first gave details of the plan in an interview Wednesday with The Wall Street Journal. The quality control reorganization comes after a number of recent recalls of Tylenol, Motrin and other products by McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson. The recalls have led to the temporary shutting of one manufacturing plant. McNeil’s conduct surrounding the recalls is the subject of inquiry by both the House Committee on Oversight and Investigations and by the Food and Drug Administration’s office of criminal investigations. In the last two years, F.D.A. inspectors have found significant violations of manufacturing standards at two McNeil plants, according to the agency’s Web site. In January, McNeil recalled millions of bottles of adult Tylenol, Motrin and other products made at a company plant in Puerto Rico after consumers complained about a moldy or musty odor in the products. The company said a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets had leached into the products, causing the moldy smell. In April, McNeil recalled an estimated 136 million bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other products made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. The company recalled the products because they might have contained too much of the active drug ingredient or foreign particles, the F.D.A. said. In July, McNeil said it was starting a program to improve manufacturing and quality and it has temporarily closed the Fort Washington plant. The recalls and plant shutdown cut Johnson &amp; Johnson’s sales by $200 million and its earnings by 5 cents a share in the second quarter, Dominic J. Caruso, the company’s chief financial officer said during a recent conference call. He estimated that annual sales would decline by $600 million because of the plant closing.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/business/26adco.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Group Hopes to Add Punch to Influence Public Opinion<date>Published: July 25, 2010</date><text>LOS ANGELESTHE Harmony Institute wants to change your mind — at the movies. In the last few weeks, a little-noticed nonprofit with big ideas about the persuasive power of movies and television shows quietly began an initiative aimed at getting filmmakers and others to use the insights and techniques of behavioral psychology in delivering social and political messages through their work. Harmony, based in New York, was organized by John S. Johnson III, a co-founder of the Buzzfeed.com viral media site and a descendant of a Johnson &amp; Johnson founder, Robert Wood Johnson, and by Adam Wolfensohn, an investment banker who was a producer of the climate change documentary “Everything’s Cool.” It was a favorite at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. In an interview, Mr. Johnson said the institute was born from his own perception that environmental and social messages in films and television shows were often ineffective. “It felt like a lot of preaching to the choir,” said Mr. Johnson, who spoke of the limited ability of a blatant message movie like “An Inconvenient Truth” actually to change minds. “It’s not reaching people, it’s not expanding the choir.” By contrast, he said, a popular adventure like “The Day After Tomorrow,” which wrapped its global warming message in a rip-roaring story, appeared to alter attitudes among young and undereducated audiences who would never see a preachy documentary. Mr. Johnson made a study of what his group calls “the science of influence,” with the help of friends like Kenneth Broad, a director of Columbia’s Center for Research on Environmental Decisions, and Eric Johnson, a professor of business and marketing at Columbia, both of whom are now on the institute’s advisory committee. Michael Douglas, the actor, who according to a spokesman is related, through his mother, to Mr. Johnson’s family, became involved after a conversation in which Mr. Johnson argued that movies like “The China Syndrome,” about the dangers of nuclear power, pointed the way.  So far, the group has not done much, except to organize its own thinking and to issue a recent report, with backing from the Pacific Foundation and the advocacy group Free Press, called “FTW! Net Neutrality for the Win: How to Use Entertainment and the Science of Influence to Save Your Internet.” The report suggests, mundanely enough, that people can be persuaded to support net neutrality if they see story lines about children who fall behind in school because they lack access to the Web, or about small-business owners who “risk financial ruin” when they cannot reach customers because a site is blocked or slowed down. Mr. Johnson said the institute focused first on net neutrality mostly because it had interested backers in Free Press and the Pacific Foundation, though he also finds the issue to be both important and little understood. But the report also promises a sophisticated attempt to change attitudes on a range of issues — the report cites films and shows that have affected the perception of homosexuality (“Will &amp; Grace”), legislation on violence against women (“The North Country”), and literacy in the third world (through telenovelas like “Ven Conmigo”) — by using applied behavioral science. “When audiences enter a fictional world they take a mental journey that allows them to suspend the confines of their traditional beliefs,” the report says. Mr. Johnson rejected the notion that a deliberate attempt to program opinion might be unduly manipulative. “Top Gun,” he said of Tom Cruise’s classic pro-military fly-boy adventure, “is a fantastically persuasive movie.” Martin Kaplan, the director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of entertainment and society at the University of Southern California, agreed that attempts to massage the audience are commonplace. “All storytellers are manipulators,” Mr. Kaplan said by e-mail last week. He said that the “designated driver” concept was helped by mentions in movies and television shows, while Viacom supported a companywide AIDS awareness campaign on its various networks. The marketplace, Mr. Kaplan said, generally keeps entertainment from becoming too didactic. “Audiences can smell propaganda a mile away,” he wrote. Even so, the institute’s alignment with positions that would mostly be categorized as progressive might confirm the view of Hollywood as consistently leaning left. The institute’s advisory committee also includes some heavy-hitters from the entertainment and media worlds, including Mr. Douglas, Ridley Scott, Ted Hope and Arianna Huffington. Mr. Hope, an independent producer whose recent credits include “Adventureland” and “Towelhead,” said the institute’s work would be useful to filmmakers whose work is more issues-oriented than his. “I am not so much in the message business as the entertainment business,” he said in an e-mail message.  In television, networks typically have given writers and producers considerable discretion over the ideas and attitudes embedded within shows, as long as a message does not blatantly offend or unduly disrupt a story line. Still, Mr. Johnson’s focus on net neutrality may pose a challenge for creative types who are working for companies that have significant interests in the Internet world. Comcast, which is poised to take control of NBC Universal, for instance, has pushed for a cautious approach to regulations that might restrict its management of broadband systems, arguing that the Internet has been reasonably open so far and that excessive regulation might strangle growth. So a story about the plight of “grassroots campaigners” who find their political struggles curtailed by a service provider’s censorship, as suggested by Harmony, might have a tough climb. “We’re breaking ground here,” said Mr. Johnson, who acknowledged that much had yet to be figured out. But, he insisted, persuasion is inseparable from entertainment — and the only real question is whether it works. “If it is conscious and if it has rigor, it’s much more effective,” he said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02E5DA1E3EF932A15754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Profit Up, but Forecast Is Cut<date>Published: July 21, 2010</date><text>The health care company Johnson &amp; Johnson said Tuesday that its second-quarter revenue was flat, primarily because of recalls of nonprescription medicines. But the company still reported a 7.5 percent increase in net income. In a rare move, Johnson &amp; Johnson reduced its 2010 profit forecast by 15 cents a share. The company cited the recalls of tens of millions of bottles of Tylenol and other well-known brands, long-term closure of the suburban Philadelphia factory that made them and unfavorable currency exchange rates. Net income was $3.45 billion, or $1.23 a share, up from $3.21 billion, or $1.15 a share, a year earlier. But the improvement was almost entirely the result of a lower tax bill for the quarter. Excluding a one-time gain of $67 million from settling litigation, earnings would have been $3.38 billion, or $1.21 a share. On that basis, the earnings matched the forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But the analysts had expected revenue of $15.66 billion, $300 million more than the company reported. The company said it expected earnings for the year of $4.65 to $4.75 a share, down from its April forecast of $4.80 to $4.90. The numbers exclude any one-time charges or gains. Its shares fell $1.11, to $58.46.</text></article></page><page index="4"><article index="1" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A01E0D6143AF930A25754C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Will Buy a Stroke-Treatment Company for $480 Million<date>Published: July 13, 2010</date><text>The market for medical devices used in the treatment of strokes is heating up. Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Monday that it would buy the Micrus Endovascular Corporation, which makes medical devices, for about $480 million in cash, or $23.40 a share. Micrus Endovascular, based in San Jose, Calif., makes catheters and other minimally invasive devices used to treat stroke-related problems in the brain, like arterial thickening or aneurysms. Last year, Johnson &amp; Johnson strengthened its position in the stroke technology market by creating a business unit, Codman Neurovascular, a subsidiary of its neuroscience division, Codman &amp; Shurtleff. Micrus will join the Codman neurosciences group, Johnson &amp; Johnson said in a statement. This is the second announcement of a significant merger in the neurovascular market recently. Also on Monday, Covidien, a maker of medical devices and supplies, said it had completed its acquisition of ev3, a specialty maker of endovascular devices like stents and guide wires, for $2.6 billion. In a health care climate in which hospitals are increasingly buying bundles of devices and supplies from single companies, many concerns are feeling pressed to increase their specialty device acquisitions, analysts said. Johnson &amp; Johnson may have moved to buy Micrus because it felt pressure to keep up with Covidien's merger announcement, Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann, wrote in a note to investors on Monday. He added that other big device companies, like Medtronic or Abbott, might now start seeking a specialty neurovascular asset. Johnson &amp; Johnson might have also decided to announce its planned acquisition of a fast-growing technology maker ahead of a conference call with investors next week, when it is expected to deliver a conservative earnings forecast, Mr. Wise wrote. The price of a Johnson &amp; Johnson share has declined over the last few months because of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and because of a series of recent recalls of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines by the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Mr. Wise wrote. Shares of Johnson and Johnson fell 33 cents, to $60.21, and shares of Micrus rose $1, to $23.19.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/business/09drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Recall of Pills Fails to Give Number of Bottles<date>Published: July 8, 2010</date><text>When Procter &amp; Gamble announced a recent recall of some Scope mouthwash with defective child-resistant caps, it disclosed the extent of the recall — 35,000 bottles — in a government news release.But a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson that announced an expanded recall of Tylenol and other over-the-counter drugs on Thursday declined to say how many bottles of pills were involved. “We have never given that out for any of the recalls,” Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, said on Thursday. The expanded McNeil recall announced Thursday involves 21 lots of certain kinds of Tylenol, Motrin and Benadryl made at McNeil’s plant in Puerto Rico. The number of bottles in a product lot can vary widely. The company has instituted a series of recalls since last year. The lack of specific figures released by McNeil contrasts sharply with the typical availability of public information related to other consumer product recalls. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which oversees recalls of products like defective cribs and window blinds, negotiates with companies to make sure that they detail the number of recalled products in releases to the public, said Scott Wolfson, the director of public affairs at the commission. Providing recall statistics is important, he said, because consumers often take action depending on the size of a recall. A larger recall that garners wide news coverage, he said, often prompts people to scour their homes for defective or unsafe products so they can throw them out or return them for a refund. “We feel it is critically important for recalling companies to include the number of affected units so it gives the consumer a sense of scope, of importance,” Mr. Wolfson said. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees recalls of medicines, said the agency made public the information it had on the volume of a recall. But often the agency does not “have the exact number at the time of the release and sometimes it takes a while to get the actual number from the company,” Elaine Bobo, an agency spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message on Thursday. Since last year, McNeil has recalled millions of bottles of Tylenol arthritis caplets, Motrin and other products made at a plant in Puerto Rico, according to information posted on the Web site of the F.D.A. The products may be contaminated with a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets, causing a moldy odor in the bottles. Earlier this year, McNeil recalled an estimated 136 million bottles of children’s liquid Tylenol and other pediatric products because they might have contained a higher-than-labeled dose of the active drug ingredient, metal particles or inactive ingredients that failed quality tests, the agency said. The F.D.A. made the volume of the children’s product recall public during a Congressional hearing in May. McNeil has a Web site, mcneilproductrecall.com, with information about the recall and how to obtain a refund.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/27/business/27sellars.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Richard Sellars, Who Led Johnson &amp; Johnson, Dies at 94<date>Published: June 26, 2010</date><text>Richard B. Sellars, a former chairman and chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson who resisted abandoning the company’s hometown in New Jersey and then helped revitalize its downtown, died on Friday at his home in Osterville, Mass. He was 94.His death was confirmed by his son, Richard Jr. Joining the company in 1939 as a junior salesman for its new Ortho Pharmaceutical division, Mr. Sellars worked for Johnson &amp; Johnson for 40 years. He became the company’s chairman and chief executive in 1973, the second person outside of the founding Johnson family to head the health care conglomerate. Mr. Sellars is credited with persuading Johnson &amp; Johnson to keep its headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., despite the city’s decline. Although the company was founded in the city, in 1886, some executives discussed relocating, but Mr. Sellars was instrumental in convincing the board to stay. “It was apparent even then that we had a commitment to New Brunswick that we couldn’t run away from,” Mr. Sellars said in a 1984 interview. “The survival of our country depends on the survival of its cities, so we’d all better get involved in cleaning them up.” Mr. Sellars became active in developing plans to revitalize the city’s downtown. He chaired the New Brunswick Development Corporation, a tax-exempt organization, and helped to recruit the architecture firm of I. M. Pei to redesign the business district. The same firm would later design the Johnson &amp; Johnson corporate headquarters building. “He was so committed to the needs of the city,” said John Heldrich, a former executive at Johnson &amp; Johnson who worked with Mr. Sellars. Mr. Sellars was also active in state and national politics, serving as a treasurer of the Republican National Committee. Richard Beverland Sellars was born on Sept. 9, 1915, one of four children, and raised in Worcester, Mass. He attended American International College and Maryville College. At 23, he joined the sales force of Ortho Pharmaceutical, where he became a vice president in 1948. A year later, he joined Ethicon, the company’s suture business. He was named president of Johnson &amp; Johnson International in 1970. After stepping down as chairman and chief executive in 1976, Mr. Sellars was chairman of the company’s finance committee until he retired in 1979. In 1981, he was named a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the health care foundation created by Robert Wood Johnson II, the last member of the family to run the company. He was a trustee for 15 years. Beside his son Richard, of Arnold, Md., Mr. Sellars is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Doris Sophia Johnson (no relation to the company’s founders); another son, Peter, of Sandwich, Mass.; two daughters, Christine S. Cotton of Osterville, and Carolyn M. Sellars of Williamsport, Pa.; nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/health/16drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">J.&amp;J. Unit Recalls Additional Over-the-Counter Drugs<date>Published: June 15, 2010</date><text>The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit whose recall of liquid children’s Tylenol and other pediatric medicines is under Congressional investigation said on Tuesday evening that it was recalling additional over-the-counter drugs. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, said that it was recalling four lots of certain Benadryl allergy tablets and one lot of Extra Strength Tylenol gel pills. McNeil did not respond to a reporter’s query about how many bottles those lots amounted to. The company said in a statement that “the products were inadvertently omitted” from an earlier recall — one preceding the children’s drug recall — involving medicines made at a company plant in Puerto Rico. Since last November, McNeil has recalled about 11.7 million bottles of various Motrin products and about 6.3 million bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplets made at that Puerto Rico plant, according to the F.D.A.’s Web site. The company began the recall after receiving consumer complaints about a moldy odor emanating from some products. The smell was caused by contamination from a chemical byproduct of a substance used to treat wooden transport pallets, the company said. Although risk of serious medical problems was remote, the company said, people should stop using the products. Refund requests can be made using a company Web site, mcneilproductrecall.com, or toll-free number: 888-222-6036. McNeil is already under scrutiny by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform over a recall in April of an estimated 136 million bottles of liquid pediatric Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec. “Today’s announcement is indication that we have more to look at when it comes to this company,” Representative Edolphus Towns, a New York Democrat who is the chairman of the committee, wrote on Tuesday in an e-mail message in response to a reporter’s query.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/12/business/12drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">More Disputes Over Handling of Drug Recall<date>Published: June 11, 2010</date><text>The feud between Johnson &amp; Johnson and Congressional investigators over the company’s recent recalls of over-the-counter medicines deepened on Friday as they disputed the meaning of company documents turned over to a House committee.The new material sheds light on an incident in 2009 in which McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, hired private companies to buy certain defective Motrin products from stores. McNeil has said it did nothing wrong in removing the Motrin and that the medicine posed no safety risk. But investigators consider the documents significant because they deepen concerns about whether McNeil, responsible for a recall in April of an estimated 136 million bottles of pediatric medicines, was aboveboard in its handling of various quality-control problems. Representative Edolphus Towns, a New York Democrat who is the chairman of the committee conducting the investigation, has suggested that the documents — which include e-mail messages, formal correspondence and instructions to contractors — raise the prospect that McNeil conducted a surreptitious Motrin recall in 2009 without the full knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration. Mr. Towns, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has repeatedly referred to the Motrin episode as a “phantom recall.” One document on McNeil letterhead instructs contractors involved in the Motrin buyback program not to alert stores about their activities. “Do not communicate to store personnel any information about this product,” the document says. A separate McNeil instruction said, “Just purchase all available product.” Mr. Towns said that document, given to the committee by McNeil this week, indicated to him that McNeil had directed surreptitious activity by its contractors. A McNeil spokeswoman, Bonnie Jacobs, disagreed. “Given that there was no safety risk, the objective was to remove the affected product from a unique distribution channel, mainly convenience stores and gas stations, with as little disruption and consumer confusion as possible,” Ms. Jacobs said on Friday. Earlier this week, Ms. Jacobs said that the company had nothing to do with a separate communication from a subcontractor hired to retrieve Motrin from stores. In that document, also provided to the committee, the subcontractor instructed its employees how to behave — “Simply ‘act’ like a regular customer while making these purchases. There must be no mention of this being a recall of the product!” — when buying back the Motrin for McNeil. On the issue of informing the F.D.A. about its activities, Ms. Jacobs said McNeil had contacted the agency after it discovered that two lots of Motrin did not dissolve properly. The company informed the agency that it planned to retrieve the products from stores and kept the agency apprised of its progress, she said. An e-mail message from an F.D.A. official, obtained by The New York Times on Friday, suggests the agency was frustrated with McNeil’s approach. “It seems that your company is doing a recall even though you are calling it a ‘retrieval,’ ” Neisa M. Alonso, an investigator and recall coordinator with the F.D.A. in San Juan, P.R., wrote in a message date July 16, 2009, to an executive at McNeil. “The agency’s position is that your company should do a voluntary recall of the product since it appears to be that you are already doing a recall of the product.” McNeil later instituted a formal recall of the defective Motrin.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/health/11drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Drug Maker Seen as Uncooperative on Inquiry<date>Published: June 10, 2010</date><text>A Congressional investigation into a recent recall of children’s Tylenol and other pediatric medicines has been stymied by the manufacturer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, investigators say, raising the prospect that new measures — like issuing of subpoenas to compel cooperation — could be invoked.The unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson that makes the over-the-counter drugs, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, is already under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration for a pattern of violations in manufacturing and quality control practices that have led to a number of recent recalls. The agency said last month that it was considering criminal penalties or other actions against McNeil. Now Representative Edolphus Towns, a New York Democrat who is the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Johnson &amp; Johnson had used delaying tactics in its dealings with the committee and in some instances had provided misinformation — accusations the company denies. Such conduct has cast Johnson &amp; Johnson in an unusually negative light, Mr. Towns said, and might compel the committee to take more aggressive action as it looks into drug quality and safety issues raised by the recall. Other large corporations investigated recently by the committee, including Bank of America and the insurance giant A.I.G., were more forthcoming, Mr. Towns said. “But we are not getting the kind of information and cooperation from Johnson that I would like,” Mr. Towns said in a telephone interview. A spokeswoman for McNeil offered a starkly different view of the company’s dealings with the committee. The spokeswoman, Bonnie Jacobs, said Thursday that the company had provided the committee with about 20,000 pages of documents, made its executives available for interviews and answered queries in a timely manner. “We have been very cooperative with the committee,” Ms. Jacobs said. Mr. Towns, however, said he was particularly troubled by apparent discrepancies in Johnson &amp; Johnson’s accounts of its activities. The company, he said, told members of his staff that the recall involved six million bottles of children’s medicines even as it informed the F.D.A. that the recall involved more than 136 million bottles. “It means that we didn’t get a straight story from Johnson &amp; Johnson,” Mr. Towns said. “We need to know where the spin is and where the truth begins.” But Ms. Jacobs said there was a simple explanation: the numbers represented answers to two different questions from government officials. There were about six million bottles of the products in stores at the time of the recall, she said, and an estimated 136 million bottles in the hands of consumers. The House committee opened its investigation in early May shortly after McNeil announced a voluntary recall of liquid pediatric Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec. The products, made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa., may have included metal particles, or too much of the active drug ingredient, or inactive ingredients that did not meet testing standards, the F.D.A. said. McNeil said that it had rejected defective products before they reached stores and had not received reports of health problems caused by issues related to the recall. But consumers should stop using the products, the company said, even though the possibility of serious medical harm was remote. On May 27, the committee held a public hearing, with testimony from an F.D.A. official and an executive from Johnson &amp; Johnson, intended to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the large recall. But, after the hearing raised new questions for legislators, the committee widened its investigation. Mr. Towns said that the House committee was now examining a new recall of children’s medicines that were made for another company by the McNeil plant involved in the Tylenol recall. The committee has also opened an investigation into an incident last year in which McNeil hired private contractors to purchase certain defective Motrin products from stores, an event which Mr. Towns has described as a “phantom recall.” After F.D.A. officials inquired about the contractors’ activities, McNeil instituted an official recall. “It was troubling to us,” Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the agency’s principal deputy commissioner said during the Congressional hearing. “When F.D.A. found out about this, we insisted that an actual recall occur.” Ms. Jacobs of McNeil said that the company had contacted the F.D.A. after it discovered that two lots of Motrin did not dissolve properly. The company, she said, informed the agency that it planned to remove the products from stores and regularly gave the agency progress reports. The escalating Congressional investigation, along with Mr. Towns’s complaints about stalling and discrepancies from Johnson &amp; Johnson, has the potential to fuel the F.D.A.’s own inquiry. An agency official said during the hearing that the F.D.A. had referred the McNeil case to its office of criminal investigation, the agency’s law enforcement arm, which works with the Justice Department to prosecute companies accused of violating the laws governing drug manufacturing and marketing. On Thursday, an F.D.A. spokeswoman said that the agency did not comment once it had referred a case for criminal investigation. In a statement in late May on a company blog, McNeil said that it was undertaking comprehensive improvements in manufacturing and quality control systems. But Mr. Towns said he found some recent actions by company managers troubling. In particular, he faulted a company executive for implying during her sworn testimony that the “phantom recall” incident — in which contractors bought defective Motrin products off store shelves — was a limited and transparent transaction. Documents later provided by the company, he said, suggested more covert and larger-scale activity. One purchase order among the evidence indicated that McNeil had hired a contractor in 2009 to visit 5,000 stores, or about 100 stores per state, for a fee of $487,500. A document from another contractor, titled “Motrin Purchase Project (June 12, 2009),” instructed employees buying Motrin to “simply ‘act’ like a regular customer” and make “no mention of this being a recall.” Mr. Towns said he was “troubled by the information that was given to us at the hearing versus what we are actually seeing now in the documents.” But Ms. Jacobs of McNeil said that the documents fully supported the executive’s testimony. The kind of Motrin was a small-volume product for McNeil, she said, and remained on sale mainly at convenience stores and gas stations. The “Motrin Purchase Project” document was created without McNeil’s knowledge by a subcontractor, she said. But Mr. Towns cited further issues. During an interview in late May, Peter Luther, the president of McNeil, told House investigators that the Fort Washington plant involved in the Tylenol recall did not make products for other companies, Mr. Towns said. Four days later, Blacksmith Brands, which markets PediaCare children’s medicines, announced its own voluntary recall “as a precautionary step” — because certain of its cough and cold products had been made at the same McNeil plant. Ms. Jacobs said that McNeil had sold the PediaCare brand to Blacksmith last fall. The McNeil plant, she said, was making the PediaCare products on a temporary basis and had not fully transferred manufacturing to Blacksmith. But Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat from Washington, who sits on the House oversight committee, said the company’s conduct seemed to her to demonstrate a continuing lack of transparency. “The only way for Johnson &amp; Johnson to reclaim any measure of credibility,” Ms. Norton said, “is to let it all out now.”</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/28/business/28drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">F.D.A. Weighs Penalties in Drug Recall<date>Published: May 27, 2010</date><text>The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit that recalled millions of bottles of liquid children’s Tylenol and other pediatric medicines last month may face criminal penalties, product seizures or other sanctions, an official from the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.The agency is considering further actions against McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, after a pattern of violations in manufacturing and quality control practices led to a number of recent recalls, Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner, said at a Congressional hearing on Thursday. On April 30, McNeil voluntarily recalled more than 136 million bottles of liquid pediatric Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec because they may have contained too much of the active ingredient of the drug, metal specks or inactive ingredients that failed testing requirements, the agency said. But McNeil’s problems go beyond those related to last month’s recall, including other forms of contamination, dating back two years. During a session in which some committee members questioned McNeil’s integrity, Dr. Sharfstein noted lengthy delays by the company in reporting problems to the agency. And in one case, in 2008, Dr. Sharfstein said, McNeil hired a contractor to quietly remove packages of Motrin from retailers for suspected quality problems — which he suggested was essentially an unannounced recall that was not reported to the F.D.A. “This is something troubling to the agency,” he said. “We think it reflected poorly on the company.” He said the F.D.A. was “considering additional enforcement actions against the company for its pattern of noncompliance, which may include seizures, injunction or criminal penalties.” Another agency official, Deborah M. Autor, the director of the F.D.A. Office of Compliance at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told the panel that officials had referred the McNeil case to the office of criminal investigation, the agency’s law enforcement arm, which works with the Justice Department to prosecute companies accused of violating the laws governing drug manufacturing and marketing. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform called Thursday’s hearing to examine the circumstances surrounding last month’s recall and whether the F.D.A. had responded adequately. But the evidence presented indicated long-running problems. “I have become deeply concerned about your company,” Representative Edolphus Towns, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the committee, told the Johnson &amp; Johnson executive who testified. “It paints a picture of a company that is deceptive, dishonest and willing to put the health of children at risk.” That executive, Colleen A. Goggins, the worldwide chairwoman of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s consumer group, acknowledged lapses by the McNeil unit. “The quality and process issues that we found at McNeil, those which led to the recall and others, are unacceptable,” she said. But she also defended the company’s integrity. “There was never any intent to deceive or hide anything,” Ms. Goggins said. The products in the latest recall were made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. Ms. Goggins said that the risk of serious medical problems from the recalled products was remote and that there were no reports that the products had caused serious medical harm. Earlier this week, an F.D.A. spokeswoman said that the agency had received reports of health problems associated with the recalled products, including several deaths. But she said the agency had not found evidence that the products had caused the reported health issues. Ms. Goggins said McNeil had identified and rejected the children’s medicines that contained metal particles or higher-than-normal doses before they reached the marketplace. As part of an overhaul of its manufacturing and quality control processes, McNeil has replaced several senior executives and is making systemwide improvements, Ms. Goggins said. McNeil posted a statement on a company Web site this week saying that it was making improvements in every part of its manufacturing and quality control operations, including organizational changes, employee training and new procedures for investigating product problems. But Mr. Towns, the committee chairman, said McNeil’s corporate conduct surrounding the recalls dating back several years raised integrity questions. For example, Dr. Sharfstein said, in 2008, McNeil notified the F.D.A. that it had hired an outside contractor to buy samples of Motrin from retailers to determine whether problems with the drug’s ability to dissolve warranted a recall. In 2009, however, the agency received information that the contractor had been buying up inventories of the product in what seemed to be an unannounced recall, he said. McNeil later initiated a formal recall of the products after the agency questioned the company about the contractor’s conduct, he said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D8123AF93BA15756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">F.D.A.

Unit<date>Published: May 28, 2010</date><text>The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit that recalled millions of bottles of liquid children's Tylenol and other pediatric medicines last month may face criminal penalties, product seizures or other sanctions, an official from the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday. The agency is considering further actions against McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, after a pattern of violations in manufacturing and quality control practices led to a number of recent recalls, Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the F.D.A.'s principal deputy commissioner, said at a Congressional hearing on Thursday. On April 30, McNeil voluntarily recalled more than 136 million bottles of liquid pediatric Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec because they may have contained too much of the active ingredient of the drug, metal specks or inactive ingredients that failed testing requirements, the agency said. But McNeil's problems go beyond those related to last month's recall, including other forms of contamination, dating back two years. During a session in which some committee members questioned McNeil's integrity, Dr. Sharfstein noted lengthy delays by the company in reporting problems to the agency. And in one case, in 2008, Dr. Sharfstein said, McNeil hired a contractor to quietly remove packages of Motrin from retailers for suspected quality problems -- which he suggested was essentially an unannounced recall that was not reported to the F.D.A. ''This is something troubling to the agency,'' he said. ''We think it reflected poorly on the company.'' He said the F.D.A. was ''considering additional enforcement actions against the company for its pattern of noncompliance, which may include seizures, injunction or criminal penalties.'' Another agency official, Deborah M. Autor, the director of the F.D.A. Office of Compliance at the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, told the panel that officials had referred the McNeil case to the office of criminal investigation, the agency's law enforcement arm, which works with the Justice Department to prosecute companies accused of violating the laws governing drug manufacturing and marketing. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform called Thursday's hearing to examine the circumstances surrounding last month's recall and whether the F.D.A. had responded adequately. But the evidence presented indicated long-running problems. ''I have become deeply concerned about your company,'' Representative Edolphus Towns, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the committee, told the Johnson &amp; Johnson executive who testified. ''It paints a picture of a company that is deceptive, dishonest and that has risked the health of many of our citizens.'' That executive, Colleen A. Goggins, the worldwide chairwoman of Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer group, acknowledged lapses by the McNeil unit. ''The quality and process issues that we found at McNeil, those which led to the recall and others, are unacceptable,'' she said. But she also defended the company's integrity. ''There was never any intent to deceive or hide anything,'' Ms. Goggins said. The products in the latest recall were made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. Ms. Goggins said that the risk of serious medical problems from the recalled products was remote and that there were no reports that the products had caused serious medical harm. Earlier this week, an F.D.A. spokeswoman said that the agency had received reports of health problems associated with the recalled products, including several deaths. But she said the agency had not found evidence that the products had caused the reported health issues. Ms. Goggins said McNeil had identified and rejected the children's medicines that contained metal particles or higher-than-normal doses before they reached the marketplace. As part of an overhaul of its manufacturing and quality control processes, McNeil has replaced several senior executives and is making systemwide improvements, Ms. Goggins said. McNeil posted a statement on a company Web site this week saying that it was making improvements in every part of its manufacturing and quality control operations, including organizational changes, employee training and new procedures for investigating product problems. But Mr. Towns, the committee chairman, said McNeil's corporate conduct surrounding the recalls dating back several years raised integrity questions.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/27/business/27tylenol.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Questions for Makers on Defects in Drugs<date>Published: May 26, 2010</date><text>For consumers who turned to drugstore house brands after the recall last month of liquid children’s Tylenol and other medicines made by a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, there is yet more unsettling news.The recall included more than 40 varieties of liquid pediatric Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec that may have contained metal particles, too much of the active drug ingredient or inactive ingredients that did not meet testing requirements. At the time, the Food and Drug Administration recommended that consumers look for generic alternatives to these brand-name over-the-counter drugs. But now, Perrigo, a company based in Michigan that supplies drugstore equivalents of those children’s medicines to pharmacy chains like CVS and Walgreens, has received a warning letter from the F.D.A. about significant manufacturing violations of its own — including ibuprofen tablets contaminated with metal shavings. Although the problems cited in the warning letter did not mention children’s products, the deficiencies at both Johnson &amp; Johnson and Perrigo raise questions about why some manufacturing plants have shipped defective medicines. “Why are these issues not being detected?” said David J. Kroll, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at North Carolina Central University in Durham. “What is the F.D.A. planning to do about premarket quality control?” The problems at Perrigo seem certain to focus more attention on a Congressional hearing scheduled for Thursday about the circumstances surrounding the Johnson &amp; Johnson recall. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which earlier this month announced an investigation into the recall, has invited officials of Johnson &amp; Johnson and the F.D.A. to testify at the hearing. The House committee is trying to determine the chronology and the cause of the manufacturing issues at Johnson &amp; Johnson and whether federal regulators responded adequately. “We feel that it’s so important, when you have an agency that has jurisdiction, that they are on top of situations like this,” Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the committee, said Tuesday. “Were they aware of what was going on and at what point did they know?” Mr. Towns said he also intended to ask executives if Johnson &amp; Johnson had reduced its quality control staff at its McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which makes and sells the products at issue, before the recall of products manufactured at a McNeil plant in Fort Washington, Pa. “I also want to find out if there was any shaving or cutting of staff that led to these problems,” Mr. Towns said. The McNeil unit has instituted a multipronged plan to address the quality control issues that precipitated the recall on April 30, according to a statement posted on a company blog on Tuesday. McNeil is improving “processes and employee training in every part of the manufacturing and quality operations,” as well as adding new procedures for quality control investigations, the statement said. McNeil says it has also made organizational changes in management. In response to a query from a reporter on Wednesday, a company spokeswoman declined to elaborate. Arthur J. Shannon, a spokesman for Perrigo, the country’s largest maker of store-brand over-the-counter drugs, responded to a reporter’s query by saying the company was working with the F.D.A. to institute corrective actions at its plant. Different plants in the same Allegan, Mich., complex make infants’ and children’s products, he said. There are some similarities in the problems at both companies. In F.D.A. documents, agency officials cited the failure of each company’s quality control unit to ensure manufacturing standards. McNeil has been beset by recent manufacturing issues. Because of quality control problems, the company made a series of recalls of popular over-the-counter medicines — last September, November and December, and in January of this year. Then, in April, F.D.A. inspectors observed manufacturing and quality control problems at McNeil’s Fort Washington plant. According to an F.D.A. inspection report, these included failure to investigate and take corrective action on consumer complaints regarding particle contamination in a drug, unclean equipment at the plant, failure to train employees in good manufacturing practices, and bacterial contamination of a drug ingredient. McNeil has tested some recalled products and to date has found no bacteria, according to Bonnie Jacobs, a McNeil spokeswoman. “To our knowledge, no bacterially contaminated components were used in the manufacture of any of our recently recalled products,” Ms. Jacobs wrote in an e-mail message. McNeil shut down the plant after the inspection and recalled the liquid children’s products. Even though the possibility of serious medical problems was remote, the company said, people should discontinue using the recalled products. The company has a Web site, mcneilproductrecall.com, with information about the recalled products and how to identify them. Mr. Towns of the House committee said consumers were understandably nervous to learn of problems in products that they trusted. “We’re concerned that it could be a pattern,” he said. The F.D.A., for its part, noted a pattern of quality-control lapses at Perrigo. The warning letter, posted on the F.D.A. Web site Tuesday, cited Perrigo for shipping defective drug products from its Allegan factory. The plant had identified certain ibuprofen tablets as being contaminated with metal shavings but had shipped a portion of the pills anyway, the letter said, before later recalling the entire lot. Mr. Shannon of Perrigo said that the company had recalled the ibuprofen tablets cited in the letter from a retail warehouse before the pills reached retail store shelves. In an earlier incident in 2006, Perrigo recalled about 11 million bottles of acetaminophen because it found metal particles, ranging from a speck to 8-millimeter pieces of wire, in some caplets. The agency’s recent warning does not cite any children’s medications made by Perrigo. The F.D.A. stands by its recommendation that consumers look for generic alternatives to the recalled McNeil children’s products, an agency spokeswoman said Wednesday. But industry analysts said the recent quality problems at both companies raised concerns about why certain plants in the United States had not adhered to manufacturing standards. “In a country where we are concerned about drugs being manufactured abroad, to find out that we have this lack of control at an American facility raises all sorts of questions,” said Mr. Kroll, the professor of pharmaceutical sciences. “Is it possible that we could see all kinds of drug manufacturing quality issues here?”</text></article><article index="10" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9903E6DA1730F934A35756C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">House Panel Is Investigating J.&amp;J. Recalls<date>Published: May 7, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Lawmakers requested information on Thursday from regulators about Johnson &amp; Johnson's recall of Children's Tylenol and other over-the-counter pediatric medicines, saying the company's repeated recalls ''point to a major problem'' with production. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has opened an investigation after Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled 40 widely used children's pain and allergy medications, saying some might have a higher concentration of their active ingredients, while others might be contaminated. In an F.D.A. report issued Tuesday, inspectors said they had found thick dust, grime and contaminated ingredients at the plant that produces Children's Tylenol and dozens of other products recalled last week. Johnson &amp; Johnson has had four recalls of over-the-counter medicines in the last year. ''Taken together, these recalls point to a major problem in the production of McNeil products,'' the committee chairman, Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, and the panel's ranking Republican, Darrell E. Issa of California, said in a statement, referring to the company's consumer health care unit. The McNeil unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson declined to comment.</text></article></page><page index="5"><article index="1" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/business/05tylenol.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Agency Told Tylenol Maker of Many Quality Concerns<date>Published: May 4, 2010</date><text>The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit that voluntarily recalled certain lots of children’s liquid Tylenol and Motrin over the weekend had numerous and wide-ranging quality control problems at the plant that made the products, according to a federal inspection report released Tuesday.That unit, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, failed to adequately investigate and correct various deficiencies in its manufacturing and drugs made at its plant in Fort Washington, Pa., according to the report, posted Tuesday afternoon on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration. “This is yet another example of the need for companies to take full accountability for the quality of their drugs, and the serious consequences that can happen when companies do not do so,” Deborah M. Autor, the director for compliance at the agency’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. The report, which the agency had sent to McNeil last Friday, before the recall, said the company had used raw materials with known bacterial contamination to make certain lots of infants’ and children’s liquid Tylenol. Samples of finished products tested negative for bacteria, however, and the risk to consumers was remote, agency officials said. A McNeil spokeswoman disagreed with the F.D.A.’s account of the bacteria issue. She wrote in an e-mail message that that the company had not used material that had tested positive for bacteria. She said that a supplier had rejected some drums of a material from a master lot after finding bacterial contamination. But the drums sent to McNeil’s plant had tested negative for bacteria. The F.D.A. report also said McNeil had not responded properly to several dozen consumer complaints about foreign particles found in certain medications. McNeil said in a statement Tuesday that the company had temporarily stopped production at the Fort Washington plant. The company will not start manufacturing again until it has taken corrective actions and can assure the quality of products made there, the statement said. The F.D.A. report concerns manufacturing deficiencies observed by federal health investigators during a routine inspection of the plant in April. After receiving the report last Friday morning, McNeil late that evening recalled a wide range of certain lots of liquid infant’s and children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and Zyrtec. Some of these over-the-counter medicines may contain more of the active ingredient than is specified on the product label or tiny metal particles or inactive ingredients that do not meet testing standards, the company said. Although the possibility of health problems was remote, people should stop using the products, the company said. A full list of the products can be found on the company’s Web site mcneilproductrecall.com. Consumers can also call the McNeil recall hot line at 888-222-6036 for more information about a refund or coupon to replace the recalled products. McNeil is not disclosing the overall number of bottles involved in the recall, a company spokesman said. The F.D.A. said Tuesday that the recall involved about 1,500 product lots. This is the fifth recall of McNeil products since last September. In January, for example, McNeil undertook a large-scale recall of certain lots of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl, Rolaids and St. Joseph Aspirin after consumer complaints about moldy smells emanating from certain products. The company said that the odor had been caused by a byproduct of a chemical used to treat wooden transport pallets that had leached into the products at a company plant in Puerto Rico. In February, F.D.A. officials met with managers from McNeil and Johnson &amp; Johnson to express serious concerns about McNeil’s manufacturing operations, the agency said Tuesday. Since that meeting, McNeil has taken steps to improve its manufacturing processes, but F.D.A. officials said they had not yet determined whether the changes were sufficient or whether the agency would take further action against the company. At the time of the January recall, industry analysts described the moldy smell problem at the Puerto Rico plant as a fluke and an isolated incident. But some of the inspectors’ observations about the Fort Washington plant resemble problems the agency cited at the Puerto Rico plant. These include failure to follow certain good manufacturing standards and failure to adequately investigate consumer complaints. McNeil said it was working with the agency to resolve the matter. “The quality issues that the F.D.A. has observed, many of which we had recently identified in our own quality reviews and communicated to the F.D.A., are unacceptable to us, and not indicative of how McNeil Consumer Healthcare intends to operate,” the McNeil statement said.</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/business/03drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Tylenol, Generics and Trust<date>Published: May 2, 2010</date><text>Is a brand-name drug synonymous with quality?That is the question many parents were asking themselves over the weekend after they learned about a wide recall of over-the-counter liquid medicines for children from a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, voluntarily had a recall because some products may have manufacturing deficiencies, the Food and Drug Administration said. It did not act because of adverse health reactions to the products, the company said in a statement. Certain liquid infants’ and children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl may contain too much of the active drug ingredient or tiny metal particles or inactive ingredients that do not meet testing requirements, McNeil said. Although the potential for medical problems is remote, the company said, people should stop using the products. The recall quickly became a flashpoint for some parents on Twitter, Facebook and parenting blogs, not to mention on playgrounds and at birthday parties over the weekend. Some people said they felt frustrated in their efforts to obtain more information from the company. Others said they had lost confidence in the products. This is at least the fifth recall for consumers of McNeil products in less than a year because of quality control issues. “Another recall for baby Tylenol!” Kevin Kowalski, a father in Illinois, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Well, then no more baby Tylenol, back to generic brand.” Johnson &amp; Johnson is considered a model in the consumer products industry for its fast and adept handling of a Tylenol scare in 1982 in which seven people in Chicago died after taking capsules that had been laced with cyanide. But, in that case, the problem was not the company’s fault: an outsider had tampered with the capsules. No one has ever been charged. Now, however, Johnson &amp; Johnson and its McNeil unit may have more difficulty wooing customers back because the latest recalls stem from problems at company plants, industry analysts said. Johnson &amp; Johnson will have to work to counter increasing consumer skepticism about whether they should pay more for name-brand children’s medicines when there are lower-cost drugstore brands available, said Michael Braun, an assistant professor of marketing at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. “They are going to have to go to greater lengths,” Mr. Braun said. “The greater the harm to the reputation, the more expensive it is to fix it.” But some consumers said they found the company’s initial response flat-footed. Over the weekend, some people said they had been unable to obtain clear information about how to receive a refund on mcneilproductrecall.com, a company Web site about the recalled products. Other people complained that they could not get through to customer service representatives at the company’s recall hot line: (888) 222-6036. Still others complained that, when they did reach customer representatives, they were offered replacement coupons, not refunds, for the recalled products. Mark Mandel, a father of a 21-month-old daughter in Chicago, said he felt frustrated because he had thrown out a Tylenol infants’ product during a recall last year. Now, some of the replacement medicines he bought were involved in the new recall. “It makes me question their quality control,” said Mr. Mandel, a microbiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. “It makes me wonder if they have the parents’ best interest and the children’s best interest at heart.” McNeil was working to respond to a higher than usual volume of consumer calls and had assigned additional resources to respond to customers, a company spokesman said Saturday. By Sunday, the company had posted clearer information on the site about how consumers may obtain either a refund or a coupon for recalled products. McNeil has tried to address most consumer questions in the frequently asked questions section of its recall Web site, a company spokesman said Sunday. The company understands that many consumers are either not getting through on the toll-free information line or still have questions that are not answered by the site, he said. “Responding to consumers is extremely important to us,” Marc Boston, a McNeil spokesman, wrote via e-mail. “To improve our response time to consumers, we are continuing to add to these resources including adding additional information” on the Web site and increasing staffing for the hot line. The products involved in the recall were made at a company plant in Fort Washington, Pa. McNeil is not providing information about the total number of bottles of medicine involved, Mr. Boston said. A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said that the recall involved more than 1,000 product lots. In instituting a wide recall, Mr. Braun speculated, McNeil may have been acting out of an abundance of caution. In January, federal health regulators cited the company for not acting quickly enough to recall a wide range of over-the-counter medicines after some consumers complained of moldy smells emanating from the products. In January, McNeil undertook a wide recall of certain kinds of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and St. Joseph Aspirin. But after the cluster of recalls, some consumers said they had lost confidence in brand-name over-the-counter medicines. “It’s very disturbing because you go to the store and buy the name brands thinking you are getting quality goods and then you find this out and you don’t know who to trust now,” Jennifer Perrotta, a mother of two in Massapequa, N.Y., said by phone on Sunday. “You kind of lose confidence in the brand names you have been using for years.” On Saturday, Ms. Perrotta, a speech language pathologist for the North Shore school district, told her friends via Facebook that she had emptied her medicine cabinet of children’s products. She went to her local pharmacy, she said in the interview, and bought drugstore brands to replace the name-brand medicines involved in the recall.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/business/02drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Children’s Tylenol and Other Drugs Recalled<date>Published: May 1, 2010</date><text>A unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson has voluntarily begun a recall of certain children’s over-the-counter liquid medicines because of manufacturing deficiencies, the Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday.The deficiencies may affect the potency, purity or quality of the products, the agency said in a statement. It said it was investigating the plant where the products were made to make sure there were no other problems. Consumers should stop using certain lots of infants’ and children’s Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl products because some of them may contain more of the active drug ingredient than specified, the Johnson &amp; Johnson unit, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said in a statement late Friday. Other products involved in the recall may contain foreign particles or inactive ingredients that may not meet testing requirements, the company said. “The particles may be solidified product ingredients or manufacturing residue such as tiny metal specks,” Marc Boston, a McNeil spokesman, said. McNeil did not undertake the recall because of adverse health reactions to the products, the company said, but it advised consumers to stop using them. Although the potential for serious medical problems is remote, McNeil said, parents and caregivers should not give the products to children. The recall involves all unexpired lots of seven products in 43 different flavors and sizes. These include Tylenol Infants’ Drops, Children’s Tylenol Suspensions, Infants’ Motrin Drops, Children’s Zyrtec liquids in bottles and Children’s Benadryl Allergy liquids. McNeil has posted a full list of the recalled product lots on a dedicated Web site: mcneilproductrecall.com. The recall comes after federal health regulators cited McNeil on Friday morning for manufacturing violations found during a routine inspection at a company facility in Fort Washington, Pa., an F.D.A. spokeswoman said. This is the second major recall this year for McNeil. In January, after receiving reports of moldy smells emanating from over-the-counter medicines made at a plant in Puerto Rico, the company recalled several hundred lots of adult and children’s products. The earlier recall involved certain lots of Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin and Tylenol. McNeil has a hotline, (888) 222-6036, available 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday and on weekends from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. But due to high call volumes, a reporter who called the hotline at different times on Saturday was unable to reach a customer service representative. A recorded message directed callers to the company’s Web site and later disconnected. McNeil said it was working to respond to the high call volumes.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E7DE1E3AF933A05757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">Drug Makers To Pay Fine Of $81 Million<date>Published: April 30, 2010</date><text>WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department announced Thursday that two subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson had agreed to pay more than $81 million in a case accusing them of illegally promoting the epilepsy drug Topamax for psychiatric uses. Federal drug regulators approved Topamax for epilepsy and for preventing migraine headaches. It was the second settlement this week involving a pharmaceutical manufacturer accused of misconduct involving promotion of unapproved uses for a drug. On Tuesday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, announced a $520 million settlement with AstraZeneca, resolving allegations of illegal marketing of the company's antipsychotic drug Seroquel. In the case involving Topamax, the government says Johnson &amp; Johnson's Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit will pay more than $75 million. That unit's subsidiary, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, has agreed to plead guilty to one misdemeanor violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and to pay a $6.1 million criminal fine. The government says that Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical promoted Topamax sales for unapproved psychiatric uses under a program called Doctor-for-a-Day. The program hired outside physicians who joined sales representatives in visits to health care providers and to speak at meetings and dinners about prescribing Topamax for unapproved uses. Topamax had been a blockbuster for Johnson &amp; Johnson, with sales topping $2 billion a year by 2006 and peaking at $2.7 billion in 2008. Topamax was approved for preventing migraine headaches about five years ago. The drug got generic competition in March 2009, and sales for the year plunged to $148 million. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen said it had cooperated with the government since its inquiry began in 2003. The settlement resolves two lawsuits brought under the False Claims Act. More than $9 million of it will go to the private citizens who brought the suits.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E4D7173FF932A15757C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson's Quarterly Profit Rises<date>Published: April 21, 2010</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson, the maker of health care products, reported an increase in first-quarter profit as consumer spending continued to recover from recession levels. But the company said Tuesday that the combined impact of the health care overhaul, currency fluctuations and generic competition would suppress profits the rest of the year. It lowered its 2010 profit outlook by 5 cents a share, or about 1 percent. The company reported that first-quarter profit rose 29 percent, to $4.53 billion, or $1.62 a share, mainly on a $900 million gain from settling a patent fight with Boston Scientific and other litigation. Excluding that, net income increased 3 percent, to $3.62 billion, or $1.29 a share, from $3.51 billion, or $1.26 a share. The conglomerate, whose products include drugs, baby shampoo and birth control pills, said sales rose 4 percent, to $15.63 billion. Its medical devices business posted an 8 percent sales increase. The results just beat the forecast of analysts, who on average expected $1.27 a share on sales of $15.6 billion. Dominic J. Caruso, the company's chief financial officer, said changes from the health care overhaul would lower earnings for the year by about 10 cents, or $300 million, because the government will now get back higher rebates for drugs bought through the Medicare and Medicaid. He said the company could absorb that, given that it expected sales of about $63.5 billion this year. International sales rose 14.4 percent, mostly because of the effect of exchange rates. Sales in the United States fell 5 percent, as a major recall of Tylenol and other popular nonprescription medicines hurt sales. In addition, generic competition reduced sales by about 90 percent from a year ago for Topamax for epilepsy and Risperdal for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Shares of the company fell 4 cents Tuesday, to close at $65.99.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03ortho.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Health System Bears Cost of Implants With No Warranties<date>Published: April 2, 2010</date><text>In January, William R. Morris’s artificial hip, just three years old, was failing so badly that it had to be replaced during an extensive procedure that cost about $50,000.The maker of the failed hip has since sent letters to Mr. Morris’s doctor, but none offering to cover replacement expenses for the device, which typically is expected to last 15 years. “They keep asking for the joint so they can look at it,” said Mr. Morris, a 52-year-old oil industry geologist who lives in Anchorage. When a car breaks, a computer fails or a toaster flames out, the manufacturer is often liable under the product warranty. But that is not how the multibillion-dollar orthopedics industry tends to work, according to doctors, industry experts and three of the biggest device makers. The million or so artificial hips and knees implanted each year in the United States, they say, are normally not guaranteed. Instead, the costs of replacing implants that fail early because of design or mechanical problems — devices that sell for as much as $15,000 each — are largely paid by Medicare, insurance companies and patients. Implants can fail for many reasons, but if only a small percentage of them fail prematurely because they are substandard, the costs to taxpayers, policyholders and patients can run into the tens of millions of dollars each year, health care experts estimate. Orthopedic producers may sometimes even profit from the failures because they sell the replacements at full price. “Companies have dumped these costs into the health care system,” said Dr. Lawrence D. Dorr, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles who two years ago took the unusual step of drawing attention to one problematic hip device. “They don’t have any skin in the game.” The costs imposed by poorly performing medical devices were not dealt with in the landmark health care legislation that Congress passed last month. To pay for part of the overhaul, lawmakers mandated an excise tax on implant sales that is intended to bring in $20 billion over the next decade. Patient advocates say an important opportunity was lost. Arthur Levin, the executive director of the Center for Medical Consumers, an advocacy group in New York, said it was appalling that the manufacturers did not provide warranties, given how critical such implants are for patients. By contrast, makers of another widely used and costly category of implants, heart devices like defibrillators, have issued warranties for more than 30 years and have provided free or discounted replacements when devices fail prematurely. “Either they do not have faith in their products, or they are just saying tough luck to patients,” Mr. Levin said, referring to the makers of orthopedic implants. “It borders on unethical business behavior.” Those manufacturers may cover the cost of replacement surgeries in some circumstances, as when they face lawsuits. Generally, however, patients are unaware of the industry’s no-warranty policy. Three of the six major orthopedic implant manufacturers in the United States did not respond to inquiries about whether they offered warranties. Another manufacturer, Zimmer Holdings of Warsaw, Ind., said the longevity of a hip implant depended on many factors beyond the company’s control, including a surgeon’s skill, a patient’s weight and a patient’s adherence to postoperative restrictions on activity. “Because of the multifactorial nature of the survival of an implant in a particular patient, revision surgeries are to be expected,” said Zimmer, using the medical term for a replacement operation. “Therefore, we do not provide free or discounted replacement revision products when one of Zimmer’s implants needs to be revised.” The producer the implant removed from Mr. Morris this year, the DePuy Orthopaedics division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, also said it did not guarantee its devices. “While we don’t have product warranties, we evaluate and address all complaints and issues on a case-by-case basis and take actions based on the specific circumstances,” the company said in a statement. Stan Mendenhall, the editor of Orthopedic Network News, an industry publication, said he was unaware of any major producer of hips and knees that offered a warranty in this country. As the population ages, the use of artificial hips and knees is growing fast, providing a lucrative market for device manufacturers. Sales of artificial hips and knees in this country reached an estimated $6.7 billion last year, and the devices have one of the highest profit margins of any medical product. An artificial joint can cost $3,000 to $15,000. Many implants work well, lasting 15 years or more before they wear out and need replacing. It is impossible to know how many artificial hips and knees fail early because of design or manufacturing problems, because the United States, unlike some other countries, has no database to track such procedures. Also, implant companies and doctors say that such devices primarily fail because of issues unrelated to the product.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/business/18drug.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Maker of Tylenol Explains Actions Taken to Alleviate Musty Smell of Pills<date>Published: March 17, 2010</date><text>The Johnson &amp; Johnson unit that drew criticism and a federal warning letter in January on the grounds of mishandling quality control problems with Tylenol says it has taken steps to prevent similar incidents in the future, according to documents newly posted on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration.The company, the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, “recognizes the seriousness of this situation and has identified this corrective action plan as our top priority,” Peter Luther, McNeil’s president, wrote in a response letter to the agency dated Feb. 5. The agency posted the letter Tuesday. The New York Times filed a document request last month under the Freedom of Information Act. In January, the F.D.A. sent a warning letter to McNeil in which officials said the company had failed to thoroughly investigate consumer complaints of a moldy odor from some bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Relief Caplets. In 2008, a number of consumers reported temporary digestive problems after using the products. But after ruling out bacterial contamination, the company did not initially conduct other testing to determine the root cause of the musty smell, the F.D.A. said. The warning letter also said that McNeil had failed to alert officials about the problem in a timely fashion — waiting more than a year after the first complaints to notify the agency. A related F.D.A. inspection report cited several other quality control issues, including failure to monitor Tylenol Arthritis Caplets for possible impurities or degradation. In January, McNeil widened an existing recall of Tylenol arthritis products to include more than 500 product lots of Tylenol, Benadryl, Rolaids, St. Joseph’s Aspirin, Motrin and Simply Sleep. McNeil identified the cause of the smell in some Tylenol bottles as the breakdown of a preservative, used to treat wooden transport pallets, that had leached into the products at a company plant in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Some industry analysts said that Johnson &amp; Johnson — long considered a leader in consumer product safety — had stumbled by not immediately grasping the scope of the problem, identifying its source and beginning a wider recall. But now McNeil is taking corrective and preventive actions to improve its quality assurance systems, according to Mr. Luther’s letter to the F.D.A. McNeil has changed the way it reviews consumer complaints so it can identify problems faster and take action more effectively, the letter said. McNeil also plans to conduct a comprehensive assessment of its quality management system, according to the letter. The letter also said that McNeil was changing its investigation procedures, although the F.D.A. blacked out details of those changes. “We are confident that this corrective action plan provides the approach necessary to identify and implement systemic actions that will improve and enhance our quality processes and systems while addressing the concerns raised by the F.D.A.,” Mr. Luther wrote in the letter. McNeil now requires all of its suppliers to ship components on heat-treated pallets free of the problem preservative, the letter said. The letter added that McNeil was destroying existing product components that had been shipped on pallets that the company could not confirm to be preservative-free. A second McNeil letter posted this week on the F.D.A. Web site said the company had assessed stability testing of all products made at the Las Piedras plant and planned to begin better analysis methods, where appropriate, by the end of this year. The F.D.A., in response to a reporter’s query, said on Tuesday that the agency was carefully reviewing the McNeil letter. “Our primary concern is protecting public health by determining what occurred and why it occurred, and ensuring that the company takes the needed corrective actions as stated in the agency’s warning letter,” said Richard Friedman, the director of manufacturing and product quality at the agency’s center for drug evaluation and research . In a statement, Marc Boston, a spokesman for McNeil, said that the company was already practicing the enhanced quality assurance measures outlined in the letters.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/business/10device.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">With Warning, a Hip Device Is Withdrawn<date>Published: March 9, 2010</date><text>A unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, just months after saying it was phasing out an artificial hip implant because of slowing sales, has warned doctors that the device appears to have a high early failure rate in some patients.The action by the company, DePuy Orthopaedics, follows more than two years of reports that the hip implant, which is known as the ASR, was failing in patients only a few years after implant, requiring costly and painful replacement operations. Some orthopedic experts have voiced dismay in recent interviews that DePuy had not halted sales of the device earlier. And some specialists said that they believed the device had a design flaw that made it difficult to implant properly, a claim disputed by DePuy officials, who had said the product had no safety problems. The director of an implant database in Australia, Dr. Stephen Graves, said the data had shown for some time that the ASR had been failing early at a significantly higher rate than some competitors’ devices. In December, DePuy voluntarily withdrew the ASR from the Australian market. DePuy, of Warsaw, Ind., also announced late last year that it planned to phase out sales of the product worldwide by the end of 2010. “It is way too late,” Dr. Graves said. While the ASR is not widely used in the United States, DePuy officials said recently that it had been implanted in thousands of patients worldwide. In a letter dated March 6, DePuy told doctors that recently analyzed data from Australia suggested that the ASR had a higher-than-expected failure rate when used in traditional hip replacement on certain types of patients. The letter said that the data shows that the risk is highest for patients of small stature, a group that typically includes women, and patients with weak bones. Asked Tuesday by a reporter why the company was issuing the advisory now, even as it was winding down sales of the device, DePuy said in a statement that it believed that “this is new and important information surgeons who continue to use ASR should have to inform their clinical decision making.” The ASR, one of several hip models sold by DePuy, belongs to a category of devices known as metal-on-metal implants. Such implants are under increasing scrutiny because they can generate large amounts of metallic debris as they wear. The debris can cause severe inflammatory responses in some patients, damaging muscles and other soft tissues, requiring a follow-up operation to replace the device soon after implant — instead of the 15 or more years artificial hips are supposed to last. Just last month, in an interview, DePuy officials defended the ASR’s track record, saying its performance equaled that of competing devices. Those officials also said that the company was phasing out sales of the ASR for commercial reasons, not because of any safety issues. “With declining sales of this particular product in its market segment, we are focusing on newer technologies,” Sally Hunter, DePuy’s worldwide vice president for regulatory affairs, said last month. DePuy sells the ASR for use in hip “resurfacing,” a popular alternative to traditional replacement. The company also separately markets an ASR component — its hip socket, or cup — for use in traditional hip replacement. DePuy’s March 6 alert deals with the ASR’s failure rate in traditional replacements. While the ASR resurfacing system has been used abroad, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved it for sale in the United States. In 2005, however, the F.D.A. cleared the ASR cup for use in traditional hip replacement. The device was cleared through a regulatory pathway that did not require it to undergo clinical trials. Since the beginning of 2008, the F.D.A. has received about 300 complaints on the ASR involving patients in the United States who received it. A review of those reports indicates that a vast majority of those patients underwent an operation to have the device replaced soon after getting it. The number of such complaints typically understates a product’s problem, however, because many doctors and hospitals never bother to file reports with the F.D.A. Ms. Hunter said that some problems with the ASR had arisen because doctors were improperly implanting the device’s cup when first using it. To function properly a cup, which resembles a small hollow ball cut in half, must be positioned in the hip at the proper angle. “With every device, there is a learning curve,” Ms. Hunter said. Some surgeons, including the ASR’s co-developer, Dr. Thomas P. Schmalzried, an orthopedic specialist in Los Angeles, said they had used the device successfully in their patients. But Dr. Schmalzried said in an interview last month that he and DePuy officials realized within the last two years that the ASR cup might be more of a challenge to implant properly than competing cups. “The window for component position that is consistent for good, long-term clinical function is smaller for the ASR,” than other cups, said Dr. Schmalzried, who has received $3.4 million in payments in the last two years from DePuy for his work on the ASR and other devices. Asked last month about Dr. Schmalzried’s comments, DePuy officials expressed surprise that he had made them. They said they would provide a reporter with a statement after consulting with him. But DePuy’s subsequent statement did not refer to Dr. Schmalzried. In that statement, DePuy said that while reports had cited “a theoretical potential for ASR cups to be more sensitive to component position,” other data from studies and examinations of explanted devices “does not support the fact that performance is primarily related to design.” In early 2009, DePuy sent a brochure to doctors on the importance of proper cup positioning for all hip implants. But the information did not address any specific concerns about the ASR. In its recent letter, DePuy emphasized the need to properly position the ASR. Several orthopedic specialists said that they believed that the design of the ASR cup, which is shallower than some similar devices, was at the heart of the implant’s problems. For example, Dr. Harlan C. Amstutz, an orthopedic surgeon in Los Angeles and an implant designer who is a consultant for Wright Medical Technology, a competing orthopedic company, said that he believed that the design was prone to problems. “It may not be Toyota, but it is not good,” Dr. Amstutz said.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B00E6DA103AF935A25751C0A9669D8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">GLOBAL UPDATE; Girls' Health: Kits to Aid in Menstrual Health May Cut School Absenteeism in Kenya<date>Published: February 16, 2010</date><text>Tackling a problem that is widespread but rarely discussed, a new American-backed charity in Kenya has begun making and giving away kits containing washable sanitary pads, underwear and soap. Many schoolgirls from poor families stay home up to five days each month when they have their period, according to a recent study in rural Ghana by Oxford University scientists. Disposable sanitary pads like those used in wealthy countries cut absenteeism, but poor families often cannot afford them; a Kenyan girl interviewed by the Voice of America said a box of pads costs about the same as a bag of corn flour, and her parents had to choose the latter. Substitutes like cloth, mattress padding or newspaper may leak or raise the risk of infection. Not only are the girls embarrassed, but as soon as it is clear they are ovulating, pressure for sex from men -- often including their male teachers -- steadily increases, the study found. Huru International, in partnership with the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Elton JohnAIDS Foundation, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sunflag Steel, Warner Brothers and other backers, developed large but soft terry-cloth pads that can be washed and reused. They are sewn and packaged at a Nairobi community center supported by AmericaShare, the charity arm of Micato Safaris, a New York travel company. The kits also contain information about safe sex and avoiding AIDS. AmericaShare hopes other African women will use microfinance loans to buy the machines needed to make the pads and sell them.

Enlarge This Image It will provide advice, exercises and periodic shipments of toiletries with scents that the company says “elicit relaxing and refreshing moods.” “Out of that was born this idea of developing a stress management program,” said Margaret Aleles, vice president for innovation growth platforms and new businesses at the company. The new online stress management program for women, Upliv, is scheduled to be introduced later this month at upliv.com. It represents a departure for Johnson &amp; Johnson, because while it has a product component, it is primarily a subscription program. For a monthly fee ($99.95 for the first month, $39.95 monthly thereafter), women first take an online stress analysis, which measures both their level of stress and aspects of their lives  like finances, career or relationships  that are the most enervating. Based on those responses, participants are given instructions for weekly sessions, which teach relaxation strategies like deep breathing. They also are sent articles from Upliv’s database and assigned tasks like writing about sources of stress, which can be saved in an online journal. While Upliv lists psychiatrists on its advisory board, there is no one-on-one counseling. But it is personalized to the degree that, for example, a member whose stress analysis reveals her career to be her biggest source of stress will be given more career-related exercises than someone worried mostly about dating. As for products, upon registering and every 90 days thereafter, members will be shipped Upliv toiletries with scents that, according to marketing materials, “elicit relaxing and refreshing moods,” including Field of Happiness, Ocean of Clarity and Canopy of Tranquility. Shipments, for which members will be billed $8.72, will include two bottles of body wash and one bottle each of body lotion and facial wash. For a year, including shipping fees, that adds up to $566, a price Ms. Aleles said was in line with “what women already were doing for stress, like going to a spa and spending $100 or taking a yoga class for $20.” (For women who subscribe for a year, Johnson &amp; Johnson is offering an introductory price of $380.) Relieving stress by spending more time on the Internet, which is often blamed for making users more sedentary and imbalanced, might sound counterintuitive, but Ms. Aleles argued otherwise.  “Women spend over 27 hours a week on the Internet that’s not e-mail related, and what we found is that women love to go on the Internet after their kids have gone to bed,” Ms. Aleles said. “They find it stress-relieving.” While some Upliv tips, like relaxing by taking a hot shower or having a cup of herbal tea, are predictable, the company says the overall approach is effective. In an internal study in which 540 women aged 25 to 45 who reported “moderate to high stress levels” were put either on the Upliv program or in a control group, women in the program reported marked improvements, including increased “clear-headedness” and “sleep satisfaction.” Upliv will be introduced with a 30-minute infomercial, intended to begin later this month in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas and Atlanta. The infomercial, by Cesari Direct of Seattle, features the actress Angie Harmon, Upliv’s spokeswoman, as well as scientists, a fragrance specialist and several women who participated in a trial run of the program. “Stress is usually one of the biggest causers for headaches and before I started this program I was averaging sometimes about 15 a month,” one participant, Jenny Ford, a teacher and mother of three, says in the infomercial. She said that her headaches had virtually disappeared as a result of the program, and that it had “really improved my marriage, because I’m happier, I have more energy, and I’m not such a drag.” Another participant, Caroline Jalango, 37, single and a sales associate, tells the interviewer in the infomercial that the program helped her to be “responsible for my well-being  it’s a very powerful tool to me.” In a telephone interview, Ms. Jalango, who lives in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and participated in a three-month trial in the fall, said that even though it had been a few months since she had had access to the Upliv Web site, “it has become like a lifestyle for me,” and helped her to be less stressful about her job, her family relationships and “being single while my biological clock is ticking.” While she said she “didn’t really like the fragrances” of the Upliv personal care products, she did appreciate weekly online live chats with other participants and representatives from Johnson &amp; Johnson, who were seeking their feedback.  “Women really like to have a sense of community and a sense of sharing and cheering other women on,” Ms. Jalango said. Such camaraderie will not be a feature of Upliv when it is introduced, however. The Web site will not enable participants to interact with one another, although the company hopes to introduce interactive features within a year. Ms. Jalango, meanwhile, said one of her least relaxing experiences was appearing in the infomercial. “I freaked out,” she said. “I had never been on camera before and there were all these microphones and everything.

Go to the Prescriptions Blog » Times Topics: Health Care Reform Multimedia Profit Disparity Add to Portfolio Pfizer Inc Bristol-Myers Squibb Co Go to your Portfolio » After all, in return for the prospect of tens of millions of newly insured customers and a large degree of regulatory certainty, the pharmaceutical industry had agreed to pay a relatively small price: $8 billion a year in discounts and fees. It was a modest compromise for an industry with $246 billion in prescription drug sales last year. But now, with the health care overhaul on a back burner in Washington and possibly dead for this year, drug makers are getting a sinking sense of how a piecemeal public policy future might look for them. President Obama’s proposed budget this week, for example, includes a plan he alluded to in last week’s State of the Union address: a new tax on profits from some patents and other intangible assets parked in overseas tax havens by American companies. For drug makers, which are among those most likely to be affected by such a tax, the president’s proposal “pretty much came out of the blue,” said Martin A. Sullivan, an economist formerly with the Treasury Department and Joint Committee on Taxation. Another expert agreed. “Pharma’s one that would really get hit,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “That’s a biggie.” The industry giant Pfizer, for example, which has said that 88 percent of its $56 billion in income from 2004 through 2008 originated overseas, could be subject to the corporate 35 percent tax rate on at least some of its foreign profit in the future if the president’s proposal goes through. Although the tax idea faced a cool reception from Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, it highlighted the risks to the drug industry of unpredictable election-year politics. It is a time when bolt-from-the-blue challenges may await drug makers, compared with the carefully mapped future they had worked out with the White House and the Senate under the health care legislation. As if to reinforce the continuing business challenges that drug makers face, regardless of carrots and sticks from Washington, Pfizer issued an earnings report and financial forecast this week that disappointed Wall Street. The report, on Wednesday, has helped send its shares down 6.3 percent in the last two days. Pfizer lowered its 2010 and 2012 forecasts, citing the rising dollar and the sale or spinoff of some assets, including animal health products and an H.I.V. drug. The company also noted the coming patent expirations on some of its blockbuster drugs, including Lipitor, as well as growing competition from lower-priced generics. Several of the other big American drug companies reported a mixed bag of results last week. Johnson &amp; Johnson posted a rare yearly decline in sales and gave a disappointing 2010 profit forecast. Bristol-Myers Squibb’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates, helped by a lower-than-expected tax rate. Eli Lilly profit fell just short of expectations, and its shares declined as investors also showed concern about expirations of its drug patents. The other big American drug maker, Merck, plans to report on Feb. 16. None of those drug makers had forecast effects from a health care overhaul by Washington. But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill. Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry. The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal  including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada  would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table. As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States. Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. “Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.” Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy. “The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It’s not working to their advantage.” Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry  if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection. The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs  to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently. In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. “No question that’s alive,” said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. But the overall health care reform package, he added, is “either dead or severely hobbled.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on February 5, 2010, on page B1 of the New York edition.With the possible demise of health care legislation, getting back to business as usual may not be the best thing for the nation’s drug makers.

But all of them had basically endorsed the Senate bill. Just last month, before the Republican candidate Scott Brown’s victory in a special election in Massachusetts upended the Democrats’ supermajority in the Senate, Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, told analysts that the Senate health care bill was “largely consistent with the principles” that were important to his industry. The drug industry had forecast lower revenue in the early years of its cost-savings deal, in which it agreed to pay $80 billion in rebates and fees over a decade. But its revenue and profit were expected to more than make up the difference later in that period as more than 30 million uninsured people began receiving health and drug coverage. And just as important, the industry had received assurances from the Obama administration and some critical Congressional Democrats that long-feared proposals that might have popular appeal  including government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and allowing the import of cheaper drugs from Canada  would be tabled in return for drug makers’ support of the rest of the health care overhaul. And some industry experts say any notions of an offshore tax had also been taken off the table. As part of the deal, the drug industry had also pledged and spent more than $100 million on TV advertising in support of the overhaul effort. It is unlikely that the drug industry will run ads promoting President Obama’s offshore tax proposal. Drug makers are fighting it through a Washington-based business coalition called Promote America’s Competitive Edge, which includes many other multinationals. The group argues that lower foreign tax rates create a level playing field for American companies and international competitors and, ultimately, save jobs in the United States. Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury economist who now writes about tax issues, said that all the big drug makers engage in offshore tax sheltering of one sort or another. And the portion of overseas profit and revenue has been growing in recent years. “Typically when a pharmaceutical company develops a new drug, it transfers it to a holding company in a tax haven like Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, usually on very favorable terms,” he said. “There’s a tremendous amount of income taken out of the U.S. and put into the tax haven. This proposal seems targeted to just that type of situation.” Pfizer has reported that 58 percent of its revenue came from overseas in 2008, compared with 39 percent a decade earlier. For other drug markets, overseas revenue in 2008 amounted to 46 percent for Lilly, 44 percent for Merck and 42 percent for Bristol-Myers. Professor Gordon of the University of Michigan, who studies pharmaceutical companies, said the president’s new plan to tax “excessive” offshore profits had surprised the industry and revealed the risks of a piecemeal health policy. “The industry thought that it got some uncertainty off the table,” Professor Gordon said. “They’re not thrilled about what happened in Massachusetts. It’s not working to their advantage.” Some analysts, meanwhile, say parts of the $80 billion, 10-year deal could come back to bite the drug industry  if it is held to some of the cost pledges without receiving the offsetting political protection. The pact, for instance, committed the industry to support an increase in the rebate the government receives on Medicaid drugs  to 23 percent, up from 15 percent currently. In the current deficit-cutting environment, that discount may still look attractive to lawmakers. And it could conceivably be enacted by Congress at any time without being part of an industry quid pro quo. “No question that’s alive,” said Seamus Fernandez, pharmaceutical industry analyst for the health care investment bank Leerink Swann. But the overall health care reform package, he added, is “either dead or severely hobbled.”</text></article><article index="2" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/02/business/02device.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Boston Scientific to Pay $1.7 Billion to Settle Patent Suits<date>Published: February 1, 2010</date><text>Boston Scientific said Monday that it would pay $1.725 billion to a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson to settle long-running disputes between the companies over patents for coronary stents. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Boston Scientific Corporation Go to your Portfolio » The figure appears to be the largest sum ever paid to resolve patent litigation over a medical device. It also follows by just a few months, a separate payment of $716.3 million by Boston Scientific to the Cordis division of Johnson &amp; Johnson to settle other stent-related patent litigation. Under the agreement announced Monday, Boston Scientific said it would pay $1 billion immediately to Cordis. The remaining $725 million will be paid in early January next year, the company said. The settlement will allow Boston Scientific to continue to market its existing line of stents, tiny devices used to prop open clogged blood vessels. The agreement’s size suggests that Boston Scientific viewed the payments as manageable given the profits to be made in that market. In 2008, drug-coated stents accounted for 20 percent of the company’s revenue of $8.05 billion. Two courtroom trials related to the patent disputes were scheduled to start this month. “We believe that today’s settlement  while substantial  is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders,” said Ray Elliott, the president and chief executive of Boston Scientific. “It resolves major litigation without exposing Boston Scientific to the uncertainties of a jury trial.” But some industry analysts suggested that the settlement’s size could sharply curtail Boston Scientific’s ability to make major acquisitions in the near future or force the company to undergo another round of staff cuts. In 2007, the company announced a plan to lay off about 2,700 workers, or about 13 percent of its work force. In a note to investors Monday, Larry Biegelsen, an analyst with Wells Fargo Securities, wrote that he believed that the device maker would “announce another restructuring in the near future.” As of last September, Boston Scientific had roughly $1.38 billion in cash with about $6.03 billion in debt. A Boston Scientific spokesman declined to comment specifically on the settlement’s possible impact on the company’s operations. "We are a large, diverse company with an investment-grade profile and the financial strength and flexibility to meet this obligation,” said the spokesman, Paul Donovan. “Our strong cash flow will let us fund almost all the settlement payments from cash on hand, and after the payments we will still have significant liquidity." Before the agreement announced Monday, the largest patent settlement over a medical device involved the payment by Medtronic of $1.35 billion to Dr. Gary K. Michelson, the developer of spinal implants, in a deal reached in 2005. Of that amount, Medtronic paid $550 million to settle a lawsuit and an $800 million to acquire Dr. Michelson’s patents. In trading on the New York Stock exchange Monday, Boston Scientific shares closed down 21 cents, or 2.4 percent, at $8.42. Johnson &amp; Johnson stock closed up 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $63.09. Another industry analyst, Kristen Stewart of Credit Suisse, said Monday that she was reducing her target price for Boston Scientific stock to $9.50 a share from $10 to reflect the settlement’s impact. She also wrote Monday in a note to investors that the settlement funds could have “otherwise been reinvested back into the business or to fund acquisitions.” Boston Scientific has been struggling to find its footing since its $27 billion acquisition in 2006 of Guidant, a producer of implanted heart pacemakers and defibrillators. Most analysts believe that Boston Scientific overpaid for Guidant.

The model dictates that a company should communicate clearly with the public about a crisis, cooperate with government officials, swiftly begin its own investigation of a problem and, if necessary, quickly institute a product recall. The template is based on Johnson &amp; Johnson's conduct in 1982, when several people died after taking tainted Tylenol pills. The company's reaction to the crisis is widely regarded as exemplary. But last week, Johnson &amp; Johnson appeared to abandon its own template, stunning a few business school professors. Its conduct also drew harsh criticism from federal officials. On Friday, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, announced the recall of several hundred batches of popular over-the-counter medicines, including Benadryl, Motrin, Rolaids, Simply Sleep, St. Joseph Aspirin and Tylenol. According to a federal inspection report, the response was anything but swift. The recall came 20 months after McNeil first began receiving consumer complaints about moldy-smelling bottles of Tylenol Arthritis Relief caplets, according to a warning letter sent by the Food and Drug Administration to the company on Friday. Since then, a few people have also reported temporary digestive problems like nausea, vomiting and stomach pain, the agency said. The McNeil unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson had recalled some batches of the arthritis drug at the end of 2009. But the company did not conduct a timely, comprehensive investigation, did not quickly identify the source of the problem, and did not notify authorities in a timely fashion, prolonging consumer exposure to the products, the warning letter said. Analysts said the company's seemingly slow response appeared out of character for one of the most trusted corporate brands in America, the maker of beloved household products like Johnson's Baby Shampoo and Band-Aids. And the recall, they said, had the potential to encourage consumers, who may have perceived name-brand medicines as being a higher quality worth their premium prices, to switch to less expensive drugstore brands. ''The F.D.A. comments on Friday were devastating because they make the company seem to be complacent and sloppy,'' said Timothy Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. Deborah M. Autor, the director of the Office of Compliance at the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said on a conference call with journalists on Friday that the company should have acted faster. ''When something smells bad literally or figuratively,'' Ms. Autor said, ''companies must aggressively investigate and take all necessary actions to solve the problem.'' In response to a query from a reporter on Sunday, a spokeswoman for McNeil said that the company was working with the F.D.A. to resolve the agency's concerns. ''We're conscious of the fact that people expect more of us,'' the spokeswoman, Bonnie Jacobs, wrote in an e-mail message. ''McNeil Consumer Healthcare has applied broad criteria to identify and remove all product lots that it believes may have the potential to be affected, even if they have not been the subject of consumer complaints.'' In a statement on Friday, McNeil said the breakdown of a chemical used to treat wood pallets that transport and store product packaging was the source of the moldy smell in some products. The company has set up a Web site, McNeilProductRecall.com, which provides the list of recalled batches, also known as lots. Consumers can also call 888-222-6036 to ask about a refund or replacement of recalled products. Separately on Friday, the Justice Department also filed charges against Johnson &amp; Johnson in federal court in Massachusetts, accusing the company of paying kickbacks to a nursing home pharmacy to promote several of its prescription drugs, including the antipsychotic drug Risperdal, to elderly patients. The company said on Friday that its conduct had been legal and appropriate. The company was reviewing the government's complaint and intends to respond in court, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Calkins said the company faces even more public scrutiny with both problems coming out on the same day. ''Now you have two stories that people are connecting,'' Mr. Calkins said. ''It is a bit of a compound fracture.''</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/16/business/16recall.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson Widens Recall of Smelly Over-the Counter Drugs<date>Published: January 15, 2010</date><text>The health care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson expanded a recall of over-the-counter medications on Friday, the second time it had done so in less than a month because of a moldy smell that has made users sick.

McNeil has been sent a warning for violating manufacturing standards and failing to report and investigate the problem in a timely way, Ms. Autor said. Johnson &amp; Johnson has 15 days to respond. The F.D.A. said it wanted to know why the problem was not made public sooner. Johnson &amp; Johnson said the smell is caused by small amounts of a chemical associated with the treatment of wooden pallets. The F.D.A. said the chemical could volatilize into the air, and traced it to a plant in Las Piedras, P.R.

Now brace yourselves for P.E.  shorthand for premature ejaculation. Johnson &amp; Johnson has developed Priligy, a pill aimed at men who ejaculate before copulating or within seconds of beginning. Priligy, which is intended to help prolong latency time before orgasm, went on sale earlier this year in nine countries, but it has not been approved for sale in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, Sciele Pharma, based in Atlanta, plans to seek approval from the agency next year to market a prescription drug in the form of a metered-dose aerosol sprayed on the skin that is intended to increase latency time. Company representatives have been making the rounds of medical conferences and meeting journalists, trying to drum up sympathy and attention for premature ejaculation as a widespread medical problem in need of a drug intervention. “P.E. is more prevalent than E.D.,” Joseph T. Schepers, the company’s director of investor relations and corporate communications, told me when his team came to the office this week as part of a press tour in Manhattan. “One in three men actually have the condition.” Donna Gibson Dell, Sciele’s senior product manager for the drug, concurred: “It’s a huge unmet need.” Pharmaceutical companies dream of developing the next Viagra, a product that had worldwide sales last year of about $1.93 billion. “Viagra, and I think E.D. along with it, have become part of the cultural fabric,” said Jim Maffezzoli, a senior director in marketing at Pfizer, which introduced the drug in 1998. “The brand, everybody knows it.” Mr. Maffezzoli credited Viagra’s success to its status as the first prescription pill approved to treat a man’s inability to develop or maintain an erection. But creating a blockbuster quality-of-life drug like Viagra involves more than just being innovative or being first. Sometimes it requires a drug maker to create and market a whole new category of disease. The template goes something like this: Start with a legitimate quality-of-life issue  like fitful sleep or shyness  that does not yet have its own prescription medication and is debilitating to a few people a lot of the time. Next, position the quality-of-life issue as a medical condition with symptoms so common it covers vast numbers of people who had previously not identified themselves as having a health problem, or who thought they were just experiencing an occasional and normal annoyance. Articles in medical journals with high estimates on the prevalence of the issue help convince doctors and journalists of its scope. F.D.A. approval of the new drug legitimizes the condition as a problem with a medical solution. The uncertainty for drug makers as this kind of script plays out is whether doctors and the public will buy into a hitherto unrecognized disease, said Alan Cassels, a pharmaceutical policy researcher at the University of Victoria in British Columbia. “Marketers know you don’t sell the steak, you sell the sizzle,” said Mr. Cassels, the co-author of “Selling Sickness: How the World’s Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies Are Turning Us All Into Patients.” With premature ejaculation drugs, he said, “It will come down to convincing physicians that this is a serious disease and convincing most men that, if they have unsatisfactory intercourse and they don’t last up to a minute, they have a medical problem.” Premature ejaculation can be extremely distressing for men, said Dr. Wayne J. G. Hellstrom, a professor of urology at the Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans. “They don’t usually last in their relationships,” said Dr. Hellstrom, who has consulted for Johnson &amp; Johnson. The International Society for Sexual Medicine, a professional association, has developed a definition for premature ejaculation. It is a condition “characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration,” and which is accompanied by feelings of distress and lack of control. Sciele’s spray-on drug contains lidocaine and prilocaine, which act on sensory nerve endings in the penis, said Dr. Mike Wiley, director of urology for Sciele. The company studied the product on several hundred men who had a typical ejaculation time of about 36 seconds, Dr. Wiley said. After using the product, the typical time from penetration to ejaculation was about 2.6 minutes  about a two minute increase. While there is no doubt that some men are distressed about their inability to control their orgasms, there is little concrete evidence to suggest that there is an epidemic of premature ejaculation. In response to a query from this reporter, a public relations representative for Sciele sent material to back up the claim that one in three American men suffer from this affliction. One study, a 1999 report on sexual dysfunction in the United States, has been disputed by some sexologists because it was based on a sociology survey from 1992 that included questions about issues like fidelity  but was not created by epidemiologists to answer sexual health questions. Dr. Hellstrom at Tulane said perhaps 20 to 30 percent of men experience premature ejaculation at some point in their lifetimes. BUT Leonore Tiefer, a clinical associate professor in the psychiatry department at the New York University School of Medicine, said drug makers were increasingly trying to medicalize parts of daily life  whether it be mood, sleep or sexual function  in which there is a healthy and wide variation of normal. “Rapid ejaculation as opposed to slow ejaculation is common, but there is slow and fast everything in the world: slow and fast walkers, slow and fast eaters, slow and fast breathers,” said Dr. Tiefer, who is a psychologist specializing in sexual problems. “When you tell someone they are a fast ejaculator, it makes it sound like there is a right time to ejaculate and, if you ejaculate before, it’s a medical problem.” She added: “It is going to become a problem once enough publicity is given to it.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on December 13, 2009, on page BU4 of the New York edition.VIAGRA and its pitchman, Bob Dole, turned erectile dysfunction into a modern man’s malady.

Buffett see in railroads? Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, is paying a big premium for Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Mr. Buffett says he thinks the business of transporting goods around the country is ready to rebound. But investors may want to delay hitching a ride on his caboose. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Berkshire Hathaway Inc Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation CSX Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On its face, the transaction, at a 31 percent premium to Burlington’s market price on Monday, makes other railroad operators look relatively cheap. Stifel Nicolaus says it thinks there could be more than 30 percent upside in the CSX stock price, for instance, if investors were to peg sector valuations off the Berkshire-Burlington deal. And that is after the lift that rival stocks got after the transaction was announced. But it is not that simple. Berkshire now has its train set. Antitrust issues would prevent it from buying another, even if Mr. Buffett wanted one. Competition concerns would also be a barrier to further consolidation within the sector. Meanwhile, leveraged buyout investors are scarce, as are activists like the Children’s Investment Fund, which retreated earlier this year after taking on CSX management for 18 months and driving up its stock price. So there is no obvious reason to attach any merger premium to Burlington’s rivals. There is a general economic play. Railroad volume and prices have been soft through the recent recession. But they might at least have bottomed. Burlington’s adjusted third-quarter revenue of $3.6 billion was down 27 percent from the previous year, but up 8 percent from the previous quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It is tempting to raise other possibilities, too. Railroads are more environmentally friendly than trucks.

In theory, the potential value today of these cuts after tax would be more than $12 billion. Yet investors sliced $1.5 billion off J.&amp; J.’s market value on the announcement Tuesday. What gives? Unfortunately the cuts cannot be considered in isolation. The costs and risks of discovering drugs and getting them to market have surged. To deal with this, J.&amp; J. increasingly relies upon research partnerships, like its deal this year with the biotech firm Elan. These pacts mean a lesser share for J.&amp; J. shareholders in the fruits of any success. This just adds to J.&amp; J.’s problem with sales declines resulting from the loss of patent protection on its drug portfolio. For example, sales of the migraine treatment Topamax fell to $175 million in the third quarter this year, from $728 million last year. Sales of the antipsychotic Risperdal fell 40 percent over the same period, to $192 million. Combined, these accounted for much of J.&amp; J.’s overall decline in third-quarter revenue. Its drug business had operating margins of 31 percent, almost double the profitability of its consumer arm. This highlights J.&amp; J.’s so-called operating leverage: once costs are covered, additional sales are highly profitable. Yet, this cuts both ways. Look no further than J.&amp; J.’s counseling of analysts not to raise their estimates of the company’s margins as a result of the new cost cuts. Put simply, margins  and profits  would have declined without these measures. Despite the scope of the layoffs, it is roughly a wash for shareholders.

Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, is paying a big premium for Burlington Northern Santa Fe. Mr. Buffett says he thinks the business of transporting goods around the country is ready to rebound. But investors may want to delay hitching a ride on his caboose. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Berkshire Hathaway Inc Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation CSX Corporation Go to your Portfolio » On its face, the transaction, at a 31 percent premium to Burlington’s market price on Monday, makes other railroad operators look relatively cheap. Stifel Nicolaus says it thinks there could be more than 30 percent upside in the CSX stock price, for instance, if investors were to peg sector valuations off the Berkshire-Burlington deal. And that is after the lift that rival stocks got after the transaction was announced. But it is not that simple. Berkshire now has its train set. Antitrust issues would prevent it from buying another, even if Mr. Buffett wanted one. Competition concerns would also be a barrier to further consolidation within the sector. Meanwhile, leveraged buyout investors are scarce, as are activists like the Children’s Investment Fund, which retreated earlier this year after taking on CSX management for 18 months and driving up its stock price. So there is no obvious reason to attach any merger premium to Burlington’s rivals. There is a general economic play. Railroad volume and prices have been soft through the recent recession. But they might at least have bottomed. Burlington’s adjusted third-quarter revenue of $3.6 billion was down 27 percent from the previous year, but up 8 percent from the previous quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It is tempting to raise other possibilities, too. Railroads are more environmentally friendly than trucks. There is a chance the Obama administration will encourage investment by the highly regulated railroad industry. On another view, any emphasis on energy self-sufficiency could spur new coal-fired power plants, which in turn could increase the volume of coal shipments. Yet the trucking industry, suffering from overcapacity, is not going to give up without a fight.

The company, which makes drugs, medical devices and personal care products like Listerine, currently has about 117,000 employees worldwide. Many of the cuts are expected to occur overseas. Factors specific to the drug industry, including a wave of consolidation and the uncertainties of legislation pending in Congress, have combined with the sluggish global economy to put pressure on drug makers. Slower than many other businesses to contract in recent years, the health care industry is now hurrying to catch up by trying to adopt leaner research and development, manufacturing and marketing operations  often, by relying on a reduced corps of employees to take on greater responsibilities. Even before the announcement from Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009 was shaping up as a record year for job cuts in the pharmaceutical industry, according to a report from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, an employment firm that tracks job cut announcements by drug makers. Through October, drug makers had said they planned to cut nearly 58,700 jobs, more than 60 percent higher than in the comparable period last year. Health care companies still have growth opportunities if they can come up with new treatments for conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease, but the industry needs new approaches to capitalize on them, William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said in a call with analysts on Tuesday. The company’s overhaul plan, Mr. Weldon said, is meant to reduce layers of management and streamline decision making, to let the company devote more resources to investing in innovative medical products and bringing them to market. The company said that it planned to take a special pretax restructuring charge in the current quarter of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, but that it also expected the job cuts and other reduced expenditures to result in long-term savings. The company said it expected pretax cost savings next year of $800 million to $900 million. And in 2011, when the reorganization is completed, it expects pretax cost savings of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion. An analyst’s report from Credit Suisse on Tuesday said the absolute savings would amount to 3 to 4 percent of the company’s total spending for 2009. “The plans and associated savings we are announcing today,” Mr. Weldon said during the call, “will increase our operational efficiency and allow us to continue growing our strong core businesses and ensure the success of new products that are launching or pending approval in the near term.” Job cuts at the company would be global, he said, and were likely to be heavier outside of the United States. A spokesman said the company would not comment on how the job cuts would play out across the company’s drug, device and consumer divisions. Within the industry, many of the major pharmaceutical companies are facing patent expirations on their billion-dollar blockbuster drugs that will expose them to competition from cheaper generics. Meanwhile, a slow and expensive drug development process, in which it often takes more than a decade and costs more than $1 billion to bring a new medicine to market, has slowed down product pipelines. Besides economic and business pressures, health care companies are also under increased scrutiny by federal regulators and lawmakers. The increased emphasis by regulators on safety, analysts said, has resulted in a longer, costlier, more complicated approval process for prescription drugs  a business from which Johnson &amp; Johnson derived $24.6 billion of its $63.7 billion total revenue last year, from drugs like Remicade, a treatment for plaque psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. And the makers of medical devices are not exempt from increased government attention. Johnson &amp; Johnson generated about 36 percent of its overall revenue last year from devices that include knee and hip replacements, sutures, and contact lenses. The Food and Drug Administration recently said it had asked an independent group of scientific experts to review the agency’s vetting of medical devices. And, to help pay for the cost of a Congressional overhaul of the health care system, some lawmakers have called for the makers of medical devices to pay billions in extra taxes over the next decade. “Companies with massive global infrastructure are asking themselves if they can get the job done in more efficient ways,” said Rick Wise, an analyst who covers Johnson &amp; Johnson for Leerink Swann, a health care investment bank. For major drug makers that announced mergers this year, efficiency is a code for word for cuts to eliminate overlapping jobs. The $68 billion merger of the drug giants Pfizer and Wyeth, completed last month, is expected to result in a work force reduction of 15 percent, or about 19,500 jobs. The $41.1 billion merger of Merck and Schering-Plough, which was expected to be completed late Tuesday afternoon, is projected to result eventually in the elimination of 16,000 jobs. Eli Lilly, which bought the biotech company ImClone Systems last year for $6.5 billion, recently said it planned to reduce its work force to 35,000  a loss of about 5,500 jobs  by 2011. But Johnson &amp; Johnson may be in a better position to weather challenges than many of its competitors, analysts said. It has promising new products  this year, the F.D.A. approved four of the company’s new drugs, including Simponi for rheumatoid arthritis and Stelara for psoriasis. And the company recently bought 18 percent stakes in Elan and Crucell, two innovative smaller companies with which Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to develop, respectively, Alzheimer’s drugs and vaccines. Moreover, as a diversified company that markets surgical devices and consumer products as well as drugs, Johnson &amp; Johnson is less exposed to pressures unique to the pharmaceutical industry, analysts said. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson closed at $58.93 Tuesday, down 56 cents.

While third-quarter profit topped analysts' forecasts, that was largely because of cost cuts and lower taxes. Generic competition and safety concerns have undermined sales of many products for Johnson. The anemia medicine Procrit, the arthritis treatment Remicade and the attention deficit disorder drug Concerta all fell short of analysts' estimates for the quarter. Johnson &amp; Johnson said net earnings rose 1.1 percent, to $3.35 billion, or $1.20 a share, from $3.31 billion, or $1.17 a share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $1.13 a share. Unexpectedly lower taxes in the quarter bolstered results by 5 cents a share, the chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso, told analysts in a conference call. Sales fell 5.3 percent, to $15.08 billion, shy of the analysts' forecast of $15.22 billion. The company said prescription drug sales fell more than 14 percent, to $5.25 billion, hurt by generic competition for its Topamax epilepsy drug and Risperdal schizophrenia treatment. The anemia drugs Procrit and Eprex continued to suffer because of safety concerns for the category.

Johnson &amp; Johnson will record most of the payment as a special item in the fourth quarter. The companies agreed to dismiss lawsuits in the United States, Canada and elsewhere that relate to the use of stents -- wire mesh tubes that hold open arteries -- in diagnosing and treating heart disease. The suits also are related to the design of drug-coated stents, balloon catheters, stent delivery systems and balloon materials. Other lawsuits between the companies remain active.

Skip to next paragraph Dr. Joseph Biederman The psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Biederman, outlined plans to test Johnson &amp; Johnson’s drugs in presentations to company executives. One slide referred to a proposed trial in preschool children of risperidone, an antipsychotic drug made by the drug company. The trial, the slide stated, “will support the safety and effectiveness of risperidone in this age group.” Dr. Biederman was the lead author of a trial published last year concluding that treatment with risperidone improved symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder in bipolar children. Dr. Biederman  who was director of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Center for Pediatric Psychopathology Research at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston  is in the middle of two controversies: one involves the use of antipsychotic drugs in children, and the other relates to conflicts of interest in medicine. He is the world’s most prominent advocate of diagnosing bipolar disorder in even the youngest children and of using antipsychotic medicines to treat the disease, but much of his work has been underwritten by drug makers for whom he privately consults. An inquiry by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, revealed last year that Dr. Biederman earned at least $1.6 million in consulting fees from drug makers from 2000 to 2007 but failed to report all but about $200,000 of this income to university officials. Harvard and the National Institutes of Health are investigating whether Dr. Biederman violated federal and university research rules. He has suspended his work with the drug industry during the investigations. Dr. Biederman has become a key witness in a series of lawsuits filed by state attorneys general claiming that makers of antipsychotic drugs defrauded state Medicaid programs by improperly marketing their medicines. His work helped fuel a rapid rise in the use of these medicines in children. In November, the lawyers for the states released e-mail messages and internal documents from Johnson &amp; Johnson that showed the company had intended to use its connection with Dr. Biederman to increase sales. The documents became public in a motion filed by plaintiffs’ lawyers to compel him to be interviewed. Dr. Biederman has not responded to messages seeking comment. An article in The Boston Globe in December quoted a letter to the newspaper in which he wrote that while Johnson &amp; Johnson had sought commercial applications to his work, “any implication that J.&amp;J.’s interests interfered with the center’s work is wrong.” A spokeswoman for Massachusetts General Hospital said Thursday that she could not comment on pending litigation. Judge Jamie D. Happas of New Jersey Superior Court, who is overseeing the multistate litigation, ruled last year that Dr. Biederman should be deposed. As part of that process, Dr. Biederman provided lawyers with documents relating to his interactions with Johnson &amp; Johnson; the documents included presentations he made over several years summarizing the work of the center, financed by the company. Peter Spivack, a lawyer representing Dr. Biederman, filed a motion seeking to keep these documents under seal. The New York Times received copies of the documents. In a letter filed with the court on Thursday, Mr. Spivack said articles in The Times about Dr. Biederman had “publicly embarrassed Dr. Biederman and, in part, led to an agreement to forestall contact with pharmaceutical companies.” One set of slides in the documents referred to “Key Projects for 2004” and listed a planned trial to compare Risperdal, also known as risperidone, with competitors in managing pediatric bipolar disorder. The trial “will clarify the competitive advantages of risperidone vs. other neuroleptics,” the slide stated. All of the slides were prepared by Dr. Biederman, according to his sworn statement. In 2005, Dr. Biederman was the lead author of a study comparing Risperdal and Zyprexa, made by Eli Lilly. The study concluded that Risperdal improved subjects’ depressive symptoms but that Zyprexa did not. A slide listing “Key Projects for 2005” mentioned a planned study in adolescents of Concerta, a stimulant manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The study will “extend to adolescents positive findings with Concerta in A.D.H.D. N.O.S. in adults,” the slide said, referring to unusual cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In 2006, Dr. Biederman was co-author of a study showing that children given Concerta for a prolonged period did not have reduced growth, allaying a significant concern about the medicine. Josephine Johnston, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute, said the documents “raise questions about how well-designed Dr. Biederman’s trials were in that he promised a result to his funders.” “It’s another shadow over his work,” Ms. Johnston said. In a contentious Feb. 26 deposition between Dr. Biederman and lawyers for the states, he was asked what rank he held at Harvard. “Full professor,” he answered. “What’s after that?” asked a lawyer, Fletch Trammell. “God,” Dr. Biederman responded. “Did you say God?” Mr. Trammell asked. “Yeah,” Dr. Biederman said.

Skip to next paragraph Hiroko Masuike for The New York Times Merck wants to keep Scherings right to sell Remicade. Multimedia Graphic Drug Industry Consolidation Related Roche Agrees to Buy Genentech for $46.8 Billion (March 13, 2009) Merck to Buy Schering-Plough for $41.1 Billion (March 10, 2009) Times Topics: Johnson &amp; Johnson | Merck &amp; Company Inc. | Remicade (Drug) Add to Portfolio Schering Plough Corp Go to your Portfolio » That’s the question drug analysts and executives are asking in the wake of the deal announced Monday in which Merck would acquire Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion. That agreement involves a complicated structure, called a reverse merger, in which Merck would technically become a subsidiary of Schering  which would in turn rename itself Merck. The contortions are meant to let the new company avoid losing the rights to Remicade, a lucrative rheumatoid arthritis drug that Schering markets internationally under a joint agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson. Last year, Schering had $2.1 billion in Remicade sales outside the United States, while Johnson &amp; Johnson sold $2.8 billion worth in this country. A change in Schering’s ownership could set off a termination clause in that marketing pact and enable Johnson &amp; Johnson to gain full rights to Remicade, as well as another drug, golimumab, which is pending approval in Europe. During a conference call with analysts on Monday, Fred Hassan, the chief executive of Schering, said he had a cordial conversation that morning with William C. Weldon, the chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson. Mr. Hassan did not disclose the content of their discussion. And so far, Johnson &amp; Johnson is not commenting  leaving analysts to speculate whether the company will take the Remicade case to arbitration, or maybe even try to pre-empt the Merck-Schering deal with a higher takeover bid. The most complicated hypothesis involves a Solomonic solution in which Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck split Schering. Schering is an attractive takeover candidate for Merck for a number of reasons. Schering’s pipeline of heart, asthma and arthritis drugs would diversify Merck’s drug portfolio. The two companies already collaborate on cholesterol drugs, a franchise that could benefit from consolidation. And expiring patents will expose 35 percent of Merck’s revenue to generic competition by 2012, according to Jason Napodano, an analyst at Zack’s Investment Research. By comparison, Schering will have only 6 percent of its sales exposed by patent loss in 2012, Mr. Napodano wrote. Still, some analysts said Schering could be an equally good fit for Johnson &amp; Johnson. If such a merger occurred, Johnson &amp; Johnson would gain control not only of the Remicade business but also of Schering’s promising drug pipeline, major consumer brands like Coppertone and its profitable animal health business  all of which analysts say would shore up some weak spots in Johnson &amp; Johnson’s portfolio. And the combined entity, they say, would eventually be able to save $3.5 billion annually through consolidation, the same amount projected in the Merck deal. Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote in her note to investors on Tuesday that there is a 20 to 25 percent chance that Johnson &amp; Johnson will make a higher offer for Schering. A counterbid from Johnson &amp; Johnson at a premium of 10 percent would amount to $45.2 billion, or a value of $25.98 a share, she wrote, compared to the $23.61-a-share value of Merck’s agreement with Schering. In an interview, she said that Johnson &amp; Johnson’s biggest deal to date is its $16.6 billion purchase in 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer brands including Listerine. “You don’t expect Johnson &amp; Johnson to do a big deal and they haven’t done a big deal, but there are reasons to consider it,” Ms. Arnold said. “Schering-Plough is the best house in the neighborhood. Why wouldn’t you want to buy the most attractive house in the neighborhood?” But Schering would pay a penalty if it accepted a higher offer from a company other than Merck: a breakup fee of $1.25 billion, according to the merger agreement filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A less drastic maneuver for Johnson &amp; Johnson would be to challenge Schering over the international rights to Remicade and golimumab. Under provisions of the companies’ joint marketing agreement, the Remicade arrangement would be terminated under any one of several conditions: if Schering became the subsidiary of another company or if the incumbent board of directors no longer constituted a majority. Merck and Schering say that their reverse merger structure allows the new entity to avoid setting off any of the provisions. But some analysts said the structure leaves room for dispute. “It would seem logical that Johnson &amp; Johnson would challenge that stance,” said Roopesh Patel, an analyst with UBS. But even if Schering were to lose its co-marketing rights to Remicade and golimumab, a merger would still be profitable for Merck, Mr. Patel said. In a note to investors, he estimated that if the merged company retained co-marketing rights, earnings would be $4.32 a share for 2013. Without the two drugs, he wrote, earnings would be an estimated $4.12 a share in 2013  still higher than the $3.08 he projected for Merck for 2013 if there were no merger. A final hypothesis involves Johnson &amp; Johnson buying Schering outright and then selling Merck the cholesterol franchise, which Ms. Arnold valued at $12 billion. But even if all three parties could agree in principle on such a transaction, the net cost to Johnson &amp; Johnson could give it pause. “If it’s over $30 billion, it’s over $30 billion,” Ms. Arnold said. “That’s a lot of money.” More Articles in Business » A version of this article appeared in print on March 13, 2009, on page B6 of the New York edition.HOW will Johnson &amp; Johnson respond?

Skip to next paragraph Related Accounts, People &amp; Miscellany (March 2, 2009) For those who do not take note of the corporate logos on mouthwash, allergy medicines or artificial sweeteners, all three products are manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson, one of the country’s pre-eminent consumer goods companies. The products were placed within the scenes of “Harlem Heights” as part of an extensive partnership between Johnson &amp; Johnson and BET, the leading cable channel for black viewers. Through the arrangement, Listerine, Zyrtec and the skin care brand Ambi are woven into the stories of the eight young New York professionals who are profiled on “Harlem Heights.” Splenda and the hand sanitizer Purell are also present as the cast members conduct their daily lives. It is common, of course, for products to be featured on television shows. Some days, it seems that every commercial citation on a show is suspect; last month, the actress Tina Fey wound up issuing a denial after bloggers wondered whether the multiple references to McDonald’s in an episode of NBC’s “30 Rock” were product placements. But advertiser integrations are more difficult to do in unscripted shows, by their very nature. “It is very much an art as opposed to a science,” said Alvin Bowles, the senior vice president for integrated marketing at BET Networks. As advertisers try to position themselves ever closer to the entertainment that viewers are watching, a rough formula is emerging. Before the production of “Harlem Heights,” the cast members completed a survey of their health and wellness habits. The survey found an opportunity to integrate allergy medicine into the story line. “You need to have those conversations far enough in advance so you understand exactly where some of the natural, organic places for integrations are, so things don’t feel staged,” Mr. Bowles said. “Harlem Heights,” which begins on Monday, is the latest spin on the docudrama genre that has included “Laguna Beach,” “The Hills,” and others that traffic in what could be called semi-reality. Set in Manhattan, the show follows eight members of what it calls the “young black elite.” The breadth of the Johnson &amp; Johnson partnership is unprecedented for the network. The brand is also visible in the commercials for “Harlem Heights” and on the show’s Web site. BET’s integrated marketing department is about two years old, making it younger than comparable efforts at the cable channel’s corporate cousins MTV and VH1 at Viacom. Philippe Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, has credited the integration opportunities with helping to secure price increases in the upfront period of advance advertising sales last year. As BET has reoriented itself away from a home for sometimes-controversial music videos, it has invested considerable money in acquisitions and original content. Music videos now represent less than 20 percent of the network’s lineup, compared with 70 percent four years ago. After showing some ratings weakness last year, the network’s audience numbers inched up in January, with a 6 percent gain over the same month last year. The programs have given Mr. Bowles new products to promote to potential advertisers. He said for some advertisers, who may not have commercials that are tailored to the African-American audience, product promotion is an answer to that concern. “By being able to utilize story-line integrations and being able to embed their product or message within the environment that we have control of, it allows us to offer a different message than we’ve been able to offer before,” he said. In the first three quarters of 2008, Johnson &amp; Johnson spent $33.9 million on advertising to reach African-Americans, up 17 percent from the same period in 2007, according to the Nielsen Company. Only one company, Procter &amp; Gamble, spent more. Brooke Crittendon, one of the cast members in “Harlem Heights,” said the integrations did not distract from the taping. “It sort of worked out,” she said. “If I was filming a scene at my house and I was getting ready, obviously I’m going to get out of the shower and put lotion on.” That scene featured the skin cream Ambi, which Johnson &amp; Johnson promotes by saying it meets “the needs of women of color.” Ms. Crittendon, who also works for MTV as a producer for the documentary series “True Life,” said it seemed that the burden of the integrations was shouldered by the producers. Kurt Williamson, the co-creator and an executive producer, said he had tried to avoid incongruous uses of Johnson &amp; Johnson products. None of the cast members put on a Nicorette patch or apply Rogaine on-camera. For the products that did appear, “we would come on the set with boxes and we would place things within the scenes, while trying to make it as organic as possible,” Mr. Williamson said. Viewers will judge whether the promotions seem forced. “We don’t necessarily have to showcase them gargling for 30 seconds to make sure you get the full effect, but you can get the sense that Listerine is part of their daily process,” Mr. Bowles said.

For the products that did appear, “we would come on the set with boxes and we would place things within the scenes, while trying to make it as organic as possible,” Mr. Williamson said. Viewers will judge whether the promotions seem forced. “We don’t necessarily have to showcase them gargling for 30 seconds to make sure you get the full effect, but you can get the sense that Listerine is part of their daily process,” Mr. Bowles said.</text></article><article index="6" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E2D8133BF936A15751C0A96F9C8B63&amp;ref=johnsonandjohnson">MARKET PLACE; Drug Firms Dreaming Of Deals<date>Published: February 25, 2009</date><text>Sports fans have fantasy baseball. Drug industry analysts have fantasy mergers. In the pharmaceutical version of the game, analysts use balance sheets to project how big-league drug companies could acquire more nimble rivals. The goal is to enhance product rosters, while reducing costs by shedding redundant staff and operations. Dreaming up dream teams has become a popular sport since Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, said it would buy Wyeth last month in a deal valued at $68 billion. Meanwhile, the big Swiss drug maker Roche is engaged in a hostile tender offer for the 44 percent of the American biotechnology company Genentech that it does not already own. ''Cash is up but valuations are down,'' said David S. Moskowitz, director of research at Caris &amp; Company, an investment bank. ''We see this as a major year of consolidation.'' In interviews, a half-dozen analysts suggested that three other giants -- Merck, Sanofi-Aventis and Johnson &amp; Johnson -- could be in the takeover hunt. The most talked-about targets are Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough. ''When you are trying to prognosticate, look for companies that are already collaborating, that already have a relationship with late-stage drugs or drugs that are already on the market,'' said Jason Napodano, an analyst with Zacks Investment Research. ''Then you buy 100 percent rights to the drug by buying the whole company.'' Merck is among the big pharmaceutical companies that are facing patent expirations on top-selling drugs with few promising prospects to replace them. The company, with a market value of about $60 billion, tops many analysts' lists as a potential acquirer. It has $6.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, according to the latest publicly available data. Richard T. Clark, the chief executive of Merck, which makes the bone drug Fosamax and the Gardasil vaccine for the virus that can cause cervical cancer, did not dispute the prospects for a merger when asked about the company's plans during a recent conference call with analysts. ''There are opportunities across the whole spectrum that we look at,'' Mr. Clark said. In response to a reporter's query, a company spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail message that Mr. Clark was traveling and not available to elaborate. Analysts said it was simply a question of whether Merck would pursue a more traditional drug maker, like Schering-Plough, with which it already collaborates on cholesterol treatments and which has a market capitalization of about $29 billion. Or Merck might expand into another realm with a biotechnology company like Gilead Sciences, a $46 billion company that specializes in H.I.V. drugs. Among other big pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis have enough cash to be in the market for the kind of purchase that would help them restock product lines while reducing expenses through consolidation. But executives at those companies have all said they are not interested in megamergers. ''These big massive deals, I've been through two of them, and you're out of the picture for three or four years trying to get those bedded down,'' Chris Viehbacher, Sanofi's chief executive since December, said in a recent telephone interview. He was referring to his 20 years at GlaxoSmithKline during which he saw the company, originally SmithKline, merge with Beecham in 1989 and Glaxo Wellcome in 2000. ''Making companies so big is one of the reasons our research and development innovation went off,'' Mr. Viehbacher said. His plan, he said, is to increase Sanofi's research partnerships with outside companies and expand into generics, vaccines and over-the-counter drugs. As for medium-size companies, analysts said that Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca could be either buyers or sellers. But Lilly, with a market cap of about $37 billion, is still digesting its $6.5 billion purchase of ImClone five months ago, which may make it unlikely to buy anything else soon. David Brennan, chief executive of the $51 billion AstraZeneca, recently told reporters his hands were full cutting the work force while looking for small acquisitions. Mr. Moskowitz of Caris, among other analysts, said that likely takeover candidates included Schering-Plough and Bristol-Myers, because they have fewer drugs whose patents are lapsing and have a number of drugs in the mid or late stages of development.</text></article><article index="7" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/us/06tylenol.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">F.B.I. Searches Building Where Man Linked to 1982 Tylenol Poisonings Lives<date>Published: February 5, 2009</date><text>BOSTON  F.B.I. agents searched Wednesday inside a building where a man connected to the fatal Tylenol poisonings of 1982 now lives. A spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation office in Boston said only that agents had conducted the search at a condominium complex on Gore Street in Cambridge as part of an investigation. They received a search warrant on Wednesday morning, said the spokeswoman, Gail Marcinkiewicz. Kenneth Galinski, commander of the Arlington Heights police department in Illinois, told The Associated Press on Thursday that one of his officers had also been dispatched to Boston, and that so far no one had been taken into custody. The man, James W. Lewis, was convicted of extortion in 1983 after he admitted sending a letter to Johnson &amp; Johnson, the maker of Tylenol, demanding $1 million “to stop the killing.” After serving more than 12 years in prison, he moved to the Boston area in 1995. While he was a suspect in the killings, he was never charged. Agents who said they were from the Boston and Chicago offices of the F.B.I. left Mr. Lewis’s building around 7:30 p.m. with several boxes and a Macintosh desktop computer. Several other places in Cambridge were searched as part of the investigation, Ms. Marcinkiewicz said, including at least one storage facility. But no arrests have been made, she said. The poisonings in 1982, which killed seven, terrified the nation and changed the way drugs are packaged, have never been solved. The F.B.I. office in Chicago said the agency was conducting “a complete review of all evidence developed in connection” with the murders. “This review was prompted, in part, by the recent 25th anniversary of this crime and the resulting publicity,” the statement said. “Further, given the many recent advances in forensic technology, it was only natural that a second look be taken at the case and recovered evidence.” The statement also said that the anniversary of the poisonings in 2007 had “prompted many people to call law enforcement agencies with tips,” and that all tips were being investigated. After Mr. Lewis was convicted, he offered prosecutors help in solving the Tylenol murders. “He is a prolific writer and artist,” said Jeremy Margolis, a former federal prosecutor in Chicago who prosecuted the case against Mr. Lewis, “and he provided me with great volumes of documents and a number of diagrams, all of which dealt with his theories as to what might have taken place.” A spokesman for the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office said Mr. Lewis was arrested in Massachusetts in 2004 on rape, kidnapping and other charges. The spokesman, Corey Welford, said the charges were dropped in July 2007, a day before Mr. Lewis’s trial was to start, because the alleged victim declined to testify.

The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., earned $2.71 billion, or 97 cents a share, up from $2.37 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue fell 4.9 percent, to $15.18 billion, from $15.96 billion. Excluding charges and gains, the company said it earned 94 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected profit of 92 cents a share on revenue of $15.93 billion. The one-time items included a $225 million after-tax gain from litigation settlements. Looking ahead, Johnson &amp; Johnson said it expected 2009 profit of $4.45 to $4.55 a share. Analysts expect profit of about $4.61 a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson noted, however, that the analysts estimate excludes the impact of acquiring the cosmetic product and breast implant maker Mentor Corporation, a deal expected to close in January that will dilute earnings by 3 to 5 cents. Johnson &amp; Johnson included that impact in its forecasts. The revenue drop, a rarity for Johnson &amp; Johnson, was led by an 11 percent plunge in pharmaceutical sales, to $5.7 billion. That decline was partly a result of a 41.4 percent drop in sales of the antipsychotic Risperdal, which now has generic competition. Medical device sales fell 2 percent, to $5.6 billion. Consumer products eked out a 1.2 percent increase in sales to $3.9 billion, helped by the introduction of the allergy treatment Zyrtec as an over-the-counter medicine. For the year, net income jumped 22 percent, to $12.95 billion, while revenue rose 4.3 percent, to $63.75 billion.

Analysts said Johnson &amp; Johnson was paying “a giant premium” for Mentor, which makes MemoryGel breast implants, liposuction equipment and skin repair products. Under the deal, Johnson &amp; Johnson will start a cash tender offer for $31 a share  nearly double Mentor’s Friday closing price of $16.15. The drug company will also assume Mentor’s debt, about $50 million, and make the company a stand-alone unit in its Ethicon business, a top provider of sutures, mesh and other surgical products. Mentor, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has about 1,300 employees and had $373 million in 2007 sales. Mentor shares jumped $14.43 on Monday, or 89 percent, to $30.58 in afternoon trading; J.&amp; J. shares, weighed down by a big decline in the broader market, fell $3.25, or 5.5 percent, to $55.33. “It’s a good space for J.&amp; J. to get bigger in because it’s a space with the least cost-control pricing pressures,” as patients, rather than insurers or government health programs, generally pay for cosmetic surgery, said Erik Gordon, associate dean and head of biomedical industry programs at Stevens Institute of Technology. Johnson &amp; Johnson this summer introduced a collagen-based skin filler called Evolence. Some products made by Ethicon are being used in plastic surgery, including sutures, mesh implants for facelifts, and harmonic scalpels, said Bill Price, a spokesman for the company. The deal is expected to reduce Johnson &amp; Johnson’s 2009 earnings by 3 to 5 cents a share and is scheduled to close during the first quarter. Mentor’s chief executive, Joshua H. Levine, will stay on as a member of Ethicon’s global management board, Mr. Price said. Significant layoffs are not expected. Mentor’s main competitor in the breast implant market is Allergan, the maker of Botox. Mentor is developing its own anti-wrinkle injection and dermal fillers to compete. On Nov. 24, Johnson &amp; Johnson bought Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, a biotech company, for $438 million. The deal is expected to close this month. Mr. Gordon said he expected more acquisitions  by J.&amp; J. and by pharmaceutical companies that have too weak a pipeline to support their overhead and need to either acquire products or merge with another large company and slash costs. Over all, portions of the health care sector with cash-heavy balance sheets, like big drug makers, have been more open to acquisitions during the current recession.

Dr. Biederman’s work helped to fuel a fortyfold increase from 1994 to 2003 in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder and a rapid rise in the use of powerful, risky and expensive antipsychotic medicines in children. Although many of his studies are small and often financed by drug makers, Dr. Biederman has had a vast influence on the field largely because of his position at one of the most prestigious medical institutions. Massachusetts General said in a statement Monday that it took the accusations related to the research center “very seriously” and intended “to investigate these issues thoroughly.” Johnson &amp; Johnson makes a popular antipsychotic medicine called Risperdal, or risperidone. More than a quarter of its use is in children and adolescents. Last week, a panel of federal drug experts said that medicines like Risperdal were being used too cavalierly in children and that regulators must do more to warn doctors of their substantial risks. Other popular antipsychotic medicines, also referred to as neuroleptics, are Zyprexa, made by Eli Lilly; Seroquel, made by AstraZeneca; Geodon, made by Pfizer; and Abilify, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Thousands of parents have sued AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson, claiming that their children were injured after taking the medicines; they also claim that the companies minimized the risks of the drugs. As part of the lawsuits, plaintiffs’ lawyers have demanded millions of documents from the companies. Nearly all have been provided under judicial seals, but a select few that mentioned Dr. Biederman became public after plaintiffs’ lawyers sought a judge’s order to require Dr. Biederman to be interviewed by them under oath. In a motion filed two weeks ago, lawyers for the families argued that they should be allowed to interview Dr. Biederman under oath because his work had been crucial to the widespread acceptance of pediatric uses of antipsychotic medicines. To support this contention, the lawyers included more than two dozen documents, among them e-mail messages from Johnson &amp; Johnson that mentioned Dr. Biederman. A judge has yet to rule on the request. The documents offer an unusual glimpse into the delicate relationship that drug makers have with influential doctors. In a November 1999 e-mail message, John Bruins, a Johnson &amp; Johnson marketing executive, begs his supervisors to approve a $3,000 check to Dr. Biederman as payment for a lecture he gave at the University of Connecticut. “Dr. Biederman is not someone to jerk around,” Mr. Bruins wrote. “He is a very proud national figure in child psych and has a very short fuse.” Mr. Bruins wrote that Dr. Biederman was furious after Johnson &amp; Johnson rejected a request that Dr. Biederman had made for a $280,000 research grant. “I have never seen someone so angry,” Mr. Bruins wrote. “Since that time, our business became non-existant (sic) within his area of control.” Mr. Bruins concluded that unless Dr. Biederman received a check soon, “I am truly afraid of the consequences.” A series of documents described the goals behind establishing the Johnson &amp; Johnson Center for the study of pediatric psychopathology, where Dr. Biederman serves as chief. A 2002 annual report for the center said its research must satisfy three criteria: improve psychiatric care for children, have high standards and “move forward the commercial goals of J.&amp; J.,” court documents said. “We strongly believe,” the report stated, “that the center’s systematic scientific inquiry will enhance the clinical and research foundation of child psychiatry and lead to the safer, more appropriate and more widespread use of medications in children. “Without such data, many clinicians question the wisdom of aggressively treating children with medications, especially those like neuroleptics, which expose children to potentially serious adverse events.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Health » A version of this article appeared in print on November 25, 2008, on page A22 of the New York edition.When a Congressional investigation revealed in June that Dr. Joseph Biederman, a world-renowned child psychiatrist, had earned far more money from drug makers than he had reported to his university, he said that his interests were “solely in the advancement of medical treatment through rigorous and objective study.” Skip to next paragraph Massachusetts General Hospital Court documents reveal that Dr. Joseph Biederman, a renowned child psychiatrist, pushed Johnson &amp; Johnson to fund a research center whose goal was to move forward the commercial goals of J&amp;J. But e-mail messages and internal documents from Johnson &amp; Johnson made public in a court filing reveal that Dr. Biederman pushed the company to finance a research center at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, with a goal to “move forward the commercial goals of J.&amp; J.” The documents also show that the company prepared a draft summary of a study that Dr. Biederman, of Harvard, was said to have written. Dr. Biederman’s work helped to fuel a fortyfold increase from 1994 to 2003 in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder and a rapid rise in the use of powerful, risky and expensive antipsychotic medicines in children. Although many of his studies are small and often financed by drug makers, Dr. Biederman has had a vast influence on the field largely because of his position at one of the most prestigious medical institutions. Massachusetts General said in a statement Monday that it took the accusations related to the research center “very seriously” and intended “to investigate these issues thoroughly.” Johnson &amp; Johnson makes a popular antipsychotic medicine called Risperdal, or risperidone. More than a quarter of its use is in children and adolescents. Last week, a panel of federal drug experts said that medicines like Risperdal were being used too cavalierly in children and that regulators must do more to warn doctors of their substantial risks. Other popular antipsychotic medicines, also referred to as neuroleptics, are Zyprexa, made by Eli Lilly; Seroquel, made by AstraZeneca; Geodon, made by Pfizer; and Abilify, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Thousands of parents have sued AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly and Johnson &amp; Johnson, claiming that their children were injured after taking the medicines; they also claim that the companies minimized the risks of the drugs. As part of the lawsuits, plaintiffs’ lawyers have demanded millions of documents from the companies. Nearly all have been provided under judicial seals, but a select few that mentioned Dr. Biederman became public after plaintiffs’ lawyers sought a judge’s order to require Dr. Biederman to be interviewed by them under oath. In a motion filed two weeks ago, lawyers for the families argued that they should be allowed to interview Dr. Biederman under oath because his work had been crucial to the widespread acceptance of pediatric uses of antipsychotic medicines. To support this contention, the lawyers included more than two dozen documents, among them e-mail messages from Johnson &amp; Johnson that mentioned Dr. Biederman. A judge has yet to rule on the request. The documents offer an unusual glimpse into the delicate relationship that drug makers have with influential doctors. In a November 1999 e-mail message, John Bruins, a Johnson &amp; Johnson marketing executive, begs his supervisors to approve a $3,000 check to Dr. Biederman as payment for a lecture he gave at the University of Connecticut. “Dr. Biederman is not someone to jerk around,” Mr. Bruins wrote. “He is a very proud national figure in child psych and has a very short fuse.” Mr. Bruins wrote that Dr. Biederman was furious after Johnson &amp; Johnson rejected a request that Dr. Biederman had made for a $280,000 research grant. “I have never seen someone so angry,” Mr. Bruins wrote. “Since that time, our business became non-existant (sic) within his area of control.” Mr. Bruins concluded that unless Dr. Biederman received a check soon, “I am truly afraid of the consequences.” A series of documents described the goals behind establishing the Johnson &amp; Johnson Center for the study of pediatric psychopathology, where Dr. Biederman serves as chief.

Janice DiCosolo, 38, died in February 2004 because the patch she was wearing delivered a fatal dose of the narcotic fentanyl, the main ingredient in the Duragesic patch, a jury said. The patch is made by Alza Corporation, a company based in Mountain View, Calif., owned by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The product was distributed by another unit of the company, Janssen Pharmaceutica. The patches generated $1.16 billion in sales last year. “We sympathize with the DiCosolo family over their loss,” Greg Panico, a spokesman for Alza and Janssen, said in an e-mail message. “However, we disagree with the jury’s verdict. We are considering our options for an appeal.” Last month, a jury in Sanford, Fla., awarded more than $13 million to the family of Susan Hodgemire, who died after using a Duragesic patch in 2002. The companies have faced several other lawsuits related to the patch. Janssen recalled one lot of the patches because of improper sealing a day after Ms. DiCosolo died, David Sudzuss, a defense lawyer, wrote in a court filing.

The two lawmakers, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter asking the nonprofit group that sponsors the conference, the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, for information about its financial relationships with device manufacturers and drug producers. The senators also sent a letter to Columbia University, which has an affiliation with the Cardiovascular Research Foundation. Two well-known researchers at Columbia, Dr. Martin B. Leon and Dr. Gregg W. Stone, are involved with the foundation; Dr. Leon is its former chairman and Dr. Stone its current one. In a statement, the foundation said it would ''comply fully'' with the information request. ''C.R.F. is committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in all of its research and educational activities and ensuring independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in all of its programs,'' the statement said. According to the foundation's most recent tax filing on the Web site guidestar.org, it had revenue in 2005 of $47.2 million. Columbia University Medical Center issued a statement saying it would respond to the request for information. ''It is important to note that Columbia University and its Medical Center have conflict of interest policies and procedures in place, and we expect that they are followed by all members of the faculty,'' the statement said. The manufacturers cited in the senators' letters are Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Medinol. The annual conference here, known as Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, has attracted hundreds of doctors from around the world who specialize in using devices that are placed in the body through catheters, most notably heart stents, the tiny devices that are used to prop open clogged arteries. At the meeting, manufacturers of stents and related surgical products or drugs display their products in an exhibition hall. The letters sent Thursday are part of a recent wave of inquiries by Senators Grassley and Kohl into potential conflicts of interests between medical researchers and drug and device companies. The lawmakers are also among those sponsoring legislation that would require the industry to more fully disclose such financial ties. In their letter to the foundation, the lawmakers also took note of a comment in an article published last November in The New York Times. In the article, a researcher, Dr. Jeffrey W. Moses, who serves on the board of the Cardiovascular Research Foundation, said that the safety of heart stents ''is not the big issue any more.'' The senators wrote: ''As you are no doubt aware, there are divergent scientific opinions concerning such products, the safety and efficacy of which are a matter of dispute among cardiologists.'' The letter to the Cardiovascular Research Foundation asked the group to disclose all financing it had received since 2003 from the five device manufacturers named in the letter and also to provide documentation of any payments and benefits the foundation had provided to 22 researchers including Dr. Stone, Dr. Leon and Dr. Moses. The lawmakers asked Columbia to provide information about the disclosures those researchers had made to the institution about their income from industry sources. At the same conference on Thursday, researchers released results of a new study indicating that a drug-coated stent called Endeavor, made by Medtronic, was linked to more heart attacks and deadly blood clots than the Cypher stent made by Johnson &amp; Johnson.</text></article><article index="5" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/business/17stent.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Medtronic Shares Fall on Questions About Stent<date>Published: October 16, 2008</date><text>Shares of the medical device maker Medtronic fell Thursday after a study showed that its new drug-coated stent was associated with more heart attacks and blood clots than a rival stent made by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » Results from the study, which included more than 2,000 patients, showed that heart patients who received the Medtronic device, called Endeavor, had more heart attacks and blood clots and needed repeat procedures more often than those treated with the Johnson &amp; Johnson stent, known as Cypher. There was no difference in death rates, however, according to the study, called Sort Out III  which was sponsored by Johnson &amp; Johnson and presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting in Washington. A Medtronic spokesman, Joe McGrath, said the study was at odds with every other study that has been done. “The data are also short-term,” he said in a statement. “At nine months, it’s premature to draw any meaningful conclusions about a difference between Cypher and Endeavor.” “Sort Out III at nine months has no bearing on what matters most to patients with coronary artery disease  long-term freedom from adverse events and long-term freedom from repeat procedures,” he added. In a statement, Dr. Campbell Rogers, chief scientific officer at Johnson &amp; Johnson’s cardiovascular unit, the Cordis Corporation, said, “The breadth of clinical safety and efficacy data and the long-term patient outcomes associated with the Cypher stent are completely unmatched by the competition, and this gap continues to widen.” A Leerink Swann analyst, Rick Wise, said he thought the market had overreacted to the data. He noted that the study did not directly compare the two devices and that the registries raised questions about, among other things, patient complexity and optimal use of anticlotting drugs, both of which are crucial variables in driving adverse events. David Lewis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, characterized the results as a “modest negative” for Medtronic, which already is struggling to defend its market share. Drug-coated stents are tiny wire-mesh tubular devices that are implanted in diseased vessels to prop them open. The drug coating aims at keeping vessels from reclogging. Medtronic shares closed were off about 2 percent, to close at $40.01. .

Because the large medical products company is more broadly diversified than many other drug and medical device makers, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s report is not necessarily considered a bellwether for the entire health care industry. Hospitals, for example, tend to be retrenching, squeezed by the credit crisis and concerns about patients’ ability to pay their bills. But health care products, like the artificial joints made by Johnson &amp; Johnson’s DePuy division, may be less subject to the economic winds buffeting most sectors of the economy. “Everything we’ve seen so far has shown that health care has been pretty defensive and volumes have not been affected by the downturn in the economy,” said David H. Roman, a medical devices analyst for Morgan Stanley. For example, up to 70 percent of hip and knee replacements, a large part of the medical device industry, are performed on Medicare beneficiaries  a group whose insurance coverage is guaranteed and who would be unlikely to delay surgery because of the economy. And, as Mr. Roman said, Medicare beneficiaries are growing in numbers. Another medical products company, Abbott, is set to announce its earnings Wednesday morning. Many analysts predict those numbers will also be strong, largely because of the company’s Xience drug-coated heart stent, a device that has become popular among interventional cardiologists, Mr. Roman said. Xience’s success is coming in part at the expense of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Cypher stent, which is one of the rare devices in the company’s portfolio that did not show solid growth. In Johnson &amp; Johnson’s earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, Dominic Caruso, the chief financial officer, said that the company’s access to commercial paper had been unfettered and available at what he called “very, very good” rates. That could bode well for other health products company. “That’s important,” said Ronny Gal, a pharmaceuticals analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. “The markets are not frozen for health care companies.” Mr. Gal said the news could mean that Teva, the Israeli maker of generic drugs, would have no problem completing its pending $7.5 billion acquisition of Barr Laboratories, another generic maker. To finance that deal, Teva plans to raise more than $2 billion, Mr. Gal said. Johnson &amp; Johnson announced sales of $15.9 billion for the third quarter, up 6.4 percent from a year earlier. Excluding special charges, the company said it earned $1.17 a share in the third quarter, versus 88 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had been expecting earnings of $1.11 a share. Excluding special charges, the company’s net earnings for the quarter increased 7.6 percent compared with last year’s period. Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., also raised its guidance for the year.. The company increased its earnings guidance for full-year 2008 to $4.50 to $4.53 a share. Its previous forecast had ranged from $4.45 to $4.50 a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday, closing at $64. The company said its results improved despite generic competition to its Duragesic painkiller patch and its schizophrenia medication Risperdal, as well as sales declines in Europe for its injectable anemia medication Epogen. The company’s acquisition in December 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer products division  which included the Listerine line of products  seems to be a successful move, with the company citing strength in that part of its business. Among strong sellers for Johnson &amp; Johnson during the quarter was Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy treatment that the company introduced this year. Zyrtec was part of the Pfizer consumer products acquisition. Also in that acquisition was Listerine mouthwash, another strong seller. Consumer products generally are steadier and less risky than pharmaceuticals, with lower research and development costs, fewer regulatory demands, lower litigation costs and less impact from generic competition. Eli Lilly , for example, recently announced it would pay $70 a share, or $6.5 billion, for Imclone, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux. The price was considered high, but the move was thought to be critical to Lilly, which faces the loss of patent exclusivity on its best-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug in 2011. Lilly “is between a rock and a hard place from the standpoint that it desperately needs to get new product into its portfolio,” Dr. Timothy Anderson, another pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, in a note to clients. Lilly reports its earnings on Oct. 23.

The company said it earned $3.31 billion, or $1.17 a share in the third quarter, compared with $2.55 billion, or 88 cents a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had been expecting earnings of $1.11 a share. Excluding special charges, the company’s net earnings for the quarter increased 7.6 percent compared with last year’s period. Johnson &amp; Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., also raised its guidance for the year.. The company increased its earnings guidance for full-year 2008 to $4.50 to $4.53 a share. Its previous forecast ranged from $4.45 to $4.50 a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s shares were up more than 2 percent Tuesday, closing at $64. The company said its results improved despite generic competition to its Duragesic painkiller patch and its schizophrenia medication Risperdal, as well as sales declines in Europe for its injectable anemia medication Epogen. The company’s acquisition in December 2006 of Pfizer’s consumer products division  which included the Listerine line of products  seems to be a successful move, with the company citing strength in that part of its business. Among strong sellers for Johnson &amp; Johnson during the quarter was Zyrtec, an over-the-counter allergy treatment that the company introduced this year. Zyrtec was part of the Pfizer consumer products acquisition. Also in that acquisition was Listerine mouthwash, another strong seller. Consumer products generally are steadier and less risky than pharmaceuticals, with lower research and development costs, fewer regulatory demands, lower litigation costs and less impact from generic competition. Eli Lilly, for example, recently announced it would pay $70 a share, or $6.5 billion, for ImClone Systems, the maker of the cancer drug Erbitux. The price was considered high, but the move was thought to be critical to Lilly, which faces the loss of patent exclusivity on its best-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia drug in 2011. Lilly “is between a rock and a hard place from the standpoint that it desperately needs to get new product into its portfolio,” Dr. Timothy Anderson, another pharmaceutical analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients. Lilly reports its earnings on Oct. 23.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/14/us/politics/14money.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Drug Industry, Having Long Smiled on G.O.P., Now Splits Donations Equally<date>Published: October 13, 2008</date><text>WASHINGTON  After favoring Republicans by a ratio of more than two to one for most of the last decade, pharmaceutical companies and others in the health care industry are now splitting their contributions evenly between the two major parties, campaign finance reports show. Skip to next paragraph Multimedia Graphic Even Footing Related Health Sector Puts Its Money on Democrats (October 29, 2007) Blog The Caucus The latest political news from around the nation. Join the discussion. Election Guide | More Politics News Lobbyists and executives in the industry say the swing reflects the fact that Democrats control both houses of Congress, are expected to increase their majorities and may win the White House, giving them a dominant voice on health policy. “There’s a new world order,” Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said when asked why Democrats were getting more of the industry’s money. The figures illustrate the maxim that money follows power, all the more so since public programs account for a growing share of spending on prescription drugs: 34 percent in 2006, up from 23 percent in 2000. So the companies’ fortunes depend more than ever on government decisions, and leading Democrats have offered proposals that would further expand the role of the public sector in financing and delivering health care. The industry has shown strong Republican leanings in the past. While Democrats in Congress have severely criticized drug makers and health insurance companies, Republicans have worked closely with them on many issues, fending off countless proposals for stricter regulation. But a new trend in campaign contributions emerges from data reported by Pfizer, Amgen, Johnson &amp; Johnson, other companies and their trade associations. In the 2008 election cycle, pharmaceutical companies  their employees and political action committees  have donated $20 million to federal candidates and the parties, with 49 percent going to Democrats and 51 percent to Republicans, according to the data, compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign finance. Not since 1990 has the split been so nearly even. By contrast, Democrats got just 31 percent of the industry’s donations in 2000 and 2006, 26 percent in 2002 and 34 percent in 2004. Contributions by the American Medical Association show a similar pattern. Democrats have received 52 percent of the $882,000 in contributions reported by its political action committee in the current election cycle. In prior elections, the doctors’ group favored Republicans, giving them 61 percent of its donations in 2002, 80 percent in 2004 and 70 percent in 2006. Fred P. DuVal, treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association, said: “Parity between the parties is now the operating principle for many corporate political action committees in the health care industry. That’s a sea change.” Mr. DuVal is a government relations consultant whose clients include Pfizer and Aetna. The leading campaign contributors in the pharmaceutical industry in 2007-8, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, have been Pfizer, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. All three heavily favored Republicans in the last four election cycles, but the proportion of money going to Democrats now approaches or exceeds 50 percent at each company. “People in the pharmaceutical industry have not suddenly changed their spots,” said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. “They understand who will be writing legislation in the next few years. They want to be at the table.” The trend is well illustrated by the shift at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug maker. The company’s employees and its political action committee made 85 percent of their contributions to Republicans in 2000. Republicans got 81 percent in 2002, 69 percent in 2004 and 67 percent in 2006. But Democrats have received 51 percent of the $1.2 million in contributions reported in the current election cycle. On its Web site, Pfizer now boasts that its political action committee supports equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. At Johnson &amp; Johnson, Republicans received 70 percent of the contributions in 2000, 61 percent in 2002, 63 percent in 2004 and 61 percent in 2006. But in the current campaign, Democrats have received 59 percent of the $964,000 in donations reported by Johnson &amp; Johnson employees and the company’s political action committee. One other factor that may have chilled enthusiasm for giving to Republicans is that the party’s presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, has not taken a typically Republican stance toward the industry. Mr. McCain has supported legislation to let the government negotiate directly with drug companies to obtain lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries, a position that is anathema to the industry. He wants to allow imports of prescription drugs from Canada and some other countries. He has defied makers of brand-name drugs by pushing legislation to speed the approval of lower-cost generic drugs. And he championed legislation to codify patients’ rights, a bill strenuously opposed by insurers and President Bush. In a recent television advertisement, the McCain campaign boasts that “he took on the drug industry.” At a Republican presidential debate in January, after Mr. McCain criticized drug companies, one of his rivals, Mitt Romney, told him, “Don’t turn the pharmaceutical companies into the big bad guys.” Mr. McCain shot back, “Well, they are.” 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in US » A version of this article appeared in print on October 14, 2008, on page A18 of the New York edition.WASHINGTON  After favoring Republicans by a ratio of more than two to one for most of the last decade, pharmaceutical companies and others in the health care industry are now splitting their contributions evenly between the two major parties, campaign finance reports show.

Reviewing Deaths In Anemia Drug Study<date>Published: September 27, 2008</date><text>Federal health officials said Friday that they were reviewing a higher rate of deaths among patients treated with a Johnson &amp; Johnson anemia drug in a German study of stroke patients. Sixteen percent of patients who were treated with the drug, Eprex, had died three months after the study began, compared with 9 percent who were given a placebo, the Food and Drug Administration said in a statement. The study was testing whether Eprex could improve brain function in stroke patients, an unapproved use of the drug. The 522 patients were given relatively high doses of Eprex for three days or a placebo. Most were not anemic, the drug agency said. Eprex is known generically as epoetin alfa. Johnson &amp; Johnson also sells epoetin alfa under the name Procrit. Amgen sells a version under the name Epogen. The blockbuster drugs are part of a class called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or ESAs, which are approved for treating patients with kidney disease and cancer. The safety of ESAs came under scrutiny in recent years after other studies found tumor growth or shorter survival for some patients given high doses. The drug agency ordered strong new warnings on the medicines in July. The agency said Friday that it was aware of other trials testing the potential neurological effects of epoetin alfa. The higher death rate in the German study ''suggests the need to closely monitor patients enrolled in other ongoing trials for adverse outcomes and to evaluate whether the potential benefits for enrolled patients outweigh the risks in these trials,'' the agency said. Johnson &amp; Johnson reported last week that early data showed Eprex patients in the German study died more frequently than placebo patients, and said it was doing additional analyses to better understand the findings. The company alerted the drug agency to the findings, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman, Mark Wolfe, said Friday. The study was initiated by the researcher, Mr. Wolfe said. Johnson &amp; Johnson provided financing and supplies of the drug but was not involved in the trial's design or conduct, he said.</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/business/17device.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Consumer Ads for Medical Devices Subject of Senate Panel<date>Published: September 16, 2008</date><text>As makers of medical devices like artificial knees and heart stents increasingly pitch their products directly to consumers, some lawmakers, medical groups and others are calling for restrictions on such advertisements, claiming they mislead patients. Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Stryker Corp Zimmer Holdings Incorporated Medtronic Inc Go to your Portfolio » The amount of medical device advertising directed to consumers on television or over the Internet  an estimated $193 million last year  represents just a small fraction of the volume of consumer advertising for prescription drugs, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a consulting firm. But some experts maintain that the advertising of a medical device can have more of an impact on a patient’s well-being than a drug, because devices often require surgery to implant and may remain inside the body for years. “The results are irreversible because you are kind of stuck with a device,” said Dr. Kevin J. Bozic, a professor of orthopedics at the University of California, San Francisco. On Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging plans to hold a hearing about direct-to-consumer promotions of medical devices. Dr. Bozic, who was an author of a recent medical journal article critical of consumer advertising, is among those scheduled to testify. In a statement, the committee’s chairman, Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he was holding the hearing because he thought that the Food and Drug Administration might have to increase its scrutiny of medical device promotions, much as it had done for pharmaceutical advertisements. “The medical device industry is just beginning to get into the game,” Mr. Kohl said. David Nexon, a senior official at the Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group in Washington that represents medical device makers, said the organization thought that current F.D.A. rules governing direct-to-consumer advertising were adequate. He added that while an advertisement might stimulate a patient to ask a doctor about a device, the process of receiving one involves a discussion of its benefits and risks. “You may take a pill because it doesn’t involve very much,” Mr. Nexon said. “But you don’t undergo surgery unless you think you have a serious need for it.” In 2007, spending by medical device makers on direct-to-consumer advertising was nearly double the amount in 2005, according to data provided to the Congressional Research Service by TNS. Over the last three years, a variety of device makers have started ad campaigns. Stryker, for instance, has run ads for a ceramic replacement hip, a device that some patients have since complained squeaks loudly enough to be heard while they walk. Another orthopedics maker, Zimmer Holdings, has advertised a replacement knee created for women, and Medtronic, a maker of heart devices, has run consumer promotions about heart defibrillators. At the hearing on Wednesday, an official of Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, is expected to testify that current rules requiring consumer drug advertisements to provide balance between a medication’s benefits and risks should be extended to cover medical devices.

Skip to next paragraph Add to Portfolio Coca-Cola Co Go to your Portfolio » The Olympics are not just moneymakers for the current athletes, but for former ones as well. Even for the alumni, the ability to cash in on one’s former fame peaks every four years, because corporate sponsors prefer to work with athletes when their signature sports are in the news. “My husband and I plan everything around the Olympics,” said Ms. Evans, who earned gold medals at the 1988 and 1992 Games. She is working with Speedo, the Canola Council (a trade group for canola growers), Johnson &amp; Johnson and John Hancock. “We planned our wedding around the ’04 Olympics; we planned our little girl being born at the end of ’06, when ’07 wasn’t as busy,” Ms. Evans added. “My husband teases me, we plan in quadrenniums,” she said, using the International Olympic Committee’s term for four-year periods. For the companies, the endorsements offer an instant way to evoke nostalgia, whether it is among baby boomers who remember watching Ms. Comaneci score her perfect 10, or among younger fans whose early Olympic memories are of Ms. Foudy’s days as one of the Fab Five of women’s soccer. Many retired Olympians make a living out of their former glory, giving motivational speeches and making appearances for corporations. As time passes, the less picky they can be about opportunities. “If it’s soon after their retirement, maybe they’re appealing to and familiar to a much broader audience,” said Peter Carlisle, managing director for Olympic and action sports at Octagon, a talent management agency. “You may be able to keep that going for a while, but it would generally probably diminish over time,” said Mr. Carlisle, whose clients include Michael Phelps. “As it diminishes, I think the opportunities are still there, but the market gets more and more restricted.” Often, the former athletes depend on Olympics meet-and-greets to attract new sponsors and earn a little cash. The one-time appearances can bring in thousands of dollars  and, more important, can lead to longer-term endorsements. For a retired Olympian, showing up at the current Games is “make-or-break if you want to do business with AT&amp;T, for example,” Mr. Carlisle said. “It’s a one-time thing that, if it goes well, will mean you’ll have repeat opportunities in the future.” Dominique Dawes, the three-time Olympic gymnast, has a busy schedule in Beijing. Her agenda includes a breakfast with Coca-Cola executives, with whom she will later watch the women’s gymnastics finals. She will do commentary for Yahoo Sports and represent a Johnson &amp; Johnson campaign that enrolls former Olympians as inspirational speakers. In an interview, Ms. Dawes said that most Olympians do not go on to become professional athletes, which means that “the majority are not going to get multimillion-dollar endorsements.” “My goal is to work with a number of sponsors, not just at the Olympic Games, but more importantly, even afterwards,” Ms. Dawes said. While she makes some money from speeches and motivational CDs, her goals include opening a gymnastics camp and clinic, “and to get those things off the ground, it’s important to get sponsorship,” she said. The corporations that spend millions to sponsor the Olympics hold plenty of events during the Games for their clients and employees, and the presence of former Olympians adds some glitter. “They seem to resonate because they let us almost escape to what we believe to have been a better time in sports,” said David M. Carter, executive director of the University of Southern California’s Sports Business Institute. For the athletes, these appearances are a good way to make thousands for a few hours’ work. Ms. Evans, for example, gets $5,000 to $15,000 for an appearance, according to her agent, Evan Morgenstein of the Premier Management Group, while the swimmer Rowdy Gaines fetches just under $10,000. A variety of product endorsements is on display at this year’s Olympics, but the one that has raised the most eyebrows is Botox (eyebrows, that is, that have not been injected with the drug). Ms. Comaneci, who represents Botox, said she understood the controversy, but was brushing it aside. “Why shouldn’t it be available for athletes?” she said. “We are human beings, and then we grow up and we age like anybody else.” Crystal Cienfuegos, a spokeswoman for Allergan, which markets Botox, said that Mr. Spitz, who is 58, and Ms. Comaneci, who is 46, “appeal to our target demographic.” Mr. Morgenstein of Premier Management, who arranged Mr. Spitz’s work for Botox, said he was not concerned about negative implications. His client, he said, “had the opportunity to use their product successfully.” “By the end of the year, Spitz is going to make seven figures,” Mr. Morgenstein said. That is impressive, he added, considering “your best day at work was 36 years ago.” This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Correction: August 14, 2008 The Advertising column on Tuesday, about former Olympians who parlayed their athletic success into marketing work, misstated the name of the university that founded the Sports Business Institute, whose executive director commented on the durable popularity of Olympic stars.

The move, which the F.D.A. announced on Wednesday, represents the first time the agency has invoked authority under a 2007 law that empowered it to order changes in a drug's prescribing information. Previously, the F.D.A. could only negotiate with a drug's manufacturer to change the label. Sales of the drugs, Aranesp and Procrit, have already plummeted in the last year because of studies suggesting that their use to treat the anemia caused by chemotherapy could actually make cancer worse or shorten lives. Procrit is manufactured by Amgen but sold under license by Johnson &amp; Johnson. Sales of Aranesp, generally considered Amgen's flagship product, fell 13 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $825 million, the company announced Monday in posting its quarterly results. In the United States alone, sales plunged 26 percent, to $427 million. Yaron Werber, a biotechnology analyst at Citi Investment Research, estimated that the new label could reduce the use of Aranesp for cancer patients in this country -- the drug is also used by people with kidney disease -- by an additional 40 percent, further cutting annual sales by about $264 million. Despite the concerns about the drug, sales of Aranesp and Amgen's overall financial results were better than Wall Street expected in the second quarter. That, plus the positive result of a clinical trial for a new bone drug, lifted Amgen shares this week. Shares of Amgen rose 2 cents, to $62.30 Wednesday, near their 52-week high. Amgen said in a statement Wednesday that the new label was consistent with its expectations and that it had already factored the impact of the label change into updated financial guidance it provided to investors on Monday. Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would cooperate with the F.D.A. in using the new label. Its sales of Procrit and a similar drug, Eprex, dropped 14 percent worldwide in the second quarter, to $652 million, and fell 23 percent in the United States to $346 million. Because the company is larger and more diversified than Amgen, the sales of any one drug tend not to have as large an impact on its financial performance. The new labels will say that treatment with the drugs should not begin until a patient's hemoglobin drops to 10 grams per deciliter of blood. And language is being removed that seemed to imply that it was safe to continue treating patients until their hemoglobin rose to 12 grams per deciliter. Hemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying component of blood and is at low levels in people with anemia, causing problems like fatigue. There are no accepted theories yet on why high doses of the anemia drugs seem to make cancer worse. The new labels also say the drugs should not be used if the chemotherapy is being given to cure patients, rather than to extend their lives. While that would be left to a doctor to judge, it would very likely apply, for instance, to so-called adjuvant therapy, in which chemotherapy is used after a tumor is removed by surgery in hopes of preventing cancer from coming back. When cancer is advanced, chemotherapy is often not considered curative. However, the new labels will not advise against use of the drugs for all patients with breast cancer or head and neck cancer. An advisory panel to the F.D.A. in March had called for such an advisory, because the drugs' risks seemed to be stronger for those two types of cancer. One effect of the label changes could be to make it less likely that Medicare would loosen reimbursement policies for the drugs. Amgen and many oncologists have been trying to get Medicare to amend a policy in which it will not pay for use of the drugs if hemoglobin is above 10. In their arguments, the company and doctors pointed to the drugs' labels, which seemed to suggest that the F.D.A. thought that a hemoglobin level of up to 12 was safe. But now the F.D.A. has also adopted the 10 gram level for initiating cancer therapy, and mention of 12 grams has been removed from the label. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the F.D.A.'s oncology drug office, said that the mention of the level of 12 was confusing people, making them think hemoglobins up to 12 were safe when, in fact, the safety is unknown. ''We felt people interpreted this as an upper safety limit,'' he said in an interview Wednesday. He said a hemoglobin level of 8 to 9, just high enough to avoid blood transfusions, was appropriate, though the new labels do not state a specific figure. The labels for the drugs have already been changed a few times since new safety concerns arose early last year. The F.D.A. and Amgen have been negotiating the latest changes since the advisory committee in March recommended further restrictions on use of the drugs. While the company and the agency agreed on most language, there were some points on which they could not reach agreement, Dr. Pazdur said. That prompted the F.D.A. to invoke its new authority to order the changes, he said. Amgen had wanted the label to give doctors discretion to initiate therapy before hemoglobin levels dropped to 10 in patients who could not tolerate that degree of anemia. And it wanted mention of the 12 gram upper limit for stopping therapy.</text></article><article index="4" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/business/16johnson.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Johnson &amp; Johnson Net Rises 8%<date>Published: July 16, 2008</date><text>The health care giant Johnson &amp; Johnson beat Wall Street expectations on Tuesday with an 8 percent jump in second-quarter profit.

The two sides announced the settlement a month after Judge Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court in Manhattan threw out much of J.&amp; J.’s trademark claim against the relief organization. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but according to a statement, it includes an agreement that both parties will continue to use the symbol  a Greek red cross on a white background. Johnson &amp; Johnson sued the Red Cross last August, claiming that the organization’s decision to use the Red Cross symbol on products sold in stores was a violation of a longstanding arrangement. Under that arrangement, the company had used the trademark commercially on products like Band-Aids while the Red Cross used it as a symbol of its disaster relief mission.

Reviews Arthritis Drugs for Links to Cancer<date>Published: June 5, 2008</date><text>CORRECTION APPENDED The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that it was investigating whether four drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system diseases might increase the risk of cancer in children. The F.D.A. said that it had received reports of 30 cases of cancer over 10 years among children and young adults treated with those drugs, which are sold by Amgen, Abbott Laboratories and other companies. But the agency did not make clear how many children had taken the drugs or whether the cancer incidence among them was higher than would be expected. And it said that for now, it believed that the potential benefits of the medicines outweighed the potential risks ''in certain children and young adults.'' The drugs involved are Enbrel, sold by Amgen and Wyeth; Remicade, sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson and, in Europe, by Schering-Plough; Humira, sold by Abbott Laboratories; and Cimzia, which won approval in April and is sold by UBC, a Belgian company. All the drugs try to damp inflammation by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor, and they are used to treat various immune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, which is an inflammation of the bowel. The TNF-blockers, as they are known, represent one of the most successful classes of drugs ever developed using biotechnology. Remicade, Humira and Enbrel had combined sales of more than $13 billion last year. But use in children constitutes a small part of the total. Dr. Michael Severino, an Amgen executive, said about a half-million patients had been treated with Enbrel since its approval about a decade ago, of which only 12,000 were children. Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's disease in children. Enbrel and Humira are approved to treat juvenile idiopathic arthritis, once known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. In fact the label on Enbrel was changed in March to allow use in children as young as 2, from a previous suggested lower age of 4. Amgen is now seeking approval of Enbrel to treat psoriasis in children, an issue that will be discussed by an advisory panel to the F.D.A. on June 18. Since the drugs block part of the immune system, it has always been known that they might contribute to higher risk of cancers and also infections. The labels for the drugs all contain warnings to that effect -- particularly about the risk of lymphomas, which are cancers of immune system cells. About half the cancers reported in the children getting the drugs were lymphomas, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the F.D.A. said. A study that pooled data from randomized clinical trials, found that adults given Humira or Remicade to treat rheumatoid arthritis had 2.4 times the cancer rate of those in the control groups. ''It's clearly something we have to be concerned about and discuss with our patients,'' said Dr. Eric L. Matteson, chairman of rheumatology at the Mayo Clinic and an author of the study, which was published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Matteson has been a consultant to many of the companies developing such drugs. Dr. Edward H. Giannini, professor of pediatric rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said that 70,000 to 100,000 children in the United States had juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and that the biotech drugs were ''unequaled'' in their ability to control the disease. ''This was a disease that put kids in wheelchairs,'' he said. Dr. Giannini, who received consulting fees from the companies for helping to devise their pediatric clinical trials, said that no cases of cancer were seen in the clinical trials that led to Enbrel's approval for pediatric use. And a subsequent registry that followed 600 children found no cases after more than 800 patient-years of exposure. Still, he said, ''We have to be careful with the safety aspects of giving immune response modifiers to very young children,'' whose immune systems might not be mature yet. Michael Parks, a spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company had already submitted data to the F.D.A. Most of the cancer cases associated with Remicade use were in children with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. And all but one of those children also received other immune-suppressing drugs with a known cancer risk, he said. Laureen Cassidy, a spokeswoman for Abbott, said there had been no instances of cancer in children given Humira in clinical trials or in postapproval safety studies. Humira was approved for pediatric use a few months ago. The F.D.A. announcement had little impact on the stocks of the companies involved.

This week the company lost the second round in its trademark dispute against the disaster relief agency when a federal judge in Manhattan threw out most of the case. In a decision late Wednesday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of United States District Court said the Congressional charter for the Red Cross gave it the right to use the symbol  a Greek red cross against a white background  even for business purposes. The company and the Red Cross had amicably shared use of the symbol for more than a century through an agreement signed in 1895. Johnson &amp; Johnson has also used the symbol on packaging for many of its consumer health products, like Band-Aids. But the Red Cross angered Johnson &amp; Johnson beginning in 2004 by licensing the symbol to other companies for use on commercial items sold in stores as part of the organization’s fund-raising program. The items included humidifiers, hand sanitizer gel, medical examination gloves, nail clippers, combs and toothbrushes. Some were part of first-aid kits sold at Target and by other retailers. Red Cross received part of the proceeds. Last August, the company said it had no recourse but to take the dispute to court. In his second ruling dismissing part of the case  the first one was in November  Judge Rakoff said that charitable reasons for Red Cross’s business ventures made them all the more reasonable. “The fact that the ultimate purpose of these licensing activities is a ‘charitable purpose’  i.e. to raise funds that A.R.C., a not-for-profit organization, can utilize for its charitable endeavors  only further emphasizes their legitimacy,” his decision said. Judge Rakoff said the doubtfulness of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s claim against the organization was “well illustrated by the ironic fact” that in 1986 the company itself entered into a similar promotional agreement with the Red Cross. At that time, the company agreed to donate 5 cents to the Red Cross for coupons redeemed to buy company products. The coupons said: “Help Johnson &amp; Johnson support the American Red Cross. For each purchase with the coupon below, Johnson &amp; Johnson will donate 5 cents to the American Red Cross.” While some claims in the case remain unresolved, including the accusation that the Red Cross purposely interfered with two of the company’s business partners, the Red Cross all but declared victory on Thursday. “We have been vindicated by the court on the major issues,” the organization’s acting chief executive, Mary S. Elcano, said. “We want them to get rid of this case. It’s been meritless from the very beginning.” Ms. Elcano also said the case had been a disruption requiring hearings and document requests that have disrupted the organization’s charitable activities since last August, when the lawsuit was filed. “That’s what we want to be about: to deliver the lifesaving services that the Red Cross provides,” she said. Marc Monseau, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokesman, said: “We are disappointed that the court rejected our claims involving A.R.C.’s commercial uses of the emblem.

Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image A Cordis Web site ad, which mimics language in the TV ad. Enlarge This Image An ad for the heart stent made by a Johnson &amp; Johnson unit. Enlarge This Image A journal article says ads ignore potential dangers to patients. The 60-second ad for the Cypher stent, made by the Cordis subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, failed to adequately warn consumers about the potential dangers of receiving a stent, according to the article published by The New England Journal of Medicine. Stents are metal mesh devices that are used to prop open arteries after they have been cleared of blockages. The ad uses the tag line “life wide open.” “We believe that the F.D.A. should perform a critical post-release review of the ‘Life Wide Open’ campaign to assess whether it meets the basic regulatory requirements for non-deceptive advertising,” the journal’s article said. It also questioned the validity of advertising such high-risk procedures directly to the public. Cordis defended the ad in a written statement, saying its content and message was reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration before it began running last Thanksgiving Day, starting with a National Football League game broadcast. “The goal of the ‘Life Wide Open’ campaign is to foster an informed, balanced conversation between patients and physicians about treatment options for coronary artery disease, which kills millions of Americans each year,” the statement said. A spokesman, Christopher Allman, said the television ad was no longer running nationally but was being broadcast in Baltimore. Mr. Allman would not explain why the ad was running in one local market. The journal article, by the cardiologists Dr. William E. Boden of the medical school at the State University of New York at Buffalo and Dr. George A. Diamond of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, comes as pressure mounts on the F.D.A. to limit consumer medical advertising or at least to increase oversight of it. The United States is one of the few industrialized countries that permit such advertising. On Friday, an F.D.A. advisory committee plans to discuss whether television ads for prescription drugs should include a statement encouraging consumers to report negative side effects to a toll-free number operated by the agency. That is currently required for print prescription drug ads. There is no such requirement for ads for medical devices, which are not as closely monitored as drug ads. The trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said on Tuesday that it had not taken a position on the proposal being discussed by the F.D.A. During a Congressional hearing last week on drug advertising, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, John D. Dingell, pressed several drug company representatives on whether they would support encouraging television viewers to call the 1-800 number to report adverse events. “They said they couldn’t tell us, so we’re communicating with the C.E.O.’s of the companies,” Mr. Dingell said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Mr. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said he supported the requirement. “But understand one thing,” he said. “It might not be enough.” He said the committee had found systemic violations of advertising requirements by drug companies. “Some ads appear to be misleading and others appear to be downright deceptive,” Mr. Dingell said. The chairman of the House subcommittee investigating drug advertising, Representative Bart Stupak, said that Congress should consider banning drug ads aimed directly at consumers. Although the F.D.A. currently does not scrutinize advertising for medical devices as closely as for prescription drugs, it does regulate ads for so-called high-risk medical devices, including stents. For several years the agency has been reviewing a set of guidelines proposed in 2004 for advertising medical devices. Karen Riley, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency would have no comment on the article’s call for a review of the Cypher stent advertising. The Cypher ad, which says that “when your arteries narrow, so does your life,” was the first to market a stent directly to consumers on television. Similar ad campaigns, however, have promoted hip and knee implants, include one featuring the golfer Jack Nicklaus, who underwent a hip replacement in 1999 using a device made by Stryker. In 2007 ad spending for medical devices was $200 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence, an advertising research firm. Dr. Boden, one author of the journal’s article, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that it was impossible to inform viewers adequately about the benefits and side effects of a stent operation in a 60-second spot. “This involves very sophisticated technology, totally in my view beyond what any sophisticated lay consumer could possibly learn from a 30- to 60-second television ad,” he said, pointing out that print ads require more detailed disclosure about risks. The ad gives the impression that the Cypher stent is going to improve life more than other brands would, Dr. Boden said. “It doesn’t say artery wide open,” he said “It says life wide open.” In the article, Dr. Boden and Dr. Diamond observe, “The notion that television viewers inspired by such an ad would go to their physicians and request not only a stent but a specific brand and model of stent is frightening, if not utterly absurd.” The ad mentions some adverse events that can occur after a stent implant, including heart attack and stroke. But the doctors’ critique said the ad failed to warn explicitly of the risk of some other serious complications, including a ruptured coronary artery. The ad referred patients to a Web site, but the authors said it also did not adequately address the full range of potential complications.

The ad uses the tag line “life wide open.” “We believe that the F.D.A. should perform a critical post-release review of the ‘Life Wide Open’ campaign to assess whether it meets the basic regulatory requirements for non-deceptive advertising,” the journal’s article said. It also questioned the validity of advertising such high-risk procedures directly to the public. Cordis defended the ad in a written statement, saying its content and message was reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration before it began running last Thanksgiving Day, starting with a National Football League game broadcast. “The goal of the ‘Life Wide Open’ campaign is to foster an informed, balanced conversation between patients and physicians about treatment options for coronary artery disease, which kills millions of Americans each year,” the statement said. A spokesman, Christopher Allman, said the television ad was no longer running nationally but was being broadcast in Baltimore. Mr. Allman would not explain why the ad was running in one local market. The journal article, by the cardiologists Dr. William E. Boden of the medical school at the State University of New York at Buffalo and Dr. George A. Diamond of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, comes as pressure mounts on the F.D.A. to limit consumer medical advertising or at least to increase oversight of it. The United States is one of the few industrialized countries that permit such advertising. On Friday, an F.D.A. advisory committee plans to discuss whether television ads for prescription drugs should include a statement encouraging consumers to report negative side effects to a toll-free number operated by the agency. That is currently required for print prescription drug ads. There is no such requirement for ads for medical devices, which are not as closely monitored as drug ads. The trade group representing pharmaceutical companies, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said on Tuesday that it had not taken a position on the proposal being discussed by the F.D.A. During a Congressional hearing last week on drug advertising, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, John D. Dingell, pressed several drug company representatives on whether they would support encouraging television viewers to call the 1-800 number to report adverse events. “They said they couldn’t tell us, so we’re communicating with the C.E.O.’s of the companies,” Mr. Dingell said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. Mr. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan, said he supported the requirement. “But understand one thing,” he said. “It might not be enough.” He said the committee had found systemic violations of advertising requirements by drug companies. “Some ads appear to be misleading and others appear to be downright deceptive,” Mr. Dingell said. The chairman of the House subcommittee investigating drug advertising, Representative Bart Stupak, said that Congress should consider banning drug ads aimed directly at consumers. Although the F.D.A. currently does not scrutinize advertising for medical devices as closely as for prescription drugs, it does regulate ads for so-called high-risk medical devices, including stents. For several years the agency has been reviewing a set of guidelines proposed in 2004 for advertising medical devices. Karen Riley, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency would have no comment on the article’s call for a review of the Cypher stent advertising. The Cypher ad, which says that “when your arteries narrow, so does your life,” was the first to market a stent directly to consumers on television. Similar ad campaigns, however, have promoted hip and knee implants, include one featuring the golfer Jack Nicklaus, who underwent a hip replacement in 1999 using a device made by Stryker. In 2007 ad spending for medical devices was $200 million, according to TNS Media Intelligence, an advertising research firm. Dr. Boden, one author of the journal’s article, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday that it was impossible to inform viewers adequately about the benefits and side effects of a stent operation in a 60-second spot. “This involves very sophisticated technology, totally in my view beyond what any sophisticated lay consumer could possibly learn from a 30- to 60-second television ad,” he said, pointing out that print ads require more detailed disclosure about risks. The ad gives the impression that the Cypher stent is going to improve life more than other brands would, Dr. Boden said. “It doesn’t say artery wide open,” he said “It says life wide open.” In the article, Dr. Boden and Dr. Diamond observe, “The notion that television viewers inspired by such an ad would go to their physicians and request not only a stent but a specific brand and model of stent is frightening, if not utterly absurd.” The ad mentions some adverse events that can occur after a stent implant, including heart attack and stroke. But the doctors’ critique said the ad failed to warn explicitly of the risk of some other serious complications, including a ruptured coronary artery. The ad referred patients to a Web site, but the authors said it also did not adequately address the full range of potential complications.</text></article><article index="9" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/25/business/25adco.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Companies Return Criticism From Darfur Group<date>Published: April 25, 2008</date><text>AFTER taking criticism from activist groups over the last few months, some Olympic sponsors are starting to criticize right back. Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image Adrian Bradshaw/European Pressphoto Agency A Coca-Cola stall in front of the National Stadium in Beijing. Dream for Darfur has criticized the beverage maker and others. On Thursday, Mia Farrow’s activist group, Dream for Darfur, issued a report card that roundly criticized most of the major Olympic sponsors. The group had been asking the sponsors for months to comply with requests both tame (meet with Mia Farrow) and more involved (contact the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee regarding Darfur). Even after 9 of the 19 sponsors it had singled out agreed to meet with Ms. Farrow, the group said it had seen little progress from the corporations. In the report card, it gave 16 of 19 sponsors a D or an F. The highest marks were earned by Adidas, McDonald’s and Eastman Kodak. The group was “really not pleased with the progress,” said Dream for Darfur’s executive director, Jill Savitt. In response, some sponsors began criticizing the group’s approach. “For an organization that has not eased the suffering of a single individual on the ground in Darfur to criticize those who are helping thousands every day is more than ironic,” a Coca-Cola spokesman, Kelly Brooks, wrote via e-mail. “This is not a report card on sponsors’ good works, this is simply a report card judging companies solely on the basis of the Dream for Darfur yardstick  a company’s willingness to publicly pressure a sovereign nation to intervene in the activities of another country.” Coca-Cola’s chief executive, E. Neville Isdell, wrote a column published last week in The Financial Times with similarly harsh words for the organization.  Johnson &amp; Johnson also issued a sharp response to the report card. “At Johnson &amp; Johnson, we’ve worked hard for years to help the people of Darfur, which is consistent with the commitment of Johnson &amp; Johnson to contribute to better health around the world. Given the complexities of the tragedy in Darfur, we are disappointed that Dream for Darfur has used such a narrow context by which to evaluate the company’s response,” a spokeswoman, Lorie Gawreluk, wrote via e-mail. General Electric joined the chorus. “We commend Dream for Darfur for raising awareness of this tragic situation, however we strongly disagree with the organization’s approach as well as the use of the Olympic Games as a political platform and the assertions made in the report card,” Deirdre Latour, a G.E. spokeswoman, wrote via e-mail. The three companies pointed to their efforts in Darfur. Ms. Gawreluk said that Johnson &amp; Johnson donates cash and products to the region through organizations such as Unicef and the International Rescue Committee. Mr. Brooks said that Coca-Cola has pledged more than $5 million to providing water in the Sudan, among other efforts. Ms. Latour noted the GE Foundation has donated $4 million to humanitarian aid for refugees. The sparring comes after weeks of a near impasse between activist groups opposing China’s involvement in the Games and the companies that have paid giant amounts to sponsor the event. Most of the sponsors have a significant stake in China. Adidas, for example, manufactures 49 percent of its shoes in China. For Coca-Cola, the country is its fourth-biggest market. China was the fastest-growing region for Panasonic in its most recent quarter, with sales growth at 17 percent. McDonald’s expects to open 125 restaurants in China this year. United Parcel Service has invested $600 million in China over the last five years. Anheuser-Busch has invested $1.8 billion there. Activist groups, including Students for a Free Tibet, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders and Dream for Darfur, have been sending letters to the sponsors asking them to take a stance on human-rights issues. The groups are threatening increased pressure, ranging from protests at shareholder meetings and offices to a turn-off-the-commercials campaign during the Olympics.  So far, almost none of the sponsors have changed their stance, most saying that political issues are not within their purview, as Visa did Thursday. “While we appreciate Dream for Darfur’s efforts to bring attention to the situation, Visa believes a lasting resolution to the crisis can only be achieved through governmental and diplomatic channels and not by Olympic Games sponsors,” Visa said in a statement. A few, such as Anheuser-Busch, have offered more specific suggestions. “The situation in Darfur is abhorrent, and we support efforts to bring awareness to this crisis. We believe diplomatic dialogue between governments within the United Nations and dispatching additional peace-keeping troops to Darfur are essential steps in the process of improving conditions in this region, and we have expressed our position on this topic with the International Olympic Committee and support dialogue to affect change,” Francine Katz, vice president of communications and consumer affairs for Anheuser-Busch, wrote in an e-mail message. Even one of the companies praised in the report, Adidas, was tepid in its response to the group. Dream for Darfur had awarded it a B+ rating for a letter it had written to the United Nations regarding the Darfur conflict. Adidas began its Olympics advertising campaign in China last year and is outfitting Games employees and officials along with the Chinese Olympic team. “The Adidas Group welcomes the rating it received from the second report card by Dream for Darfur,” Anne Putz, a spokeswoman for Adidas, wrote in an e-mail message. “We will continue to take action where we can. At the same time we need to stress that as a business we also understand our limitations and recognize that we have the greatest impact on those areas where we have the most influence.” Dream for Darfur also gave high marks to Kodak and McDonald’s, Kodak for writing a letter to the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations, and McDonald’s for a “private action.” McDonald’s had no comment Thursday and Kodak did not return a request for comment. Nine sponsors  Anheuser-Busch, Atos Origin, BHP Billiton, Manulife Financial, Panasonic, Staples, Swatch, U.P.S. and Volkswagen  received an F, which largely meant they had not responded to Dream for Darfur. Even if a sponsor wanted to cancel a contract, it would not be simple. Payments are made in regular installments over four years, and nine sponsors are contracted through 2012, three to 2016 and one to 2020, according to Ben Seeley, an International Olympic Committee spokesman. “Only for gross breach could these contracts not run through until their end point," Mr. Seeley wrote in an e-mail message.

Results Are Sweetened by a Weak Dollar<date>Published: April 16, 2008</date><text>Johnson &amp; Johnson posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Tuesday as the weak dollar and cost-cutting offset plunging sales of medicines facing generic competition and anemia drugs hit by safety concerns. Demand for the company’s wide array of consumer products, including a new over-the-counter form of the antihistamine Zyrtec and various other products recently acquired from Pfizer, bolstered results. But its two other major businesses, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, would have fared poorly had they not been propped up by the beaten-down dollar. “International sales and exchange rates in overseas markets that benefit from the weak dollar are the only things that are keeping Johnson &amp; Johnson afloat,” said Steve Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities. The company earned $3.6 billion, or $1.26 a share, compared with $2.57 billion, or 88 cents a share, in the period a year earlier, when it took several merger-related charges. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates, on average, had expected a profit of $1.20 a share. Johnson &amp; Johnson said global sales rose 7.7 percent, to $16.19 billion, above the average forecast of $15.85 billion. Revenue would have risen only 2.6 percent if not for the weak dollar, which increases the value of sales in overseas markets. Excluding the benefit of the weak dollar, sales of consumer brands like Band-Aids and Listerine rose 6.3 percent, revenue from medical devices increased just 1.4 percent and prescription drug sales fell 0.6 percent. Combined sales of the anemia drugs Procrit and Eprex fell 23 percent, to $629 million, in the quarter, hurt by concerns that overuse of such medicines can increase the risk of adverse events and death. The company raised its 2008 earnings forecast slightly, to $4.40 to $4.45 a share, reflecting growth of up to 7 percent. That represents a slowdown, however, from growth of more than 10 percent last year. Its previous forecast was $4.39 to $4.44 a share. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson fell 9 cents Tuesday, to $65.65.

The dangers were made clear in an article by Gardiner Harris and Alex Berenson in The Times on April 6. Their report described how Johnson &amp; Johnson obscured the fact that its Ortho Evra birth control patch delivered much more estrogen than standard birth control pills, thereby increasing the risk of blood clots and strokes. More than 3,000 women and their families have sued the company. The company is arguing in court that the women can’t sue because the patch and its labeling were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the presumed authority on drug safety. But the disturbing element is that the company seems to have done its best to mislead the F.D.A., as revealed in company documents made public as a result of the lawsuits. The company’s primary study on Ortho Evra, completed in 1999, found that the patch delivered a relatively high amount of estrogen into the bloodstream. A company official dealt with that uncomfortable and unexpected fact by applying a “correction factor” to lower the numbers by 40 percent. He rationalized that the correction was justified because the body metabolizes hormones from pills and patches in different ways. But the company was not eager to acknowledge what it had done. The correction factor was mentioned only once in a 435-page report to the F.D.A. and even then only in a complex mathematical formula. Nor was it mentioned when the study was published in 2002. The F.D.A. has since required label changes citing evidence that patch users are at higher risk of developing serious blood clots than women using birth control pills. Even so, the agency continues to insist that Ortho Evra is a safe and effective method of contraception.

Skip to next paragraph Tom Uhlman for The New York Times An Ortho Evra birth control patch from Johnson &amp; Johnson. Related Times Topics: Food and Drug Administration Times Topics: Supreme Court, U.S. But because the Food and Drug Administration approved the patch, the company is arguing in court that it cannot be sued by women who claim that they were injured by the product  even though its old label inaccurately described the amount of estrogen it released. This legal argument is called pre-emption. After decades of being dismissed by courts, the tactic now appears to be on the verge of success, lawyers for plaintiffs and drug companies say. The Bush administration has argued strongly in favor of the doctrine, which holds that the F.D.A. is the only agency with enough expertise to regulate drug makers and that its decisions should not be second-guessed by courts. The Supreme Court is to rule on a case next term that could make pre-emption a legal standard for drug cases. The court already ruled in February that many suits against the makers of medical devices like pacemakers are pre-empted. More than 3,000 women and their families have sued Johnson &amp; Johnson, asserting that users of the Ortho Evra patch suffered heart attacks, strokes and, in 40 cases, death. From 2002 to 2006, the food and drug agency received reports of at least 50 deaths associated with the drug. Documents and e-mail messages from Johnson &amp; Johnson, made public as part of the lawsuits against the company, show that even before the drug agency approved the product in 2001, the company’s own researchers found that the patch delivered far more estrogen each day than low-dose pills. When it reported the results publicly, the company reduced the numbers by 40 percent. The F.D.A. did not warn the public of the potential risks until November 2005  six years after the company’s own study showed the high estrogen releases. At that point, the product’s label was changed, and prescriptions fell 80 percent, to 187,000 by last February from 900,000 in March 2004. Gloria Vanderham, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokeswoman, said the company acted responsibly. “We have regularly disclosed data to the F.D.A., the medical community and the public in a timely manner,” Ms. Vanderham said. “Ortho Evra is a safe and effective birth control option for women when used according to the labeling.” But Janet Abaray, a plaintiff’s lawyer from Cincinnati, said that Johnson &amp; Johnson took advantage of an agency overwhelmed by its many responsibilities. “Johnson &amp; Johnson knew that F.D.A. does not have the funding or the manpower to police drug companies,” Ms. Abaray said. A series of independent assessments have concluded that the agency is poorly organized, scientifically deficient and short of money. In February, its commissioner, Andrew C. von Eschenbach, acknowledged that the agency faces a crisis and may not be “adequate to regulate the food and drugs of the 21st century.” The F.D.A. does not test experimental medicines but relies on drug makers to report the results of their own tests completely and honestly. Even when companies fail to follow agency rules, officials rarely seek to penalize them. “These are scientists, not cops,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School. Last month, at a trial over the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, Dr. John Gueriguian, a scientist who worked at the F.D.A. for two decades, testified that the agency did not always ask for strong warnings even if it believed a drug was risky. Companies typically oppose warnings, and the agency knows it must compromise on its requests or face years of delay, Dr. Gueriguian said. “We at the F.D.A. know what we can obtain and we cannot obtain,” Dr. Gueriguian said. “We have many, many problems, and we have a management system  what we can’t obtain we will not ask.” For years, top officials at the agency acknowledged that lawsuits could aid the agency’s oversight of safety issues. In the last decade, suits over Zyprexa, the withdrawn pain pill Vioxx, the withdrawn diabetes medicine Rezulin, the withdrawn heartburn medicine Propulsid and several antidepressants have shown that companies played down the risks of their medicines and failed to disclose clinical trials to the public even as they have aggressively marketed their drugs. But now, the agency says a proliferation of lawsuits could lead to an overlapping patchwork of rules that would burden companies and might discourage patients from taking useful medicines. The Ortho case, however, suggests that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like other drug makers, is not always quick to tell the F.D.A. about potential problems with its medicines. In 1996, the company told the agency it planned to develop the Ortho Evra patch in part because it would be likely to expose women to less estrogen than pills. The company suggested that the body would not break down hormones delivered via the patch as readily as the pill, so lower doses could be used to achieve contraception. And unlike the pill, which must be taken daily, the patch is changed weekly. High doses of estrogen are known to raise the risk for blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. But a crucial trial completed in 1999 showed that the patch delivered 30 to 38 micrograms of estrogen into the bloodstream each day, according to company documents. 1 2 Next Page » Janet Roberts contributed reporting.

The Bush administration has argued strongly in favor of the doctrine, which holds that the F.D.A. is the only agency with enough expertise to regulate drug makers and that its decisions should not be second-guessed by courts. The Supreme Court is to rule on a case next term that could make pre-emption a legal standard for drug cases. The court already ruled in February that many suits against the makers of medical devices like pacemakers are pre-empted. More than 3,000 women and their families have sued Johnson &amp; Johnson, asserting that users of the Ortho Evra patch suffered heart attacks, strokes and, in 40 cases, death. From 2002 to 2006, the food and drug agency received reports of at least 50 deaths associated with the drug. Documents and e-mail messages from Johnson &amp; Johnson, made public as part of the lawsuits against the company, show that even before the drug agency approved the product in 2001, the company’s own researchers found that the patch delivered far more estrogen each day than low-dose pills. When it reported the results publicly, the company reduced the numbers by 40 percent. The F.D.A. did not warn the public of the potential risks until November 2005  six years after the company’s own study showed the high estrogen releases. At that point, the product’s label was changed, and prescriptions fell 80 percent, to 187,000 by last February from 900,000 in March 2004. Gloria Vanderham, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokeswoman, said the company acted responsibly. “We have regularly disclosed data to the F.D.A., the medical community and the public in a timely manner,” Ms. Vanderham said. “Ortho Evra is a safe and effective birth control option for women when used according to the labeling.” But Janet Abaray, a plaintiff’s lawyer from Cincinnati, said that Johnson &amp; Johnson took advantage of an agency overwhelmed by its many responsibilities. “Johnson &amp; Johnson knew that F.D.A. does not have the funding or the manpower to police drug companies,” Ms. Abaray said. A series of independent assessments have concluded that the agency is poorly organized, scientifically deficient and short of money. In February, its commissioner, Andrew C. von Eschenbach, acknowledged that the agency faces a crisis and may not be “adequate to regulate the food and drugs of the 21st century.” The F.D.A. does not test experimental medicines but relies on drug makers to report the results of their own tests completely and honestly. Even when companies fail to follow agency rules, officials rarely seek to penalize them. “These are scientists, not cops,” said David Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown Law School. Last month, at a trial over the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, Dr. John Gueriguian, a scientist who worked at the F.D.A. for two decades, testified that the agency did not always ask for strong warnings even if it believed a drug was risky. Companies typically oppose warnings, and the agency knows it must compromise on its requests or face years of delay, Dr. Gueriguian said. “We at the F.D.A. know what we can obtain and we cannot obtain,” Dr. Gueriguian said. “We have many, many problems, and we have a management system  what we can’t obtain we will not ask.” For years, top officials at the agency acknowledged that lawsuits could aid the agency’s oversight of safety issues. In the last decade, suits over Zyprexa, the withdrawn pain pill Vioxx, the withdrawn diabetes medicine Rezulin, the withdrawn heartburn medicine Propulsid and several antidepressants have shown that companies played down the risks of their medicines and failed to disclose clinical trials to the public even as they have aggressively marketed their drugs. But now, the agency says a proliferation of lawsuits could lead to an overlapping patchwork of rules that would burden companies and might discourage patients from taking useful medicines. The Ortho case, however, suggests that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like other drug makers, is not always quick to tell the F.D.A. about potential problems with its medicines. In 1996, the company told the agency it planned to develop the Ortho Evra patch in part because it would be likely to expose women to less estrogen than pills. The company suggested that the body would not break down hormones delivered via the patch as readily as the pill, so lower doses could be used to achieve contraception. And unlike the pill, which must be taken daily, the patch is changed weekly. High doses of estrogen are known to raise the risk for blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. But a crucial trial completed in 1999 showed that the patch delivered 30 to 38 micrograms of estrogen into the bloodstream each day, according to company documents. 1 2 Next Page » Janet Roberts contributed reporting.</text></article><article index="3" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/nyregion/04johnson.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">New Jersey Court’s Ruling Ends 12-Year Fight Among Johnson &amp; Johnson Heirs<date>Published: April 4, 2008</date><text>The better half, the old man, the breadwinner, the spouse. Roget’s Thesaurus may be of some help, but when it comes to defining who may inherit part of a reported $350 million from the Johnson &amp; Johnson fortune, the one built on Band-Aids and Mylanta, the New Jersey Supreme Court is far better. At least Marty Richards thinks so. The court decided on Thursday that Mr. Richards, the third husband of a Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress, remained a spouse even though the heiress died in 1990. New Jersey’s highest court ruled 5 to 2 that Mr. Richards was eligible for part of an enormous trust fund, just like the 30 or so other family members, including great-grandchildren. The decision cannot be appealed. Roderick Ryan, the son of the heiress, Mary Lea Johnson Richards, along with the great-grandchildren of John Seward Johnson Sr., the son of one of the company’s founders, have argued in court for years over the meaning of “spouse,” to the exclusion of Mr. Richards. Mr. Ryan is Mr. Richards’s stepson. The estate’s trustees are free to determine how much or how little money Mr. Richards may receive, the court said, but they cannot exclude him on the grounds that he is not a spouse. “I’ve always wanted to be part of the family,” said Mr. Richards, 76, a New York impresario known for producing such Broadway hits as “Chicago” and “Sweeney Todd.” In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Richards said that he continued to wear two wedding rings, his own and that of his late wife. He has not remarried. “It hurt me terribly when they said I was not a spouse,” he said, referring to other Johnson family members. “What do you mean I’m not a spouse?” Mr. Richards sighed. “I wanted to be treated respectfully as Mr. Johnson had suggested I be treated,” he said, referring to John Seward Johnson Sr., Ms. Richards’s father. Richard Collier, a lawyer in Princeton, N.J., represents Mr. Ryan, who helped lead the legal opposition against Mr. Richards. Mr. Collier noted that there had been thousands of pages of testimony, 12 years of complex estate litigation and four lawyers involved in the case. The majority Supreme Court opinion is 13 pages long. “They barely gave us one page for each of the 12 years of litigation,” Mr. Collier said. In 2003, a trial judge ruled in Mr. Richards’s favor. He prevailed again in the Appellate Division after the stepchildren and other family members appealed. In its decision, the Supreme Court majority, referring to the lower court’s decision, wrote, “The bone of contention between the appellate majority and the dissent was the testimony of the scrivener,” Jim Hill, who drafted the Johnson trust, established in 1961. Mr. Hill, who was also a trustee, died in 2007. Mr. Hill had testified that Mr. Richards was a spouse within the meaning of Mr. Johnson’s intentions. The Supreme Court majority conceded that Mr. Hill’s testimony could be reasonably challenged and excluded much of it, including the “spouse” testimony, from its consideration. But, the Supreme Court wrote, even without Mr. Hill’s testimony on the meaning of “spouse,” there was “ample evidence to support the trial judge’s determination.” The court’s opinion ends a fight that began in 1995, shortly after Mr. Hill asked Mr. Richards to lunch at the Harvard Club. The Johnson trust, Mr. Hill told Mr. Richards at the lunch, would, in the coming year, after a long period of charitable giving, start disbursing money to family members  including Mr. Richards. Other trustees challenged the inclusion of Mr. Richards, and the matter went to court. The value of the trust was put at $350 million during trial testimony in 2003, but it may be lower now because of stock market reverses. The assets consist of shares in Johnson &amp; Johnson. Alan Naar, Mr. Richards’s lawyer, said he would apply to the trustees for a ruling on disbursements “in a short period of time.” Mr. Richards was married to Mary Lea Johnson for 17 years until her death from liver cancer at age 63. (They had lived together for two years before that.) Mr. Richards said he would give any money that he received from the trust to charity, principally the Mary Lea Johnson Richards Organ Transplantation Center at New York University Medical Center.

Skip to next paragraph Related These five medical device makers are required, under a federal settlement, to publicly list the consulting payments they make to doctors: Biomet (Disclosure) DuPuy Orthopaedics (Disclosure) (pdf) Smith &amp; Nephew (Disclosure) Stryker (Disclosure) Zimmer (Disclosure) (pdf) Having reached settlements with the five leading makers of artificial joints last year over the payments, the government has been focusing on the many doctors who receive money as the companies’ paid consultants. “We are going to be looking at those soliciting kickbacks,” Lewis Morris, the chief counsel in the federal office that pursues civil complaints of Medicare fraud, told an audience of hundreds of doctors, company representatives and investors this month in San Francisco at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. The same message has gone out to health care lawyers attending legal education seminars in recent months and, directly from Christopher J. Christie Jr., the United States attorney in Newark, who is overseeing the investigation. Executives say Mr. Christie has addressed sales meetings of the five companies, which reached a settlement last fall to avoid prosecution on charges they had routinely paid illegal kickbacks to surgeons. Mr. Christie said “ ‘I’ve dealt with the supply issue, now I need to deal with the demand issue,’ ” recalled Edward B. Lipes, the executive vice president in charge of surgeon relationships at the device maker Stryker Corporation, the first of the companies to cooperate in the investigation, which began in 2005. Although industry executives say they have heard that some doctors have received subpoenas, none have been publicly identified. “Our investigation is continuing into the conduct of individual surgeons,” Michael Drewniak, the spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in Newark, said Friday. Mr. Drewniak declined to say whether any of the doctors had become targets of the investigation. The government has not argued that any of the kickbacks led to unnecessary knee or hip surgery or maltreatment of any patients. Nor has it established a direct link to higher Medicare costs. Switching a patient from one company’s device to another would not change the amount Medicare pays hospitals for an implant. But kickbacks might raise the overall cost of health care. Doctors can be convicted of violating Medicare’s antifraud statutes simply for submitting a bill for a procedure linked to a kickback, whether or not the procedure was necessary. Besides Stryker, the original targets of the investigation were Biomet; DePuy Orthopaedics, a unit of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Company; Smith &amp; Nephew; and Zimmer Holdings. Those four agreed to pay $310 million in fines to settle civil charges. In December, two smaller competitors, the Wright Medical Group and Exactech, received subpoenas, indicating that the government is intent on making sure that the entire major joint business  the $6 billion core of the orthopedics industry  is playing on the same field. From the government’s perspective, the investigation has already been successful. Even before the settlements with the device makers, those companies and others had sharply curbed entertainment, travel payments and other practices the government regarded as possibly influencing doctor’s medical decisions. And with the settlements, still tighter restrictions were forced on the companies. To avoid prosecutions that could have threatened the companies’ Medicare business  a crushing blow in a segment of the health care industry where the average patient is 68 years old  the device makers not only agreed to pay the fines but to operate for 18 months under stricter federal scrutiny than military contractors do. Mr. Christie’s appointed monitors, overseers whom the companies pay monthly retainers plus up to $895 an hour, screen every payment the companies make to doctors who help with training or with developing new products. Each company is required to develop and gain government approval of a “needs assessment” detailing every task for which it will engage doctors this year. The settlements also set a $500-an-hour ceiling for most consulting agreements. In addition, all five were required to disclose on their Web sites cash payments last year to each doctor or medical group they dealt with, as well as compensation paid each of them in the form of plane tickets, lodging, food and gifts. The companies halted nearly all types of payments to doctors and many education programs while completing the needs assessment, including previously pledged support for groups like the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Stryker and Smith &amp; Nephew say they have received final approval for their 2008 assessments. Other companies are at various stages of getting their assessments approved. For all the disclosures and scrutiny though, the details of the misconduct that attracted the Justice Department’s attention remain murky. The companies were allowed to deny any wrongdoing in the criminal and civil settlements they negotiated. The four that signed so-called delayed prosecution agreements  Biomet, DePuy, Smith &amp; Nephew and Zimmer  have been promised that the criminal cases filed against them in September will be dropped a year from now if they live up to compliance procedures in their agreements. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »A long-running federal investigation into the orthopedic device industry’s suspected kickback payments to hip and knee surgeons now has the doctors in the spotlight.

Skip to next paragraph Related Drug Maker Stays Close to Doctors and Patients (March 16, 2008) Times Health Guide: Gaucher Disease The drug in question, Cerezyme, is used to treat a rare inherited enzyme deficiency called Gaucher disease. Some experts say that for most patients, as little as one-fourth the standard top dose would work, saving the health care system more than $200,000 a year per Gaucher patient. “It is economic malpractice to give a much higher dose of an expensive drug than is required,” said Dr. Ernest Beutler, an authority on Gaucher disease at the Scripps Research Institute. Some other Gaucher specialists argue otherwise, saying that skimping on the medicine could endanger patients. But all sides agree on one thing. “Nobody would even be wasting their time talking about this if it were a cheap drug,” said Dr. Neal J. Weinreb, a Coral Springs, Fla., specialist in Gaucher (pronounced go-SHAY). In that sense, the dispute over Cerezyme could be a sign of the increased scrutiny that dosing will receive as drugs become more expensive. Pharmaceutical companies have faced complaints for years over prices, but now they might have to defuse efforts to use less of their drugs to cut costs, and to rebut accusations that doses are inflated to bolster profits. There are also economic and social questions about how much burden taxpayers and co-workers should be expected to bear; ultra-expensive drugs, especially in full doses, can raise the cost of everyone’s insurance. With Cerezyme, which is made by Genzyme, the profits are sizable. Gaucher disease, which can have complications like ruined joints, is rare; only about 1,500 people in the United States are on the drug and about 5,000 worldwide. Sales of Cerezyme totaled $1.1 billion last year, making it a blockbuster by industry standards. Genzyme is not the only company feeling some pressure. Some lung cancer doctors are using only half the approved dose of Genentech’s drug Avastin, after a recent study suggested the half-dose might be as effective as the full one, which can cost $100,000 a year. In a letter to The Journal of Clinical Oncology last September, Dr. Ian E. Haines of Monash University in Australia argued that the doses of all three Genentech cancer drugs  Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin  appeared to be higher than necessary, perhaps to bolster sales. Dr. David P. Schenkein, a Genentech executive, said the doses were chosen solely for maximum effectiveness in fighting cancer. Scientists reported last year that a two-hour infusion of Schering-Plough’s anticlotting drug Integrilin worked just as well for some patients as the standard 18-hour infusion, saving hundreds of dollars per treatment. And doctors are sharply reducing their use of anemia drugs sold by Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson. While the cutbacks are mainly for safety reasons, the drugs’ multibillion-dollar cost to Medicare intensified scrutiny of the products. In the case of Genzyme’s Cerezyme, higher doses are not harmful. It is only a question of how much of the drug is needed, given the cost. Some experts say that patients who are given too little of the drug could suffer from the complications, which can occur without much warning. “The risk is taken by the patient,” said Dr. Gregory Pastores, a Gaucher expert at New York University who tries to use a moderate dose. Tina Chavers, 38, of Pensacola, Fla., said she wondered whether higher doses might have saved her hips, which were replaced a few years ago. “There was no indication to tell us that I was going to lose my bones,” she said. “We just really thought my disease was very controlled.” But a contrasting story is told by Carmie Stein of Akron, Ohio, who took the drug for 11 years until she switched doctors about four years ago. The new doctor said her condition was so mild that she did not need treatment. “I really felt cheated,” Ms. Stein said of the years she took the drug, perhaps unnecessarily. Ms. Stein, a fitness buff, said she had felt healthier and more energetic since she stopped taking the drug. Gaucher disease is an inherited deficiency of an enzyme the body needs to break down fats. The disease can cause vastly enlarged livers and spleens, anemia, low platelet counts, and bone pain and deterioration. Cerezyme is a synthetic version of the missing enzyme. Genzyme, which became a leading biotechnology company because of Cerezyme, says that it has raised the price only once  3 percent last year  since introducing the drug in 1994. The company says it needs the high price to make a sustainable business of serving such a small number of patients and to pay for research on new products. Genzyme also says it provides the drug free, if necessary, so that no one goes without the product because of its cost. But critics say the company’s development costs were minimal, because the early work on the treatment was done by the National Institutes of Health, which gave Genzyme a contract to manufacture it. And analysts estimate the current cost of manufacturing the drug to be only about 10 percent of its price. Insurers generally cover the drug because there are so few patients. But finding or staying on insurance can be difficult. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »When a drug can cost more than $300,000 a year, the right dose becomes a matter of public debate.

And analysts estimate the current cost of manufacturing the drug to be only about 10 percent of its price. Insurers generally cover the drug because there are so few patients. But finding or staying on insurance can be difficult. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="6" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/14/business/14anemia.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Panel Seeks New Limits on Anemia Drugs<date>Published: March 14, 2008</date><text>Skip to next paragraph Related Times Health Guide: Anemia A federal advisory panel, in response to mounting safety concerns, called on Thursday for additional restrictions on the use of anemia drugs by cancer patients. The recommendation by a committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration could lead to an additional decline in sales for the drugs: Aranesp, made by Amgen, and Procrit by Johnson &amp; Johnson. But the two companies avoided the outcome they most feared: a recommendation that the drugs not be used by any cancer patients. That probably would have meant the loss of at least $1 billion in sales for each company. “They dodged the really big bullet, but they still took some damage,” said Geoffrey C. Porges, a biotechnology analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Yaron Werber, an analyst with Citigroup, estimated that Amgen would lose about $125 million in Aranesp sales if the recommendations were enacted. That would be about 25 percent of Mr. Werber’s already reduced projections for 2008 sales to cancer patients in the United States. The meeting was held because eight clinical trials suggested that the drugs might make cancer worse for some patients or even shorten their lives. Cancer patients take Aranesp or Procrit to counter the anemia caused by chemotherapy. The difficulty for the committee was that those eight studies involved high doses of the drugs. There was very little solid information on whether the drugs were dangerous at doses typically used by cancer doctors. Faced with that information, the panel voted 13 to 1 in favor of recommending that the drugs remain available for use by many cancer patients. But the committee then voted 9 to 5 in favor of recommending that the drugs not be used by patients with either breast cancer or head and neck cancer because the evidence of a risk was strongest for those types of tumors. The committee also voted 11 to 2, with 1 abstention, to recommend that the drug not be used by patients being treated with the intent of curing their cancers. The definition of that category is vague, but it generally refers to patients with early-stage cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy after surgical removal of a tumor, in which the doctors hope the cancer has been eliminated. F.D.A. officials said after the meeting that most use of the anemia drugs was for patients with more advanced cancers. The panel members also recommended that patients be made to sign consents in order to obtain the drugs. But the panel voted against carefully controlling distribution of the drugs. The F.D.A. itself is expected to revise the labels of the drugs in consultation with the manufacturers. The agency does not have to adhere to the recommendations of its advisory committees, although it usually does. In a statement, Amgen said it was “committed to working with the F.D.A. to consider the input from the committee and to implement future label changes.” Amgen’s shares rose nearly 5 percent, closing at $47.18. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is not as reliant on the drugs, closed up 26 cents, to $62.81. Sales of the anemia drugs have already been plummeting because of safety concerns and payment restrictions by Medicare and other insurers. Sales of Aranesp fell 12 percent, to $3.6 billion, in 2007, down from $4.1 billion the year before. The sales slump has forced Amgen to cut its work force. Amgen has said that $1.55 billion of its Aranesp sales last year were for cancer use in the United States and an additional $550 million for cancer use in other countries. Most of the rest involved treating anemia stemming from kidney disease. The use of the drugs on kidney patients was not the subject of the meeting on Thursday. Amgen’s other anemia drug, Epogen, is primarily used for kidney dialysis patients. Johnson &amp; Johnson had sales of $2.9 billion last year for Procrit and Eprex, a similar drug sold outside the United States. Both are sold under license from Amgen. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which made a joint presentation to the committee, argued that it was not clear the drugs were dangerous. They said that the drugs should remain available because they help chemotherapy patients avoid blood transfusions, which carry their own risks of infections and side effects. The risk of contracting AIDS or hepatitis from a transfusion has declined significantly in recent years, they said, but other unknown pathogens might arise. “The known risks of blood transfusions are less today than yesterday,” Dr. William N. Hait, a Johnson &amp; Johnson executive, told the panel. “We do not know if that will be true tomorrow.” The companies proposed some changes in the drugs’ labeling that would reduce their use somewhat, but less than if the drugs were barred completely for certain cancers. But Dr. Vinni Juneja, an F.D.A. official, said in his presentation that the drugs did not totally eliminate the need for transfusions but only reduced them by about 50 percent. Some patients or patient advocates testified in support of the drugs, while others said they were more concerned about the risks or that the matter was too confusing to know what position to take. The meeting on Thursday was the third advisory panel meeting the F.D.A. has held on the risks of these drugs’ use for cancer patients. The earlier ones were in 2004 and last May. “There is a perceived lack of progress,” said Carlea Bauman, president of the Colorectal Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. The drugs, she said, “have been on the market for many years, billions of dollars have been spent by insurers, millions of patients have been treated, and yet we still have many of the same unanswered questions,” as at the 2004 meeting. Several committee members and patient advocates called on the drug companies to end sales programs that might give doctors a financial incentive to overuse the drugs. Doctors typically buy the drugs, administer them to patients, and are reimbursed by insurers and patients. The doctors can profit if the reimbursement is greater than what they paid, and companies can sweeten that margin by giving the doctors discounts and rebates. “The current system has led to distrust,” Robert L. Erwin, president of the Marti Nelson Cancer Foundation, told the committee. Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson said the payment system, common for oncology drugs, did not lead to overuse.

But in 1990 Dr. Anagnostou published some of the first evidence suggesting that Amgen's then brand-new anemia drug, Epogen, might fuel the growth of tumors. Few people paid heed. ''Many people believed the work I did was not reproducible,'' recalled Dr. Anagnostou, who was then a blood disease specialist at Brown University. Unable to obtain a federal grant to conduct further studies, he said he eventually moved on to other things. Now, people are paying more attention. Eight clinical trials have suggested that Epogen and related anemia drugs, widely used to treat the anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy, might make tumors worse or hasten the death of cancer patients. On Thursday an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration will consider placing further restrictions on use of the medicines -- Amgen's drugs Epogen and Aranesp, and the Johnson &amp; Johnson drug Procrit. Among the choices to be discussed, according to a briefing document the agency posted on its Web site on Tuesday, would be to eliminate use of the drugs for patients with certain types of tumors or for patients who still have hope of curing their cancers, or even to stop using the drugs among all cancer patients. But one of the big unanswered question is this: If the anemia drugs really are ''Miracle-Gro for cancer,'' as one F.D.A. adviser famously put it in a similar meeting last year, then what is the mechanism behind that? What do the drugs do to tumors? All the drugs are synthetic forms of a human hormone called erythropoietin, or Epo, that spurs production of red blood cells. Dr. Anagnostou's work hints at one possible explanation. His experiments suggested that Epo could spur growth of blood vessels that can nourish tumors. Another possible explanation is that Epo stimulates tumors directly to grow. Or, that Epo protects tumors from the destruction intended by chemotherapy. Evidence that could support these hypotheses has been building slowly, but it is far from ironclad. The studies have shortcomings and there are contradictory data. Animal studies, for instance, have generally not shown Epo making cancer worse. ''The sense is there's some smoke, but we don't know if there's any fire,'' said David A. Gewirtz, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University. In his study, Dr. Gewirtz found that Epo did not stimulate growth of breast cancer cells in a dish. When the National Cancer Institute held a workshop in December on whether Epo spurred tumor growth, there was little consensus, other than agreement that more study was needed. Amgen's representative at the workshop, Dr. C. Glenn Begley, sharply questioned any finding of a tumor-stimulating effect, according to a summary by the cancer institute. Amgen says there is no convincing evidence that Epo does anything in the body besides spur red blood cell production. The company thinks the excess deaths in the trials among Epo users might stem from blood clots. The clinical trials in question all used the anemia drugs to raise patients' red blood cell levels more than what is recommended in the drugs' labels. At those levels, blood clots are a known side effect. ''There's really no necessity to advance another explanation,'' Dr. Roy Baynes, an Amgen vice president, said in an interview. If the culprit is blood clots, the implication is the drugs would be safe if used at more modest levels, as called for on the labels. But if, as some scientists argue, Epo does spur tumor growth directly, then even modest doses of the drugs might be considered risky for cancer patients. Various scientists have reported that some types of tumor cells have receptors that can detect Epo and react to it. And they have reported that Epo spurs the growth of tumor cells in laboratory dishes. There are even reports that some tumors make their own Epo, in effect stimulating their own growth or protecting themselves from death. Amgen says that the techniques used to detect the receptors actually pick up other things, giving false readings. But Dr. Murat O. Arcasoy, associate professor of medicine at Duke, said, ''most people accept that there are receptors. The question is, 'How do they signal, how do they contribute to growth?' '' Another question is why it has taken so long to find such possible deleterious effects. Epogen was first approved for kidney dialysis patients in 1989 and Procrit for anemia caused by chemotherapy in 1993. When Procrit was approved, the F.D.A. realized there was a ''hypothetical risk'' that Epo could spur tumor growth, the agency said in its briefing document on Tuesday. But the agency still does not think the link has been established definitely, it said. Dr. Arthur J. Sytkowski, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard who has studied Epo for 30 years, said scientists assumed Epo did nothing except spur red blood cell formation. ''Nobody's to blame for this,'' he said. Dr. Anagnostou's 1990 study was one of the first to suggest a different role for Epo. He was trying to figure out why Epogen caused high blood pressure in some patients. So he put endothelial cells, the type that line blood vessels, into a lab dish and exposed them to Epo. To his surprise the cells were stimulated to proliferate. He commented in his paper that this could possibly spur the formation of blood vessels that would nourish tumors. Dr. Anagnostou patented the use of Epo to treat blood vessel injuries and profited when it was licensed to Johnson &amp; Johnson. Still, Dr. Anagnostou, now semi-retired, says safety issues were missed. ''We had been assured it was totally safe because it only affects red blood cells,'' he said.</text></article><article index="8" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/business/27anemia.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Study Finds Death Risk From Anemia Drugs<date>Published: February 27, 2008</date><text>Widely used anemia drugs sold by Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson raise the risk of death among cancer patients by about 10 percent, according to a new analysis of previous clinical trials that is to be published Wednesday. Skip to next paragraph Related Health Guide: Anemia » The study is the first compilation of clinical trial data  called a meta-analysis  to show a statistically significant increase in the risk of death from the drugs, said Dr. Charles L. Bennett, a professor at Northwestern University and its lead author. The Food and Drug Administration is planning to convene an advisory committee on March 13 to discuss whether to impose further restrictions on the use of the drugs, Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson, with cancer patients. The Amgen drug Epogen, which is the same as Procrit but is aimed at kidney dialysis patients, will not be directly affected by the discussions. Amgen said the study, being published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, provided little new information. “What he observes is the risks that we’ve already talked about that are in the label,” said Roger Perlmutter, Amgen’s executive vice president for research and development. The F.D.A. ordered stronger warnings on the drugs’ labels last year, after a flurry of studies suggested that the products, if used too aggressively, could worsen cancer conditions or hasten death. And Medicare sharply restricted reimbursement for the drugs when used to treat anemia caused by cancer chemotherapy. Sales of Aranesp, Amgen’s best-selling product, declined to $3.6 billion last year from $4.1 billion in 2006. One option that analysts expect to be discussed at the meeting in March would be to bar the use of the drugs for specific types of cancer, like breast cancer and head and neck cancer. Another would be to delay treatment with the drugs until patients became more anemic than the current threshold, a change that would more closely match the Medicare reimbursement policy. A third option, which many analysts say is unlikely, would be for the F.D.A. to no longer authorize the drugs’ use in treating anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs would still be allowed to treat anemia caused by kidney disease. Jim Birchenough, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, estimated in a report on Monday that rescinding approval for chemotherapy-induced anemia would reduce Amgen’s sales of Aranesp by $1 billion a year. A change in the label to match the Medicare policy would cut them by $300 million. The new analysis on death risk, which could play into the discussions on March 13, combines data from 51 clinical trials involving 13,611 patients. The study also found a 57 percent increase in the risk of blood clots in veins, a known side effect of the drugs. Dr. Bennett, an oncologist and hematologist, said he did not think that the higher risk of death came from those blood clots. Rather, he said, there is evidence that the drugs, which are synthetic forms of a natural hormone called erythropoietin, directly stimulate the growth and spread of tumors. Amgen scientists dispute that explanation. Procrit, which Johnson &amp; Johnson sells under license from Amgen, was approved for treatment of cancer patients in 1993, and Aranesp in 2002, based on their ability to reduce the need for blood transfusions. But the studies on which the approvals were based were not large and long enough to measure the effect on patients’ longevity. As a result, efforts have been made to pool the results of many smaller trials to look for safety problems. A meta-analysis published in 2004 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research group, found that patients who were given the drugs tended to live longer. But in recent years, some new clinical trials, aimed at showing that using the drugs at higher doses than indicated on the label would improve survival, found the opposite. As those studies were added to the compilations, the safety balance appeared to shift. A meta-analysis published in 2006 by the Cochrane Collaboration found an 8 percent higher risk of death among users of the drugs, but the result just missed being statistically significant. The analysis being published Wednesday adds some more recent studies and reaches statistical significance. That still leaves unclear whether the drugs are dangerous if used at the levels indicated on the label, a question that bedeviled an F.D.A. advisory committee last year and is likely to do so again in March. “We didn’t ask the right questions for 15 years,” Dr. Bennett said.

Hours after the decision in the case, Riegel v. Medtronic, was announced, lawyers involved in a group of Florida state court cases related to Johnson &amp; Johnson’s drug-coated Cypher heart stent received an e-mail message from Judge Mary Barzee Flores asking for briefs on whether the lawsuits should be allowed to continue. And lawyers for patients with injuries they attribute to other devices like heart valves, artificial hips and defibrillators said they were girding for a flood of court filings from device makers like Medtronic asking judges to dismiss such lawsuits. “Medtronic probably already has summary judgment motions ready to go, and I expect to see them filed in the next few days,” said Hunter J. Shkolnik, a New York lawyer. “The next six months will be consumed fighting about such motions,” Mr. Shkolnik predicted. He represents more than 600 plaintiffs with lawsuits in state court in Minneapolis stemming from potentially faulty electrical leads Medtronic made for heart defibrillators. Lasr fall, Medtronic recalled the product, known as the Sprint Fidelis, after reports that the leads  wires that connected the device to the heart  were more prone to developing potentially deadly fractures than an older lead called the Quattro. In addition to the Sprint Fidelis and the heart stent cases  some in Massachusetts have named Boston Scientific rather than Johnson &amp; Johnson as the defendant  lawyers said Wednesday’s Supreme Court ruling could also affect the course of personal injury lawsuits filed against St. Jude Medical over a silver-coated heart valve recalled in 2000. There were 19 state and federal cases pending involving the St. Jude valve as of last October, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the company, which is based in St. Paul. Other lawsuits that could be affected are ones against Johnson &amp; Johnson and Synthes over spinal disks, and Stryker over artificial hip components. Soundtec, an Oklahoma City-based producer of an implantable hearing aid, had been told just two weeks ago by the Arkansas State Supreme Court that the federal approval of its device did not protect it from a claim in state court that its design was defective. Lawyers say the Arkansas decision is now likely to be reversed. Recent settlements of large groups of lawsuits on terms relatively favorable to device makers are a sign that lawyers had been anticipating the Supreme Court outcome, according to Mark Herrmann, a Chicago lawyer who defends drug and device companies. In December, for example, Medtronic announced an agreement to pay $114.1 million to settle 2,682 injury lawsuits related to its 2005 recall of defibrillators with a defective battery. In November, Boston Scientific agreed to pay up to $240 million to settle 8,550 claims stemming from recalls of defibrillators made by a subsidiary, Guidant. Plaintiffs in those cases are free to stay out of the settlements and try to continue suing the companies. But the odds against their success are much steeper now, according to both plaintiffs and defense lawyers. The Supreme Court’s Riegel decision turned on interpretation of laws and regulations governing Class III medical devices, which include products that sustain life, prevent major health problems or might pose unreasonable risks if they malfunction. The majority of Class III devices submitted for F.D.A. consideration  hundreds each year  are variants on products like standard pacemakers that were already in the market when the main law covering devices was passed by Congress in 1976. While companies must notify the F.D.A. when introducing such products, the agency does not require extensive safety and effectiveness testing before allowing them to be sold. But many of the industry’s most sophisticated and profitable Class III devices  implants like defibrillators, newer pacemakers that balance the heart rate in different chambers of the heart, drug-coated stents to prop open arteries, artificial hips, spinal disks, knees and stimulators that control pain  are seen as so different from pre-1976 devices that they must undergo a more thorough safety and effectiveness review. In Riegel, lawyers agree, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended that such a premarket approval process  known as P.M.A.  would bar patients from filing lawsuits that in effect, second-guess regulators’ judgments about the safety and effectiveness of devices they have reviewed. P.M.A. applications may take nine months or more to be processed and may include a hearing before a panel of outside experts. The Supreme Court ruling also presumes that the labels companies develop to warn of side effects and limitations are adequate because they, too, receive F.D.A. review. 1 2 Next Page » More Articles in Business »The Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday protecting many types of medical device makers from personal injury lawsuits began rippling through the courts and law offices almost immediately.

Soundtec, an Oklahoma City-based producer of an implantable hearing aid, had been told just two weeks ago by the Arkansas State Supreme Court that the federal approval of its device did not protect it from a claim in state court that its design was defective. Lawyers say the Arkansas decision is now likely to be reversed. Recent settlements of large groups of lawsuits on terms relatively favorable to device makers are a sign that lawyers had been anticipating the Supreme Court outcome, according to Mark Herrmann, a Chicago lawyer who defends drug and device companies. In December, for example, Medtronic announced an agreement to pay $114.1 million to settle 2,682 injury lawsuits related to its 2005 recall of defibrillators with a defective battery. In November, Boston Scientific agreed to pay up to $240 million to settle 8,550 claims stemming from recalls of defibrillators made by a subsidiary, Guidant. Plaintiffs in those cases are free to stay out of the settlements and try to continue suing the companies. But the odds against their success are much steeper now, according to both plaintiffs and defense lawyers. The Supreme Court’s Riegel decision turned on interpretation of laws and regulations governing Class III medical devices, which include products that sustain life, prevent major health problems or might pose unreasonable risks if they malfunction. The majority of Class III devices submitted for F.D.A. consideration  hundreds each year  are variants on products like standard pacemakers that were already in the market when the main law covering devices was passed by Congress in 1976. While companies must notify the F.D.A. when introducing such products, the agency does not require extensive safety and effectiveness testing before allowing them to be sold. But many of the industry’s most sophisticated and profitable Class III devices  implants like defibrillators, newer pacemakers that balance the heart rate in different chambers of the heart, drug-coated stents to prop open arteries, artificial hips, spinal disks, knees and stimulators that control pain  are seen as so different from pre-1976 devices that they must undergo a more thorough safety and effectiveness review. In Riegel, lawyers agree, the Supreme Court concluded that Congress intended that such a premarket approval process  known as P.M.A.  would bar patients from filing lawsuits that in effect, second-guess regulators’ judgments about the safety and effectiveness of devices they have reviewed. P.M.A. applications may take nine months or more to be processed and may include a hearing before a panel of outside experts. The Supreme Court ruling also presumes that the labels companies develop to warn of side effects and limitations are adequate because they, too, receive F.D.A. review. 1 2 Next Page »</text></article><article index="10" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/business/media/24adco.html?ref=johnsonandjohnson">Rogaine Seeks Place in the Morning Routine<date>Published: January 24, 2008</date><text>SINCE its introduction in 1988, Rogaine has always been a bit of a punch line, not only for what it does (help grow hair) but also for its sales results, which never quite (insert bad hair-growth pun here). Skip to next paragraph Enlarge This Image An image from a television commercial for Rogaine. But 2007 was a breakout year for Rogaine. A mousse-like version was introduced in 2006 and proved far more popular than the traditional liquid formulation, which comes in a bottle with an eyedropper. The foam version is dispensed by pressing a nozzle, a convenient feature for a product meant to be used twice a day. Now comes a new marketing campaign for Rogaine that tries to reposition it as an everyday bathroom essential  like deodorant or toothpaste  rather than a medication. “Your daily grooming routine probably already includes brushing, shaving, maybe more,” reads a promotion on the Rogaine Web site. “Take a look at what adding just a few minutes more with Men’s Rogaine Foam can do.” The campaign tries to encourage younger men to start using Rogaine before hair loss is evident, since the product is most effective when used on thinning patches rather than outright bald ones. And for the first time Rogaine is directly catering to gay men by purchasing spots on Logo, the gay-themed channel owned by Viacom.  Unlike many ads for hair growth or replacement products, the Rogaine spots do not show “before” and “after” images. Rather, the themes are convenience and efficacy: with assiduous use, the message goes, Rogaine can not only regrow hair but keep remaining hair out of the shower drain. (The slogan: “Use it or lose it.”) “In the morning it’s all about get in, get out,” begins a commercial by BBDO in New York that began appearing recently. It shows a young man getting ready for work by shaving, showering, brushing his teeth and, yes, rubbing a dollop of foam into the crown of his head. Rogaine was developed by Upjohn, now a division of Pfizer, but was bought in 2006 by Johnson &amp; Johnson, which created the product’s new identity around the foam version. “The key here is compliance, and the foam experience is much more something that’s going to fit into lifestyles,” said Meghan Marschall, a Johnson &amp; Johnson spokeswoman. By talking to men as young as their early 20s, “we’ve expanded our target audience by a roughly a decade,” she said. The television spots, introduced Dec. 31, are running on ESPN (television and radio) and traditional prime-time series like “CSI” and “Law and Order,” as well as on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.” Johnson &amp; Johnson would not say how much it was spending on the campaign. The company is also putting ads on dry-cleaner hangers, hoping to remind men of Rogaine while they are getting dressed. The idea is to reach them "during their morning routine, when they’re the most image-conscious," Ms. Marschall said. In 1968, Upjohn first tested minoxidil, the generic name for Rogaine, to treat high blood pressure, but began hearing reports of an odd side effect: Patients taking the drug reported that hair was sprouting on their backs, cheeks and heads. Some researchers saw a silver lining and began developing a topical form of minoxidil for the scalp. Rogaine was introduced in 1988 as the first drug approved for baldness by the Food and Drug Administration. Financial analysts went wild for it, predicting $500 million in annual sales. But the public was less enthusiastic. Rogaine has been available over the counter since 1998, but annual revenue, which was $47 million in 2002, declined to $31 million in 2006, the year Pfizer sold the product, according to the market research firm Information Resources (which excludes sales at Wal-Mart.)  But in 2007, sales suddenly jumped more than 25 percent, to $42 million. Johnson &amp; Johnson sees a clear link between the introduction of the foam version and the spike in sales. Indeed, the women’s version of Rogaine is available only as a liquid, and slightly fewer women have been buying it, according to Nielsen data. (The manufacturer says women should avoid the men’s formulations, which could cause them to sprout facial hair.) As for the two versions of Rogaine for men, the color schemes are the same on the labels, but the foam has a sporty scent, whereas the liquid smells slightly medicinal. Actors in the new spots have only a hint of hair loss, which is evident during a brief overhead view of them applying Rogaine. “I think it’s very similar to what you see with women’s anti-aging skin creams,” Ms. Marschall said. “They used to target women with visible signs of aging, but now women in their 20s are buying the products even before they have any signs of aging.” Such an approach, she said, is “a big move away from Rogaine treating a condition to being part of an everyday grooming routine for men who want to look their best.” Gersh Kuntzman, author of “Hair! Mankind’s Historic Quest to End Baldness,” said that marketing to men before they develop what he calls the “flesh yarmulke” makes sense. (Johnson &amp; Johnson does not recommend Rogaine for bald spots beyond the circumference of about a soda can.) “The whole key to Rogaine is getting these guys to use the product before they even acknowledge in their own minds that they need it,” Mr. Kuntzman said. “The thing with baldness is when a guy thinks of himself as bald, it’s too late. Then he’s going to accept baldness and just be an old bald guy or try a lot of coverup products.” More Articles in Business »SINCE its introduction in 1988, Rogaine has always been a bit of a punch line, not only for what it does (help grow hair) but also for its sales results, which never quite (insert bad hair-growth pun here).
